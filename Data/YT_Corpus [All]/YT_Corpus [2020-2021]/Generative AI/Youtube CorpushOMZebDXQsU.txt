 and machines really think even the scientists argue that one I'm convinced that machines cattle will think in a whole lifetime can a computer be as smart as a human today we're sitting down with my friend and initialized portfolio founder D Scott Phoenix vicariance has come up with a new type of machine learning based on the computational principles of the human brain AG AI artificial general intelligence is coming let's go meet Scott [Music] [Music] Scott thanks for hanging out man it's great to see you well we're YC batchmates way back in the day so I guess it's been 12 years though is that right long time the worst fashion wipe see history that's right well we've gone on to bigger and better things but and we survived so something the scary sort of happened at least financially was 2008-2009 stunning Wall Street has seen very very few days like this the mortgage crisis has now taken down two of the biggest names the most storied names on Wall Street one of them Lehman Brothers yeah I remember being out in San Francisco during the financial crisis after yce like trying to raise around and wearing my blazer and going these VC meetings and just like collapsing at the end of the day being like oh my god no one is making any investments right now like the markers in freefall and being so relieved we finally close around yeah likewise we closed our seed round for Posterous the day Lehman died oh god yeah it was like d-day the Money Bank you were like well since then you started vicarious you know walk us through a vicarious is yeah I mean I guess the story really starts back before what I see even when I was in college I was trying to figure it out what I wanted to do with my life and made a big list and thought about how could I have the most impact for me the things that gave me the most joy were was when I was being broadly of service to other people I thought about spaces like education or health or policy and when I hit on AI as a possibility it totally be wiped out all the others because you know the impact of it could be so big if this was the right time in history to work on it so there was a question of like okay am i 300 years too early or it was now roughly the time when it could be possible to build AI that's like your brain and mine and when you do the math on how fast computers are and how much we now know about the brain and the the progress we've made on algorithms and so on you know in this window it's probably the right time in history to be working on building the first true artificial general intelligence so when I think of like why do you want an AGI the reason why I want one is because there's all these like every problem that has been solved so far and human existence and will be solved is solve using the same hardware in our heads using the same set of core capabilities just stacked taller and taller so like when I think about how we program which is something that are like simian and ancestors didn't have to do it all the the things that we use in order to write a computer program are the same object manipulation metaphors that get us through everyday life like I have a three-year-old daughter and she's she's as well as iPad games where she's learning on a program which constitutes of her giving little instructions to a tiny car about like you know turn right at this trade turn right go straight and so on and so those that like following a list of status you know starts way way way at the bottom of things that we learn is very small children and then if you can gain those skills and acquire them and then be able to build on top of them you can get to something that can solve the kinds of problems that we need to solve today like how do we build a vaccine or a therapy that binds to the you know the receptors on the on the spike protein of so these are all things that you can do with the general purpose AI but then there are all these steps that you need to sort of get to you know in order to get there how do you guys approach that I think a lot of people even in the industry have vastly different and contradictory definitions of what it means to have general purpose AI my view of what AI is our AGI is is given the same sensory experiences that human have from birth to you know late childhood or young adulthood you should write a program that can acquire the same concepts and the same capabilities and and be able to do the same stuff that's not a truly general AI like if you if you put that AI inside of like bar-coded world like it wouldn't work just like if you put a human baby inside a bar code world like baby would not learn how to read barcodes and like anything all probably our concepts are built around the environment that we live in and sort of the constraints of what it's like to be an animal inside the world and so that's the tack that vicarious is taken towards building a GIS you know we start with something that's embodied inside of a robot but subject to the constraints of the real world like physics and friction and unreliable sensors and change like the the test data that the robot gets is very different oftentimes from what it was trained on just like the circumstances we run into everyday life are not identical the ones that we experience when we were a child and so those for us serve as really helpful kind of like guiding constraints that encourage us to build an AGI that matches what humans can do rather than building one that's a very good at at playing go or or dota or something I guess walk me through how your approach is really different than what a lot of people think of AI which is sort of the latest in deep learning techniques a ID or an AGI especially has started to be this conflation between what is the behavior that seems intelligent and what's going on inside the agent's mind you and I are smart because when we close our eyes inside our heads we have an entire version of reality with a simulator in our heads where we can you know imagine what it might be like to like climb you know not ever astana unicycle and we can add details that like maybe the the wheels are really slippery and we're listening to music as we do it we can get an infinite number of details and and those details can then change how we imagine something like play out so we have access in our own heads to a learn representation of the entire universe and that's how we can solve problems on things that we can't see or touch directly like working on an antibody or a vaccine and it's also how we can solve the more abstract problems like program now a lot of the focus virtually all the focus on AI research today is not on that at all it's on taking something where you we have the simulator like you already have the dota game or you already have a trillion hours of YouTube videos or you already have chests and then you spend a lot of money on computers running on AWS to expose it to 14,000 years of just the exact similarity that you've already written already exists whether it's a go game or you know it did a game or whatever it is video and so you've learned something that can respond in a way that seems intelligent without actually having anything going on inside its head in my mind it would kind of be the old old animal brain approach to building AI it sounds reptilian I guess yeah so Kol never an insectoid even like a lot of our insect friends I saw a video of a wasp who after combat in which it hadn't been decapitated it went through a very elaborate like wound cleaning routine where it was like cleaning its farms of its body you know just to make sure there wasn't any any any wounds that went unclean from the combat while holding its own head and then it flies away while still holding its own head and so it has like all of these very complex routines that are sort of hard-coded there's nothing going on literally in its head whereas you contrast that to the human alike in humans and mammals everything happens because we have this model of the world I'm not because we're just following some rote reflexes that we've learned over an evolutionary process and today's API is largely about creating an evolutionary process through millions of years of training data that that Jarrid a system that behaves somewhat intelligently would expose the same stimuli it's like the wasp with no head yeah I remember seeing a video of you putting a frog in front of the iPad so I mean there's so many videos of animals like revealing that there's nothing going on inside the animal's head it's just like following a script that gives it the illusion of the intentionality of a mental model when in reality it's just following up a list of hard-coded commands and there's no there's no deeper intelligence going on and they're you know really well-meaning teams out there that are basically dumping a lot of money into exactly those deep learning models but they're not necessarily sort of pushing forward the state of the state of the art right the the methods are not new the methods are well-known like I would say the teams are putting a lot of money in this and it's economically useful like I think that you can build very complex kind of like heuristic systems using large datasets to solve problems that are important like dimension a system that manages the temperatures of the datacenter and saves hundreds of millions of dollars doing this and I think the applications in society for doing those kinds of systems are huge and plentiful and varied and and you can you can swim forever almost building those kinds of systems I think the problem with those kinds of systems is that they're always limited by the data that you feed them with as a species the most interesting things that we can do exist at the edges where there's very little data like if you wanted to build a AI system to invent fusion power it's unclear when you'd even train it on because you're trying to discover most of the things like most of the the work is in doing the discovery where there's no data yet and so it's not well-suited to create a new kind of human progress that I want to see in my lifetime to do that and we need something that's much more human like them assistance other people are building some of the most famous projects out there are sort of subject to this right like even alphago if you add another square or add another row or column it actually breaks the model because there's not like a deeper meaning it does and you can see this to if you like read opening I made a lot of noises from a publicity perspective about they're too dangerous to release language model that would send they would synthesize paragraphs of text deep and when you read them they they were locally coherent but so globally incoherent because of this very phenomenon where they don't have a model of the world yeah I mean they're incredibly useful and complicated matrices but there's not a deeper meaning what what I would love to see is more effort being spent on systems that are more human-like in this way that actually learn in that model of the world and learn high-level concepts and can reason so that we can build something that's closer to a human brain and less like you know the amazing Cambrian explosion of different very narrow intelligences that are all trained said besides new songs or to play an nvidia game or to do you know image labeling or something I think that's why we started vicarious and and what I'd love for more companies to be working on to the origins of a I kind of started this way as well didn't it first text-to-speech models for instance were trying to use neural networks I guess link vicarious to this sort of lineage of AI and you know how this stuff sort of started in this you know Cambrian era of 16 to 60s and 70s so I think the debate about how to build intelligence that actually goes way further back then the current arguments happening or even the ones that happen in the early days of artificial intelligence in the 70s and 60s you know you you look back towards the philosophers and you see you know thinkers like play-doh or kata are arguing for a human mind that uses symbolic primitiveness or you know platonic solids or pure reason in order to understand the world and then there are others that are more in the lineage of people like skinner who believe that everything is behavior and there's you know the human mind is effectively blanked and there's nothing that's innate and i would argue that those two extremes or paradigms of thinking from a philosophical and then later from a psychological or psychophysics perspective moving into an artificial intelligence perspective but at that pendulum swing of like is everything learned or is is everything hard-coded is it nature is it nurture has been with us for a really long time and I think because a lot of the recent successes commercially have been with using very large compute power with very simple to create systems that are economically valuable or at least show flashy demos that's kind of swung the pendulum in favor of viewing the mind or the artificial intelligent mind anyway as something that is all on the nurturer column but I think if you take a really close look at the literature and the neuroscience and the cognitive science communities there's so much that humans are able to do from incredibly young ages and there's no way to bridge the gap between our current artificial intelligence systems that take 14,000 years to learn how to manipulate just one Rubik's Cube and a human child which can do it in you know two years and so there's a very significant gap that I think needs to be bridged by bringing more innate Ness more nature into the way we think about how to build artificial intelligence and that's been one of the North Star Destroyer vicarious is thinking okay for the things that need to be learned we should learn them but for the things that are likely to be innate or we can find strong biological evidence for being an eight then we should take advantage of that and use more structure in the models that we create and I would also for the people who are more like deep learning the purists I would observe that a lot of what's taken for granted in modern deep learning systems things like local receptive fields or convolution or reinforcement learning or Bachelor ization and are all either violent to be inspired directly or after the fact you could look back at the biology and realize hey that's actually really strong neural correlate for this I think that provides some encouragement that we're looking in the right direction and seeing that what's what's gotten us to where we are now in our quest for intelligent machines is actually looking for more innate structures so in terms of innate structures we both have young children who are growing very quickly and you know going from basically Tamagotchi mode into real human mode which is amazing to see are there parallels in terms of types of learning systems that sort of layer on top of one another or you know is that a salient feature of the system is you you're focused on the building yeah I think so I think you know there's a there's a hierarchy of skills that we form in hierarchy of representations that we form as humans as we develop and the the learning systems that we we trained in vicarious inside the robots exhibit many of the same kinds of properties where by having access to one set of concepts you can construct higher-level concepts and that was something that I'm if not it wasn't published in the science robotics paper we released last years you know we'll be in a follow-up to that paper but I think you know drawing from our experience as humans and from the cognitive science and neuroscience communities is something that can be a really powerful accelerant for figuring out what are the right directions to point our you know the next iterations of our architectures beyond well let's just get a bigger computer how do you break it down into smaller pieces or is that not possible for something of this sort of magnitude you know the classic standard SAS view of software's ship something to you know a small number of users make them very happy and then iterate from there and I don't even know how you apply that to something like a GI so I think all of the big technologies are virtually all the big technologies that have come to reshape our society have been created using a really similar blueprint or recipe like I think about Amazon to create an everything store were you like there were anything and it gets there the next day is a crazy idea you know circa pre internet or even circa early internet and to build it Jeff had to you know make a core technology and apply it to one very narrow thing which you start with books and so yeah inventing e-commerce and using a distribution center model for doing those shipments was enough to kind of get the flywheel spinning and then the more you turn it you go from books to ebooks in CDs and the skis and games and you expand outward eventually you selling to anyone really fast or think about Elon like Elon started SpaceX to build a Mars colony and you can build a Mars colony in one go and if you want a Mars colony what you really want as a space logistics company and so he started with you know the long term goal for that was to get large reusable rockets and the short term one was let's build small disposable rockets as a stepping stone to get the large reusable ones which make the Mars colony possible and you can kind of look at any of the of the very large successful companies that have come to shape an industry or an AK spective society and they'll follow the same footprints effort for us as a robotics and AGI company and we wanted this any robot any task no programming just language and we're gonna get there once it's at a time where we start off with a small numbered for robots doing a small number of different tasks and every time we add a new task the robots get more valuable we get more customers we get more money which lets us make the robots to more tasks and so on and we fly that wheel up until you know the robots really can do anything including solve very challenging problems like the ones that face us in society today robotics is sort of the way to have a very direct economic impact very quickly and I'd also say the like I like businesses that well you know it's good to have a very long term like in 30 years I want to you know they're all disease or something kind of ambition for society but I especially love businesses who can create value all along the way and so you have to wait you know 30 years to find out if your joke is funny you can you can create value for everyone every time you have a small success it gets you closer to that long-term goal honor also helps people in the immediate term and so that's what we're trying to have a curious there are so many problems in robotics that require basically a lot of if statements and one-off work a lot of calibration and you know have you been able to apply more gen techniques to have you know a machine that teaches itself to learn I think we've made a lot of great progress to the farm on Mike Harris's mission and our customers certainly appreciate it in the sense that most of the customers we talked to they don't know any robots like they've never been able to learn any robots even though we're about to have been around for thirty years fifty years even because to get in a robot to do something it just requires a lot of very brutal programming and mechanical engineering and fixtures and you know hard upfront costs that then make the system inflexible and so we're able threw all that away and instead provide them with robotic labor Burt as the service the same way we can get computers of service these days it's much more flexible and dynamic then you know would be possible using any other system other than vicarious provides we're actively serving multiple customers and our systems are running almost 24/7 doing you know real work in factories in America we can do a bunch different tests so you can see at the website if you want to dig it a little bit deeper but it's everything from packaging machine tending kidding palletizing deep palletizing sorting there many of her tasks we support and many more promising and then these are classically things that would be sort of single purpose you know there are definitely robotics companies that have done single things really really well per se but yeah none that you know a purpose across so many different tasks yeah I think for us the difference between us and many of the robotics companies that exist that are much smaller than we are is the the average robotics company builds one product and has to charge a lot of money for it because they just have one product and even building one robotics product is very difficult and so you have to build a whole bunch of custom stuff to get it to work and so you're not able to amortize the cost of your product over a very large customer base or over a large of applications whereas for us we just have one in AI layer we spent last ten years building and so because it's so comprehensive we can create new applications relatively quickly and we can amortize all of the costs of doing a deployment over a customer NEADS 50 or 100 or 500 robots and so that makes the economics much better for us - much better for them now recently I was on an episode of Netflix's explain series by Vox and the topic was coding and one interesting direction they took that I didn't expect but you know it's definitely right was they started identifying that when you talk about traditional robotics approaches what you're talking about is rooms full of coders writing code that would do one specific purpose within Factory for instance like just picking this up and putting it in this other thing right yeah loading and unloading is like just one vertical and you could have a team of engineers working on just that one thing there's this coming revolution where the machines could program themselves that sort of sounds like what you've already started working on basically you know one-off sets of being programmers that are sort of doing these sort of infinitely deep deep learning projects that only do that one thing they're you know really learning systems that learn how to learn and you can see some of that in the in the science robotics paper in terms of in in that one there's the he really does program itself like you show it a pair of diagrams you know like in woman in one diagram the apples and oranges are all mixed together and in the second diagram the apples are on the right and your arms are on the left and then you show it maybe two or three examples of that it figures out I'll give the program that you're trying to communicate to me is sort a Poisson oranges and on the left on the right in this way and then it literally writes the its own code and execute that code on the robot so that's you know that's exactly the direction that we've gone with it and continue yeah that's really cool what advice do you have for people who are sort of fast but when we were 18 or 22 just starting out maybe just learning to code or reading the right things following the right people but what does society want from us us builders and creators right what what advice would you share to the 18 or 22 year old version of yourself now how much time you have having I would emphasize how hard it is I think that a lot of emphasis in the startup world on building short-term get it to market flip the company move on to the next thing and kinds of businesses and products for markets that are already over served so I think about things that are primarily consumer apps or in heavily saturated markets and then there's very few people who take an interest in more esoteric but important building blocks of society so I think about businesses like SpaceX or like flex port or like coinbase who are now very large and successful but to build them you had to be kind of weird and they're interested in something that most people were too busy building social media apps or building something that was much more kind of short term or narrowly focused to what I'm invest time in and so I guess the advice or encouragement I could give to young people who are thinking about this is a line of a lot of work is to reflect very hard on what is the biggest gift you feel like you can give to your fellow humans and decide with full intention to make that your life's purpose and know that it's going to be incredibly hard and painful and you'll be met with resistance but ultimately by being able to give your largest gift to society you're also giving it to yourself like you'll feel the most fulfilment by knowing that you've become who you were supposed to be I guess that's the advice I would offer to young people who are thinking about having a career in startup store or technology as technologies the ultimate lover humanities ever found on creating a better life for everyone here and you can be part of that but I would encourage to be part of it in a way that leverages your unique gifts and unique you know weirdness is the wrong word but like interests and set of backgrounds and passions there might be something that you're very very interested in that's where the unusual I'm I'm meeting Ben's Silverman who started Pinterest and he showed me the demo and he uses a tutu as co-founder something at the time and usually you can collect things like make websites where you like have pictures of all your stuff and I'm like why would anyone use this or even you Gary when you showed me Posterous you know that the first meeting of our YC class like what are you building and you're like it's email for blogs how did you get in you know and so I think if you can tap into what you really feel in your bones is to get if that you have to give to all the other humans and then build build build to try and make it so and be prepared for setbacks but stay true to that gift you want to give that's where I would apply my my energy I mean I feel like even in this interview you've been able to show sort of both of both of those things right like we talked about AGI it's probably you know the biggest thing that humanity will see in the next hundred years or you know ideally like much sooner than that and you're trying to bring it about much sooner than that but at the same time you're able to basically bring it down to the level of how do we make money and have enough how do we actually economically make a difference in the lives of your customers like the even the people who you know they're they're making widgets they're making you know X and there's you know a top line and the bottom line and the technology can actually be applied already in a way that puts dollars and cents in people's pockets and it's economically viable and that's what can really grow like you said earlier that's really powerful Thanks modeling it it's like that's really really cool and also rare right what you've been able to do is very very rare you know what as you're talking about it it it it just reminded me of how hard it is like I think you know if you go to Mike aquarius's website you see a list of you know all of the most famous people as our investors and all these publications and in you know the highest profile possible academic venues and our incredible team and really polished videos the robots doing real work and like it's been 10 years it's been an incredible and you know had times wonderful and at a times heartbreaking journey to build the company and and I think anyone who's trying to do something that is their calling is their destiny it's gonna have that character to it we're on the outside like you look at with you Lana's been able to do and on the outside you're like wow you know electric cars and tunnels and spaceships it's just like super cool but you hear him talk about the moments where he had to risk it all or where he wasn't he was sleeping on the factory floor like and all the short sellers were squeezing the life out of the company and it was on the verge of bankruptcy so many times I want people who choose to walk this path to choose it with eyes open about that it's going to be hard there's gonna be moments that you doubt that you know you should be doing it or that it's gonna work out and and like that's part of the choice to do it like I knew when I started my carry us like I want to build a GI we pitched it to virtually every investor in Sand Hill Road and you know the only ones who said yes we're the ones who backed me in my previous company basically with a couple of exceptions like Dustin Moskovitz and I knew and very with the eyes open committed to myself like this may not go anywhere this may be incredibly hard and I'm comfortable spending the next decade you know working kind of by myself on this thing that maybe no one else ends up caring about or doesn't go anywhere because it was that important to me and I would find something that you feel that way about I can commit to that because in those darkest moments that's what will keep you going there's no you know there's no pot of gold or Exeter or or you know shiny article in Forbes or something that that makes it all worth the thing that makes it all worth is is being true to yourself and being true to know that this is what I'm supposed to be doing even if it's you know impossibly difficult from time to time it's awesome words man : I'm glad to have you use an investor glad to be an investor yeah awesome man thanks for doing this good to see you it's great to see you man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
