 thank you maybe pleasure together without the presenter you that very short story on how we get from the billions of opinions shared by millions of people that Jonathan managed to understand and translated into the very simple understanding that we used as also games design initiatives including and it all started the story starters is some church of my company who decided to ruin the reputation of the brand again generate and that was a great opportunity couple of months later I joined the company and the global team told me we have no idea what so you have the autonomy to run the position of again in your country and then together with nothing we took this opportunity and we started to work on this and the brand was very much when you look at the rework but was very much rooted in to this discipline area so this precision efficiency quite poor resources especially after after dieselgate so we decided to move it away more into this carrying joy oh yeah and this is how the celebrity promising them a position across were established for second is decided and a false began that gives you this feel-good experience so carrying joy thanks to the Jonathan's technology we understood that the second truth resonates with customers much better from the sixth equities that were important for us also and then the other one especially on responsibility transport in Israel it is something that we lost and it was not a declaration on consumers for me personally was like excellence choice consumer so to say because I wanted very badly to move the brands of the direction of drawing and I had this fixation on the concept of celebration the world in celebration meant to me everything I put the entire team all agencies created a strategy agencies with this idea them to incorporate celebration into our our positioning statement communication lighting everything and I made a traumatic mistaken that I had that in my mind sixth celebration of fun and festive character like this but in the country that I was responsible for so that way she was very much going this direction of liturgical clerical atmospheres I was pushing one of the biggest automotive brands into the very mission area all the guys who don't buy too many cars and now they're not very well-equipped let us find my third mistake that that's right so if we take a closer look at why what you see the association's for both countries Westham and hero celebrations connotated so we have celebrate here in fireworks birthday good things positive things right side we see common associations of the translation and we can see here blue how close those things are church liturgy and you can see there's too much blue it is too much church like that really prevented from rather is what to do instead so we actually took a selection of hundreds of possible characters that we could use in the marketing as a stand-ins to communicate the brain values and the top ones we're actually teacher and doctor and many more others are now ranked by their ability to instill in the consumers mind the brand equities that we wanted them to think about behind that of course is a lot more data analysis we can see what which dimensions the teacher or the doctor actually strongest you can see here for example a doctor but very you know affordable cheap pair those things are not connected to the document plus now that we have a character that we can use that everybody would understand we can also look at topics that would resonate strongly and would again communicate those things that the consumer should think about support ni alliance we use this exactly these long installed then design luckily develops and years how to activate this project this position yeah the first one was going into this responsibility something that we lost the most property and that was a CSR activation but we developed for kids with a very strong psychological inside and when you know how to save people's life you become a better person but when you also think so again tech that there are some associations quite obvious also that are negative or as was been prospectively like you know CPR through the first eight means maybe accidents of the world accidental Volkswagen cars so there are a lot of associations we wanted to the point and therefore instead of just educating kids in the first aid in the CPR we elevated this idea to the superhero story so that kids actually are becoming superheroes appear to achieve them superpowers and this is how we avoid that all the associations exactly I want to make it super simple so for that we're going to do a quick Association test group what I do please close your eyes and now group number one open your eyes and now close them again number two now open your eyes and look at these words and again close your eyes now group wanna do open your eyes and complete this word in your head who have you thought about soon and hope you thought about so so what happened is I showed before these words these words so however I didn't think of those the machine did because it calculated for the market what would be the strongest associations and soup or so and because the machine thinks so similarly to you I was not able to get out of a machine exactly the words they trigger the semantic network that is common between all of you but you can now get it within the application you type in soup and I just showed you the words that the machine knows associated in your head with that concept then of course is exactly what marketing is all about we're trying to make people think certain things so we have now here this interface we can actually put in a slogan the best chicken noodle recipe and can already predict well people are going to think about sue if you talk about scrap the notion in one people would obviously think about soul but for this use case what you do of course is to put in the things that you're interested in teacher pupil first aid stronger they will lose brand equity values you can immediately see first aid through the roof that's a great thing to use in order to boat what we want people to think about which is this at this point you may be thinking how I doing that so HD spray billions and billions of publicly available text data sources Wikipedia all of the mass media even a little bit of social media and using machine learning you then compute these very elaborate Association networks and you can now actually predict what people will think what they will say when you ask them about a brand about a topic when your tribute for example it's weeded for this challenge what are the values associated with the brand we can now understand how people perceive their brand immediately automatically compared to the competition and you can thereby find things in areas that we can exploit in order to strengthen our positioning and to give you the whole story about this project we looked in the whole network and we look at developing this valuable responsible trustworthy and then look where's the doctor well he's super close to those values so in the hope in the grand scheme of all characters you can use it's a very good character go ahead you said idea create your campaign business results are fantastic and this is just an engagement score for these two initiatives typically when we post something about the new courage of that should make a cheer about for eight years that we were measuring this against these are the highest engagements and polls that we can have however both little heroes and this this campaign outperformed the typically top scores by far and also in terms of the Granton business results was important for me breakfast adoration the key message in this campaign the engagement of the intellect additionals out outstanding completely over our our targets all these companies received also a lot of in the end it's about I think putting the right pieces together I personally feel that the consumer should always come first about asking them takes a lot of time so very cumbersome and it can actually confirm your biases but if you start with the associations that you have you actually have the bias that is out there that is accurate and it can work with it and I believe that working together with the agency and the grant that is open to this to this change to this new way of doing things as a lot of opportunities because in the end if you use the right words if you might be right associations and you're also going to see [Applause]
