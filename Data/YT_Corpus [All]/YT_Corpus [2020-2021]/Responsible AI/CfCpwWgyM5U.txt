 you [Music] we'll start the next session this is on AI for societal impact it's it's an area that is close to our hearts in MSR and I think MIT will probably give more details so I'll introduce the track owner it's my great pleasure to introduce Amit Sharma who's from Microsoft Research India emitted his PhD from Cornell and joined us you know some time back and his research interests are in the area of causality and recently I think he's also doing some interesting work on on mental health and he's extremely passionate about the potential for AI to do social good societal impact and I'll hand it over to Amit and I'm sure he's he'll also introduce what we what I'm sure is a very interesting set of speakers that we have over the next hour and a half so overdo it thank you for this introduction as I said I think at MSR we are very passionate about having societal impact with the research projects that we do and we thought of in this data science AI summit we thought of having a session focused on how these technologies can help us have social impact right so one thing that I think is not new to almost all of you is that AI and machine learning are having a transformative impact right and I just would give you one sort of anecdote or one sort of question you can ask researchers is what are the problems in computer vision or natural language processing or even reinforcement learning which deals with control theory and making decisions that you could not solve ten years ago right and you can even today find examples even on phones that you use that there have been computer vision advances that were not possible ten years ago in 2008 there have been translation and natural language there have been automatic generation of natural language that was unheard of ten years ago and similarly in reinforcement learning we are now seeing more and more control applications that seemed like impossible right so it's not just that we are making advances it's just that we made a huge advance in our capabilities in AI right and so obviously one set of events that have happened that it's been starting to use everywhere right so for example in the West especially and in many countries we're already seeing machine learning being used in companies to automate processes giving scene we are seeing it being used in different types of even sort of field work for example education agriculture smartphone usage and so on right and so they've been big concerns that have come up one is of course job automation so with this new technology especially so powerful there are many concerns about how the future economy is going to look like there are also concerns about fairness and responsibility if you are now deploying for example take the first example deploying a technology app that helps us kid learn you have to be really sure that whatever content that's being provided is responsible it's not sort of learning some bad patterns that are not good for the student and more importantly you also want to make sure that technologies such as in healthcare or finance are being fair to all kinds of represented and underrepresented groups right so there's this part that has taken a lot of attention both in the press and in recent media this session though even though we understand that all of these are big concerns we want to focus on the positive side right so with any technology what impact can it have on our society and especially as researchers and people living in India there are many problems where it is possible that AI and technology can be useful but I think what we want to do in this session is to just bring some perspective on what's possible and what is the right way to go about it right let me just touch a few examples in this long list of problems you can think of as societal problems and the sense that they are motivated by conditions in our society and they're impacting us in different walks of our life in health care and education a country like ours faces a huge shortage in trained professionals you can imagine ái being useful in helping people to deliver effective services similarly in Financial Inclusion and governance we have great in efficiencies and you can think of ways in which AI or machine learning can help you be much more efficient and much more transparent in how things are but at the same time we also have to be asking us this question which is interestingly what I also get asked when I talk to people who are outside this machine learning is there and people ask what's different this time right and I hope in this session today we also ask this question of it's great but what's different right so technology and societal impact is not a new dream it was there when computers were introduced in the 1980s and 90s it was there with the internet being an enabler of communication across the world and it's still there with mobile phones and the ability for people to have a communication device right with them if this one thing that we have learnt that are both through research at our group in Microsoft research and through other ICT work is that technology cannot just be a fix for societal problems that we have right and one of the nicest sort of expressions to think about is that it can only act as an amplifier of the social forces that we have right so for example if you have a great educational institution if you add technology to it provide all students great apps to learn most likely they'll do well but if you don't and in think instead you have a situation where the school is not running well they're not enough teachers just sort of magically introducing apps that learn would not help students as much right and if you're interested there's a former researcher at a lab quintero to Emma who's written a book on this whole idea of techno determinism and so in this session what I hope we can do is to take both of these perspectives and present you both active research and practical projects that people are working on in this area right and based on our experience what we found at least at Microsoft Research is that these four things are the most important whenever you're thinking of applying AI for societal impact or in any technology for that matter and I'll walk through this but I think the first thing to see here is that there's nothing technical in these four points it's often not about having a deep technical advancement or end or an insight it's often about finding the right problem where ml can have an impact working with excellent domain experts or people organizations who have expertise in the problem that you're dealing with so that you're not just sort of going blind with the correlations you find and finally a big focus on deployment and testing I hope in the panel discussion we'll also toss or talk about what's the right expectation of success success means different things especially in the research world and in practice and especially for a thorny issue as a societal problem there can be different expectations of what it means to have a success so over the past few months and this year at MSR we have started this collaborative project keeping in mind these four points where we are thinking of working and collaborating with organizations across academia and the social enterprises to actually then identify these problems where yeah I can have an impact and we are very fortunate that today we have four speakers some of whom we are also collaborating with who have tackled this hard problem in many sort of different domains right so we have a great sort of diversity in the kinds of problems you'll hear about today and how machine learning and AI can help from grinching from how do you have better wildlife tracking and conservation to how do you think about tackling fake news and misinformation in the society and then also we'll also hear both from researchers as well as people who are doing the groundwork for at Fratton Books is an NGO that's look to use AI for making children read books in whatever language they wish to and finally Roanoke is going to talk about a problem that I think especially in India many of us are increasingly concerned with which is air pollution and how do you design intelligent sensors to tackle that problem so through these talks I hope we'll get both a sense of what's possible what are the range of problems that are potentially solvable but as well as the challenges and and this whole question of how much can we expect from this new technology
