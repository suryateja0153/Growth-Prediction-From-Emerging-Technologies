 We believe at Intouch that online models for targeting shoppers is not going to won't be as efficient in the offline world because basically if you think about it in the online world you find an audience or you find people that you want to target to the product that you have in mind that you want to make an uplift of sales on. But in the offline world in the physical retail, shop or store owners or store managers they don't really have control over who walks into their stores at any given moment. So they cannot really we cannot really say that for the Lipton tea that I have on my shelf right now I need to target these people what if these people will never walk into your store so you're not basically making any targeting and you're not contributing into any sales uplift. So what we really quickly realized it is that our secret ingredient is that we basically started profiling the retail products instead of profiling people who walks into the stores and that and what that has given us is that we basically have every single item in the store on standby ready to be used for targeting whatever audience that is going to walk from the door at any given point, instead of us just deciding on a specific subset of products that is the old-fashioned basically flier of promotion. Interesting so you're trying to do to the physical store what the likes of Google have done for online, so Google knows that I'm sat here in Toronto and I bought all these previous things and this is the demographic of the area that I live in, and then start promoting to me on that and you were able to do that when I walk into the store? Yes so this is exactly what we are doing and we have our different levels of personalizing these promotions and it depends if we know you or we don't know you as Helen the individual person we can also do targeting based on the location in which you just walked, in the events that are happening around the store at this point the temperature outside, what's trending on social media in this particular geographic area and there are a lot of different key factors that we consider while making personalized targeting in the store and it is basically not just relying on knowing you as an individual and in its if you don't go basically if you're not happy to have like a super personalized advertising we can still increase the sales by having different angles to the personalization. So this still protects my privacy but it gives me more relevant yes relevant ads? yeah exactly so we are we are very much big believers in responsible AI and for Intouch as an AI company we have data privacy and data protection by design in every single aspect of our business to make sure that we are not being invasive in any way while targeting people. We are still shoppers by the end of the day when we go home we go to the supermarket with our wives and girlfriends and kids and shop so that's that.
