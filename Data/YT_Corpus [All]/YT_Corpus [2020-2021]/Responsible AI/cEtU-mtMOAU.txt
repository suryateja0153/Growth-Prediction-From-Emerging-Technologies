 [Music] with great power comes great responsibility that's what they say in spider-man right but it's also really relevant to us in AI because we've seen how powerful AI can be so it could be extremely cool or extremely terrifying but I got to figure out like what are the roles who is the boss and who makes sure we follow these roles currently there is no international standard or principles but in 2017 there was a conference that looked around this area and they developed the A's Lamarr AI principles which tap into the research issues the ethics the values and also outline some of the longer-term issues we might be facing with AI and it's something that Elon Musk has signed and also the late Stephen Hawking Microsoft have also developed their AI principles which is around a great number of areas including fairness inclusivity reliability safety transparency accuracy privacy and security so these are all these different areas that they've deemed to be really really important we're gonna throw over to Brad Smith the Microsoft President to explain these in a sec over to you that's this question is not what computers can do it's what computers should do because computers will be able to do more and more and more we get to decide as communities as countries and as a global society what computers should do and that fundamentally means it's for people to chart the path and the future for artificial intelligence and it's therefore so important that this work be guided by ethical principles I don't think we're yet at a point where one can say magically we know exactly what the ethical principle should be but in our book we have done at least our best work to seek to define the six principles that we think are most important in some ways I would start with the two at the top and the center because their principles that have a in fact been around for some period of time this importance of having artificial intelligence be reliable and safe and also that it ensure that it protect privacy and security these are two areas where we've been focused on technology for a long time where the law is even well-developed but as we think about the future it is so fundamentally important that AI systems be fair if we are going to empower computers to make decisions that people make today we must ensure that these decisions are made fairly we have to ensure that we don't take the biases that are explicit or implicit in human reasoning and simply incorporate them into computer decision-making without real thought beforehand we need to protect against that sense of unfairness and similarly we need to think about what it means to ensure that AI is inclusive when it can have such an overwhelmingly important impact on people with disabilities we need to ensure that a focus on their needs is made part of this core but all four of these ethical principles at the top really do rely on two others and you heard some reference to this already without transparency there simply is no way of knowing whether AI is adhering to these or any other ethical principles so transparency is of paramount importance and at the end of the day perhaps the bedrock principle of all is an assurance of accountability we must ensure that computers remain accountable to people and that the people who design AI systems remain accountable to other people that is the only way to ensure that all of us individually and collectively will genuinely remain the masters of our own destiny so what she computers do this is a really good question and something we'll be exploring in this module as a is rapidly evolving we really need a set of guiding principles what do you think are the most important do you agree with them we're gonna be delving deeper into this area throughout this module enjoy [Music]
