 TO WELCOME ANTHONY WHO IS STANDING BY WITH A PANEL TO TALK AI. ANTHONY, OVER TO YOU. HEY, EVERYONE. SENIOR CLOUD ADVOCATE WITH MICROSOFT. AND I'M JOINED BY A PANEL TO DISCUSS THE ETHICAL USE INNING. OF AI. LET'S GO AROUND THE VIRTUAL TABLE AND HAVE EVERYBODY INTRODUCE THEMSELVES.  HI, MY NAME IS ERIK. I LEAD THE AI PLATFORM TEAM HERE AT MICROSOFT.  HI, EVERYONE, MY NAME IS MARILYN. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF ETHICS AND SOCIETY AT MICROSOFT. HI THERE. I'M ROB. I LEAD A CENTRAL DATA SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING TEAM IN THE WINDOWS AND DEVICES GROUP. I'M SARAH. AND I LEAD RESPONSIBLE AI IN THE COGNITIVE SERVICES. SO ERIK, MICROSOFT HAS MADE HUGE ORGANIZATIONAL INVESTMENTS IN RESPONSIBLE AI AND HAS BECOME CENTRAL TO HOW WE BUILD OUR PRODUCTS TODAY. HOW DOES MICROSOFT'S APPROACH DIRECTLY BENEFIT OUR CUSTOMERS AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR I. T. PROFESSIONALS IN THE AUDIENCE IN TERMS OF ENABLING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WAY THEY USE OUR PRODUCTS RESPONSIBLY? YEAH, THANKS. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I HAVE TALKED TO CUSTOMERS AND REALLY HEARD FROM THEM THAT THEY'RE REALLY GRAPPLING AND STRUGGLING WITH HOW DO THEY DEVELOP AND DEPLOY AI IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER AND. ONE THING THAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE BUILT A LOT OF TOOLS AND PRACTICES BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE INNOVATION THAT WE HAVE ENABLED IN THE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO CONNECT WITH. BY WORKING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND SHOWCASING EXACTLY HOW WE'VE DONE THIS WORK, HOW WE HAVE TAUGHT OUR TEAMS AND HOW OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PAYING OFF AND USING THE SAME TOOLS THAT WE USE AND MAKING THEM AVAILABLE THROUGH AZURE MACHINE LEARN, THEY CAN GO AND DO THE EXACT SAME THINGS SO IT'S HELPING CUSTOMERS BUILD AND DEPLOY AT THEIR AI-BASED APPLICATIONS WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE DONE THIS IN A REALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER. WE HAVE MADE HUGE INVESTMENTS IN HOW WE BUILD OUR PRODUCTS IN RESPONSIBLE WAY. AND WE ARE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE WE CAN SHARE AND CONNECT THAT WITH ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS THAT WE HAVE ACROSS AZURE AND ACROSS MICROSOFT. SO ROB, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT SOME OF THE INTERESTING INNOVATION YOUR DATA SCIENCE TEAM IS DOING TO PUT THIS INTO PRACTICE?  YEAH, THANKS. BEFORE I TALK ABOUT WORLD IS DEPENDING MORE AND MORE ON AI AND MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS FOR PREDICTION, DECISION SUPPORT, AND AUTOMATION. IT'S TRUE IN INDUSTRIES, CERTAINLY TRUE FOR MICROSOFT. OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS. THOSE DECISIONS AND ACTIONS HAVE HIGHER STAKES, IT BECOMES MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN EXPLAIN THE REASONS BEHIND THE DECISIONS AND ACTIONS TO MEET COMMITMENTS WE HAVE ON FAIRNESS, RELIABILITY, SAFETY, ACCOUNTABILITY, PRIVACY, AND SECURITY. IN THE CASE OF WINDOW, WE'RE USING MACHINE LEARNING TO HELP ASSESS THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT AND TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES. SO FOR EXAMPLE, WITH WINDOWS UPDATE, WE TRAIN AND USE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF THE UPDATES ON SYSTEM RELIABILITY AND PERFORMANCE. AND THAT MIGHT DETERMINE HOW QUICKLY WE UPDATE A DEVICE. SO WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE WHY BEHIND THESE PREDICTIONS TO HELP THE ENGINEER, THE PEOPLE WHO BUILD WINDOWS, PRIORITIZE WHAT TO WORK ON AND DETERMINE THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION TO TAKE. SO THIS IS WHERE TECHNOLOGY LIKE INTERPRETABILITY TOOLS COME IN. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE FEATURES THAT IMPACT THE MODEL BOTH GLOBALLY FOR THE POPULATION AND INDIVIDUAL PREDICTIONS OR CLASSIFICATIONS. THIS IS IMPORTANT AT TRAINING TIME TO BUILD TRUST AND FOR DEBUGGING THE MODELS BUT ALSO IN PRODUCTION TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE MODELS PERFORMING, MAKING DECISIONS IN THE WILD. INTERPRETABILITY CAN HELP WITH DETECTING FAIRNESS ISSUE, MEETING REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, AND PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY. SO MY TEAM ALONG WITH MICROSOFT SEARCH AND THE AZURE ML TEAM INVESTED IN SOMETHING THAT WE CALL INTERPRET ML. AN OPEN SOURCE PACKAGE, ALSO AVAILABLE IN AZURE ML. THAT BRINGS TOGETHER MULTIPLE STATE-OF-THE-ART MACHINE LEARNING INTERPRETABILITY TECHNIQUES. WE USE IT BOTH TO TRAIN INTERPRETABILITY GLASS BOX MODELS AND EXPLAIN BLACK BOX SYSTEMS LIKE THE UPDATE SYSTEM I DESCRIBED. SO FOR GLASS BOX MODELS, IT INCLUDES THE EXPLAINABLE BOOSTING MACHINE WHICH IS A MODEL DEVELOPED IN MICROSOFT RESEARCH. THIS USES MODERN MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES LIKE BAGGING, GRADIENT BOOST, AUTOMATIC INTERACTION DETECTION, BUILDING ON GENERALIZED MODELS AND MAKES EXPLAINABLE BOOSTED MACHINE AS STATE OF THE ART BUT WITH LOSTLESS EXPLANATIONS. THIS IS HELPFUL FOR UNDERSTANDING BUILDING MODELS THAT CAN BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD AND EXPLAINED. INTERPRETABILITY INCLUDES BLACKS BOX EXPLAINS AND IT CAN EXPLAIN ANY MODEL AFTER THE FACT WITH TECHNIQUES LIKE FEATURE IMPORTANCE, EXPLANATION, EXPLORATION, AND INDIVIDUAL CONDITIONAL EXPECTATION PLOTS. INTEGRATING THE BEST OF BREED METHODS BUT ALSO IN WAYS TO OVERTIME MORE EXPLAINERS CAN BE ADDED AND YOU CAN ADD YOUR OWN. SO TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, THESE METHODS HAVE ENABLED THE DATA SCIENTISTS AND EDGE NEARS TO CREATE GLOBAL EXPLANATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING SPECIFIC OUTCOMES AND WHICH FEATURES HAVE THE MOST IMPACT ON RESULTS GIVEN INPUTS. SO AN END RESULT FOR US IS MORE RESPONSIBLE SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTION. IS. SARAH, HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT ON THE GROUND? ARE THERE NEW PRODUCT FEATURES THAT HIGHLIGHT HOW TEAMS DWELT THE ISSUES IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY? YEAH, I'M GLAD YOU ASKED. ONE OF THE ONES THAT I THINK IS AN EXCELLENT SHOWCASE OF HOW RESPONSIBLE AI CAN LEAD TO BETTER PRODUCTS AND INNOVATION IS OUR NEW SPATIAL ANALYSIS FEATURES IN THE COGNITIVE SERVICES. THIS IS A CAPABILITY THAT ENABLES YOU TO USE VIDEO TO ANALYZE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE TASK PATTERNS OF PEOPLE IN THE STORE. AND UNDERSTAND ARE THEY ABLE TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE, IS THERE A PLACE WHERE THERE'S A BOTTLENECK AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO REDESIGN THINGS? ARE THERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE DISPORE WE NEED TO WAIT LIMIT HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN ENTER. WE CAN SEE WHY THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL AND HELPFUL FEATURE PARTICULARLY AT THE TIME. HOWEVER, IT'S ALSO VERY SENSITIVE. WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT PEOPLE ON VIDEOS AND ANALYZING THEIR PATTERNS. SO WHEN WE STARTED BUILDING THIS TECHNOLOGY, WE TOOK RESPONSIBLE AI INTO ACCOUNT FROM THE BEGINNING. SO WE DID HARMS MODELING EXERCISES TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHO ARE THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY, WHO MAY BE AFFECTED, WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR, WHAT ARE OUTCOMES WE WOULD WANT TO AVOID. AND ARMED WITH ALL OF THAT THINKING, WE WERE ABLE TO DESIGN IT INTO THE PRODUCT SO WE COULD REALLY ENABLE THE SCENARIOS THAT WE CARED ABOUT AND TRY TO AVOID THE OUTCOMES THAT WOULD BE LESS IDEAL. SO WE DID THINGS LIKE DEPLOY ON THE MICROSOFT CAMPUS. WE DID USER RESEARCH, CONVENED COMMUNITY JURIES, ALL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE RELATED TO THIS TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT DESIGN DIFFERENCES WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON HOW WELL IT WORKED FOR THEM. SO AFTER THAT, WE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH A R THE CUSTOMERS THAT WERE DEPLOYING THE TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGNED RESPONSIBLE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE THANES THAT HELPED THEM BEST DEPLOY THE TECHNOLOGY IN A WAY THAT AWE LOSS IT TO WORK WELL FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BUILDINGS SO THEY CAN HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH IT AS WELL. AND REALLY HELP EVERYONE ACHIEVE WHAT ACHIEVE WHAT THEY WANTED TO ACHIEVEMENT. SO WE HAVE THE GUIDELINES AS WELL AS ALL SORTS OF INFORMATION TO HELP YOU GET THE BEST ACCURACY AND THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE SYSTEM. SO FUTURE CUSTOMERS CAN BENEFIT AS WELL. SO THING IS JUST A GREAT EXAMPLE HOW IF YOU START WITH THE THINKING AT THE BEGINNING OF DEVELOPING THE PRODUCT, IT CAN JUST SHINE THROUGHOUT THE PRODUCT AND YOU WILL LIFE CYCLE AND YOU WILL END WITH UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS A BETTER PRODUCT AND BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR CUSTOMERS TO USE.  AND HOW CAN I. T. PROFESSIONALS CREATE A CULTURE OF RESPONSIBLE INKNOW EVACUATION IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THEY SUPPORT? THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. AND CULTURE IS JUST CRITICAL TO THINK ABOUT RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. IT'S IMPORTANT TO BUILD THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT. AND CREATING A CULTURE INVOLVES AN INTENTIONAL PROCESS OF INQUIRY. IT'S GUIDED BY PRINCIPLES. INFORMED BY HUMAN VALUES. AND AS I. T. PROFESSIONALS, YOU NEED TO THINK THROUGH HOW YOUR COMPANY'S VALUES AND PRINCIPLES SHOW UP IN THE CODE THAT'S DEVELOPED AND PRODUCED. AND YOU ARE THE GATE KEEPERS AND YOU SET THE FOUNDATION FOR HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT PROBLEM, HOW THEY ANTICIPATE THE WAYS IN WHICH TECHNOLOGY MIGHT BE USED AND THE WAY THE CONSIDERATIONS MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE MODEL ANDS THE CODE THAT GO O OUT THE DOOR SO PEOPLE WILL LOOK TO YOU FOR EXAMPLE, TOOL, BEST PRACTICES. SO YOU WILL WANT TO START ASSEMBLING THE GUIDELINES AS WELL AS CREATE MECHANISMS FOR PEOPLE TO AND QUESTIONS AND RAISE CONCERNS AND WORK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE HARD PROBLEMS. AND ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS TO THINK ABOUT YOUR ML OPS AS SETTING THE ENGINEERING CULTURE AND PRACTICING INTO SOMETHING CONCRETES. IT SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENT ROLES NEEDED TO RESPONSIBLY DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY IF DATA SCIENTISTS TO ENGINEER, DESIGNER, RESEARCHER, PEOPLE COLLECTING DATA. AND YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING ON YOUR CORPORATE POLICIES. SO WE KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, IN PRACTICE, MODELS, THEY CAN BREAK WHEN THEY'RE DEPLOYED IN THE REAL WORLD. WE KNOW MODELS SOMETIMES FAIL TO ADAPT TO CHANGES IN THE DYNAMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT. SO YOU HAVE TO THINK THROUGH HOW YOUR SYSTEM WILL HANDLE THE DYNAMICS AND BE ABLE TO CREATE THE RIGHT SORT OF CHECK POINTS TO MITIGATE IMPACT AND HARM. SO YOU KNOW, AI IS JUST ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IS WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IN THIS MOMENT, BUT IF YOU WERE TO ZOOM OUT, WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS A HOLE USIC VIEW OF RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION. AND WE CARE ABOUT THIS HOLISTIC PICTURE. WE ARE BILLING THE TOOLS TO HELP YOU. WE ARE CONTINUING TO SHARE OUR LEARNINGS AND BEST PRACTICES FOR YOU TO LEVERAGE AND WE ARE PARTNERS WITH YOU ON THIS JOURNEY. SO ERIC, PEOPLE WANT TO LEARN MORE. WHAT RESOURCES DO WE HAVE FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ETHICAL USE OF AI?  ABSOLUTELY. SO JUST TODAY, I PUBLISHED A BLOG IN THE AZURE AI BLOG ABOUT HOW YOU CAN BUILD POWERFUL RESPONSIBLE SYSTEMS ON TOP OF AZURE. YOU CAN FIND THAT OR GO TO THE MICROSOFT RESPONSIBLE AI RESOURCE CENTER.  AND AS AN ADDED BONUS, THIS SESSION AND OTHER SESSIONS CIRCLE AROUND AI ARE ALL RECORDED AND MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU. YOU CAN GO TO SESSIONS SCHEDULE RIGHT NOW. AND ACTUALLY PULL UP THE SESSION ON AI AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH THIS. SO NEXT UP, WE'RE GOING TO HAND IT BACK TO DISCUSS THE NEXT STEPS IN GROWING YOUR I. T. CAREER. OVER TO YOU. THANKS, ANTHONY. I LOVE SEEING EVERYONE TALK ABOUT RESPONSIBLE AI. THAT WAS A FANTASTIC CONVERSATION. I HOPE EVERYBODY CHECKS OUT THE BLOG AND THE RESOURCES THAT THEY WERE SHARING. WE'VE GOT MORE NOW ON ACCELERATING WILL KNOW HOW SMART YOU ARE. AND
