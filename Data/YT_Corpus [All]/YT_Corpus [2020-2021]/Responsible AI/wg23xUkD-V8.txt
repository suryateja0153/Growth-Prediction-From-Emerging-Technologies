 1 00:00:00,000 -- 00:00:02,100  Hello, I'm Tyler Brandon, and I'm one of the founding members 2 00:00:02,100 -- 00:00:04,740  of Speak Ai. I want to share something very interesting with 3 00:00:04,740 -- 00:00:07,560  you today, which is this idea of the quantified self. And because 4 00:00:07,560 -- 00:00:10,410  of technologies, we're now able to gain self knowledge through 5 00:00:10,410 -- 00:00:13,770  number or apply the scientific method that was only in science 6 00:00:13,770 -- 00:00:16,050  and business and actually use that in both our personal and 7 00:00:16,050 -- 00:00:19,020  professional lives. And this is very important right now, 8 00:00:19,020 -- 00:00:20,730  because we're seeing a significant problem. And one of 9 00:00:20,730 -- 00:00:24,180  that is a ton of what they call dark data, which is being lost. 10 00:00:24,180 -- 00:00:26,220  And a lot of this is looked at through the lens of business. 11 00:00:26,370 -- 00:00:29,280  But the same thing happens with our own personal lives. And what 12 00:00:29,280 -- 00:00:31,830  insights are we actually missing out when we don't capture 13 00:00:31,890 -- 00:00:34,710  communication, which is one of the most crucial elements of our 14 00:00:34,710 -- 00:00:38,460  success? And then adding on that is this idea of productivity. 15 00:00:38,670 -- 00:00:41,640  And what we're seeing is rising cost of anxiety. And what we're 16 00:00:41,640 -- 00:00:44,130  seeing here is the connection between well being, and then the 17 00:00:44,130 -- 00:00:46,920  quality and quantity of the work that you do. And this is 18 00:00:46,920 -- 00:00:49,830  something very personal to myself, I went through this own 19 00:00:49,860 -- 00:00:53,340  journey. This is me, I was at one point 280 pounds. And this 20 00:00:53,340 -- 00:00:56,580  is sort of it charted out in life. And what I realized if I 21 00:00:56,580 -- 00:00:59,520  had had a system to monitor myself, the way that I was 22 00:00:59,520 -- 00:01:02,790  communicating, I could have got pre warning sign or signals, and 23 00:01:02,790 -- 00:01:05,940  course corrected either to avoid a downward spiral, or actually 24 00:01:05,940 -- 00:01:09,720  continue to foster growth on the, on the positive path that I 25 00:01:09,720 -- 00:01:13,230  was on. And there's so many technologies and tools for 26 00:01:13,230 -- 00:01:17,280  quantified self. But we really saw this gap in communication. 27 00:01:17,610 -- 00:01:19,950  And so that's what we're focusing on at Speak Ai. And to 28 00:01:19,950 -- 00:01:24,210  do that it's technology, techniques and community that 29 00:01:24,210 -- 00:01:26,790  helps us extract these insights from where these crucial 30 00:01:26,850 -- 00:01:30,180  communication is actually happening. And that's both with 31 00:01:30,390 -- 00:01:32,820  other people, but then also the communication we're having with 32 00:01:32,820 -- 00:01:35,370  ourselves, the internal dialogue that's running through our head 33 00:01:35,610 -- 00:01:38,460  at all times. We're very passionate about this, our team 34 00:01:38,460 -- 00:01:41,490  is continuing to grow. If you'd like to contribute, here's some 35 00:01:41,490 -- 00:01:45,060  ways to actually do it. And very appreciative that you took a 36 00:01:45,060 -- 00:01:47,610  couple minutes to learn more. Think about the way that you're 37 00:01:47,610 -- 00:01:50,010  communicating and what you can learn from yourself. And by 38 00:01:50,010 -- 00:01:53,580  monitoring, by analyzing you can unlock potential in your life 39 00:01:53,580 -- 00:01:56,220  that you just never thought possible, both personally and 40  00:01:56,220 -- 00:01:57,540 professionally. Thank you.
