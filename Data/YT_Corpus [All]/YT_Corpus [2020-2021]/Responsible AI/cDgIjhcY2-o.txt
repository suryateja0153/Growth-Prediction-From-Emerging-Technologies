 My passion lies at the intersection of  artificial intelligence and humanity. Lately I've been using the term algorithmic  systems more and more because the system respects the fact that  this is not just a technology, it is used in context of society and that's where the humanity comes in. sometimes they're as basic as what  I call Data Science 101. What is the kind of data you're using?  Where does it come from? Is it accurately reflecting what you're  trying to measure? Have people been informed, have  they given consent? I think a lot of folks who are maybe more  mathematical, quantitative and analytical, especially when we think about  the creation of smart cities, the digitization of our government infrastructure. Somebody steals your password, you can  change your password, you can't change your fingerprint,  you can't change your iris scan. So it's absolutely necessary for these  groups to collaborate and work together. If we are to create the kind of citizen accountable  systems that improve humanity. Often the value proposition of building technology  is efficiency or income, right? So I think the best way to prevent the  creation of technology that in retrospect was something we  shouldn't have built, is addressing the fact that but values that are based on humanity  and human flourishing.
