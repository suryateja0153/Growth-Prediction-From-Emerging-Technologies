 so we're at this inflection point so we're at this inflection point suddenly all of this data these suddenly all of this data these suddenly all of this data these algorithms and the computational power algorithms and the computational power algorithms and the computational power is available things are becoming real is available things are becoming real is available things are becoming real that we've talked about you dreamt about that we've talked about you dreamt about that we've talked about you dreamt about for decades we must develop responsible for decades we must develop responsible for decades we must develop responsible and safe practices before the power gets and safe practices before the power gets and safe practices before the power gets too unmanageable for us to control too unmanageable for us to control too unmanageable for us to control [Music] [Music] [Music] artificial intelligence uses a massive artificial intelligence uses a massive artificial intelligence uses a massive amount of data to recognize certain amount of data to recognize certain amount of data to recognize certain kinds of patterns that are correlated kinds of patterns that are correlated kinds of patterns that are correlated with a successful result hidden in these with a successful result hidden in these with a successful result hidden in these vast pools of data we're now using vast pools of data we're now using vast pools of data we're now using remarkable opportunities to run off the remarkable opportunities to run off the remarkable opportunities to run off the rails data can be bad because it has rails data can be bad because it has rails data can be bad because it has baked into it baked into it baked into it certain human biases that are naturally certain human biases that are naturally certain human biases that are naturally a part of society our biases we get not a part of society our biases we get not a part of society our biases we get not only embedded in this one program but only embedded in this one program but only embedded in this one program but get scaled out rapidly what I see is a get scaled out rapidly what I see is a get scaled out rapidly what I see is a generation that takes all kinds of life generation that takes all kinds of life generation that takes all kinds of life instructions from its device from an instructions from its device from an instructions from its device from an algorithm that you know nothing about algorithm that you know nothing about algorithm that you know nothing about who's behind that screen who's on the who's behind that screen who's on the who's behind that screen who's on the other end the wire if you want the other end the wire if you want the other end the wire if you want the machine to behave in an ethical manner machine to behave in an ethical manner machine to behave in an ethical manner you have to know why it does what it you have to know why it does what it you have to know why it does what it does whose responsibility is it is it whose responsibility is it is it corporations government is it society corporations government is it society corporations government is it society and it's really all of us the new and it's really all of us the new and it's really all of us the new Manhattan Project is not AI development Manhattan Project is not AI development Manhattan Project is not AI development the new Manhattan Project is AI safety the new Manhattan Project is AI safety the new Manhattan Project is AI safety it will be human choices that will it will be human choices that will it will be human choices that will determine where we go with this determine where we go with this determine where we go with this technology that means that the choices technology that means that the choices technology that means that the choices aren't made for us about how to manage aren't made for us about how to manage aren't made for us about how to manage the new power that these technologies the new power that these technologies the new power that these technologies give us
