 There shouldn't be anybody that's practicing artificial intelligence that isn't treating it as human intelligence. Every company today every Fortune 100 Fortune 2000 has an Ethics Officer that's responsible for the human ethics. I think it's a result of migration. Two years ago, every executive was focused on the big circle. 100% about what's my platform? What does this mean? So they focused on AI is a platform issue. Today we've seen a complete change. That platform... that hundred percent part of that circle that overlaps is now only about 15 percent. Most executives say if you're in a Microsoft shop, you're using Microsoft Azure platform. For an IBM shop, Watson is your platform. So platform decisions has fundamentally been taken over by the corporate infrastructure. 35% goes now into well what is AI? Well mostly it's centered around training on data. We'll talk about that a little bit later on. That's about thirty five percent which is around creation. What's the remaining 50 percent? It's about governance. How do we keep ourselves out of control and constantly move our AI towards helping customers. It's about governance and ethics. We see that movement from platforms into that other circle lagging but more more companies are going...you're right, if I have a chief ethicist that's responsible for all of our ethical behavior, making sure that we're compliant, if I'm turning over those decisions to something artificial, I need to make sure that they're done the same way.
