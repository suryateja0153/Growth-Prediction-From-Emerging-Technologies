 what are the potential impacts of AI on society and the environment and what is meant by eco socially responsible AI systems well stick around and you'll find out all right before we dive in be sure to subscribe to this channel if you haven't already that will help you keep up to date with all things data and analytics so there's a nonprofit organization called the Montreal AI ethics Institute that recently published a paper called secure a social and environmental certificate for AI systems check out the description below for the link to the actual paper the paper focuses on the fact that AI will have a significant and unsustainable impact on the environment and society and a framework should be developed to minimize that impact in an eco socially responsible way the framework proposed by the Institute consists of four pillars they are compute efficient machine learning federated learning data sovereignty and Lee desk certificate before diving into these pillars let's discuss what these impacts are exactly so many AI algorithms can have a tremendous carbon footprint and that's due to the excessive data compute and power requirements needed to train certain AI models that perform well and what that means is potentially a lot of carbon dioxide emissions also training many AI models can require very specialized and expensive equipment which makes it inaccessible to most and further there are many labor issues potentially around the preparation of the data used to train these algorithms and there's a general lack of diversity in the field as well lastly and very importantly AI and the data that powers it also raises a lot of questions and potential issues around data security data privacy and so on to minimize the impact the secure framework proposes the four pillars that we mentioned earlier and in plain English they are meant to make compute resources more efficient accessible and cheaper so that a wider range of people can learn about and develop AI models training use models on devices instead of a centralized method like cloud for example which reduces the risk of things like data breaches potential privacy issues and ultimately impacts people's trust give ownership of data to people so that they can decide how their data is used when it's used and why it's used ultimately by either giving or taking away consent promote getting certification that ensures environmentally sensible and responsible AI so another thing that's brought up that's really interesting is this idea of a single metric to measure sort of the performance of the model and also the considerations and trade-offs that should be taken into account so for example normally when training a model oftentimes people think in terms of accuracy for performance so say you're creating a predictive model you want your you know predictions to be almost a hundred percent accurate if you can now most the time that's impossible and certainly a model that only predicts well forty percent of the time isn't very good but still it's this idea that you're focusing on this one single metric but that metric doesn't really take into account all these other things that we've talked about in this video around the impacts potentially on the environment society the carbon footprint how much data and labour is required to create the data how complex the models are and what the impacts of that complexity is and so on and so it's a really interesting thing to consider you know how how do we kind of move more into a direction where we come up with a single metric that may take into account many more factors like some of these factors we're talking about today the secure framework is a really interesting approach and it's great to see organizations like the montreal AI ethics Institute leaving the charge and they're not alone another organization called Responsible AI has developed this thing that they call responsible AI licences or rail for short this is another sort of approach to deal with and handle the same sorts of sort of ethical issues responsible use of AI minimize the impact and so on and so forth so this is a really interesting area that's very important and it'll be interesting to see you know how things evolve with these initiatives and organizations over its so again if you haven't subscribed already now is a great time to do so if you like this video be sure to click the like button and share it with others and thanks for stopping by I'll see you in the next video
