 hi everyone i'm michael baldwin i lead financial services product management for google cloud with me today is my colleague tom shane also a financial services product manager thanks for joining us tom and i both spend our days thinking about how we can help financial institutions transform their businesses with artificial intelligence and machine learning today we'll be sharing with you an overview of some of the major areas where we see this transformation happening and how google cloud can help we know that business transformation is top of mind for many of our financial services customers however these are challenging times with financial services institutions navigating the pandemic interest rates are an all-time low customer expectations are changing with the shift to digital for example digital banking has increased from 63 in 2019 to 72 percent today regulatory requirements of are evolving and compliance costs are increasing also the financial services industry as a whole is facing new and creative types of fraud for example the dollar value of attempted fraudulent transactions grew 35 in april year over year and finally with the move to digital disruption is accelerating for instance the pandemic drove a 72 increase in the use of fintech apps in europe today we'll cover three areas where we see ai helping to unlock business transformation in financial services first ai can help reimagine the customer experience to deliver things such as personalized digital banking contact centers with ai-powered virtual agents and smoother custer customer experiences for traditionally paper intensive processes like lending second financial institutions are looking for ways to use data and analytics to transform how they detect and manage risk and finally financial institutions ask us for a best-in-class ai platform that is flexible secure and compliant that empowers them to build their own ai-powered solutions to solve their most critical business problems as we talk about through examples of ai powered transformation and financial services you'll see that ai isn't a science experiment it's being used to solve real-world problems across banking capital markets insurance and payments the key thing for us is working with our customer customers to identify their top business problems then figuring out how ai can be most helpful for them in solving for their key needs and ultimately our goal is to make it as easy as possible to deploy these solutions in real-world end-to-end workflows deloitte recently surveyed over 2 700 global i.t and line of business executives to obtain a global view of how organizations are adopting benefiting from and managing ai technologies and as you can see from this recent deloitte survey shown here on the slide 81 of customers are reporting payback on their ai in less than two years when ai is absorbed in this way it can lead to true business transformation so first let's talk about how artificial intelligence can help transform the customer experience customer experience is obviously a broad area let's talk through a few examples of what this can mean many financial institutions today struggle to get a single view of the customer sometimes known as customer 360. with the continued shift from physical branches to digital financial institutions are looking for new ways to deliver high quality and helpful experiences across all of their customer touch points lighting up omni-channel operations across web mobile contact centers physical branches and atms when it comes to acquiring new customers financial institutions want to onboard in days not weeks and are looking to use ai powered intelligence to help retain those customers finally as customer 360 becomes a reality will be able to enable ai powered experiences to sell the right product to the right customer at the right time and also drive other personalized insights to help with customer retention and new business acquisition our contact center ai solution is one example of how ai is helping reimagine the customer experience first let me share a quick overview of our of our contact center ai solution the goal of contact center ai is to deliver exceptional customer service and increase operational efficiency using artificial intelligence it enables virtual agents to converse naturally with customers and expertly assist human agents on complex cases it does this through a set of underlying powerful features for example dialog flow which automates basic chat and voice interactions a feature called agent assist which makes human agents more effective and insights which unlocks insights about call drivers and customer service interactions customer support is particularly relevant in financial services as financial institutions have seen a thousand percent increase in call volume since the onset of the pandemic customers are calling in with questions like are branches still open can i defer loan payments are you waiving any fees right now and of course security is paramount in financial services so our teams are hard at work making sure that we have bank level security built into this product next i want to share how we're working to make lending more operationally efficient and create smoother customer experiences our lending document ai alpha is built on top of our document ai technology document ai helps organizations unlock insights from their mountains of documents using artificial intelligence by turning unstructured data into structured data which means you can now actually understand and utilize it with mortgage rates low there's a surge in mortgage applications this solution provides a bundle of specialized models focused on specific document types used in lending and with this solution we're able to work with lenders to quickly onboard customers and speed up the processing of paper-intensive mortgage applications also when the us congress authorized the paycheck protection program as part of the pandemic relief package we made the same technology available to help with the processing of ppp loans next let's talk about insurance dealing with a car accident can be a major headache for the automobile owner in a time-consuming process for the insurer we worked with usaa an insurer and a google partner mitchell to build ml models that analyze images of cars that have been in accidents and make damaged parts estimates this in turn can be converted into an estimate of costs needed to repair the car saving appraiser's time and leading to a smoother customer experience now i'm going to hand things over to tom shane my colleague and fellow product manager for financial services who will walk us through how ai is driving business transformation and risk management and also we'll share an overview of how our ai platform is being used by developers and data scientists inside financial institutions to deliver on their top business priorities over to you tom thanks michael when google cloud thinks about how we can help apply ai and ml to transform financial services in the risk management space we typically think about four key things first is mitigating risks across channels and digital experiences as michael said financial institutions are increasingly looking to move to a digital first posture in the post-covet environment that provides great benefits from a customer experience perspective but it does open up new vectors of risk and potential fraud for example rising scams in the retail banking segment second moving to holistic and contextual analysis by holistic we mean extracting signals from traditional structured data sources but also combining that with insights from unstructured data to form one holistic or customer 360 view that allows financial services organizations to contextually analyze customers and events and detect true anomalies or risks that need to be reviewed from normal behavior for that customer or event third thinking about how to dynamically and rapidly respond to changing risk types for example changing macroeconomic and market conditions or new fraud types in the postcovid world and finally being able to offer that worry-free and seamless customer experience customers want to know that the risk management systems that are operating in the background are keeping their accounts and assets safe but they don't want those systems to inappropriately impact their customer experience for example a false positive alert on a fraud transaction next i want to talk about a customer who's working to help transform their risk management processes hsbc is working with google cloud to leverage the latest in machine learning to dynamically assess potential financial crime risk and holistically look at customers hsbc is bringing their extensive knowledge of combating financial crime which combined with google's expertise in developing ml solutions is already leading to encouraging results in this area you may have heard from our ceo thomas curion's keynote the google cloud is focused on building up digital transformation solutions powered by google's ai in risk management we're focused on giving you a preview of two of those solutions today the first is annie money laundering or aml and the second is know your customer or kyc i want to talk about some of the challenges and opportunities in each of these areas when our customers ask us about aml they often talk about challenges around the current rule-based system in that sophisticated bad actors can sometimes get around these systems leading to potential missed money laundering events and these system often lead to many false positives on the data side we also hear challenges about poor data quality and the lack of that holistic or customer 360 view to inform their aml efforts and finally we hear that all of these false positives are creating heavy amounts of manual work which is taking away from higher value opportunities in terms of opportunities for innovation google cloud can help extract insights from data and apply ai and ml technologies to better detect and prevent and identify those real money laundering events and then help organizations operate more efficiently by reducing false positives as well as providing more insights in the alert review process know your customer or kyc is another area that financial institutions often ask us about we hear challenges such as manual processes around looking at documents and combining that with other information we hear how this sometimes impacts the customer onboarding process either delaying it or leading to excessive outreach to customers to collect information and finally we hear about challenges of integrating all this information into banks overall systems we think there's three key opportunities to help improve this process the first is helping in the automation part by automation we mean looking at all of the documents received in the kyc process and automatically extracting insights entities and information from these documents and putting them into downstream processes we also think there's an opportunity to move to a rapid and digital onboarding process especially important in the post-covet environment and finally we think extracting insights from these documents can help better identify potential risk sooner as well as inform financial services organizations overall customer 360 efforts next i want to turn to the capital market space and b and y melon it was using machine learning to help predict treasury settlement failures the treasury market is one of the largest and most liquid in the world however one to two percent of transactions fail every day which equates to about 70 billion dollars so bny melon is leveraging google cloud to develop end-to-end pipelines to better predict when these settlements might fail this has allowed b y melon to get in front of these potential failures and out mitigate them before the daily cutoff outside of solutions in the customer experience and risk management space we also know financial institutions want to build their own ai and ml models for a range of different use cases and business problems so at google cloud we're focused on building and deploying a flexible platform to allow financial services organizations to build out these models and this is based on google's learnings running large-scale ml systems we believe that responsible ai equals successful ai when we at google think about responsible ai we typically think about four key pillars the first is robustness and that's making sure results stay robust over time the second is ensuring that these systems are understandable the third is considering the fairness implications of these systems and the fourth is incorporating security by design to keep both the data and the assets secure throughout the entire model life cycle in terms of robustness at google we've found that transitioning to end-to-end machine learning pipelines greatly helps in this way we see that an ml system is much more than just a model it's about consistently extracting and validating data ensuring the data distributions don't shift over time it's about applying the right features and the right model to the problem training the model evaluating the results and ultimately deploying it to production a common failure mode that we often hear from our customers is a great model that works well in development but can't transition to production or doesn't replicate results in production so we've introduced ai platform pipelines which is coming soon to help with this problem ai platform pipelines is integrated with other gcp native services such as our data warehouse bigquery and our ai serverless training platform we know that financial institutions are also focused on making sure ml systems are understandable we know that this is key in financial services for a couple key reasons the first being that these systems often underpin high value business problems where the results need to be robust and they need to be understandable third these systems often interact with humans whether it's in a model governance approval process or in downstream processes such as an analyst reviewing a fraud alert and finally we know these models need to meet regulatory obligations so google has built our explainable ai solution based on google's experience understanding interpreting ml systems this solution provides feature attributions to say which attributes or features are most predictive of any given prediction in this hypothetical example that you see in the lower right hand corner you can see that the amount feature or attribute is most predictive of this particular prediction google is also very committed to ai and ml fairness we've released our ai principles which govern applications in which google applies its ai and ml technology and we've also released a fairness tool kit and i want to highlight a couple components of it first is the what if tool which allows organizations to dynamically dissect their data and results the second is fairness indicators which allows organizations to provide categories and then slice different fairness performance metrics by those categories to evaluate differences across groups and finally i want to talk about our responsible ai practices which provide guidelines to organizations implementing these systems next i want to talk about security and how google cloud we're incorporating this by design in our ai platform and solutions we know security is absolutely table stakes for financial services organization so we're focused on a couple areas the first is preventing data exfiltration with our vpc service controls and ensuring no external internet access the second is providing choice so customers can use their own encryption keys to encrypt and decrypt data and customers can choose where data processing happens and where their data is stored in terms of data residency and finally always ensuring authorized and appropriate access to that data through fine grain identity and access management controls as well as our access transparency logs finally i want to turn to a customer who's using google cloud's ai and ml infrastructure two sigma has moved some of their deep learning research to the cloud in large part to leverage the latest in aiml infrastructure they're using google cloud's tensor processing units or tpus which are purpose-built chips by google for machine learning training and inference and you can see when two sigma moved their tensorflow workloads to tpus they saw a boost in productivity which allows them to spend less time worrying about managing their ai and ml systems and more time crafting results in summary google cloud is focused on providing data-powered innovation in financial services we're building out ai-powered solutions in customer experience and risk management for financial services organizations and we're also focused on enabling a digital platform to allow financial services organizations to build and deploy their own ai and ml solutions in a way that meets their requirements we look forward to meeting you and working with you to help transform the future of financial services if you're interested in learning more please follow the url on this slide thank you so much for taking time out of your day and again we look forward to working with you
