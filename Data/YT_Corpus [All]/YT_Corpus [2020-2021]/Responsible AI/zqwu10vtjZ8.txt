 hi guys welcome to tech city inside I'm Shelly Williams and today we'll be discussing Microsoft's AI for good initiative and I have here with me a lawyer and Microsoft's government affairs lead for Middle East and Africa mr. Mike here thank you for joining thank you yes so um before we go into Microsoft's AI for good initiative I like us to discuss a little bit on AI I mean such an exciting and you know interesting phenomenon that we hear all around the world today um it's been tagged as a main driver of the fourth Industrial Revolution so it's not powerful to improve lives and impact on economies what do you think is responsible for this drive I think a number of things that have happened recently the most important are two factors I would say one is just the increase in computing power and so over time computers have gotten just more and more powerful and you see this of the basic Internet of Things devices they're connected they're able to collect all sorts of data and that's the second point which is that today we have more and more data and so this combination of compute power and data has now allowed us to move into the fourth Industrial Revolution and empower things like artificial intelligence where we can piece together machines can learn facial recognition is actually a great example of how over time machines can understand complex patterns and teach itself how to recognize some of those patterns with greater accuracy yeah so as a government affairs lead for Middle East and Africa obviously we did some work in Africa what would what do you think the impact of AI is on many African economies developing economies yeah I I think we're in the very early stages many people have talked about this decade as the decade of digital transformation and it's really a transformation that began at the beginning of the decade so now almost nine years ago what we're seeing now is really the digitization of everything and I think we expect that artificial intelligence will drive a lot of the future innovation I think for Africa it's it's also a really interesting opportunity and Microsoft we talk about the power of hyper scale cloud and we talk about its ability to democratize technology and what that means essentially is we've we've built a global cloud service but that means that a developer in Lagos can access the same advanced technologies artificial intelligence services that we provide to developers in Silicon Valley in Seattle in London and Tel Aviv and so I think that's going to be a huge opportunity for Africa where anyone once they're connected to the Internet can access the most innovative technology at a very cost-effective price develop apps and arguably then sell it into a global market yeah so I mean I seems really exciting whenever I now hear of it and I think what is more exciting is that Africa seems to have the markets to drive AI and what I mean by that is that if you look at the statistics of the median age in Africa it's around nineteen point five plus a median age and compared with countries like Germany the US and China who have the median ages at 40 between 30-something and 40 something so I mean juxtaposing that's with Africa's demographic boom and how disruptive AI is to be what would you say is the application of AI within social and economic context in Africa yeah it's we see a great opportunity recently we've made a number of investments in Nigeria specifically we've opened up an African Development Center but we also have worked with another company to bring in a lot of our customer service and support teams into Nigeria and that reflects just the talent that we see in the market the other thing that will be interesting I think is how do governments in Africa create and really encourage tech startups because I think that's that's really the power once you have access to the the massive hyperscale cloud services then how do you get people experimenting building solutions trying different things and ultimately I think those are going to be the growth drivers for for the continent yes speaking about empowering startups Microsoft's AI for good initiative is doing something about empowering people towards taking sustainable actions towards a more accessible in a world in layman terms for people who have never heard about AI Microsoft's AI for good initiative what is Microsoft's AI for good initiative it so it's a program that's pretty new but at the same time I would say its origins and some ways aren't that surprising so Microsoft we've always had a philanthropies team and as part of that we've we've tried to make software available in the past to nonprofits to other companies that are trying to do charitable goods or trying to help create a societal benefit and so what we've done now filed services we've taken that same concept and we've we've given cloud credits but we've also taken it one step further and so we're trying to help and really fund companies or people with ideas in terms of how they can use cloud services to really transform and solve ideally global issues and so AI for good is a program today that has four pillars for us there's AI for Earth which is really about sustainability and for accessibility and there's actually a great example there that's available on YouTube right now which is called seeing AI so we've essentially created an app now that you can put under smartphone and you use the camera to read a business card for example and it will read it out loud to somebody who is blind or sighted impaired right so that's an example of some of the solutions we're piloting the two other ones are AI for humanitarian action and then AI for cultural heritage so I mean I'm working me through this different pillars of AI and I want to know the idea inspiration behind it because it was same as Microsoft wants to be B should I say the one-stop place for AI basically so could you work me through the interconnectedness of you know the four pillars of AI for good initiative yeah I think those are four pillars that we feel we're cloud and AI in particular have the potential to really transform and bring real change to people right and so if you think about AI for Earth the most common solution that we've seen today there's really going to take a massive amounts of data and so you think about conservation in Africa right historically if you think about how we protect animals and you know that those that are nearing extinction and and how to protect them from poaching that's largely done manually today and so the idea now is to figure out how do you take say drones and to be able to scan an area use AI to identify where the animals are the type of animals and to be able to record that right and so again it's taking massive amounts of data combining it with computing power to create pragmatic solutions and guidance for people who are on the ground so they understand alright this this is where the animals are these are their patents this is where they will go this is where we need to be in order to protect them and so I think with all four of these pillars the main thing we're looking for is areas again where massive data and compute can bring real pragmatic and day-to-day change I think the other idea and origin for AI for good is to figure out how do we use us as in some ways a proof of concept right AI is still such a new technology but if we can encourage people to start experimenting and building solutions in some ways we can we can create a model and help demonstrate how other people can be using AI and hopefully spur an ecosystem where there are more and more solutions especially in these four areas yeah great seems like a very interesting and initiative and I'd like to know the opportunities for people in Africa for the AI for good initiative I mean you're speaking about encouraging people and like I mentioned you know Africa is that place that would like to get involved in you know issues of AI and things like that so what are the opportunities for people in Africa for the AI for good initiative so our programs are open to everyone they there's an application process and I think it continues to change so the deadlines may evolve but the latest information will be on our website you know in general I would say though the idea is to come up with solutions that again take massive amounts of data combine it with compute power using hyper scale cloud services right and you show how you can make a tangible impact even if it's a simple impact or simple story I think those are the ones we want to show the conservation one is a great example right it's it's not not too sophisticated but it's something that no one's been able to do before and now we've created a record for Rangers for others that they can better use to do their jobs okay so you follow breaking it down just so that people watching can understand what this is about I would use myself as an example if I wanted to be part of the iPhone and Microsoft's AF for good initiative what exactly do I have to do if I'm passionate about Wildlife and Earth what do I have to do do I have to take recordings and then upload it to certain site my guess is it's largely a largely lean on a proposal right now and so the idea is to write up how you see what what what is the problem that needs to be solved what are the issues and ideas for solving it and then how does that pull in AI right so how can a I be a factor in that and all of these are things that we're looking for people to do it it's not massive amounts of custome I work or anything but the idea is how do you take simple data points use our commercially available services right so again these are the same services that anyone can get access to with an internet connection and then build a solution or an app and and then and then prove that concept and the idea is with our grants is that would provide funding for people to actually get that done and the other thing is even figure out how to submit ideas right as a even if people don't fully understand the technology or what needs to be done to to create a final solution those are areas where we can help but what we really value from your viewers and from people across the continent will be getting the ideas for things where you see pragmatic solutions to real problems yeah interesting bringing it back to Africa now what do you see the AI initiative a I forbid initiative achieve in Africa in the next five years technological predictions and all of that yeah so I I want to encourage people to think big right so when I think about Africa I would say take your biggest problems and then figure out alright how can we take small steps using data or or the technology to find solutions right and so when I when I look across the continent as you've indicated I mean one of the one of the big issues is already is just it's one of the advantages is youth but I think one of the challenges is also employment for everyone right and so again that could be another area where you think about how to use AI to match people with opportunities and to create a create a system right where you can that drive a more efficient workforce agriculture is when we talked about conservation is another one right I think all these are really interesting issues I think about drought is there something I can do with drought and then looking at sensors and so that's what that's I don't want to suggest I know all the answers but hopefully this is where I think we really lean on the ideas of the people right to come up with you know just different ways of thinking about how to deal with some of these issues you know we were talking earlier today of my colleagues is about traffic in Lagos and how it's gotten worse in theory there's there's there there's going to be an AI solution for that right yeah how do you think about again creating data points smart highways and helping manage traffic more efficiently and better and ideally maybe even driving people to more car sharing and other models right I think that's something legations definitely look forward to a traffic situation thank you so much for talking with us on tech city insights thanks very much all right guys that's it on tech city insights that was
