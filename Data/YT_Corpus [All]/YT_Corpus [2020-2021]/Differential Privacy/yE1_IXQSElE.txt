 Hi I’m Elisabet Lobo, and this is an overview of our work to be presented in Security and Privacy Differential Preivacy is used to report statistical analyses from sensitive data To protect the privacy of the data subjects, this technique adds some calibrated noise to the statistics before their publication This will of course introduce some errors on the results that, we as analyst, will like to keep an eye on to determine the accuracy or utility of the analyses Data aggregations are very common when constructing statistical analyses But usually, estimating the error of the final results boils down to adding the errors of the components In this work, we took a completely different approach and we were able to obtain tighter error bounds in a programmatic way In a nutshell, we use information flow control techniques to track statistical independence of the analyses We this extra information we are able to compute tighter error bounds, that will allow us to perform more data aggregations If you want to know more about this work, we invite you to check our extended talk
