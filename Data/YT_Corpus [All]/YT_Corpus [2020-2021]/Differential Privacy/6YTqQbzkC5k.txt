 The Rowhammer bug is a reliability issue in DRAM that enables attackers to flip bits in neighboring rows on the DRAM module. By repeatedly hammering aggressor rows, Rowhammer can effectively write to the victim row, thereby modifying protected memory. This has been used to obtain root privileges, perform sandbox escapes, and even fault cryptographic protocols. In contrast to prior works, which target integrity, we show how to use Rowhammer to read bits from memory, directly breaching confidentiality. This is possible because Rowhammer is data dependent, meaning that a bit flip is influenced by the values above and below it. By hammering his own memory, an attacker can deduce the values of nearby bits. In our talk, we will describe how we used this effect to read bits from memory and extract keys from OpenSSH. Finally, we also show that ECC-RAM does not stop RAMBleed, which allows us to read bits despite all flips being corrected. Want to hear more? Come to our talk or visit our website.
