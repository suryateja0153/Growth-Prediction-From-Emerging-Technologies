 Xclaim: Trustless, Interoperable Cryptocurrency-backed Assets. Today, there exist over 2,000 cryptocurrencies which differ in design and purpose. It is unlikely that there will be "one chain to rule them all". For mainstream adoption, we need a way to transfer assets between systems *without* putting trust in centralized providers. We present cryptocurrency-backed assets, a new approach to cross-chain communication. The idea is simple: create on-chain assets 1:1 backed by existing cryptocurrencies... and then trade these assets efficiently, as if they were native to the platform. For example, we implement Bitcoin-backed tokens on Ethereum. XClaim ensures trustlessness and security by: cross chain state verification, collateralization, and a proactive "proof-or-punishment" verification approach. Thereby XClaim is 96% faster and 65% cheaper than traditional HTLC atomic swaps.
