 hi everyone Aaron here for ZolloTech and you may have heard recently that people are listening to Siri conversations now this is not completely tied to you specifically it's actually anonymous and it uses differential privacy to send that information anonymously but what they're doing is when you use Siri and you ask something and maybe it gets it wrong what they do is they send that information to Apple anonymously and then someone from a third party actually listens to that confirms what is said and trains the artificial intelligence using the neural network and this may or may not have been known I knew about this quite a while ago and Google does the same thing as well as Amazon with Alexa and also obviously with the Google assistant so if you want to stop that which I would recommend at this point since Apple has actually halted their third party involvement as has Google at this point but there's a way to prevent that and still use all the features without completely disabling Siri now if you want to disable Siri of course you can do that just go to settings go to your name here at the top go to iCloud and then scroll down and turn off Siri altogether if you don't want to use Siri that's the most secure way it will completely disable everything however if you want to continue using Siri you can either modify some settings let me show you that back under settings just scroll down until you get to Siri and search and under Syrian search you can turn off if you use the word Siri with the word hey in front of it to recognize your device or have your device recognize your voice and then ask it a question you can turn that off altogether and just leave it for the side button and then that will work a little bit more securely however if you want to just stop any information sending from your phone to third-party servers or anything like that there's a way to do that now you can do this yourself using the Apple configurator on a Mac it's a free app in the App Store but it is a little bit involved if you're not familiar with it and you do have to have a Mac so keep that in mind you'll need to install Apple configurator 2 on a Mac if you want to do this yourself once you have it installed go ahead and open it up and then in the upper left go to file new profile and then you'll click on restrictions on the left and click configure now what you're looking for is to disallow the server-side logging of Siri commands so you uncheck that and anything else you don't want that's why I said it's involved but then go ahead and exit it save it and then install the profile however someone has created it already it's very simple and if you're worried about the privacy of course you can create one yourself but I'll link to this profile in the description below and this profile is on github and all you do is direct link download it so you tap on the link say allow it and then it'll say profile is downloaded so we'll hit close and we'll go back to settings then we'll go back to the top it says profile downloaded however if you're not seeing that word there you can just go to general scroll to the bottom where it says profiles now we'll go ahead and tap on the profile and it says prevent server-side logging of Siri conversations let's go ahead and hit install put in our passcode and it's going to say the profile is not signed that's okay go ahead and hit install and now will prevent any information from leaving your phone when it's actually using Siri so I would recommend this for now if you care about privacy and information leaving people have actually picked up a lot of conversations they probably shouldn't have in a while it's completely anonymous it is also recognizable by your voice so it's actually using the microphone so maybe it's a celebrity or something like that they could recognize the voice and sometimes as you know Siri just activates and picks up information and it messes it shouldn't necessarily be doing that so people have picked up everything from something that isn't legal to all sorts of illicit situations as well as just regular conversations so I would highly recommend installing that profile now the good thing about all of this is that Apple has listened and they said in a future version they're actually going to put a switch to disallow the server-side information being sent as well so that'll be really nice to see in a future update but let me know your thoughts in the comments below of course you can delete that profile if you don't want it there just go to settings go back to general go down to profiles tap on the profile and hit remove it's not a big deal if you don't like it being there and of course like I said you can create your own send it to yourself and install it if you'd like but that's it let me know what you think in the comments below of course I'll link this wallpaper as I always do and if you haven't subscribed already please subscribe and hit
