 today we have the second half of our back to the new workplace post Koba 19 webinar with Professor ramesh Hrothgar and three of our MIT startups in the first session last week professor kokum and dr. dairy talked about the bigger picture of going back to work around social and policy considerations as well as employee experience we were mentioning that Co result that the technology solution is a key part for what you and your company are focused on for returning to work the good news is today we'll be delving much more into that practical technology solutions aspect with more real-life back to work scenarios let me share today's agenda with you first we're hear from Professor Roscoe speaking ANCOVA safe paths and paths check the digital compact Racing's non profit is spun out from MIT there were here from the three of our startups palbok tulip and human eyes who focus on different aspects of that returning to work solution then we're here have a panel with Professor Roscoe the startups and Jeff Dell more of FM Global representing the corporate voice that panel will be moderated by Michael shriek from MIT Sloan let's get started I've been reducing professor Hrothgar who is speaking first at the MIT Media Lab professor Roscoe's research focus is on AI imaging for health and sustainability these interfaces spend researching physical digital and global domains he has received a Lemelson Award for his groundbreaking inventions in a number of other distinguished there were awards he's worked on advising special research projects at Google Facebook and at Apple so he knows the ins and outs of these tech giants as well he has also co-founded multiple MIT startup yesterday you testify and a congressional hearing on the same topic take it away professor Bhaskar hello everyone what a pleasure to be here and thank you Rebecca last time when we spoke on this platform which is getting started and as Rebecca said we have spun out the MIT safe paths work into a non-profit foundation path check foundation so I'm going to share some slides and and walk you through some of these some of these ideas but I'm going to focus mainly on the learnings so I'm supported by Chris Christ who you know is a doctor and a software entrepreneur and also part of the path check foundation so let's talk about reopening businesses and patchak foundation is building solutions not only for public health but also for this new start for countries States and employers that are open source privacy first and interoperable the first versions were based on GPS the new versions are based on google apple bluetooth solutions and the versions of coming we have other case management and public health solutions as well just a brief summary of what we discussed last time which is on the Left we have the app that's going to the employers or citizens for students exposure notification personal guidance and on the right we have the safe places dashboard that's used for public health and businesses so it can improve the tracing conversation your contact tracing dashboards heat maps and so on and then our code base which is the largest nonprofit open source code base for Cobie 19 supports the whole range of api's GPS Bluetooth Wi-Fi QR codes and everything else and the challenge really is how do you do this in a privacy-preserving way so we have three arms the technology arm the think tank and implementations in technology we are doing the app the web tool the algorithms SDK everything is open source think tank they have interoperable standards all to work with stakeholders landscape analysis so you know check our website and implementation with Public Health and employers and Laura corporate relations so we are also delighted with that we have a fantastic alliance in fact next it will be making an announcement with some big fortune 500 companies who have joined us in in various ways there are tech players or implementation players or contributing talent or using our our sources so on so keep a watch on that for for next week some of you probably had questions about the Google Apple proximity API and the way it works is if two people Alice and Bob and let's say Bob is going to get infected at some point when Alice and Bob meet maybe they bug did not know that he's infected at some point Bob gets infected and he uploads the keys the Bluetooth keys that they have exchanged over a broadcast channel and then and then Bob uploads them to the server and at some point alice downloads on the skis to see all the keys that she has heard over the Bluetooth broadcast is the same key that she received from the server and if there's a match then she knows she was exposed by Bob so it's a pretty clean simple technology and we do the same thing for GPS we do the same thing for Wi-Fi and so on so only the infected person has to upload some information the 99.99% of the people who are not infected never have to upload anything at all and that sub privacy is maintained and if they do upload is all encrypted so when you think about the experience flow from individual from the moment they get exposure notification to the moment they might be infected is infected and have to upload the information you know it's an emotional rollercoaster for most people and so our team is made up of not just technologists but epidemiologist you know behavioral scientist legal privacy and so on and we all work together to figure out what the solution should be and we put it out in the public domain but we are very fortunate with the few million dollars of philanthropic funding so we have hard core software engineers building extremely high quality code as well so from exposure notification you come to triaging symptom checking quarantine or not test or not what 14 days after you have come out of those those conditions are not so we look at this holistic picture and again as a software company anybody can build this the challenge is how do they do this in a privacy-preserving way so all the machine learning all the encryption all the decentralization has to work without the name or email or employee ID or a national ID anything's identifiable should not be used for this process and that's why some of the MIT magic comes in so just want to make sure that when we mean by privacy it's not about the individual privacy but is also about consent it's also about regulations often you cannot share the data because of HIPAA regulations sometimes it's about trade secrets you may be an employer and you cannot share your data with insurance player or the pharma players or its national security you might have people in Singapore and Asia and Europe and is there travel across boundaries you simply cannot use the information that's kind of held by those countries in the systems and again what's incentive for an employee or citizen to participate they can just switch it off so these are all very complex issues from human behavior and your incentives that we that we work on as well so let me share with you a few learnings on on the last three months we have spent this implementing with many fortune 500 players working with many governments and we all have contracts for several US states and territories and nations so I'll be first one to admit that it's a humbling experience because we thought we can build something and it'll work it's a very complex situation and I have built many startups from my own bare hands which teams but there's nothing that matches the scale and importance of what we are doing and so we'll be very honest of what works and what doesn't doesn't work so when it comes to businesses what they're noticed is that businesses do not want to access the health care data of their employees and even location data is considered very sensitive because it's personally identifiable and without consent is out of question so that's all kinda considered invested at the same time businesses do want some control and some command and control dashboard like concept and they also want notions of Passport like who has which symptoms but they have tested an art exposures and what you are noticed is that everything that people are doing right now is is Israeli scattershot like symptom checking is very annoying because people do it for three days and the fourth day they just click random buttons to say I'm fine I'm just gonna come into work if they have already done the test you know you have to close the loop with testing facility so this tension between centralization and decentralization of employee data is a major issue and what we have been able to convince many employees employer sorry is that they should use decentralization they should not worry about capturing so much data about their employees that employees start playing games and this stop using the apps they stop using you know the pendants and the you know Bluetooth tags or UWB tags that are being sold on the market for 100 or 200 dollars it's all technology it doesn't work for you know when the human ingenuity the human laziness starts you know getting around it there's also the confusion about should we use Bluetooth R or GPS because Bluetooth the Google actual exposure notification can only be used by states and nations and not by businesses so what do you do so we're also working through those issues and then finally I would say this is this is the most important employers simply do not an employer X doesn't want to give an app to their employees saying here's an app by X our company's so download it and use it because employees exhibition large companies will not allow the infringement on their personal freedom and we have noticed this again and again so the relationships we have built with a lot of fortune 500 companies and others is that they would like us they would like path check to be almost like the lead certification or Fairtrade kind of organization it's open-source non-profit auditable so we provide the front end we take the mantle of privacy and personal freedom and security and we provide that solution to the employees and the employers then talk to our app to create the dashboards and when we upload any micro or macro aggregation of data from this app we take care of all the privacy constrain so that even the most malicious employer will not be able to reconstruct anything about the employees at the same time the workers will feel safe and the employee can create dashboards for all the policies what's working and what's not working so it's a good symbiotic relationship where path check takes care of the pesky issues of privacy personal freedom and and data protection and the employers get the benefit of of having - force and so you know here are some slides I want talking to them about them in detail but a classic business experience would have the same you know employee shows up there to do tests on the site what happens you know if there's a 24 hours to 48 hours delay or somebody was infected or not if they're infected what do you do if they are not infected what does it mean to still allow them to practice social distancing staggering schedules and so on so some of the things we are doing ourselves in past check for others we you know they're partnering with other innovators in the startups or other organizations they provide the other part of the stack and together we make an offering so that is privacy-preserving but still allows you to have this command and control structure around it and so in that sense in a safe pass is working with many stakeholders not just governments and public health but also with workers and labs and healthcare and insurance and schools and we are learning a lot and we're putting out our documents you know on a regular basis of what you're learning we just put out the document yesterday on the relationship between manual contact tracing and digital contact tracing because you know most organizations will have to set up some small stuff it could be one person or hundred people who are just call center command control and how do they interface with the apps that are out there again there is no literature on it there is no playbook on it so we're putting out our experiences and sharing it rest of the world and then on the MIT that's on the path check foundation site and at MIT we continue to do cutting-edge research in mush relearning and encryption and digital health so these are some of the papers that are on our website how do you do is Wi-Fi colocation cheapest intersection how multi-hop analysis on bluetooth how do you preserve encryption how do you do hashing how you do machine learning in presence of encryption so please take a look we're putting the papers out literally the day after we feel proud enough we put it out we don't wait for the review cycles and we submit them for review so you know we are getting out of the academic mode and making sure I focused on the goal here so when we talk about the kind of machine learning aspect of Kove 8:19 you know the classic challenge is again the debate between privacy and utility on the horizontal axis you know it's you know it progressively more privacy so anonymization when we think about three main pillars of of privacy confidentiality and nanami t and privacy right and confidentiality simply means some people can see everything and in today's world that's not just not going to work anonymity helps to a little bit but if it's an overlapping data set anonymity can also you know you can crack open anybody's identity so anonymity is we think of basically no privacy and but that's great for machine learning so the vertical axis is tentative statistics on the data can you run any inference on the data or can you do full-fledged machine learning can you learn the AI and for machine learning if we are you know it's going to do questionnaires from your employees or you have sensors or video or audio all this data coming in and you want to train some networks neural networks to train that how are you going to deal with that information but it's not a smart phone or some other edge devices and so so what we realized is that anonymization is for the best in terms of utility but worse in terms of privacy encryption is great for privacy but suffers in machine learning so two techniques have emerged we call it smashing called federated learning and smashed learning sorry it's federal learning and split learning and split learning is from our group at MIT and it allows you to give its sufficient privacy at the same time allows you to do full-fledged machine learning so it's almost magical that data stays on the phones or H devices and we can still create a global AI for any task you may have and this technique is useful in others as well they're applying it to getting back to work for Kobe 19 and Canada like I would have time to go into detail of the technology but the key idea here is instead of sharing raw data from those edge devices like smartphones and cameras and so on we just share the wisdom we just share the features of the data as opposed to sharing the raw data and that's how we maintain the privacy of the data so to conclude we think contact tracing case management and advising employees and citizens and students on our premises is very critical to reopen businesses and whether it comes to machine learning or encryption or digital health paths check as a foundation is committed to creating open source extremely high tech you know research and development and getting it out there and MIT safe paths is committed to doing high quality research and contributing the open source and working with our partners at MIT thank you so thank you so much Rebecca and thank you Ramesh we you have done quite a bit of hard work with your team um we heard you testified yesterday on a panel before the congressional taskforce on exposure notification and contact tracing would you care to share some of the issues and how they could be addressed yeah Thank You Cheryl I think I think it was a wonderful experience to do the congressional testimony on on contact tracing and I think the points that kept on coming about the one of the four panelists yesterday and the question that kept on coming up was first of all wash with National Response which right now is in in disarray but maybe the second point which is very important is this notion that government will likely likely consider nonprofit and open source entities to do contact tracing and that's an interesting subtle point because if you're not in nonprofit or open source then it's very easy or the contact tracing app to get misused you know for any large employer and if states and nations are deploying it then you could imagine if 60 70 percent of your state on the smartphone is using this one app is extremely powerful you know even some of the most popular social apps you know are not don't have 60 70 percent penetration so given that it's extremely powerful and they're thinking about making it from nonprofit and open source because even though using privacy-preserving techniques they're fancy things we can do on the server side using metadata that could be problematic and the third point that keeps coming up is how do we the manual contact tracing with digital content reasons because the government has spent tens of millions of dollars to create an army effectively call centers and case management centers but they are becoming very inefficient just today Boston Globe has an article where about half the people were laid off from the 1,700 people they had hired to do manual contact tracing because the number of cases in Massachusetts are coming down so ramping up and ramping down man and contract racing is just not possible and so the digital apps are going to play a very critical role so again kind of a coordinated response nonprofits and open source doing apps and merging manual and digital contact tracing thank you so on another question related to that there were so many organizations developing products for contact tracing can they can you characterize the landscape within it and where they might be sergey's with safe paths and paths check yeah so so six-plus MIT research part shake is the foundation that deploys the solution you know we are here to not compete but collaborate in fact we are here to enable everybody else so in sum we already have are building our own primary app and server and dashboard in many US states and territories and Nations so we are delighted that will be the primary brand in those states and countries at the same time there's some other players who already are trying to build and the glue bit confused because the rnd required is too complex or as as I said earlier and Chris is online that's great as we said earlier they don't use their own brand for you know because too risky for them to be out there so either big from an rnd point of view or from a brand point of view path check is helping those entities as well so whether you're state or a nation or large employer you can use the path check brand Chris do you want to add something to that sure so we've been talking to a lot of businesses since the very beginning both business is looking for help and businesses who'd like to work with us and partner with us and we actually have a formal partnership program so you can join us at a basic level an ecosystem member that just means you're part of the team you can go join us at a gold or platinum level which means that we're going to give you some support at varying levels and you can also join us as a technology partner you're literally using our technology building it into yours or vice versa where you're actually helping us to build our technology so we have several options for partnerships and working with us great thank you Chris um so it's been proposed that government agencies might be requiring code related data from companies how might save pads dashboards help a company transfer this information I I think I have not heard that so far but I would say again there's confidentiality anonymity and privacy and privacy means other than the individual other than the worker nobody else not path check not the employer not the government nobody gets to know anything about this individual any personally identifiable data not their location you know not their name none of that not even their IP address and ideally and but all the services are provided and you think this seems kind of a mismatch how can you do that how can you provide services to somebody without knowing anything about them and and that's actually that's already possible the technology for that from a computer science point of view is already available it should that we have to deploy it in the right way and deployed at scale because we're talking about deploying it to billions the people now that has never been done in a matter of weeks in matter of months and that's the role a path check is playing like when we see that green padlock in a browser that makes us feel comfortable typing or credit card address so the prowl browser doesn't know it you know your Google Chrome doesn't know it even the merchant doesn't know your credit card number but you're still able to buy those things from that notion is the same same philosophy here that's great I think we'll have time for a couple more questions since we're running a bit ahead yeah actually I see I'm Joe hit Joey hasty asked about tourism and travel and I just want to answer that that's a great question because many of our earliest adopters are actually tourist locations and they're very concerned about getting started as soon as possible obviously for the summer season and so we are working with them closely and we do have solutions for them what's really interesting is that sometimes it's challenging because you have to host these solutions in various locations and you wouldn't always be able to cross the data over so we actually are working on interoperability solutions that could allow a traveler from one country to still be covered when they land in a new country that's great another question is are you working with any behavioral scientists to test out best practices for use in adoption definitely that's something that we did right in the beginning so you know then really that some of you might know from rationale yours it's part of a team and and Julian's not a very famous professor from Harvard also behavioral scientist it's also on our team and so there's some amazing people and not just for employers also for nations we're running pilots because as you know behavior is very culture and regions specific and so we're learning a lot of pilots and hopefully we'll be able to share some results from that we also have a separate program on incentives not just carrots were also stick so not just sticks but also carrots in how people should use these solutions hopefully we'll have a lot more to share in the coming weeks but the early engagements only thing we know is this is not a trivial problem solve so if your company is thinking about hey we have an IT department they can build a solution we can use it for our employees that's not how this is going to get rolled out there are a lot of complexities of privacy it takes and behavior as I said that clear oh okay and I guess other questions what can you suggest as the key learnings of what you've been doing over the last month how things have pivoted and changed that we should know about yeah I think I think you know we started with GPS because the new Bluetooth is very challenging when I took a sabbatical leave from MIT I was at Facebook for two years 2016 and actually built a very large team to do bluetooth based you know proximity analysis and we realize this is actually you know very very pesky problem so we talked to Apple and Google recently and they said you know there's not much we can do and then a few weeks later fortunately they released the API so once that is the API fortunately we knew in advance they're also using the Apple Google Bluetooth API so there they have been lot of P words around dad and also we realize that working with States and governments is easier for us because we are nonprofit and and have the brand at the same time working with employers is great for us because it's a very quick turnaround cycle for us especially for a large employer in a state and you have some influence on the state Chris can tell you more but we have been very happy that has been a great relationship for us you work with a large employer and ask them to help us navigate the regulatory environment in that state they just have a sentence or two yeah yeah sure so we definitely been approaching from all angles going straight to government when possible but going to businesses and schools we're not possible and actually trying to form coalition's between schools and even businesses to help us put pressure on government because government is not always responsive so we are taking these kind of going around the back yeah and if the International scenarios is also great because you know a large employer is a very important kind of an economic engine in those countries and they say listen hey I have you know tens of thousands of employees who cannot cannot go to work unless you state change the regulation and work with an open source nonprofit it's a lose-lose so that's those are good conversations as well great and do you want to say anything about the pros and cons of digital passports and the key to adoption on those yeah so there's a lot of controversy around the serology tests and I'm not a biologist so I don't want to get into that region there's certain value to creating some kind of a passport on say that I here it's Okuda for me to go back to work or I have recovered and so on and so yes we actually work with you know credential verification companies who provide us tools for that and we have some other partners so we don't build the solutions ourselves we use existing technologies to embed them with us so there's a lot of value in creating some kind of a passport we also have a team or the South Africa I called Cobie ID and they built QR code based solutions so they have integrated with us so they're deploying it in many many scenarios where you cannot expect the employees to have latest smartphones so even if you have a feature phone even if you have no phone at all this QR code based solutions actually work pretty well so that's also part of our offering so I think I think there's a lot - it has to be multi-prong it's not one hammer that you know Sol's on the problem and I think there's a lot to learn we are sharing our learnings as we go
