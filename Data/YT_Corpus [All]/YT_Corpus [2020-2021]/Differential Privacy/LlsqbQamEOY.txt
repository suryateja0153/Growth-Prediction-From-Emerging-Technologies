 when pseudo-random number generators break cryptographic protocols do too despite the severe impact of generator failure sun channels have been until now overlooked as a possible threat my talk presents such an attack against a commonly used design counter drbg one of the few US government approved pseudo-random number generators our work demonstrates that attack techniques previously applied predominantly to block ciphers can also allow an adversary to compromise the security of a pseudo-random number generator we demonstrate this attack against real-world implementations showing that such a break allows an adversary to recover a client signing he used two TLS authentication this adversary can then impersonate the client handing access to protected resources I find you to attend the talk in which I'll explore the attack and what it teaches us about how best to generate cryptographically secure random numbers
