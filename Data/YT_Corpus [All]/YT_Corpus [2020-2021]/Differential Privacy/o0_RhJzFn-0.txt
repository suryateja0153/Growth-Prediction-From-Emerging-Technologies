 Money laundering is a criminal act that transforms profits from illegal activities into legitimate assets. Here we have a bank who wants to develop a new algorithm to detect money laundering activities. The problem is that many criminals conceal their activities by transferring assets across many banks. If multiple banks were to cooperate together they can build a better model on everyone's data. However, such data is sensitive due to competition and cannot be shared in plain text. Therefore, we would like to find a way to allow these things to cooperate in the presence of competition, which we call "coopetition". Helen is one such cooperative learning platform that trains linear models via the use of cryptography. Compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, we're able to compute the same model in 2.5 hours instead of three months. Please come to the talk if you're interested in learning more!
