states again thank you everyone John thank you for joining us today is greatly appreciated thank you people good to hear your voice we're going to do a quick overview of the census communication plan for 2020 and this is the opening slide so we can go to the next slide the 2020 integrated thank you very much on a macro level this slide shows all the different compartments that team ynr along with the kalam oku group approached the messaging platform for the 2020 census it is a very broad in scope plan that includes the traditional media and advertising as well as digital and website assets social media but it goes much further into stakeholder relations working hand-in-hand with the field recruitment officers data dissemination integrating the statistics and school program working with the public relations and events team handling the crisis communications and of course the giant Partnership Program the last piece of this slide is a campaign optimization which is very fascinating for the first time because the data will be coming in in real time with the digital platform we will actually be able to see which markets and census tracks are doing well and which markets and census tracts are not doing well we will be able to analyze and perhaps move around assets and/or apply more pressure into the census tracts that are trailing in response next this is the team Y&R the overarching name for our group were made up of multiple advertising agencies and PR firms what they did was they had multicultural experts from each ethnic group as well as Young & Rubicam who is a considered a top five agency traditional agency so Carol H Williams was the African American expert TDW & Company was the Asian American expert Colin moku was a Native Hawaiian Pacific island expert gng was the Native American and a Native Alaskan expert culture OneWorld was the Hispanic cultural experts and then we had expertise by other organizations based on their particular medium so Rheingold represented the digital media's wavemaker represented the traditional media's guide house was the overarching PR firm so this was our team next just a quick jump in John to let anybody know if you can't hear you have any issues please send a chat to Cristina alfano she is monitoring the chat line thank you this is an overview of the calendar of where we are today you can see we're in January of 2020 the census timeline actually started in fourth quarter of last year which is a little bit confusing because it's actually the first quarter of the federal fiscal but remote Alaska began on December 16 messaging secretary Dillingham when actually out of Alaska about a week ago and started the first enumeration January February and the first week in March is what we like to call awareness phase followed by motivation phase followed by reminder phase and then in September of this year is the thank you phase these are the phases for the advertising campaign each advertising message was custom made to serve Kay particular face next this is an overview of the phases that we just covered and the dates a little bit more detailed and sort of the overview of what the message was for each phase and awareness it was keep the 2020 census top of the mind in motivation phase two it was to drive participation and action and encouraged the 2020 census survey to be complete in reminder phase it was to inform people that enumerators would be coming to their home it was still time to participate in the survey but to be also on the lookout for enumerators in your neighborhood and then the fourth phase the thank-you phase is really when we complete the census we thank the public for dissipating and let them know what that the data will be forthcoming next before you go on John a quick reminder please mute your phones for those who have just don't joined us thank you very much this is an overview of the paid media audiences at the far left is the different groups that I was speaking about AI n is the Native American Native Alaskan asian-american black African American Latino NHP I of course Native Hawaiian Pacific Islanders and legacy and emerging which is cultural culture that Brazilian Russian polish and Middle Eastern so you can see how they divvied up the audience groups and then the language guide is on the far right of how we are messaging these groups in their traditional languages next the page media approach was to focus and prioritize the heart to count audiences and we did a zero-based planning where every agency took a bottoms-up approach to developing their audience strategies this was not an exercise where the census came to us and said Jon here's the amount of resources you got X amount of dollars build a plan they basically went to each multicultural agency and said what do you need to reach your audience at a high level so that they can participate in the census next um this is a concept where called recency theory which is what the media plan is based on and what it basically means is that when you run an ad people will remember the ad for a long period of time and so there's two strategies laid out on this track we did the strategy on the right where we wanted to go ahead and peek during the motivation phase and then tail off so the overall campaign is extremely hot and heavy for the three phases and then it phases off next this is an overview of how the media process worked we had a media day in April of 2019 where we invited media companies to participate by either coming in and/or joining on WebEx learning about the media process and then giving them the opportunity to apply via the RFP portal so it was a very open process that any media company in this in the United States could put forth the proposal as well as in Puerto Rico next this is the media by overview lists a total of three thousand eight hundred eighty nine vendors are were purchased for the 2020 census media campaign and you can see it broken down by groups and the number of vendors if we go to Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander over forty five vendors are being used to reach our community next this is the paid media summary of the whole campaign as you can see on the top bottom right it's two hundred and forty million dollars that is the entire campaign and how it breaks up by media national TV local TV national radio local radio out-of-home and so forth next you this is a slide that shows the media coverage where every area in dark green is being reached with a local media buy so you can see it covers the state the state's very well it covers Hawaii very well all the key metropolitan areas a total of 149 out of the 210 DMAs in the United States will be reached next the considerations we gave on the media budget was digital media would have a more significant role in this campaign because of the digital component of being able to participate and fill out the actual census um this will highly impact the total spin on the per channel in contrast to 2010 because in 2010 there was not a digital media advertising component there are a little fewer traditional media outlets compared to 2010 as well we saw a lot of print and newspapers either contract or go out of business or merge so there are actually a little less traditional media vendors that were buying in 2020 that we did in 2010 and then a little overview of the 2020 landscape we were very concerned about the presidential elections and the Olympics creating advertising opportunities and pricing challenges for us next this is a 2020 paid media by investment by media type but this is a breakdown as to where the total dollars are spent on 2010 versus 2020 so you can see that in overall in 2010 167 million or spent on traditional advertising and in 2020 240 million is being spent on traditional advertising next this is more information comparing 2010 to 2020 this time broken down by ethnic groups and you can see our group NHP I in 2010 had 1.1 million or 7% of the total budget and in 2020 we have 1.8 million representing about 8 percent of the budget I will tell you that we're very fortunate in that our population when you compare it our population is about 0.4% of the population of the United States so we were over-represented dollar-wise next this is an overview of the region frequency it's a very technical formula but it basically says that we're reaching 99% of all the households in 2020 whereas in 2010 they reached sixty three point five percent of the households next this is some of the highlights highlights from the diverse mass and diverse mass is everyone in the United States we spoke a little bit about the ethnic multicultural experts diverse mass is everyone else so it is I guess you could say the mainstream and the just the traditional American population base but as you can see national TV will cover 46 vendors including an estimated of over 16,000 campaign spots national radio will deliver over 3.3 billion impressions local radio and TV will represent 71 out of 210 markets and it goes on and on and on it's a very large robust comprehensive plan next this is some of the upfront highlights which is some of the programs that the national television will be buying for you to go over everything from WWE wrestling to 60 minutes to the good doctor next this is the Pacific Islander audience plan highlights here we get into the strategy of how we were able to reach the N HPI community the latest census showed that about 45% of the nati community limbs in the state of Hawaii and 55% live spread throughout the other 49 continents so we focused on Hawaii with about 50% of the budget using traditional advertising television that included cultural programming like the Merrie Monarch to the Hoku Hanohano Awards as well as news and local programming and then on the radio in state we focused on any Hawaiian music radio stations and there are many many of them about 16 of them in the state of voice each one is getting a piece of the budget and advertising to our community on the continent we ended up using more print and digital so one of the things that we did in the continent or sort of take a more targeted approach to how to reach our individuals we have a direct mail drop that's happening twice one in awareness fees and one in motivation fees and we use the company called info groups consumer data compilation tool that was able to arm specifically target Native Hawaiian Pacific Islanders addresses in the continent we also got support from some key community partners like the Council for Native Hawaiian advancement the Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander complete count committee the commitment schools and the office of Hawaiian Affairs as well as epic our participated in helping getting us their members to receive the direct mail listings we also use local magazine on the continent one of the biggest magazines that we're using is the Hawaiian Airlines in-flight to reach all of our n HPI cousins on the continent so we will be in all of the Hana whole magazines as well as local magazines like kama aina magazine which is out of Las Vegas so there are certain n HPI magazines on the west coast that super serves their community we will be participating in ads and editorial pieces in those magazines and the last piece of the HPI campaign on the continent is a very robust digital campaign on social media that included a music video which will get up to a little later next campaign development this talks a little bit about our approach that was based on research we first did what's called sea Bam's which was really focusing on the different audiences and different areas where the United States population lives and what their lifestyles are are they young with young families are they retirees do they live in the country do they live in the city are they high income low income and so forth so we broke it down into I believe it was 16 different platforms and that helped us guide the research and the creativeness then we created the platform with the entire group and came out with several different platform ideas and we went to the community and we ran focus groups all throughout the United States testing which platform would be the best and the platform that came out on top was shape your future start here participate in the census 2020 so we took them took the platform and started to come up with creative concepts to reach our audience and we went and tested the creative concepts and ideas once again through focus groups internet testing and call-out research and it allowed us to have a very specific target of what we wanted to go ahead and reach to be effective in this advertising campaign and for creative to be as effective as can be next this is an overview of all the testing that I spoke about where it took place 122 focus groups for the campaign testing see Bam's was 42 focus groups and to ITT was 18 focus groups alter off the country including Hawaii next before you go John just wanted to point out that we again we're having a special webinar specifically focused on the territories the other territories outside of Puerto Rico so let's talk about the campaign next this is a slide excuse me that shows the different phases for the Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander campaign you can see on the far left the early education took place all throughout 2019 and ended on January 13th it had paid advertising and at PSAs which is a lovely PSA with Marcus Mariota Mop Juana de Silva and dr. JA das Oreo we had events that started from September we did events all throughout the country Seattle as well as San Diego the large Hawaiian Civic club convention in Maui and the council for Native Hawaiian advancement convention in Honolulu we did earned media we create electronic press kits and wrote articles for the NH bi publications and then we created materials for our partners we had a robust partnership approach over 3,000 partners have signed on to help get the message out for the 2020 census and so we developed materials for the partners to go ahead and use including fa Q's posters for the young children targeted it and also promotional materials for the census in Schools program and then we did some email marketing welcoming the community so you see it's not just one piece that is driving the campaign it's all of these pieces moving together and working together as we slide to the next phase and awareness it is the same sort of formula um but it is um more complex so this is an ad of our family first 30-second commercial it should play you push the button one more time there you go it's a little jumpy because of the digital platform that we're on but this is a 30-second ad that features Nainoa Thompson as one of our trusted voices as well as Kevin McMullan captain in the Honolulu Fire Department it has families that are Micronesian Tong in someone and Hawaiian so that's our family first 30-second ad next this is an overview of a script of a radio ad if you push the button it should play the radio ad you well so anyway this is the radio ad in the script form because of the technology that we're using we're not able to play it but let's go to the next slide next this is a a direct mail piece this is the first direct mail piece and one of the things that was very important that came out in the research in the focus groups when we spoke to Native Hawaiian Pacific Islanders on the continent they consistently told us that every time there's advertising for them it was based in Hawaii and that they could not relate to people in Hawaii anymore because the continent was their new home so we really made a strong effort to capture the Native Hawaiian Pacific island communities with them in their background so this is a Tongan family in the state of Utah you can see how they're dressed it's a cold weather up in the timber lines and it reflects the community that lives in Colorado Salt Lake City Provo and so forth and we wanted to show them in their community next these are a few slides from the motivation commercials a few commercials from the motivation phases let's see if we can get this to work go ahead and push it again it's the 900 30-second ad so the audio isn't participating with us but we were very fortunate to get 900 Thompson to participate in the census those were some of the trusted voices dr. Toosi Oh from La Vie Leah from the University of Hawaii he's a Samoan professor as well as a Fijian professor from the university of BYU la ei this is the script of a 60 second um radio ad we actually did a radio ad that's half in native hawaiian half in english so this is what this ad is next John just to let everybody know what I can do is send the power share the PowerPoint after and then everybody can play the videos later that we great next this is one of our newspaper ads there's two pillars of the campaign one is called trusted voices the other is called family first this is a family first ad this is a Hawaiian family in motivation ad and it assesses for our family the companies on the right next these are a few ads from the reminder phase next this is a trusted voice of the soil team this is dr. Toosi of fauna by leo and he speaks to his community as well as our community in having them wanting to encourage them to participate in the 2020 census and you can see at the very bottom the tag keeps changing whether what phase that we're in this is a reminder phase it says it's not too late shape your future star year 2020 census gov paid for by the US Census next slide that's our presentation for today if you go on the census 2020 campaign website you can see many of these ads as well and if you go on the census.gov website you can see all of the digital ads on the youtube channel the broadcast ads as well as the music video that we created that's available on the census Facebook page as well as the census YouTube page and the music video we're very proud of we've gotten a lot of response over a million people have watched it and it's been out for about 14 days now are there any questions that I can ask the audience go ahead and write it in the chat line or they can try and speak over the phone line you John this is Tonya thank you very much if you don't mind I'll lead off I do have a question for you what if there is so you have the campaign you've done a lot of research and have a plan ready is what if there is anybody who feels they need additional help with communications and outreach in their specific area or they want to boost it a little do they reach out to you do they reach out to copy at census how do they do that yeah they can definitely reach out to us at info at collide moku comm anytime depending on who they are if they're a partner or an organization kay how Lonnie butts and I and how they all communicate to get our partners and organizations materials that they can use to spread the word in their community I told me a question from online can communities view your scripts to create their own PSA yes they can as long as they are a partner they can access the scripts on the partnership hub if you're not a partner they can reach out to us directly at info at kalaiy moku comm and we can work with them in getting the scripts and they can create their own PSAs we actually got a call from several personalities that had heard the ads asking if they could create their own PSA and we said yes we would love that to not only to communicate to the census community but to really communicate to their own community as you know in this world of social media there are a lot of individuals that literally have their own media channels Jason Momoa has 12 million people following him on Instagram so when Jason says something he can easily put it out through his social media network which is almost like a 1980 television show the amount of audience that these influencers are able to reach so we're happy to help you with those scripts once again the best email is info at kalaiy moku com hey John this is chemo I have uh another questions come up how many times should we expect a Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander in Hawaii and then also outside fillet how many tests should we expect them to see a Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander ad is passing in here or C so the broadcast campaign only runs in the state of Hawaii and it's very high frequency I don't watch a lot of television myself and I probably seen it eight times already the campaign just started on the 14th so it's very high frequency numbers and what we basically went ahead and bought in this order was Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander cultural programming news and local programming so if you watch Mary mutter if you watch locals or the command s cool song contests whether it be in Hawaii or on the web in California or Colorado you will see the ads targeting the Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander community as far as other 49 states because we could not justify the efficiency of buying a television ad in Salt Lake City or San Diego we did not buy broadcasts there will be a lot of census ads in those communities however by the other multicultural groups or the overarching campaign which is called diverse mass the diverse mass campaign actually starts in the middle of February so you will see a lot of census ads I was watching the CBS Evening News yesterday and it had the census ad already on that's the PSA talking about confidentiality so we should be able to see them through television through radio in Hawaii and through diverse mass on the 49 states my net worth that this is dial kg calling my question really appreciate all your map that showed all those point what is focus Cooper yes and wide so he's very a national list or do you have a list of contact person per state for the NH bi community yes sir I'll have to check with the census partnership office I believe they do they have partnership specialist in every major market that covers all 50 states the NH p i community a ton because we're the minority of the minorities we do not have dedicated NH p i staffers in let's say Missouri or Alaska or Alabama while there is dedicated staff for the census in those markets they're not dedicated for NH p i the NH p i dedicated staff is only in the state of hawaii because of the 45% of the population being in Hawaii I hope that I make request me sorry yeah I just wanted this is Tonya John I just wanted to add to your point yet a couple days ago we had the partnership office led by Anna Anna and cavae giving a presentation their presentation will be on our website it should be on later today and there's a contact for the partnership office that you can reach out to them and also if you need to you know if Kim or if we're the ones that you know and you want to reach out to us we can try to connect you that's the whole point we're trying to connect and like you said we're we don't expect to have dedicated and HPI folks everywhere but we do have n HPI all over the united states so we want to make sure that we we reach them so i'll make sure that that is posted on our website page everything links back to census.gov and will try to help make sure that information is funneled back back to people hi Sonia this is cobby hello can you hear me yeah we can hear you go ahead cobby okay okay I was I was just going to say just to kind of piggyback on your guys's comments um we do have n HPI partnership specialist in the le region we do have them in the Denver region I'm still finding out we do have partnership specialists like all across the country like John said not all of them are n HPI specific but we do have some NH guys specific in other regions that there are a lot of at HP eyes so if you want to get in contact with them please just email me and then I can connect these to their region where they are Thanks thank you copy your about them you any other questions or comments you all right if there are no more questions from our online team we'll go ahead and close the meeting for today just a reminder that we have a webinar coming up on privacy and that will be on February 6 Thursday so we still have some time it's with Michael Hawes he'll be talking specifically on privacy so we hope that you'll join us spread the word as we carry on through this webinar
