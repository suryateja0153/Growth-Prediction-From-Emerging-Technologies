 Certificate Transparency, or CT, is an emerging system for improving the Web PKI. It enables the rapid discovery of malicious or misissued certificates. It does this by logging certificates to a set of open, auditable logs, and providing cryptographic proof that the certificates have been logged. CT has desirable security properties, and its standardization and implementation began years ago. But deploying and enforcing it in the real world can involve trade-offs and must be done gradually to avoid breaking large numbers of websites. In this talk, we look at CT as a case study for deploying ecosystem-wide change while minimizing negative end user impact. We’ll look at how widely CT has been adopted and how often end users experience breakage due to CT. And we’ll identify some of the design properties of CT that have created both success and challenges in the real world.
