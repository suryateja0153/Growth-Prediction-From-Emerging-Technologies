 Hey, want to take my survey about your favorite bread? [Grunt] What about my privacy? I'll add noise to the results to provide you with differential privacy. But, but, but we're all look alike. Our responses will be correlated. Prior work says that even with differential privacy, the mutual information between the output and my response will get higher and higher as the number of correlated responses increases. There's too many of us. True, but that's not what differential privacy is about. It's not a statistical property. It's not about mutual information. Differential privacy is a causal property. What? Differential privacy is a causal property. How? Differential privacy bounds the effect size of your response. So what? Remember that correlation does not imply causation? Its contrapositive means that a bound on causation does not imply a bound on correlation. So, you shouldn't expect differential privacy to bound statistical properties like mutual information.
