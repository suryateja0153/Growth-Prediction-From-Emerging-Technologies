 Pretty much anyone who knows me knows that I love Halloween. Like, love Halloween. So when I found out the street we moved to was the trick-or-treat capital of Bellefont, I was pretty excited. However, last year we ran out of candy and had to turn our lights off. In order to avoid this unfortunate fate again this year, I am setting out to find a better way to make informed candy purchases. So if you have these two pieces of information then you can use what we call the 95 percent rule in statistics and the 95 percent rule basically says that if I go to the mean plus or minus 2 standard deviations then there's a 95% chance that you're going to fall within that region. So if I go minus 2 Sigma less than angle 2 mu plus 2 Sigma so that gives you a quick rule because this is basically telling you how far out do I think I could be in terms of the number of trick or treaters and this is basically saying if you take the mean and add on 2 standard deviations you should be safe. Lindsey: What if I only have one of those numbers? Matthew: Well, it could get a little rough. Well, I appreciate Matthew's help with this problem. What I've learned is I really don't have enough data to make a better decision this year so the best I can do is overestimate by what I think is going to be too much candy and try to get some more numbers to make a more informed purchase next year. To all of you and your candy purchasing decisions, I wish you luck and from all of us at WPSU Happy Halloween
