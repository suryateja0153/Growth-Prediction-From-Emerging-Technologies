 hi everyone i'm sutu today i'm going to talk about the privacy anniversary network it's about how to learn the representations for mobile data privacy this is a joint work with reds university today machine learning has benefited a lot of mobile services such as the siri amazon and mobile users are always required to upload the voice image video and other raw data for intelligent services but sending raw data to the mobile service provider present serious challenges to the user's privacy for example the mobile user say hi siri there is a risk of disclosing the voice privacy towards addressing this challenge our key insight is that most services actually do not need the raw data our goal is to avoid disclosing raw data to service providers by creating a device local intermediate component that encodes raw data and only sends encoded data so in this way the encoded data must be useful and private uh however existing solutions struggle to balance assembling conflicting utility and privacy objectives such as the wi-fi to practice the noisy data task plastic a specific fixture and hybridine feature unlike the previous work we want to automatically learn the deep features to find a sweet trade-off between the utility and the privacy in this work we want to maximize the utility this is quantify the influence accuracy and maximize the reconstruction error this is used to quantify the agnostic privacy and minimize the inverse accuracy of some private attributes that is used to measure the user's specify the privacy but when we use the scene to learn features by maximizing the task inference accuracy the reconstruction area are always small and when the auto encoder features by minimizing the reconstruction error which conflicts with our objective so we focus on the training of the encoder by uh introduce a new deep model the plan it employ a utility discord discriminator to as a positive teacher to supervise the training of the encoder and employ the adversaries to confront with the training of the encoder and we hope a powerful encoder master comes from a tough teacher and a two powerful adversaries so we present a new training algorithm of pun to avoid the model degradation using digit recognition image classifications sound sensing human activity prediction and the driver behavior recognition we evaluate the performance of pine and between two types of pine the pine wine is trimmed by a train with one attacker and the pen tool is trained with two attackers and we compare the past performance with the other four base lines we can see that the pen can achieve the best utility privacy tradeoff and the pan 2 also achieved the best trade-off and also the the utility of the past encoder output is even better than that of the standard dn we first realized upon uh to seek uh how uh how the sigma inside how does the plan this isn't handle the feature components relevant to privacy from those relevant to utility we can see that the pen push the features towards more constructive space and this space is dominated by the samples with redundant without redundant private sensitive background information and we also realize the past encoder output on the reconstruction privacy and finally we also provide a manifold learning based interpretation for vital utility and privacy performance of past encoder output um we think pi is a framework it can further accommodate more choices of the utility and privacy quantification and integrated more utility discriminators than prime privacy attackers uh and also more insights to guarantee and accelerate and training convergence of planning are needed thank you
