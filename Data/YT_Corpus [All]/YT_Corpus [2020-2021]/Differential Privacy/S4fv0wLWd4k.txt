 Hi My name is Hang We are a research group from Virginia Tech We study disposable email services which provide temporary email accounts to users People use disposable email services to avoid giving out their own personal email addresses And we want to understand what risks are involved in its common use cases So we collected 2.3 million email messages sent by more than 200 thousand domains. This large dataset of email messages is a great opportunity to study email tracking. With email tracking technique Trackers can know whether people have already read their emails And when, where and using what device people have read their emails. Because the receivers don’t know they are being tracked We consider this as a privacy problem We analyzed the dataset to understand how trackers are tracking users And their techniques We found that disposable email service usage is risky And third-party tracking is highly prevalent So if you want to know more about disposable email services and the email tracking ecosystem Please come by and check out my talk at the conference!
