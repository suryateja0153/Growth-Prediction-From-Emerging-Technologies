 We study so-called "cookie banners" asking for users' consent to tracking. We use a custom-made crawler to find cookie banners provided by actors of IAB Europe's Transparency & Consent Framework. We find 1 426 such websites. Based on a legal analysis by the co-author who's an expert in law, we identify 4 potential GDPR and ePrivacy Directive violations, and use our crawler to detect them either automatically, or semi-automatically when we need to click on banners. For instance, some cookie banners do not respect the choice users make. On 27 websites banners store a positive consent even if the user has explicitly opted out. Come to our talk to learn about the other violations!
