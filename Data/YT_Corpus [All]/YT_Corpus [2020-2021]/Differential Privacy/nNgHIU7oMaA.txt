 we build the first practical neural network assisted fuzzer which greatly improves fuzzing performance. In this work, we train a neural network model as a differentiable surrogate of program to smoothly approximate program behaviors. The differentiability of neural network model also enable efficient computation of gradients and applying gradient-guided mutations. Existing fuzzers, using random mutation plus evolutionary selection,  heavily rely on undirected mutations; while gradient-guided mutation performed directing mutations based on neural network models of past program behaviors and achieve significant improvement in fuzzing results. We implement the neural network assisted fuzzer as NUEZZ and evaluate it against 5 state-of-the-art fuzzers on 10 real-world programs. NEUZZ can achieve 3X more edge coverage over 24 hours run and uncover 31 new bugs including two new CVEs. We open source news and github.
