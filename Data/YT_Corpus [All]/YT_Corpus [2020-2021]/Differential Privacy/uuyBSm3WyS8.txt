Thomas and st. John district and last but not least Tomas and conducción who is our census advisor for st. Croix I also have Marissa Hotchkiss who works with me at headquarters she's my branch chief who oversees the content so should we have more detailed questions about the actual content of the questionnaire that we're using for the island areas Marissa will also be chiming in and giving us that information okay well without further ado let's go ahead and go into the slide that we have with the island areas tanja are you able to switch control for us to get to the next slide thank you here we are great thank you is it working now yeah very good okay so we're we just finished the introductory slide and we're on slide 2 where it says why we conducted the central sensors in the island area so we found out by saying that the Constitution mandates that a census be taken every 10 years in title 13 of the u.s. code authorizes the Department of Commerce our secretary who to delegate this authority to the director of the Census Bureau to undertake the decennial census the geographic scope of the defendants census is specified in title 13 which includes the 50 states DC Puerto Rico as well as our Island area territories and this is the actual wording from the mandate that gives us the authority to be able to conduct the census in all parts of the US and the territories this gives you a brief overview of the 2020 census operation and there are in the 2020 census program there are 35 different operations that make up the complete 2020 census program and what you can see at the bottom left corner is that the island area census is is one of the 35 major operations that comprise the 2020 census because of the scope of the work that is different from how we are conducting the stateside census we have an entire operation of its own with its own resources and its staff to be able to conduct the census in the island areas and my purpose today is to show you how similar and how different our operations are compared to stateside census operations this is to give you a quick facts of the numbers that we have for the island area these are the numbers that we had from the 2010 census and because we collect the this information every 10 years the most recent data that we have in the island areas is from the 2010 census and as you can see in the top row is that the total population combined for all four territories in 2010 was a little over 375,000 people with about over a little bit over 138 thousand different housing units and then you'll see that this is all broken down by each of the territories and you can see that in terms of the population size you see American Samoa and cnmi fairly comparable with more housing structures that you see for CNMI and then Guam and US Virgin Islands having a larger population than that you see there one thing that I do want to note about the US Virgin Islands is because of the geographic dispersement of the islands of Saint Thomas and st. Croix we have split this work into two different districts the one district that oversees st. Thomas in st. John and then a second district that oversees st. Croix so while we have census offices one each in American Samoa one in CNMI one in Guam we have two different offices for those two districts so in total we have five island area census offices that are operating right now for the 2020 census with five senses advisers all right so the uploading island area censuses the Census Bureau partners with the island area local government to conduct the censuses of American Samoa cnmi Guam and the US Virgin Islands and this is a partnership that we established through a contract agreement between the Census Bureau and the governor of each Island area what this means is for stateside operations in Puerto Rico and DC the Census Bureau has the boots on the ground and conducts the census with our staffing but what we do with the island areas is we give this authority to the local government for them to do the high and use the local staff in order to conduct a census and in order to do this we do it through a contractual agreement so with this Agreement the island area governments are responsible for conducting the actual data collection activities under the guidance of the census advisors that we deploy and in return the Census Bureau is responsible for providing the funds necessary to conduct the census the data collection methodology all of our data collection instruments and materials which includes questionnaires and address registers as well as all of the IT infrastructure and our on-site census advisors for oversight this contract agreement goes on for about a year and a half in which our census advisors for the field data collection part from the preparations until closed on are there on island for one year they were all deployed last September and they have reached the halfway mark of the deployment already and are looking at their last six months an island also the operations I mean order to conduct this we have an agreement like I said with the governor of each Island area in which the governor appoints a lead agency to carry out this work on his or her behalf for American Samoa we have the government has designated the Department of Commerce to conduct this work for cnmi as well that is the Commerce Department as well for Guam we have the Bureau of Statistics in plan that has been designated by the governor and in the US Virgin Islands the governor has designated the University of Virgin Islands to conduct this work all of our contracts were signed in December of 2018 and we went out to each of the sites and we called kickoff meetings on-site in January of 2019 that was last year here is a fun picture of our five island area offices as well as our Island area senses advisors so let me take you to the time-warner Jennifer I think that somehow we have lost you as the presenter I'm trying to kick it back to you but it's not working does anybody can anybody see okay we're still seeing the island area censuses and I'm trying to kick the control back to you but it's not working so I'm going to go ahead and pick it up from slide four for you got our screen shows that were on slide six unpleasurable three okay hang on yeah we're definitely not on the same slide let me just call to me and I will change the okay you're ready to watch this live we didn't see this slide can you just quickly we heard about it but we didn't see it Tanya what slide are you I work we see slide six from our screen we're on quick five run slide for it never moves past three four uh some points Jason computer lungs controls and we can't pass it back to you go on okay so we can I have the backup slides with me so we can do it from here are we all on slide for now then yes I'm actually the one sharing slide for now to everyone okay great so I'll just pick it out right back yes by four on five four shows our data from 2010 census giving you an overview of the population count and the housing come for our island areas if you can stay in 2010 we had a little over three hundred seventy five thousand people that were counted for the 2010 census and a little over 138 thousand housing units that were counted and then for the rest of the two you'll see the breakdown of each territory in terms of the population size and their housing unit so this will become a baseline for us as we collect the 2020 numbers to see how the population and the housing numbers have changed in the last ten years and you can see that the population size is fairly comparable for American Samoa and CNMI and then you'll see a higher population density for Guam in the US Virgin Islands let's go onto the next slide slide five a slide five shows you that the way that we do our work with the island areas government is that we have a partnership that is established through a contract agreement through the Census Bureau and the governor of each Island area it would through this contract agreement the island area governments are responsible for conducting the actual data collection activities for the census while the Census Bureau is responsible for providing the funds and the resources as well as our on-site census advisors to give oversight for that entire year of field data collection that includes not to fulfill data collection and activity in itself for the preparation and the closeout so for each of the island areas the governor has the authority to name a local government agency or an entity to carry out the data collection activities and B F of the governor so to give you another rundown of who these folks are for American Samoa it is the Department of Commerce that has been designated by the governor to carry out this work so they are our partner agencies as well as for cnmi Department of Commerce is also our partner agency for Guam it is the Bureau of Statistics and plan that is our partner agency and then in the Virgin Islands we have the University of Virgin Islands that has been designated by the governor to carry out this work our concepts are officially signed in December 2018 and with the official kickoff that began January of 2019 a little bit over a year ago going on to slide 6 we want to show you some pictures of what our census offices look like in all of our territories so taking you to the top right corner you see that beautiful blue side that is our sign for the st. Thomas office that serves st. Thomas and st. John district in the US Virgin Islands when you look right below that you'll see a white guy with an orange structure that is our office for us see a pink Croix in the US Virgin Islands right next to that one you'll see the sign for 2020 census of CNMI that is our cnmi office and to the right of that you see our senses our Guam office and then to the right to a top right corner is American Samoa census office and it is exactly where I am right now in that building giving this presentation in the top middle you'll see five individuals who are our census advisors from left we have Danny Doyle with our census advisor for u.s. bi st. Thomas st. John district to the right is Jason Cox who is actually sitting in this office with me he is our american samoa advisor in the middle is Torino long who is our Guam adviser and then next is the massing car nación who is our st. Croix USVI census advisor and then to the right is calling and joy too is our CNMI census divisor you look at slide seven I want to talk to you about the types of data that will be collected in the island areas because we do not have any other surveys that happen within the inter central years the years between the censuses every ten years we really have one time shot at collecting data for the island areas for those of you who may be familiar with the different surveys that are taken on stay fat in Puerto Rico we have what we call the American Community Survey that is run annually on a sample basis in addition to the decennial census that happens every ten years there is a rolling survey that asks for detailed information of the population in the household what we are doing for the Islander is is that we are leveraged in that same long-form the the longer questioner that we use for the American Community Survey to conduct the census in the island areas so while we're sort of you who are residing on stateside safety Puerto Rico will experience the 2020 census in a short form where there will be a shorter amount of questions that are asked for those who are residing in the island areas will be asked a longer form to give us the details socio-economic and housing characteristics of the island areas in order to create this questionnaire we used American communities a questioner is our baseline and then throughout three years we worked closely with our local Island area government to finalize the content of the questions to provide the maximum utility and minimum individual burden in 2020 for the 2020 census subjects we are required on the three years prior to the actual census we're required to submit the subjects of the questions that we will be asking on the census to Congress and then two years prior to that we are mandated to submit the actual questions that will be used by the census so in March 2017 we were able to submit to Congress the subjects and our questions in March of 2018 for the 2020 census masses for stateside of the same Puerto Rico but also for our territories and these correspondences were also sent to our congressional delegates of our territories of American Samoa cnmi Guam and the US Virgin Islands going on to slide 8 and this tells you the types of data that are collected what you see is the majority of the subjects are what we use for the a minute American Community Survey however there are a few exceptions in working with our local government in which we have added a few more subjects that will be relevant and that meets the data needs of our island areas if you see all of those let me just walk you through it if you look at the column the first column those are 2020 subjects these are the subjects that are asked on our 2020 sense questionnaire for stateside and then the next three columns that you see are the additional subjects that we'll be asking the island area that will give us a lot more detailed data point for us so we will be asking on social economic and housing questions and you see for each of those columns these are the types of questions that we'll be asking what you also see is that the cells that are highlighted in green are the ones that are different from the American Community Survey so everything else that you see in these cells that are not shaded pretty much leverage and mimic the American Community Survey questionnaire the green ones are the ones that have been added or been modified so for example if you look at the rightmost column under housing subjects the third entry where you see home heating fuels that is the question that we do ask from the American Community Survey for stateside what we have heard from our counterparts is that I'm having data on the source of Handy home heating fuel is not relevant for the island area so that is a subject that we deleted from the questionnaire however we got the request to add these for that you see parents place of birth reason for migration sewage disposal and source of water that have been added to accommodate the data need for the island area let's go on to the next slide slide 9 to give you where we are in terms of our activities these are our key activities of the island area censuses as I discussed earlier we deployed our census advisors in September of last year and they had been working feverishly the moment they got there to continue the preparation work to be able to officially open our census offices I'm very happy to report that in October of last year we were able to meet this milestone and in between the second and the 24th of October we were able to officially open all of our five offices and open it and we are relieved that information to the public and to hold our opening ceremonies with the offices of the governor as well as our liaison agencies since then we have been feverishly hiring staff who will be part of our office operations as well as our field operations and we have been conducting staff training now there are two components for our data collection activity that you see where it says conduct address listing and conduct housing unit enumeration which are pretty much our key milestones for just listing what we do is we put boots on the ground and we walk all parts of the island for everyone to list all the housing units where people may be living this is what is chromey happening in the Pacific Islands and what is about to happen in the Virgin Islands and this is the primary reason that I am here American somewhere right now as they are wrapping up their work with the address listing and I had an opportunity yesterday when it wasn't raining and windy yesterday to actually drive around the island and look at unique housing structures and the challenges that our census takers had in listing all of these addresses and I have to say was very eye-opening of the different unique situations that we encountered here which would be today with all of our other territories so we were very very impressed and proud of our census takers who are able to basically walk all streets in all paths throughout all of our islands to be able to list all the places where people may be living once that part is done we take that as our list and send people out and we actually do what we call enumeration which is the actual census interview we will be going door-to-door with our census takers and doing in-person interviews of all households and all those who reside on Islands this is what's happening right now with address listing and going into the enumeration we are anticipating that the fieldwork will go on until the end of May and with that we will also be conducting special integration these are for people who are living in group facilities University housing correctional facilities nursing homes and so forth as well as conducting our enumeration of the homeless population so that is also happening in conjunction with what's happening with our address listing and housing unit enumeration as we do our enumeration we will also be doing field follow-up and some of our reinterviews of our data quality and then in selling this summer we will start our closeout activities our goal right now is to be able to conduct all of our fieldwork and be able to capture everything into our questionnaires and ship all of that back to Census Bureau's national processing center by the end of July once that happens we will start closing down our our offices here and by the end of those by the end of September we will be officially closing all of our offices Jennifer this is Tanya can I ask a quick question while we're on this slide yeah so what is your actual start date in the territories for counting it looks like it's not April 1 as again the Matt is this job so April 1 is what we call the census date our reference date so that is a date that we use for our entire census operation states that and in the territories and when we take our population count we ask everyone as of April 1st so where were you living as of April 1st that becomes our reference point I think that's why a lot of folks may think that census actually happens on April 1st but really it happens around that date but we use that date as our reference point in terms of getting our population counts thank you that makes sense yeah absolutely all right so with this year I'm going to pause for a moment and I'm going to be asking each of our island area census advisors to give us a brief update on how the work is going in each of their territories so for all my staff I will be going in alphabetical order so I will start with Jason Kahn who is with American Samoa so Jason please tell us about a brief overview of the work that you were doing here as well as for those who may be familiar with somewhere our office is located and any other information that you can get so Jake yes thank you so much Jenny so we're very happy to report that here in American someone as of yesterday evening we are a hundred percent done with address listing fieldwork we're finishing some of our quality checks this week but we finished all the work in the field that we're doing to identify all the structures where people are living in American sawa and this includes all the islands of American saw moi so to do really Louvre and the Manu I so we're very happy about that there's a lot of work to get up to that point we and Jenny was showing on the slide nine that has all different dates for doing activities we have completed all of those items in they're hiring all of our staff conducting all the training so that they could start on time in February for address listing and we're very excited that we've now completed that we're also excited because we are preparing now in the next week so that we can start housing enumeration on March 2nd as scheduled as well so everything is going very well in terms of our preparation American someone in addition to that we've been doing a lot of outreach work with our partnership specialists we've been making sure that we're meeting with someone affairs all of the fully knew which are the mayors of each of the villages in American ssam want to make sure the public has good information about what to expect with the census and how they'll be able to participate so we can make sure we have complete and accurate data here in American sawa and actually as of yesterday Jenny joined us while she was on island and the press conference where we're trying to prepare the public for operations for enumeration and all the inputs and interviews we'll be doing with every household here starting in March so we're really excited about that for anyone who wants to know about our location learn fungus Omo we're in the loominatee building on the second floor which is right above the post office so anyone familiar with the area will know where that's at and our phone number in case anyone ever needs to call us is of course area code six eight four and six 4422 thank you all right thank you Jason will now go out dunya and my common choice will give us an overview of the stand of my senses yes thank you my name is crawling Joyce so I have actually a very similar update to Jason we started around the same time and we're kind of keeping pace with each other here so we are not quite done I can't say 100% done little address listings but we are well into the upper 90 percents done we are also doing QC which is why that numbers a little fluid at this point because occasionally we're running into something that needs to be kicked back out to the field for address listing but we will be done completely with all the keep sleeve Islands by middle poly middle of next week which puts us on pace to start our enumeration on time in the first week of March we also have been spending a lot of our time on outreach efforts we have been doing a ton of radio ads we're running those ads in 8 different languages just important keeping people informed that we're out on the streets that they're going to see us writing stuff down about their houses so don't be alarmed we're doing a number of print ads and local magazines and newspapers we just filmed the talk show have it run yet but we taped a talk show the other night and we also have a number of videos running the local news stations we're going to run them in the local movie theater and on social media we're also carrying a number of outreach events festivals etc handing out you know bags and other promotional items at that at those events in terms of our office location if you're familiar with the area we are on Beach Road and Chao and Lala Village if you're really familiar we for the locals we always say it's the former mayor's office on the third floor and can be reached at six seven zero six eight five 2020 is our phone number Thank You Colleen now we'll go on to Torino long who is the Guam census advisor Thank You Jenny half a day everyone so we were able to start our address listing on time On February 3rd which for us was the Super Bowl as well so we had at campaign around that and preparing the villages to see our enumerators out in the villages conducting the agile hosting we will be completely finished QC and all of our listings by Wednesday February 26 next Wednesday and we are on time to start a numeration the following Monday on March 2nd we have completed all of our peak hiring and peak training and we are excited to begin the enumeration phase we have been working with our partners with the mayors we met with the those council last week we have joined all of our local chats our neighborhood chats for the mayors and their villages we have an aggressive marketing campaign we have a website which is 20 20 grams by 2020 census Guam dot-com where we provide information to be neighbourhood about what to expect and upcoming milestones we also have regularly scheduled radio broadcast we've got regularly scheduled TV appearances as well as a monthly column in the PD n post Amyas we're located at Century Plaza which for those of you who are familiar with the area is the old DoCoMo building and we occupy the entire second level and we're just pretty excited to get going and everything is going really well Brest here great thanks Kerry let's go on to the US Virgin Islands looks I would think Kroy district office so lasting for nothing else I thank you Jenny I implement incarnation the sensor device were here on Sun Kreutz similar to my counterpart Jason Colleen and Terry here we are working on staff in the defense's office for us here we have a gold of about 50 staff in the office and another 280 flows of fields that we have higher around 208 of those and we have clear around 135 and train 135 have a couple of test session scheduled for next week where we will where we are expecting another 100 applicants or so so by the end of the month we should have our fully staff on board and fully trained a few challenges that we are experiencing here on sound Kreutz is that that we are it's a little hard for us to actually find qualified applicants because we are competing with it oil refinery in terms of salary so most people are actually lining up to work for the oil refinery another challenge is also the lack of public transportation here in San Kreutz were not all the applicants has had vehicles and that percentage challenge for us because we need people that are able to move around the volute we are actually a little different than our specific counterparts in terms of the operation itself we are doing a list enumerate simultaneously here we will be conducting our listing operation starting on March 1st and the enumeration will be simultaneously conducted as well the timeframe is the same for us here the March 1st through June 30th and with follow-up it's in July June 13 July 1st and our materials are to be shipped to the mainland by not by not later than the end of July we are similar to my counterparts we are working with trusted voices here we are engaging with civil societies and religious organizations on the island and we are coordinating with organizations that work directly with hard to count populations such as immigrant communities as well as the homeless population and the children and as a matter of fact we actually receive a draft of a very beautiful book that was published by the community foundation here in the Virgin Islands the book is gone we count is called we count and is a book intended for children's and their parents to educate children's and care and their parents on the importance of participating on the census we also working with the public official here we're working with the governor's office as well as Miss Platt his office will receive a PSA from his class cape and we're currently working with the governor's office to record another PSA on behalf of the 2020 census here and his office is also going to publish a press release with a call for participation another person that has been involved is the attorney general office she is ready to publish a press release soon after we started our collection operation that will educate the public on the importance of participating but also to look out for in posters and scammers so here you know we're working directly with the university's Virgin Island who is responsible for behind and the actual data collection operation and Dan and I are working very closely to ensure that there is a synchronization between the two offices so it's practically seamless if you come here you will not see much difference between how we are running the operation because it's all as work as one so pretty much that's all I have thank you Thank You Tomas last but not the least and oil is our adviser to think comma st. John's or chicken USB I fan Thank You Jenni good evening good morning everyone so right now Tomas then myself our operation looks pretty similar we are preparing to make assignments for address listing and enumerated at the same time we are in a crunch time right now training all of our field staff currently we are fully operational in the office and are in our fully staffed and we're about 75% higher in terms of our field set Tomas mentioned the outreach the outreach for the Virgin Islands is the same for st. Thomas and st. Croix and we have partnership specialists that work together to ensure that we have a unified front in the in the messaging for the Virgin Islands I will also just say that if you're familiar with the st. Thomas area we are located directly across the street from the airport at the Cyril King Airport and to reach either st. Thomas st. John or sink or you can call three four zero seven one eight twenty twenty and press one two or three for which office you'd like to get thank you great thank you so much Dan and thank you all to our census advisers so that brings us to our wrap-up of our overview of our census operations in the island areas I know this was a lot of information that we have given you so we would like to open up a time if anyone has questions Tonya but that brings us to our part of our our presentation today thank you very much Jennifer to you and the entire team calling in from all of the US territories who are so happy to hear from everyone is there anybody on the line who would like to pose a question while we wait for for somebody who might want to pose a question I have a question for you and I want to take you back to slide number eight can you see it Jennifer slide 8 yes we're on it uh-huh my question was you mentioned that the census stateside is it the questions on the the census stateside is it those are the questions in the first column only that's right so that's what we call the short form that will be asked of the stateside census including Puerto Rico where they will be asked this short form and then the remainder of the questions are asked on the American Community Survey which is on a rolling basis on your annual mm-hmm okay wonderful and it's those green ones that are highlighted that are specific only to the territories correct those are the four subjects that we added to the American Community Survey to accommodate it for that made us cry wonderful the other question I have is I thought that there was a citizenship question on the on the issue there was a citizenship quiz they're not there will be notice it into a question on any of the 2020 census questionnaires okay good okay another question I have is I wondered given all of the there are many people who are living in the mainland from the from the US territories is there any sort of collaboration or some of the experience that you've acquired being in the territories and working in the territories on making sure that folks from the territories in the mainland are counted or to do those areas not merge at all in your world yeah so yeah looks like two very different operations so there is an entire operation stateside that caused everyone who resides on stateside and then those who are in the territory so those are two very separate operations but people are counted in the place of their usual home if their usual home is in the territories and they get counted in the territory census if the usual home is on stateside and they will be common in that operation I thank you very much I am not seeing any indication that there are questions I think your presentation was done very well folks I do have a somebody on the line who would like to ask the question please go ahead can you all hear me yes we can down I'm not sure of your flattery yes we can mayor you hello we could hear you please ask your question hi I had a quick question about the veterans that are counted in the census so we do have some veterans that are living on the mainland because they're having difficulty receiving care in the Virgin Islands is there some kind of stipulation that it counts for those veterans that are living away but are from the Virgin Islands they're just living away for the purposes of receiving care so it brings me back to the mainland operation versus the territory operation and so a lot of your day we don't really hello the end of the day we don't get the full funding because the veterans that do reside of the Virgin Islands are not counted because they're not there at the time they're receiving care elsewhere and so it kind of messes up our veteran numbers yes as your havel are you going yeah I went again to account yeah so once again we count people where they live most of the time so we ask them to make that determination in that year if they're living in the Virgin Islands most of the time and they get common in the Virgin Islands if they're living on stateside most of the time they will get counted there so the Census Bureau's cannot make that determination for that individual they would determine where they live most of the time and be counted okay all right thank you so much I have I had a wanted to let you know to the caller who just asked the question also that next in two weeks on Thursday March 5 starting at 3 p.m. Eastern we will be talking about the Census and the military so you can we can pose that question as well at that time okay thank you so much hi can you all hear me yeah oh okay great Dara mone fuh I'm over on st. Thomas I met with dr. Mills today and also have been speaking with them Patrese Johnson just because we've been for the vi source been trying to get some clarification on the change between the 2010 and the 2020 instrument regarding people's abilities to be more specific with their place of origin ethnic group whatever it might be is there any clarification on that that anyone can share I did see the difference visually and the understanding was that we have more of an ability to be specific in the 2010-2020 instrument then has been in the 20-10 instrument like I know words like Negro are no longer on the document anymore but in terms of people being able to identify that they are from the Virgin Islands from Jamaica from Katy wherever that might be is that something that's actually new or or can anyone specifies with what actually is the thing that steps new sure so you're asking about how we have we find our question rewarding that has been in chance from 2010 to 2020 is that what you're asking correct yeah and I see the difference visibly on the page but um just yeah sure yeah so the Census Bureau over the decade has done extensive research on how to enhance the way that we ask these questions and fortunately for us we have Marissa Hotchkiss who's my branch chief over the content and form design who actually designed a questionnaire for the entire 2020 census operation verse if you wanna jump in and give some examples of how we have enhanced the question wording for 2020 okay because we noticed that is it there's obviously is going be Rijo yeah well Murray sauce yes can you jump in you might be mu how's that can you hear me now yes okay I'm okay thank you hello everyone and just two can add a little more background for everyone else on the call since you have seen the raise question I'm sure you're aware but the question that will be on the questionnaires in 2020 has both checkboxes and right in fields so the idea being that people can select one or more boxes that correspond with how they identify and they also have an opportunity to print detailed origins in the write-in field below the categories so what's different is some of the examples that we provide as a possible example origins or something life provide have been updated and then some of the terms for the categories have been updated as well and but overall you have more of an opportunity to print a detailed origin that you identify with thank you very much Marissa this is Tonya from interior again I wanted to let our caller know that we did have a webinar last week on on that very question with Rachel marks and Paul Jacobs and you're looking right now at our website I will be in the next couple of days making sure that that website is updated you will be able to see the PowerPoint

on we have all of our census contacts on on the website as well okay thank you so much I did see another question her do you have a question would you like to let us know okay the question is are the 20/20 questionnaire is available for viewing or accessible online now okay so the question was how accessible will the questioner be for the island area francis's this is going to be 100% enumeration that will be done by interviewer so we won't be visiting each of the households and each of the numerators will be asking the question do an interview format so there will not be an option where they go online and fill it on their own they will actually be contacted by a offensive taker who will be interviewing them in person okay and just in case the question is more broad will can you go online right now and see a sample census questionnaire for the for the mainland as well for the mainland so when we saw it went yeah in order to have our questioners finalized we have to get clearance from the Office of Management and Budget so when we were getting to onda clearance we posted all of our sample questionnaires on this site that she'll still be up on that 1b website okay I will track that down and provide a link to that website for our listeners and those who are interested so to my my participant who asked that question just FYI maybe check in in the next couple of days and we'll get that posted online for you any other question out go ahead Jennifer yes oh that was it from our side I didn't have anything else to add okay thank you so Oh anyway have to next joint go ahead oh I was thinking that one more question I note that there are differences between the instruments and some methodology used on the US continental versus what is used in the Virgin Islands is there anywhere that there's like a summary of of the differences and maybe justifications for the differences or at least a summary of the differences sure on the census website what we release is the operational plan for the 2020 census I can work with Tonya to send out the link to all of you that goes through all of our operation for 2020 census and there is a measure of someone speaking a challenge or a nut hearing so you may be on your if you are speaking can anyone hear me right now yes okay so we have the 2020 census operational plan that is available online I'm Tonya I can work with you to send that link out to you you can share with everyone who's on this call and within the operational plan it talks about the different operations of the 2020 census and the differences and the similarities that
