 Recent research has shown that almost all modern CPUs are affected by micro-architectural attacks such as Spectre and Data Sampling. Most variants of Spectre, attack the branch prediction unit or BPU. During speculative execution, the BPU is used to guess the destination of each branch. Our intuition here is that jumping to the predicted destination of each branch is equivalent to traversing an edge on the control flow graph of the program. Having access to the BPU that is shared between processes, attackers can pollute it by injecting a malicious target which redirects the speculative control flow of the victim, to a Spectre-leaking gadget. To mitigate this class of attacks, we designed SPECCFI which enforces the control flow integrity principles. SPECCFI constraints the execution of the program to a precomputed control flow graph, preventing the attackers from altering the control-flow to execute a malicious code gadget.
