 hi good afternoon everyone so today we are actually at the downtown very near to marina bay sands so right behind later we'll show you right behind you is the marina bay sands okay so today our video we're going to talk a little bit about what has been happening recently so more about talking about is how blockchain has been influencing government for the four start right so this first uh thing we're going to share to you is that this bank of thailand bank, they launched the world's first government saving bond on IBM blockchain right so of course according to the Taiwan market association the outstanding thai bond market is standing at about 400 421 U.S 421 billion US dollars right that's of 2019 so government bonds dominate the thai market uh at about 30 37 of it that's about 157 billion US dollars so of course in the past the government saving bonds was very time consuming very complex it involves a lot of party and then they rely a lot on non-real-time system and it's very troublesome so with this blockchain coming into the picture it streamlines the process and of bond issuance and of course for the underwriters the registrar's investors everybody that's involved in this bond market this this uh this whole thing it makes life easier for them yeah so of course the most important thing is it actually reduces or rather minimizes the redundant validation process yeah so of course for government you will want everything to be more you want everything to be faster more efficient as the world is engaging into blockchain you do not want to result so so that's that's what we have for you for Thailand and uh we believe that Thailand has been very it's a little bit just like Singapore we have always been on uh on the go in terms of the development of blockchain technology i think involved getting blockchain involved in the economy yeah i think that's a good news for Thailand and i hope the Thailand will will invest more in the blockchain technology this should be the same like china that invests in blockchain technology and IBM one of the strongest event advancing technology and the server i say you know trying to use my year i've been developing technology of course and now they use and apply the blockchain technology in a security camera and this is a very interesting thing because as far as you know you and i know so far security camera is just security camera i mean what do you want to expect more from a security camera or cctv so this particular company they have tried they are trying to integrate indoor security camera powered by uh powered by blockchain technology so of course uh the main idea here is that the user can access their camera data through decentralized system yeah that's interesting as i see this they the company they call it IoTCX and they uh they will develop the data the security camera based on the blockchain technology and keep the private key the user can access the data and then they can see that another incredible button of course this camera or the camera or the user's mobile phone handle all the computing all the encryption encryption whatever so basically they are putting the control into a user's hand letting the users control their own data and and they say that the system to decide to avoid the type of better security yeah so they don't keep any uh username as well of the company and it is a company they first do this and they must rely on funding by themselves yeah so that is an interesting thing when it comes to how far blockchain has been entering into our daily life you know security camera right there yeah so there is this he introduced his meta master sometime ago so i think it's very cute it's very interesting especially if you are using a computer there this follows your cursor right there's this head of the fox following your cursor so Metamask they recently hit 1 million users of course thanks to this decentralized finance mode yeah so they have metamask the ether is an ethereum browser wallet they have it developed by consensus consensus yes yeah and it's it surplus one million uh active active users for the first time so of course uh right now i think they are also releasing this since September 4th yeah of course in the computer it's actually very easy to use right yeah i can link link this mobile phone wallet to the computer and then you can do all sorts of funny things so i learned how to use this last year i learned how to use it to okay next we will start to talk about uh something more macro perspective or something more uh applicable to everyone else that is energy so Beijing China they have this um clean what okay this title says they are winning the clean energy rates how how far are they hit by the pressure so of course as you know the world's energy system is changing very rapidly a few months ago we did a video talking about renewable energy in the form of uh energy or demand uh remember the molten salt tower yeah so uh yeah a lot of countries are using that a lot of countries are adopting this technology that harness the energy of the sun pointing all the mirrors on the tower and then they collect the heat and then this heat can be used to burn heat up the water and spin the turbine any time any time of day even midnight early in the morning when there is no sun because this motion hot molten salt tower system it can keep the heat off the saw for a long time and even overnight it probably just lose three percent of four percent of five percent of the heat which is still enough for it to burn heat up the water to create the steam for the time they call that energy which i think is very valid yeah of course if you're talking about saving the environment we are talking about uh not using coal yeah that's what you know you have to go in mine for the coal you have to burn the coal you have to spoil the environment with the carbon but this molten salt is a different thing altogether so let's talk about china beijing again so of course the last decade we have seen exponential growth of the use of wind also has always been a go-to thing in this era when of course you need to have this super huge yesterday i saw on CNA and so there's a green city in china yeah they have some of the electricity Wheels yeah interesting yeah so of course uh for this project china is hoping that by 2030 that's 10 years from now by 2030 the carbon will be near what okay the country's intention is to take this division by 2030 and be carbon neutral in 50 years time 2060 you know we are 2020 right well that's 40 years title 2060 they are ah of course not immediately not immediately so mr Elon Musk and Tesla you know what we're thinking that's why because uh nice's good news i hear from some of the new Hopkins says this is very smooth so i think i think all this moving forward will be interesting and if you're looking at the progress of those big companies getting themselves committed to a low carbon emission i don't think that is a signal that the world is going to change i mean look at all i don't think we will need a lot of oil in the future yeah that's fine and this day uh from the channel i also share some information about about Xeonbit Project with XNB and XNS liquidity for our Crypto Currencies in the meantime this is this is our output i'm gonna show you this is marina bay sands and that is the what do you call it um this is um what is that called Singapore yeah sorry guys i've only been there twice so um right over at this side this is the marina bay financial center yeah  and right okay goodbye guys see you again
