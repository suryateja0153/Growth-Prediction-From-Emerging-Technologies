 [MUSIC].  I'm Rohan Kumar, Corporate Vice-president Engineering of Azure Data. As organizations look to adopt AI, they face immediate challenge in developing and using AI responsibly. Customers want to understand the inner workings of their AI models. What is driving them? Are they accurate and unbiased? How to build and use them while protecting PII data and staying compliant. To address these concerns, we're announcing several new capabilities in Azure machine learning. These are designed to empower data scientists and developers to understand, protect, and control data and models throughout the machine learning lifecycle. With these new capabilities, they can understand model behavior by getting explanations of how models work, [inaudible] training and inferencing, as well as assessing fairness and mitigating bias. Protect through differential privacy compute capabilities to build models using sensitive data while safeguarding the privacy of individuals. Control by tracking the entire machine learning process and maintaining an audit trail of all the machine learning assets to meet regulatory and compliance requirements. This journey is just the beginning and I cannot wait to share more with you soon. We can't wait to see what you build with all this amazing innovation. [MUSIC]
