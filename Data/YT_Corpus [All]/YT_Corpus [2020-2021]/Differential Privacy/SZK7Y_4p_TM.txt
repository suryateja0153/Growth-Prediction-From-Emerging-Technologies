 hi I'm Charlotte Ruby and today I'll be presenting SIB tools and our package to measure synthetic data utility what is centrioles these tools is a package with functions to aid in the quality control of partially and fully synthetic data for differential privacy purposes scenario you have just created a fully or partially synthetic data set how can synth tools help you first use the data comm function which determines if the original and synthetic data sets have identical attributes such as dimensions variable order and classification and factor levels this ensures that the synthetic datasets utility can be properly measured next use the perforates function this calculates overall and specific variable perturbation rates this can be helpful to check early in the synthetic data creation process to ensure sensitive variables are adequately preserved if applicable use the logic check function this will indicate if there are any logical consistency issues between variables for example in Pennsylvania a person cannot be married unless they are at least 17 years old and therefore should not have a value of marriage indicating that they are eligible to be married finally use an appropriate confidence interval function these functions calculate confidence intervals and standard errors of variables of interest canta canta CI function is used for one continuous variable the one cat CI function is used for one categorical variable and the two cat CI function is used for the cross tabulation of two categorical variables for more information about synth tools or how to use these functions please see the documentation pages provided in the synth tools package thank you for your interest in synth tools
