 [Music] okay so an obvious queer object would be something that someone takes with them in queer pride parade for instance so placard classic placard might be we're here we get used to it people hold it up wave it around something like that is something which very much speaks to the sense of community a sense of identity and politics of queer life so the placard is probably the most obvious obvious object the rainbow flag of course has a history that dates back to the 1970s which is quite interesting uh but also the clothing that people wear in a case like that that's maybe glittery and sparkly and not the kind of thing you'd wear generally wandering down lambton key something like that you know those are obvious kind of queer objects i think a non-obvious clear object would be something that's not obviously um signifying queerness in itself might be a telephone which plays an important role in networks of queer social connectedness for instance the telephone line the helpline which was really a development of the 1970s and 80s the telephone doesn't look like a queer object there's nothing inherently queer about it but it allows a set of community building activities political kind of movement people to ring in and get support and to find a community for themselves okay so now that we know what a queer object may look like let's have a look at an example from the collection all right this started life as a very ordinary policeman's helmet owned by a sergeant called trevor morley who is responsible for a resting carmen the very well-known celebrity probably in the 1960s when she turned 70 though in the late 2000s he presented this to her somewhat queered up purple little thing on the front and in red and a bit of glitter to make it a really queer kind of thing if we tip it upside down what we see in the inside too carmen happy 17th 17th birthday and thanks for the memories hello new zealand the money or the bag in 2008 air new zealand undertook the pink flights taking new zealanders to mardi gras in sydney this was one of the objects that lucky travelers could take with them on their trans testament journey a delicious lovely pink bag to mark the occasion and a memento to remember it afterwards something that on the face of it doesn't look essentially queer actually has a really interesting queer history this sign was held up in a protest during homosexual law reform in 1985 it's a reference to a petition which allegedly 800 000 new zealanders signed several signatures many in fact were signed multiple times there were signatures from mickey mouse and donald duck and a number of other fictitious characters and so this sign saying i signed it a lot and in actual fact the 800 000 is nothing like it at all quite a famous little moment from the homosexual law reform campaign whether something is obviously queer or less obviously queer that only has meaning in the context in which we explore where display or use the object that we're talking about so a sign in one context is queer if we know what it's all about a pink bag is queer if we know the flight that was taken on and a telephone is queer if it entered into a whole network of opportunities and social possibilities so really context is the key
