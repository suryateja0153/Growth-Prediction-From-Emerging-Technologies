more bitcoin headline news and analysis soon bitcoin BTC to reach $137,000 by october 2023 if historical trend is followed analysts the $137,000 bitcoin call although the crypto market has yet to break out to the upside investors have continued to speculate where bitcoin BTC will pick next one analyst notes that it will be far above $20,000 which BTC first reached in late 2017 market psychology specialist philip swift recently took to twitter to explain his call citing indicators from willie Wuan the bitcoin network momentum here is your bitcoin date and price forecast for the next dollar BTC cycle price top done by combining bitcoin network momentum and edwin Amex top cap you can now book in that Lambo test drive for autumn 2023 I pick twitter.com KN 0 6 q 8 t 5f d philip swift at positive crypto March 4th 2019 Swift notes that is per top cap and the momentum indicator which gauges transactional throughput BTC is most likely to have a market capitalization of 1.7 trillion dollars to two point six trillion dollars by October 2023 meaning a per calling price of around 92 thousand dollars to 137 thousand dollars he adds that more likely than not transactional volume on the blockchain has likely reached a low setting a positive precedent for medium term price action Swift's analysis elicited a response from Wu who created the model he used to call a top the Australian researcher noted that making such an estimate forecasts so early in the game is like trying to catch a pop fly with your eyes closed regardless who noted that this is still fun hence why people make such analysis decisions regardless in the past the industry commentator has claimed that it is only a matter of time before BTC meanders back to its $20,000 hi in a number of comments on Twitter the trader stated that he believes that fundamentals are stronger than ever the popular analyst even remarked that eventually bitcoin will recover just like the past touching on the fact that institutions mainstream media and representatives of the traditional realm of finance bashing the cryptocurrency is amazing not the craziest crypto prediction although one hundred thirty seven thousand dollars for a single unit of the flagship cryptocurrency is preposterous by current standards Swift's prediction is far from the most optimistic per previous reports from ethereum World News dollar carface Scarface a popular trader on Twitter first noted that it would be irrational to claim that BTC won't undergo another parabolic cycle he added that if the cryptocurrency follows its historical habit of rallying to five point one to sixteen point eight nine times above its previous peak Bitcoin could move to three hundred thirty-seven thousand dollars in the next market cycle this of course is well above Swift's call but is still in the sextuple digits range the aforementioned survivalism has noted that while the last cycle returns 16x as BTC ran from $1,200 to $20,000 the next cycle could post even greater returns the analyst attributing the hopeful forecasts to adoption and bitcoins resiliency on a global stage thus concluded that a pump to $750,000 wouldn't be illogical yet some have claimed that eventually the leading digital asset will break out of being sub 1 million dollars especially as the legacy economy could begin to buckle under heavy debts Jesse London the vice president of IBM's blockchain and digital asset branch recently took to an interview with finder dot-com to explain why 1 million dollars is possible he explained that while BTC is only likely to end 2019 $5,000 over time 1 million dollars could be in the cards especially as institutions and the public siphon capital into this space creating a positive feedback loop that pushes prices higher

the go-to platform for digital asset prices but remains one of the most visited websites on the Internet while cane market cap CMC has managed to play a vital role in introducing cryptocurrencies to new investors since the early days of the altcoin market the platform has increasingly commander scrutiny for its lack of professionalism and questionable business practices a problematic pricing methodology those who have been in crypto for longer than 5 minutes know not to trust kin market caps prices the main reason for this is it's problematic pricing methodology to calculate the asset prices you see on its platform kin market cap takes a volume weighted average of market pair prices the rationale for using a weighted average is because in general markets with higher volume have higher liquidity and are less prone to price fluctuations while CMC does state that it excludes exchanges if the exchanges price does not seem indicative of a free market price the platform seems to happily accept all exchanged later fees as they come seemingly without conducting due diligence on the legitimacy of the trading platforms data sources several exchanges that can market cap includes for its data feed our small unregulated exchanges whose data integrity is more than questionable the volume of any cryptocurrency is the total spot trading volume reported by all exchanges over the last 24 hours for that cryptocurrency the company states on its website kin market cap does mention though that it refrains from using volume data if an exchange does not enforce the trading fee or otherwise offers significant incentives to trade on the market pair however this does not even come close to filtering out all exchanges that engage in washed trading CMC's volume data is far from representative of an assets available liquidity it has been reported on numerous occasions that many digital asset exchange volumes are not representative of an assets real trading activity and thus its actual liquidity the blockchain transparency Institute has recently published a report highlighting this issue therefore since CMC puts more weight on prices from exchanges with the highest trading volumes which are often falsified the prices on the platform cannot give an accurate representation of the price level of crypto sitter's actually trading an unfortunate history of promoting scams while cane market camps history of promoting cryptocurrency scans through banner ads may not have many implications on the quality of its data feed it would suggest that the company's leadership ethics are questionable as castle island ventures partner Nick Carter highlighted in a blog post kin market cap has run ads for cryptocurrencies counts bit connect its connect and bit petite for which the company has been paid handsomely at the expense of unwitting investors who eventually lost money moreover kin market cap pranked bit connect in its top 10 cryptocurrencies in July 2017 when the market value of the BCC coin merited an entry the issue however was that the day to use to calculate BCC's market capitalisation came predominantly from the Ponzi scheme zone exchange day T feed myth 7 kin market cap hosted by connect banner ads for 5 months it was actually six - Nick Carter at Nick underscore underscore Carter made the fourth 2018 despite warnings from notable community members kin market cap did not Delos BCC and continued to rank it among the most valuable coins in the market additionally even after bit Connect collapsed its fraudulent coin was still being priced on kin market camp for another six months a lack of coin due diligence the kin market cap bit connect story also highlights the issue of the platform's complete lack of dude for the digital currencies and tokens it lists while one may argue that the crypto set markets are the pinnacle of free markets and that any tradable asset deserves to have its price listed the reality is that retail investors often with little to no investment knowledge go on to Kin market cap to discover new investment opportunities by listing effectively every tradable digital asset regardless of how do you piss it maybe kin market cap is facilitating potentially fraudulent cryptocurrency projects by introducing them to potential investors the number of scan coins that have come and gone and had been listed on CMC are in the dozens if not hundreds CMC has seemingly made little to no effort to filter out assets that have a high potential of turning out to be scams use can market cap with care kin market cap is an excellent platform if you want a quick and dirty snapshot of whether market roughly is however using kin market camp prices to make trading decisions or worse to price financial instruments or value portfolios means opening yourself up to an added layer of risk kin market caps shortcomings are perhaps most pronounced when it comes to small cap crypto suits where the price listed on CMC is regularly far away from where you can actually trade the asset especially if you are looking to trade more than a few hundred dollars the current pricing methodology deployed by kin market cap combined with its lack of due diligence makes the platform unusable for serious investors hence it is not surprising that a range of new crypto set price data platforms have launched in the last few years as financial institutions are searching for trustworthy pricing to build new cryptocurrency based financial products and solutions kin market cap remains the go-to crypto pricing source for retail investors and this is unlikely to change soon the platform's first mover advantage has enabled it to establish itself as an authority despite its evident shortcomings for the sake of new investors entering the space commentators can only hope that CMC cleans up its act and improves the quality of the data it provides on its platform want to see accurate up to the nanosecond

the importance of security around private keys dot the entry of institutions into the cryptocurrency sector has been an important point of discussion in the crypto sphere this reason was the backbone of the hype created by the entry of fidelity into the world of digital assets in a recent interview during the d c-- blockchain summit Tom Jessup the head of fidelity digital assets stated that the organization had planned to get a foot in the crypto race for a long time he revealed that fidelity had hired cryptographers and other officials earlier to ensure that they were always one step ahead in the crypto race Jessup stated that when he joined the company many companies were getting ready to bring in digital assets at a time when the buzz around Bitcoin was blooming he said one of the main areas of focus is to understand the current market infrastructure and to create a roadmap aim to go further by integrating new technologies the security around private keys is another aspect we consider and understand because we have been mining Bitcoin for some time we had the DNA earlier all we need to learn is how to transfer it Tom Jessup also claimed that fidelity had secure locations in multiple jurisdictions and multiple cold storages ie storages that have never touched a network in the ecosystem according to Jessup fidelity wants to launch a state-of-the-art platform by the end of 2019 he also addressed the expectation that fidelity would conduct of grand launch of the platform in q1 Jessup added we will also begin scaling of the platform but that is easier said than done the company needs licenses and jurisdiction when earlier the interest was largely around cryptocurrencies and native hedge funds fidelity also commissioned a study to talk to many institutions about crypto allocations with an aim to solve the issue of market volatility in an earlier interview with CNBC Jessup touched upon the lack of education in the space and said they've approached us wanting
