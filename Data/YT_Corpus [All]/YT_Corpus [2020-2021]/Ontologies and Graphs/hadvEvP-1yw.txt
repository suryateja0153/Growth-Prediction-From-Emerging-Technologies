 hello there everyone welcome to with the neo4j online Meetup a couple of things before we get everyone started for maximum visibility we suggest that you set your resolution does 720 megapixel you can adjust that on the bottom right of this video if you have any questions while you're watching the video live you can ask them on the right-hand side there is a chat window you can ask them right there and if you have any questions after the live stream has ended you're able to ask them on the community site there's actually a thread where you can ask them directly to the presenter and if you've enjoyed the presentation please give it a thumbs up on YouTube and if you're interested in presenting in the future you can also post you about your project in the community site under the project's category or the content category and just tell us about what you're working on and then we would consider the that's what we consider the talks for future online meetups so I'm going to get us started to introduce myself I am Corrine Wallach I am the community manager at neo4j and I am here with my colleague Mark Needham mark hello I'm mark I work in our developer relations team in London and in the time that Kareem was explaining to you about the community site I put a link for David's project on the side so if you're watching afterwards and you have any questions don't forget to ask them there I which I guess leaves us with our third person of the meetup which is David so I guess David I'll let you introduce yourself thank you very much guys I guess I'm a my name's Dave Stevens I'm a distinguished architect at DXE technology and I'm gonna present the thinking why we've created this product called digital Explorer using neo today and I'm gonna still walk through some of the modules and some of the approaches that we've got and give a little bit a demo as well so that's that's the plan for this one okay so let me share my screen I've got a couple of slides um but I'm going to mark across there I'm gonna drop out of these and show you some demos as well as you see the platform so so just for your reference as well we're actually delighted from where I'm working with me Oh last year we this project also won the digital transformation award Graff connect last year I'm in New York so it's kind of testament to the fact that how we've approached it within DXE to actually become digital ourselves and run this as an agile project so there was kind of a lot of proof points both in the the foundational technology what we're doing but also how we implemented and delivered this project as well so really really pleased are pleased with part one so just to let you guys know in terms of where I am so I'm based in the UK as I mentioned I'm a distinguished architect at DXE and I'm the product owner and architect of digital Explorer which I'm going to go go through today I'm based in the UK and you've got my links there you can click through those or you can find them on the neo4j and community site as well um so those that aren't aware of who the EXCI are and why we've been looking at this problem so the XE is approaching two years old it's the creational was created as a result of the merger of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services and CSC to create a new outsourcing and digital transformation company to meet the new demands so that's essentially who DXE are and just some numbers for you in terms of the scale or so very large organization and then and looking at that challenge of how can technology how is technology changing the landscape for our clients finally progress from data center migration office 365 migration what does the what is digital truly mean so a lot of the immediately the the start of the the launch of DXE was really looking at what is digital what is digital transformation and how we gonna be relevant going forward so a lot of the work that I've been doing within within my team and of course my colleagues it's been it's been looking at that and trying to understand that which is why we've created digital Explorer so what I'm gonna go through is how we understand digital now and how we use that through a and I call out some of the reference points as to why we're doing it with a graph and and and where we started as well and I'm probably gonna mention where we started at the end of my little summary of as the modules which we have within our within our platform but essentially what we've created is a connected knowledge platform to allowed the XE to understand the technology ships and then progress that through to a set of the delivered outcomes and I got introduced to two neo probably two and a half three years ago we were looking at solution modeling architecture technology modeling and how an Archie made model could be actually represented as data and hitting that wall very early on that I can't do this in a relational database I've got to have something different so that kind of light bulb moment of modeling and being able to represent things as they truly are really sort of accelerated mine and my colleagues thinking in terms of the potential of what we could actually do with this and I'll step through this and you'll see you know there's a lot of things when I was learning about graph modeling is limits it is the white book the whiteboard becomes the data model and for those that are familiar with with graph modeling you'll see that there's a bit more behind our data model as as I walk through this but the majority of what our data model is is what I'm going to show on this single slide as we progress through that through the actual journey within our platform so so I mentioned flow for us with it within DXE it's really really key for us now to understand how technology is shifting and changing the outcomes across industry no longer data centers is all about technology brings value directly to the line of business so for us we've got to be able to understand what is that technology mean in the context of each industry so we've got to understand blockchain in banking means this and blockchain in retail means this and in supply chain it means this so our first module that we have and we've modeled within within graph is that foundational set of reference points for us in terms of that digital landscape so we essentially have a very large set of data and many many industry use cases around key technology shifts so we can then apply that and understand the level of maturity of blockchain of augmented reality of robotic process automation all of the sort of the buzzwords that around digital we're able to distill that down to meaningful use cases in the context of an industry but also the value chain within that industry so if we take it a step further in the sense of if we've got augmented reality we can then shape that around now this in automotive design its use cases are a in automotive manufacture it's use faces are be seen D and asked an aftermarket it's the EF so we're able to really specify and build up a very rich model of those of those disruptors and that's really really powerful it allows us to relate to to the client their line of business their strategic intent that's good but we've got to take it further we've got to be able to then actually so we've got this foundational knowledge this kind of onion constrained to our current portfolio our current partners but actually how do we now take that forward and start to truly relate that to the client and our future clients so what we do into the next module that we have within our platform is a way where people can upload information about the client or refer to information about the client and start getting some indicators around their digital strategy so we can take an investor report from a client we can take an RFP from a client and we can very quickly map that against on our trends graph and call out for this client these things are relevant they're looking at these areas and we progress that forward into a into a digital map or digital blueprint so they're able to analyze the clients requirements using our graph using sums of natural language processing in terms of matching and building some logic and insights around that and progress that very quickly to create a very rich digital blueprint is essentially a road map so within that when we start to capture the KPIs the client goals the relevant enabling technology that can allow them to reach that goal so we've got we're using the power of the information to progress and forward to that and the ultimate output of that digital blueprint are a list of ideas ideas that have been framed based on the analytics that we've applied to the clients intent to that industry use cases that we have and then from there our account teams can take those ideas and then start mapping in well these DXE offerings are a fit here these partners are a fit here because we've also ingested our offerings and our partner capabilities against that same foundational set of technology disruptor information they're able to easily find this idea is seeking to address these goals these KPIs needs of these enabling pieces of technology very very simple connection through to these offerings these partners can come together and create the final required solution and it's that solution model it's exactly where we started with in this project when we were looking at our solution architecture and an arc innate modeling so that solution is already pre-populated with the business motivations from that flow of the idea from the blueprint to the client strategic papers and an intent insight that we've captured through to the functional layers where we're starting to capture these building blocks are coming together to actually and deliver this solution so that so what there's no this is not rocket science in itself in terms of it's a pretty standard approach to them understand what the client one shaped that creates and some insights and some ideas deliver a solution what we were able to achieve here is really connect that end-to-end through the whole platform both for a single account but then for many other accounts as well so so we've got a couple of things I just wanted to call out here in terms of some of the of algorithms and approaches that we're using within our platform so that first part around and that shift from understanding to shaping who have a smart document reader I mentioned we can drop in a PDF or a PowerPoint or an excel file and it will read it and extract out digital information it will span across across across the graph that then gets us into a number of areas where we're using the recommendation engine approaches so as I read in the clients document I can already get insights in terms of which people have been writing about these trends which people have been delivering solutions against these trends that the client is looking for might want to bring them into my team then also which solutions do we already have as well and that progresses forward into when we're actually building the more structured roadmap so if I if I'm building my roadmap I'd get line-of-sight left and right within my within my industry area but also up and down around adjacent industries so there are recommendation engine spans across the full graph so if I'm building my my roadmap and I drop in blocking but my in my industry isn't is in-house care I can immediately start getting recommendations around what other accounts when they started referencing blockchain in healthcare in their roadmap they started including these other enabling technologies and brought in these people and these solutions could also be composited that so that level of connectivity is becoming more and more sort of complete as that goes through so he connects that through the platform end-to-end and we just take that across the board everything that we're doing I gave started with the case around blockchain and it's relevant across different industries augmented reality and its relevance across different industries that applies at every single point within that lifecycle you can find people we can find solutions we can connect across things and it allows us internally to get a completely different view in terms of investment potential we can look at communities of interest within our graph so we can very quickly analyze our roadmaps and identify common ideas but are those either the roadmaps are calling out that maybe in completely different regions in completely different industries but we're able to use similarity matching to actually identify say this cluster of 10 ideas 15 ideas 80% the same thing they're talking about the same technology they have the same goals and aspirations so we're really able to have to leverage the power of the graph to allow us to do that and that just then accelerates forward as I mentioned in terms of well once I've got that idea got a deliverer against it how do we build the solution what solution building blocks are available to me so that connectivity just extends all around it's not it's not a single thread it truly is in the way we are sort of it's a mesh of information which we've which we've created that is that essentially at that those simple to the four modules that we have connect or that information together and allow us to do things in a different way and see things in a different way and sort of remove that the silos that we have particularly in large organizations sometimes as well so we can break down those those natural barriers so what if we got it's available now what the other thing I wanted to mention as well that we have open sourced this as well so our data model is out then we will share all of the links and for this as well and you can also access this and you can have a look you'll get a limited set of content you and see all solutions you won't see all your own seat roadmaps and for example but you'll get a taste of what's inside there but we've taken that graph approach and that connected approach together with our digital methodology that our digital blueprint methodology and we've added in a number of sort of lenses or views or sensory applications on on top of that the first one that we have it at the very top is Play Books and it's really there just to allow our teams to create interactive ebooks based on the content that's available to them so they can very quickly create a presentation essentially but pulling in relevant trends from their clients industry now what are the top three trends to talk about in manufacturing one of my best reference solutions in manufacturing pull that information that very very quickly create these interactive books but then we get into the real sort of engine and the working part of the platform trains is very much our foundational reference point so it's that catalog of information I'll show you some views of that in a moment and then we get into actually running that process through we've got to understand our clients intent so there we have workspaces real time online collaboration of content so I can create a workspace I can invite my colleagues we can all upload throw documents into that you'll read them it'll extract out the digital relevance of that information and then we can use that to shape and understand our clients intent and we then transfer that information across into a roadmap where we can then really start to focus in on okay this is the ultimate goal these are the building blocks week we need to position out these the ideas which we're going to have a game online collaborative essentially if you sort of think of post-it notes being able to drag-and-drop post-it notes and then you always looking at the graph always adjusting those recommendations and in the background and then the final part is solutions the ideas progress from the roadmap create solution so we capture not the final not just the final solution view point but we also capture the concept the prototype that the pilot solutions as well so we create multiple viewpoints of the solution excuse me have a drink and then at the very bottom of this so we have a graph Explorer we're using a lot of d3 for our visualization and I can show you some views of that that in a moment it's all powered by Neos all of this information is connected using neo4j and essentially so those are our our main modules we've also done a couple of little side projects that we have around sort of trying to sort of no challenge ourselves internally it's not shown on this slide but and we use workplace and internally to Facebook at work and couple of guys one guy in Asia one of my developers in Poland let's create a bot let's create a bot inside workplace that will we can have a conversation with say hey tell me about the latest solutions in this industry or I'm interested in blockchain and you can have a conversation and the bot can join active conversations within workplace as well so just a way that we're trying to sort of use that information in different ways and engage with users in different ways as well I'm going to show you a couple of examples just to give you some visualization and some ideas of what we've actually got so it's going to run through a few I wanna show just some of the level of the connected connectivity that we have are within within the platform so I'm just gonna drag this across and that you can guys from see it mark show if it's not I think it should be I'm just go along in the log in with my credentials gonna come back to workspaces up so I'm gonna give you a demo of workspace as well but so I give you one example in terms of I mentioned that the connectedness of her information which we have so we have this graph Explorer and module on top of this it's just allows us to show and represent some of that information in different ways we can view or that information that based on the different lens essentially but I want to give you an idea around some of those industry news cases so this view here will just show us those trends those technology trends that have the most connected industry use cases and I can then expand on augmented reality let me just get rid of all the others and just bring an augmented reality so what we can see here the free cup so what we've got in the inner circle are just some of the solutions that we have available for that that trend and these could be concepts from DXE labs these could be solutions from our digital transformation centers they could be the xe+ partner solutions so they are proof points there are real solutions that i've delivered against augment reality then you've also got some people references within there where if you can't read it it might be intentional in terms of some of those areas and then the outer rings we're getting here are they're naturally the relationship through to the industries so we can see zoom in on this size you see we got banking we've got oil and gas we've got high tech we've got retail so you can curse ends there in terms of the amount of industry use cases which we have and then we've got the various use cases being referenced in that central so it's just a graphical way of representing how just one single trend has those that are that amount of connectivity across our graph at the moment so that's one and there's a number of other views which which we can apply such wanted to go to show you show you that one I thought it'd be really interesting I'm gonna just pull us back into the slides on the second so just give you some context in terms of you know a day in the life of digital Explorer and exe and what we're sort of really reaching out and and and achieving with this so bit of a busy slide lots of words but I'll summarize it it's essentially a different view of the slide with which I was presenting previously but I'm going to show top two parts of this within a demo so the first one is okay so we go into a client or we're looking at a client we're working with the client we want to be able to understand their digital intent so we've got that work space upload and information to start making recommendations for me will show you that and then the other part is that I saw one of them take that information and build a road map and I want to create a road map that sort of interactive engaging and also highlighting certain things for move on I want to show you that those pieces as well and I may show a little bit of how we're using the RQ mate notation in terms of representing a solution on how we sort of show that and as well and then how we've essentially honored our key mate but simplify that trying to hide that complexity or around our teammate and its various relationships main so that we don't have to our phone calls talking about is it this relationship type words that this relationships like because it's just a relationship within argument so that's I'm going to go through I'm gonna start with workspaces off that's on there come back to this one close this one down I'm going to create a completely empty works based on for this left neo4j meetups and create this one now while I've got over here on my other screen I'll just track this interview for you is I've just got a couple I've got some demo comes ample content here some of this is all DXE information for the recent investor report information is out there on DXE comm and there's another pieces here but you know this is the type of information that we'd be looking for a client engagement so I've got an empty space there's and I got my catalogue here at the bottoms not really much intelligence here it's just it's just randomly throw readings and stuff based on nothing and if I click click on suggested content there's no results because I have I have no no content um other things I can do here I can invite my colleagues to join this space and we could then collaborate on on this one but what I want to do here is I'm just gonna add the document I'm just gonna pick up one to the general this is white paper from from our CTO around digital directions so I'm just gonna drop that one ends with a PDF and just get that one read and analyzed and then it's gonna look at that document and very quickly there it's just started to identify key technology shifts but also some industry insight as well so did it mention certain industries they didn't mention certain value chains within those industries as well so just to bring in some content and so them so I'm going through this exercise I may add in maybe a banking paper as well it's starting to just build up that view now for those that are we don't have this yet guys to work it those that are you know aware of and aware that the graph model or graph modeling behind it what we've got here is we've got the two attachments here in the middle and in the background we have maintained and creative relationship to say this documents of DevOps was added because it was matched in this document but we also keep keep the occurrence count as well so we build we maintain the number of matches which is made so I can true and see there I can start to build up very quickly a viewpoint of the client and we can we can change the sort of you know we can sort by the matching account so you can put some priority I can remove the grouping so overall I can see banking I dropped in the pension paper was mentioned forty two times within that and technology example so you can very we can very quickly read that document in a magic across that for graph and here I'm not just looking at the trends I'm also looking our information model that we have our own industries so you're also model and document industries and industry value chains and as well so from their sedate me a quick questions is that when you import that the PDF document do you create an over representing the document and then you're pulling apart those other information is notes as well or what is it how does that translate at the moment we're just creating a note for that document we've got some early prototypes where we have actually been raking down the document I haven't mentioned it yet but part of when we were using word net to power our search across across the platform so we're doing similarity matching using word net as part of our graph where we want to go with this this is this is this was released two three weeks ago this is very very early within within our development cycle but the intent is that we want to be able to then take that the content do better matching use word net use other ontology models around technology for example industry on colleges to pour that in so that is the intent at the moment so I just go back to just to the grouping these two cards here represent the actual the attachment so there is a node there and that mean that node would then have a relationship back to the insurance industry insurance valued or payments value chain so that we build up that but graph model around that document and I can share some pieces I'll put it into my little thread around this project around some of the other earlier reference points around word Nets more early views of what we're looking at in terms of natural language processing in terms of not just word counting and word matching but identification of key themes and for example so we're going there it's is your idea that you then do you currently store like the word taxonomy or or whatever in nature as well and then you're connecting the document to different parts of that in this context here we don't connected we don't connect it to word not but certainly in terms of trains and solutions we do connect the full solution model and I'll show you that does connect to word net so that does allow us to do much much more powerful searching of that so office and building to city etc so we're able to do that so we have word net in the background of our graph and that's fully inside neo as well cool look at Lotus and documents still not much intelligence here in the bottom but what I can now do right switch to the suggested content that's now going to search across that and is gonna give me some insight I mean normally I'm the tester and developer of the platforms like I always appear but we can now start to see some other people that have some relevance to the content up here and if I start sort of just highlight over that I can see Andrew dere has written five of the business trends and three of the pure technology trends that have been spotted here and it just goes on in get them and start to see cavies got six solutions that are delivering against the seekers we pull in some context as to what I was that person being recommended and if I just switch off people I can then start looking at solutions and again here I said to get some insight in terms of what what is that solution and gain I can then filter that downs like I'm only interested in banking capital market solution so my list has become much much narrower now in terms of the potential recommendation so it's really a way of our teams being able to find some and say well actually State Bank of Mauritius it's good I'm gonna add that to the workspace and have that as a reference point and then the team can then start to discuss around that and use that so it sort of so you can sort see that drag and drop nature which we have sequins that they can pour things in and use that information that way so that's workspaces and we can do some other things we can do sizing just to draw some attention to certain areas so we can resource okis in focus in our own pieces so I think my guys are on the team if they are I know they love d3 maybe I'm gonna get beat up tomorrow on our standard batter so that's what we're doing in terms of workspaces now that next progression it's just we can we've captured this information now I want to build a roadmap on this so that so beers that we have a number of modules you can see here so I'm going to step into two roadmaps and a lot of the the same thinking the same sort of approach both in terms of style and all so the the mashing that we're doing within neo applies here as well so I'm just going to call up I've got a train I'm going to create it I did cheat a little bit just to save you some of the laborious nature of seeing me document some of these pieces so what we have here is the outline of a digital blueprint or transformation map for a client and you we have some customization which which we can make one's gonna step into the actual canvas itself in your C again looks like the workspaces thing but we've got here we've got sections so here and we allow the teams to customize this they can be very formal they can say q1 q2 q3 or they can be non-committal insignia to a mid term long term and they but you can start to build out different roadmaps for different parts of the business so here you know we're aligning again for those value chains for our industries and we can start to see I dropped in a few here I look at manufacturing I've got digital twin procurement I've just got and digitized into in supply chain so from this one against it now using the connections that we have and the insights that we have I can switch from the full catalog which I could search against but I can I'm interested in actually in this industry this client I've put into industrial manufacturing which other trends are other accounts talking about when they have digitized supply chain in their roadmap now I can start to build that in and start to drop in new trends and every time I drop in a new trend my suggestions are altering so if I now make its real time in terms of bringing that through then ultimately they can take that and they can share this and finer detail in terms of some of the parameters and the additional information that they can they can specify in with this so one thing that we're doing here in terms of the context of the data the data model is when I drop in a trend here I'm not dropping in the master trend this trend becomes unique to my roadmap so I'm essentially creating a new node within my roadmap for end-to-end supply supply chain but it has a relationship back to the master so he always knows if I rename this to some completely different and you know my meetups trend if that was the context to which that trend was being talked about with the client it's relevant in the roadmap but we've also maintained that relationship back to end-to-end supply chain so we're able to then look at that dispersal and the occurrence of that as well and also using that relationship back to the master so then also start to do some community and the lytx around the near neighbors of that of that trend um as well as variables that we'll get into the into the real detail of what house is being referenced within that and it creates on various or views of that in terms of the output some of that we call a transformation Maps a classic summary diagram or sunburst diagram or positioning against that we have some interactive tables so we can change some of the values here so what our teams are doing here is they're taking that roadmap information and just starting to represent it in terms of which area of the clients businesses is going to impact their product line services processes or their overall business model and is it an incremental step change for them so it's kind of that will risk ambition profiling within it but they can also change the dimensions here so we really sort of allow them to take the output and tune it for the conversation so they can switch off certain value chains within that report they can change it to a Timeline view so they can use that information and the intent is really here it's to create digital content is to create conversation and not to go in with a canned presentation of a prepared roadmap and say this is the answer we think you're looking for this is interactive dynamic changing information based on the conversation and that insight that it then gives and that the suggestions and then make our also then real time as well so they'll sort of clicked in here is a to base on the content of this roadmap similar sort type of minutes very simple recommendations here in terms of the of the query but is actually based on that so based on this roadmap which solutions are available actually I'm interested in finding some demos for this client I want to go and show them some demos where we've got those used augmented reality maybe I'm only interested in the areas that I've not just focus that weren't any damp the vision behind his focus I found that I found some so we've got some solutions around digital twin that we can start we can start pulling in so then so it just progresses through and nothing new we can we can capture ideas and we can when we capture ideas we can specify it's going to meet these goals we're connecting all of that information together as we flow so as we've got a cast remind back back to the slide you need an idea of you know the the digital sort of fingerprint of a client that we're building out here in terms of how this actually unprogressive we do allow them to update attachments like they can't we don't like them doing that because yeah we could read it I suppose like work like the work space module but yeah we want in we want smart information and then we present it as a summary which is down to a simple view so so the one-page summary based on that roadmap so we can see here the overall goals that the client may have their value chains that are of relevance and we've got ideas and we can highlight but this idea is going is seeking to address these goals it's going is relevant to these value chains so isn't just different ways of representing that bad bad information for a client so that's sort of how that all sort of shapes out within that sort of back to my slide that's kind of that within this area here with that that middle ground here you know we've uploaded a token we've used the power of the information that we have we've use the ease at which we can create those queries and rapidly release that capability into our application as well so that's what was just going through I'm some of those I'll go back I want to show you our solution model and how we use that I'll give you some idea in terms of the scale which we have within that so so it is a fairly controlled data set and we do quite play governor's to that and you can start I will put a link up so you can have a look through through the schema but one thing that we have done within the neo schema is we have overall 92 labels the 29 of them are actually not live data they're just meta nodes so we're using that approach to in turn ensure that we have data integrity and we can understand what our potential taxonomy czar that we want to use and data sets and data difference that we want to use but they only move across as real nodes once once they have been used so we can manage our data dictionaries very very efficiently in that manner without word net were about 325,000 nodes there are about 700,000 relationships that when we pull in word net that just goes through the roof with because I think word net probably has has 200,000 plus knows what it probably has 200-300 thousand plus and relationships as well so so word net is sitting in in the background fluorescent and as Mark was asking you know when we add a solution we connect it to word net when we have a trend we connect it to word net looking at how we're going to do that when we're reading reading documents as well I've got a couple of blog posts I've been looking at that in terms of natural language processing and the potential to that then brings to the additional value within within so that's kind of our basis or basis and framing of that overall in terms of what our users see and what we have so we've got just over 1,400 industry and technology use cases documents is there only a hundred fifty roadmaps which you've generated 290 ideas and we have 900 solutions documented as well so growing sets of data there as well apologists need another drink lucky this wasn't last week because I so that's a scale what we have I won't come back I want to conclude we just up showing you some of the things that we have around and solutions and because it was this well we started and we don't just rely on that into end flow through the platform to capture capture solutions we've had internal events and we've given away swag bags of things we've we've harvested solutions um as well so we pour the Ember we're we're very aware that we've got to be able to capture a solution and understand its value so that the reason it's captured actually brings value and that we can't identify you know its potential reuse and its potential business value for others as well either as a complete solution or being able to break it down and creating something new so I'm going to step back into the platform and going to show you a playbook if a playbook about digital Explorer but if it all gets this into and show you part of that of that solution model so probably couldn't just use this one to present and what did it explore was first I wanted to show you a few other bits and pieces I'm just going to step through this forest and then we get into the actual solution itself so there's a very sort classical table view of our solution so we have a general description those motivations those motivations those are the business those are the technology trends you see that sort of hook across that that link across there and then we've got key capabilities and and key capabilities there we also build up a catalog so anybody can reuse and we can understand what's coming across and then we just present that it's a very very simple model but just gives them a solution on a page using our key mates notation but we also block it out in terms of certain areas so we're white we're applying within DXE is an architectural canvas so that we can very quickly validate through automation is this solution complete this solution has nothing in the security space that's going to prove a problem so we're using that solution modeling to really be able to sort of look at and validate a solution a high level but that progression through is well well if we're pushing that so we can see where it's being hosted etc etc so I'll just give gives you a view of that and you can then click through and have a look from trying to show you really quickly I'm showing many graph models gonna show and then that's how that then looks I'm in graph as well so we can get the full information about about that that solution as well so it's stepping across the platform that's pretty much our project ends away and that's how we're using neo to realize that and I speaking to since before the forces with before we went live I don't think I know anymore how would even model that in Oracle all of that level of connectivity and the relationships and V and the ease of being able to add a new relationship and understand and get value from that and and Traverse multiple paths through through relationship so some of the some of the current thinking that they were looking at is around and using community detection algorithms and and jumping across from one starfleet to an endpoint and looking at those those common ideas across roadmap so I don't I personally I don't think I could have done this without neo so the couple of links here for you you can get on to the site please have a look around drop us in a reply on the community side reach out to me have a look through load of videos out there that you can get to get to on the side so if you want to listen to my West Country tones again you could have a look through our release notes and our videos there's a lot of content out there and everything that we have is part of our sort of outsourcing open-sourcing of this always said that all those specifications are managed and there's only one source for me in terms of what where I published to and that's on github calm so you can have a look through those you can look at the overall data model of the individual data models the the labels the properties that we have within that and also some of the other aspects of of what we're doing within the platform so have a look through how to dig into it and be absolutely delighted with any feedback any suggestions any questions about this so with that mark Corrine I'll hand back over to you if there's any other questions in the chat let me unshare my screen and can see that I am still here right there we go thank you so much that was amazing um I don't see there's a lot of people chatting in the chat window they were just kind of saying hello and everything I don't know if anybody has any questions sometimes the video is a couple seconds delayed so sometimes it takes a minute to get the questions but we can also make it available for people to give questions and/or feedback on the community site which is good so I'll post the link again in the chat so if anybody has any questions that this are or welcome directly in the community site so I think that's good I think it's a for now cool thank you so much I'm good right and your future talks in Madrid yes yes yeah looking forward to that yes yeah so if you're on grass school next week in mature-age you can you can get version two of this yeah all right and big shout out to all our friends that came to the beat up today like big neo4j family reunion alright well thank you so much David and we hope to see you guys next week thank you
