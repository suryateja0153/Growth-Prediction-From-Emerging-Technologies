 if you're interested in learning more about how to improve your data science in machine learning workflows with near 4j you're in luck we've launched two new online trainings covering data science with near 4j and applied graph algorithms these courses are completely free and open for anyone to enroll as part of graphic adam e you can find them both online at near 4j comm / graphic adam e in the applied graph algorithms course you'll learn how to use graph algorithms in near 4j this course takes an applied approach introducing the algorithms how to use them in ear for J and also how to leverage graph algorithms to enhance the functionality of a web application you'll make use of the Yelp public data set with information about businesses and user reviews to build a simple business search application using react and near 4j you'll then use graph algorithms to enhance the functionality of the application such as personalized search results and building a category hierarchy you'll learn how to use the near 4j graph algorithms plugin and algorithms such as personalized page rank similarity metrics and community detection all in the context of adding functionality to an application this course is designed for application developers who want to learn more about enhancing their applications with graph algorithms and near 4je the data science with near 4j course shows how to use near 4j along with Python data science tools such as Jupiter notebooks matplotlib pandas and scikit-learn using a data set of paper authors and citations you'll learn how to query near 4j using Python and how to use near 4j for exploratory data analysis then using the near 4j graph algorithms plug-in you'll move on to generating personalized recommendations using collaborative filtering and PageRank finally you'll learn about link prediction building a binary classifier with scikit-learn using graph based feature extraction the data science with near 4j course is designed for data scientists and data analysts and some existing knowledge of Python is help each course includes guided exercises and quizzes to reinforce your learning after successfully completing each course you'll receive a certificate of completion to be successful in these courses we recommend you have some familiarity with near 4j or have completed the introduction to near for J course previously register for these new courses today at nifA J comm / graphic adam e
