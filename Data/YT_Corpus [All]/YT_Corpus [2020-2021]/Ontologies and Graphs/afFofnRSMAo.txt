 good morning everyone my name is Ahmad Chaudhry and I'm a vice president at neo4j based out of her office in San Mateo and it's it's my privilege to come here and and spend some time with you about our technology as well as how graph databases in general are generally changing the data landscape in the market today couple of things before we get into the details I know this is this is this is a an event that you know we that that you have joined willingly you know so we're extremely thankful for the time that you were to spend today I know this is a big investment a whole day so we are hoping that you will get the best out of it and we are also hoping that we're going to present the best of what we have learned or a period of time more specifically this graph tour has been going on for for about a year now so we have visited Stockholm Milan you know Toronto Seattle and many different places and I think so what we've done is we have learned a lot of that stuff along the way so what we're presenting today is is hopefully the best of the best that we have been able to put together the second thing that I also want to talk about is I want to be again you know this is this is a very big market first New York is a extremely important market there are some really good customers and accounts that we have so what I would strongly encourage you is that at the lunchtime or during the break you know take a look around you in terms of the companies that have been represented in the Bloomberg UBS Citibank JP Morgan I mean they're many of them so these are incredibly big accounts as well as customers who have had the opportunity to use some of our technology or in the process of using their technology so let's talk a little bit about what our agenda for today is so I'm going to talk a little bit about graph you know just to a baselining some of you have been using it and some of them some of you are probably in the process of understanding what graph says or perhaps are evaluating some of the different ways graphs can help your data acquire I'm gonna spend some time on the data management trends we're gonna talk a little bit of our case studies and then we talked a little bit about what's the future for graph alright so let's talk about what is graph but even before we go there let's talk a little bit about what's happening in the market today our data you know the data everybody I'm sure everybody has heard about this firm this statement data is the new oil well it's true because data drives pretty much all the decision-making individually or as an in the enterprise but if you think about what is happening in the market today is that are the nature of our data is changing you know it's the volume and velocity of the data from you know different places social networks sensors even incredibly from our websites I mean the the the nature has completely changed from what the data was about 30 years ago and it's also important to remember that be the quality and the and the the entire wave data has changed our decision-making has also gone through its some order transformation so in the earlier times when people used to think about relational databases that used to be very static data and that had to be stored in rows and columns but think about it think about in your your own day-to-day life when you think about data data is not rows and columns there is all about relationships data is all about connection between different data points and that's the quality and the volume and and the sort of say the inherent nature of data that we're talking about is changing so if you think about network of people or you know business processes or even for that matter knowledge things these are all interconnectedness you know the the the the onus is not on how we store and save the data it's also about how we get to find the value between the different data points and that's what graphs is all about so what's the graph database so graph database is basically a form of a database which uses the graph semantics and the data is stored in nodes and relationships so we have two different nodes and those represent people place or a thing it could be anything but it's about the relationship between them that is extremely important and that is also a priority which means that while the nodes or or the the single unit objects are important to recognize what they are and what they do the more important piece is what connects them and what is the value that we can find out of it and this is exactly that value that determines how we find you know relationships between them and what kind of of knowledge we can unearth between the different relationships of these these nodes so in practical use you know let's talk about a little bit of where graph has basically made a huge impact you know Frederic Overmyer he is a journalist and in one of his stocks he start over the fact that there hasn't been any major political news in the last 10-15 years which has not not connected to relationship which is not because of relationships so take a step back and think about all the proceedings that are happening in Washington DC these days plus think about what we have seen of major news events in the past there is always a relationships there's all those relationships behind them that has made the impact so no matter what happens in the front what we hear you peel the onion and you realize this that at the end of the day it's all about the connectedness in solve or the relationship of different data points that has led to the series of events that get reported in the market and one of the most important piece that we have talked about which is a big example is the Panama papers how many of you are aware of Panama papers well in this market absolutely so you know this thing happened in 2016 but it's the the impact of this is reverberating even today you know we have many different world leaders who have been deposed who have basically been impacted because of what came out of Panama Panama papers and it's it's it's an incredible story not just because of the investigative journalism that happened it also is a representation of a technology that was instrumental in in making that happen so let's talk a little bit about what happened so basically we had about 2.6 terabytes of data that got leaked out you know it got later with that translate about more than 11 million pieces of of information these were transactions these are deeds these were legal papers these are bank accounts things are like that and and it's it's an immensely complicated set of documents that perhaps nobody can sit on the tables and start highlighting about what's going on I mean these were very complicated set of different ways of of how people have connected each other and things like that but it was not very visible to begin with when you see 11.5 million people pieces of paper it's just very hard to go through them one by one and determine the impact well let's talk about what it was essentially it was about people you know everything is is that at the end of the day connected to people and this could be a person this could be somebody who essentially has a bank account or a checking account or an investment account in some place but that person also has an address and in that address that person is staying with a partner or wife or somebody else who happens to work in a company that has an offshore account so if you take that this is essentially a data model that was determined as you go through these papers but if you take it if you abstract this out this essentially is about what we call about nodes and the relationships and you know I talked about node could be a place that a person or a thing in this case node was an address node was a person node was a was a person who that was staying with or what kind of account they had but it was more important is what kind of a relationship was there between these different nodes that essentially allowed them to figure out where the shady deals were and how people were impacted and how people were connected with each other so if you kind of think about this in in in a smaller sense this is just one data model the relationships the the connectedness between few different nodes imagine this in in billions and tens of millions of off-off connections this is what graph database allows you to do it so if you I don't think any technology for that matter or for that meaning in the last 30 or 40 years has come out that can actually parse this information in the way graph has been able to do that you know it can store the information yeah I'm sure there is a there's a way for it to to find some value in that as well but if you have to find relationship then if you have to find meaning you know graph databases is is are exactly designed for these kind of workloads so what's really transpired you know the former Icelandic Prime Minister sigmundur Gustafson he basically what they post and the relationships were found out you know and we had a few changes even in other countries you know Prime Minister Pakistan was also deposed because of that so there is a lot of of these things that came out and and what really happened was neo4j was essentially you know responsible for helping the the teams to Depot retort be composed and information we used different sets of of open source technology to parse over this information and then put it together to find real meaning and you know obviously this became a big news that was in every single newspaper in the world and yet obviously had a Pulitzer Prize so in a practical sense graph database really brought together something which perhaps before this was was hard to do it you know but it's not like we find investigative journalism as use cases everyday you know there have been some really good ones but by and large a lot of what we do is also very applicable in commercial sense and these are some of the common graph use cases that I want to talk about you know one of them is is the more recommendation engine and Walmart is doing a great job of of using the information of what people talk about when they return things what kind of feedback to give and using that all in and out it excuse me in a set of different analyses to be able to come out with the right recommendation engine the second is fraud protection you know each our Brazilian bank they're using graph database to be able to do fraud detection so anything you know one of the use cases which is remarkable is that any use case any fraud which could have probably taken about ten to twelve days now can be detected within thirty minutes just because of the way graph data model allows them to find different connection points and things happening at the real time we talked about HP and and network and IT operations actually network and IT operations is a very graphi kind of a use case you know if you think about how networks are connected you know some of our telecom partners as well as our technology companies they're using graph to understand the whole network topology they're looking at how are the balancing of networks happened where the single points of failure is how to prevent these things so that's that's a very important use case that we talked about master data management that's another use case where you know if you think about in the world of where we are today GDP are and and you know forget me every time kind of requirements you know your information is available across many different places and and is is available in different databases and if you do not have the ability to make those point changes when when when it when it's required then I think you might be in in violation of some of the the new regulations that have been put in place so how do you how do companies manage these massive data minute management things is something that's it's a very graphic problem another one that I want to talk about is excuse me it's also our knowledge graphs knowledge graphs you know is essentially data warehousing you know think about it's the map of your of your data of your knowledge it's a graphic map of your knowledge and and and that could be a data warehouse and there's a lot of work that needs to be done or has been done in trying to put together that information with some of our accounts such as Airbnb and last but not the least is is about identity and access my and and UVs which is represented here has been using neo4j to be able to have an understanding of of different you know authentications different authorizations and different checkpoints and and what different set of of people or our groups have access to different information that in the network so one of the things that has also happened is that suddenly the analysts have woken up about the potential and the advantages of graph so in 2017 forest and made this prediction that 25 percent of the enterprises will be using graph databases by 2017 you know one of the funny things is that they're very quickly changed that to more than 50 percent and part of the reason is is exactly it is it is about the fact that you know how it's not again you know every database every kind of a technology you know they've talked about different data models that DB engines look at you know it's not that those are wrong or those do not serve a purpose they do but if when you're looking at many different complicated data points what is important is what is the relationship between them and today the values in finding those relationships and extracting that and presenting it in the manner that allows you to make the right decisions at the right part of time so that's why Forrester you know they they they up their prediction from 35% to 50% we talk about popularity of graph you know this is something that Dave has already talked about so just to kind of give a sense data DB engines what they do is they look at they have a very scientific way of algorithmically looking at how different companies are evaluating different database technologies you know it's based on number of job openings number of site visits number of off of meetups I mean it's a very very scientific way that they come together they aggregate this piece of information and they put it in an algorithm and then they come out with the answer so you know if you think about it this is where graph database is high and and relational databases continue to be on pretty much of a flat line yet the reality is that today's data is so complicated and it's the volume and velocity is coming in that the relational databases or some of the other databases are not in a position to to take I mean they're not designed to take advantage of all the pieces that are coming together and graph databases and that's that's the reason that the popularity of graphs has been increasing even Gartner you know which is usually a predictor of present technologies is essentially looked at graph as an important trend in 2016 so all in all you know I think the point that we're trying to make here is that you know this is this is an incredible time for graph we are super excited about it and we're super excited to have you here because you are also evaluating graph based on some of these predictions that you would have heard or understood or listened from from your colleagues or some of the other folks within the industry and it's an incredible opportunity to take advantage of these technologies and see what different you know value you are able to get out of the different data bases and the data models and and data points that you have it in the organization you know what while graph is one strong point within the data industry there's also been some some very incredible failures and one of the things that comes to my mind is is is the Hadoop a experience how many of you have deployed Hadoop or had deployed a loop fairly well you know when I do came in the market about I don't maybe about 10 years ago or so it came with a bang it was massive explosion you know it was it was one of those more remarkable technologies that everybody and you know coming from from Silicon Valley you know you know how the hype cycle works everybody was on the Hadoop hyper cycle but it was you know what happened yeah last year exactly a bar a year ago October 18th I think if I remember the time is this announcement happened Hortonworks and Cloudera merger is actually Hadoop's obituary I mean this is a very dark statement that came out why some of the analysts which basically said that you know it's like if one brick is sinking you tie the two bricks together that they don't sink any faster I mean it's it's like a one of the dark declarations of off the Hadoop industry but I think you know just as the hype was overblown you know be the sort of said the decline is also overblown of course you know of cloud era CEO quit the guy who basically brought these together and then a 25% about the value tanked in in a single day you know some of the the impact was also looked at map our before it got acquired by HP but the reality would you know I think we're trying to put together here is that there's no technology today perhaps that had this single biggest rise and fall off of what we call as a hype cycle and part of it is because of the hype that got created and part of it is is because of how the the market suddenly changed when I say the market it's it's the nature of data and I'm pretty sure all of you will recognize what I'm talking about in terms of of how you are required to process the data as much as that the value that you're going to get out of the data so a gardener obviously has this this diagram I'm sure all of you have seen this this is called the hype cycle everything that comes out is evaluated on this hype cycle you know whether it's a I machine learning I mean I can tell you that graph databases are on a hype cycle as well Hadoop was on it but the the the important reality is that you know this is this is a a very good way to have a mental map of how the technologies are going to evolve and and you know by and large they do that yeah the Hadoop was one story that essentially did not follow this path because of many different reasons and they eventually ended up in a situation where today it's good for a purpose it's not good for everything it's good for a purpose no technology is a panacea for everything that people are looking at obviously there are going to be some strong points and and and and and weaknesses but at the end of the day we have to recognize that every technology has a purpose every database has a purpose but one thing which is critical among all databases is is where is the relationship coming together between different data points and what is the value that comes out of it now what if you can stand up and basically said so why do we think graph databases are going to be successful you know if you think about following this hype cycle we could possibly have the same storyline possibly but I think the reason why we are super confident about where we are is not because that it's not something that just got dropped in as a Big Bang explosion you know we have been evaluating and this thing has been churning around within academic circles the data scientist world in the developer ecosystems for the last 10 years so what we have seen from a graph database standpoint is is it has been tried it is tested it has scaled it has been evaluated it has been turned twisted many different times and finally we have broken it out into the commercial market over the last few years and and and the successful has been outstanding so there is a it had in confidence in our ability to believe that graph databases are going to be successful because they saw the purpose that no other database today does which is about the relationships the connectedness of data you know in fact a lot of from a graph standpoint I would say is that what graph databases allow is it makes P it gets people make sense of their data and that's exactly the reason why you're after databases are a long way to go and you know it's not just about me saying because I'm representing me or for J it's about the fact that if you think about how the demand skills are being addressed in the market today so up for how many of you have know about F work very few so up work is basically you know it's kind of a freelancing site so if you're looking for some freelancing projects and you're looking for to be done in a timely way and it's across the world you know our folks is a great way in fact if you would you know you should go to our folks and check it out as well but one of the things that if you remember here if you see here is that of the top 20 skills that people are looking at neo4j stales force lightning Maas I mean these are incredible amount of of I would say validation of what people today are looking at in terms of building their skill sets as well as what companies are looking for in for for these people so you know excited I'm very excited about the way we are moving in this direction from a graph database standpoint now let's talk a little bit about something that has that happened in the last two weeks that has hasn't happened in the last thirty years you know I want to perhaps some of you are already aware of it but I want to still make an announcement that we have worked with the AIA sub body for I've been doing it for many many years along with some of our very strategic partners to essentially push the standard for graph just as SQL which was a standard query language for relational databases that was approved 30 years ago the iesous body actually approved gql as a graph query language and it hasn't happened in 30 years about two weeks ago which to me is such an incredible recognition of graph as a story line because of the fact that what it does is that it establishes a standard for now companies and people just like yours to essentially use graph so what do you have the advantages that you you are you have skills that can be used across the board there's no vendor lock-in and more importantly your applications are open source now so this is an incredible opportunity that has offered because of of the fact that it's important graphs have become extremely important and most of the organizations look at as a standard for developing a lot of these things so great thanks to you and of course it's a it's a big achievement for us as well as some of the other folks in the in the graph industry this is a representation graph representation I would like to talk about you know cypher is something that got innovated and came out of neo4j and and and we've been kind of open source said we have olives in an open source company we open source it to some of our other partners who kind of took this up Oracle and an essay P and and some of the other ones and the effort together essentially led to ISO which is a consortium of many different countries to recognize gql as as a standard language for for graph now what does it mean you know this is a very busy slide that is provided or by our incredible partners graph of it who you know who basically sleep eat graph on a day-to-day basis but what it essentially talks about is the ecosystem so it's not just about the database it's about what happens before and what happens after so you have ETL tools or you have visualization partners you have you know many different other implementation partners as well so this is a massive ecosystem of graph that personally I did I wasn't aware of before I joined neo4j but if you think about it this is this is how the industry is going to grow and now with the standards already coming together it essentially is going to get even more robust and an expansive talk a little bit about a Google partnership you know this is more closer to where we are heading towards you know we tied this we have this announcement way back in March and or April in at Google next you know we are incredibly proud to be part of the six database vendors open source database trend is that Google Cloud basically chose to offer their first party offerings on to the enterprise customers we are working towards this and you know over the next few months we'll be making some incredible announcements in terms of very going obviously being on Google allows us to use and leverage some of of our incredible graph capabilities on their super high performing machines to be able to offer to our customers a fully integrated setup we're billing and everything is all going to be uniform so this is this is a great opportunity for lot of our customers to use this in a cloud area Enterprise 76% of the 1400 customers are already using it you know this is this is a testament of the fact that this is open source but more importantly in terms of where we are how we have developed we talked about that slider on the ecosystem you know enterprise need ecosystem for technology to to flourish and the results are very much in in front of you you know one of the one of the darlings of of the startup era essentially left we can call it as a startup anymore but lyft is an example of it somebody from the startup world actually looked at a new 4G or graph and essentially became extremely successful now we're not going to take credit for lyft success because of graph but they they there is a you know a little bit of a pride in the fact that having used graph and neo4j they've been able to kind of come out of the the start of world and essentially been successful and and got listed here and the stock exchange so I'm going to complete a you know very quickly go through some of the case studies you know we talked about commercial use cases we talked about six of those cases that a common use cases in the past but I want to talk a little bit of what we have done which is more visible and I think this is going to be relevant for a lot of you who are evaluating and learning about graphs today and and you know we strongly encourage you to go to our website and and and download these case studies and or talk to any other of us we have we are available here so the German Centre for diabetes research is a great user and and I've been a big ambassador for for us near for J and for the graph part of it is because what they've done is they've taken many different years of diabetic research and put together in a more graphical form to say okay how do many different components within these research elements connect with each other and can they solve our diabetic problem and you know this is one of the more just like Panama papers was one end of the spectrum you know this is the other end of the spectrum from an Humanity standpoint this is a great example of how graph is is helping develop some of more advanced medical research caterpillar is is another enterprise customer of ours and what they're doing they're using graph for kind of building a map of different maintenance technologies that sorry maintenance that they have been doing for their machines you know when when machines come back for repair or for any of the servicing what I'll change you happened what kind of a fix you did what was the problem XYZ you know put those things together in a more graphical form and you essentially can predict the maintenance model for for many different models Xfinity is another example you know they obviously have one of the largest cable providers and they have many different services so if you they have a project called the the Smart Hub and smart hub talks about many different xfinity products that can be put together from a customer use like think about a customer 360 but within the cable world and and if I want some network that was running care of the Comcast network how you know my playlists could be used with somebody else on that network to put together something which is very unique so they be they're very different smart technologies that are being put together by by Xfinity very quickly on the future of graphs reserves there's a session that Jennifer is going to be running in the afternoon that is going to talk about where a I and graph come together this is just a very quick introduction to the fact that graph databases and the way the models are process actually are driving a lot of the area adoption you know we have seen the papers that have come together we talked about the graph algorithm written book which has been downloaded and all the data scientists and AI experts have come to me or for JDate away our website to download these things and understand more a part of the reason is because that the the modeling that that is required you know you need to have more refined data models to be able to get more predictive learning within era and machine learning and graphs are incredibly useful to be able to get that thing together so you know the the market sees a strong synergy between graphs and and artificial intelligence and where the future is but don't go why me go buy a Jennifer session in the afternoon and and understand more about that you know this is a quote that you know has been put together by by one of the sociologists from from Berkeley and he's talking about the fact that you know from an if you're looking for an AI and machine learning standpoint and relationship standpoint it's not important about me per se that you need to look at where my predictions are going to go you have to look at my relationship so if somebody has to determine you know who is going to walk in which way and who is going to get impacted in which way rather than then a person themselves you basically need to look at their relationships and that's going to determine how yeah that's going to determine their behavior so which is exactly the point that we talked about earlier is that the graph databases is all of our relationships the relationships are more important I'm more important than the nodes itself and that's that's a more stronger prediction of a behavior than actually the individual itself all right to wrap up I want to talk to a graph connect it's happening in New York in April you know we are expecting about a thousand more than thousand people it's it's going to be a phenomenal you know event talking about industry leaders as well as you know developments in the graph technology and some of the bright and the brightest stuff off the agenda in the industry are going to be presenting and I'm extremely excited about you know letting you know and looking forward to seeing you over there in in April and last but not least I want to also thank our sponsors ey and the Auris as well as Graf availa and curious you know they they have they have been incredible partners they have been the reason why we have been successful and and I just want to you know thank them for all the work they have done and continue to do and we believe these are going to be strong partnerships in the days to come thank you you [Applause]
