 so welcome back from lunch everybody my name is Jeff Morris I run Product Marketing here at neo4j I've been with the company about two years and what I want to go through today is is really just some graph observations that that I've noticed in my time here and and you'll kind of catch on as to what I'm talking about when I start saying things like you know thing things that people do us are very very analog and yet the things that we're trying to do in either automating processes or making life more convenient for ourselves are often digital right doing things on devices and computers and etcetera so what I want to altom utley do is is map out how some of our customers are doing that activity and you know and relate a back type back in to why graphs and wine neo4j is actually so good at helping you get from these analog ideas whoops helping you get from these analog ideas into digital ones so to start out I like to you know begin with some kind of a stupid story I was raised on the space program and what that means is in the mid 60's are actually from 1960 all the way through to 2000 my dad worked in a company that makes space suits makes a space suit for for for gem and I make the space suit for Mercury made the space suit for Apollo and for shuttle so I'm pretty well familiar with you know the ideas around rocket science and things like that actually I own that this particular framed poster of the framing of all of the mission patches that went up through shuttle number four and the magazine cover here is actually when during the Apollo Soyuz timing and the guy on the left is actually my dad right he's in the spacesuit you and he was actually the program manager of the spacesuit exercise the funny thing about fred is that he is a really big head and he was actually part of the QA team at for this four for the spacesuits themselves because if the helmet came down over his head and didn't bruise his nose it was of correct percentile right over 95th percentile head is what he had so is so uh these were kind of the anecdotes that I came home with there's another really good one as at one point the NASA was getting investigated by Congress about how come the space program is so darn expensive and one of the one of the activities was how come we're spending five hundred million dollars on a toilet and so Fred goes in there and actually has to testify in front of Congress and says well look this is big-time stuff this is actually quoted out of the Hartford Courant this is big-time stuff my toilet at home only has like 20 moving parts this one has over five thousand of course it's going to cost more so anyway these are like I said these are the kinds of anecdotes that that I came home with so nowadays I live here in San Rafael I come into the city very very regularly typically what I do like the last time I was here in the jazz center I think I was watching snarky puppy from right over there it's really great great band very very fun so I see a lot of live music and you can see all my film or posters here or many of them are film or in other other shows there's a Bill Graham show there there's a couple of Terrapin crossroads show there's some fairly local locally into you know live music here and what I like about live music or the way I explain it to family and friends is that it's one of the only one of the only experiences that I can go and do where I don't necessarily know what's going to happen at any given time I like that uniqueness right I like the the the experience I like the experience of being in a community of like-minded people in a crowd like that awfully awfully fun the last last shell I just saw was lucious here they were awesome singing duo and and so if we start to look at things and and investigate what my graph sort of looks like riff on what mo put up here earlier whoops make all my arrows go so my graph I have two daughters as well each of them are ones 19 and once 24 one studying theater the other one actually ironically or coincidentally actually word you you're not supposed to mix up coincidentally my older daughter works at Chabot Observatory so there's that space connection again and so I was like continue to go and look at this I you know I'm married to Laurie she's a writer she she wrote her her dad's memoir I liked live music clearly I got my picture of Chuck Berry here I root for the Giants and the Warriors and the Sharks like I said I live in in in Marin and well the bummer about living in Marin and working for a company that is in San Mateo is traffic right so you know as I Drive to work every day I started listening to audiobooks on the advice of my wife and so I started listening to a lot of audiobooks I've probably listened in the two years I've been here to about 110 I think is what the count is so going on and I started to notice things about you know that were happening in each of these books actually the first one I listen to the one on there on the left there Stephen Johnson's book about where good ideas come from is all about this concept of adjacent possibilities and Jason possibilities is really actually the situation you all are in today it's the the idea of either meeting someone new or eavesdropping on a conversation and spawning a new good idea out of that conversation that you happen to hear adjacently but this phenomenon happens all over the place it happens it happens in social networks it happens in nature it happens in science so this idea of getting things close to each other and then finding what their common connection is going to be is it's a very very graphic kind of idea back to my space theme I like you know they're the right kind crazy is all about the JPL's delivery of a space explorer to Mars thinking in terms of maps the burglars guide to the city is actually a really interesting kind of play on that it's how do bad guys get in and out of buildings and banks and areas where they want to go and robbed and then how do the cops figure it out there's connecting with people there's a you know Scott Adams book on influencing people called wind Bigley it's all about the 2016 election and then there's Carmen gallows books on how to do a good effective presentation communicate well with people there's other great ones right Dan Lyons book on startups that HubSpot he writes for Silicon Valley now the one I really like is Todd roses idea of this notion of the uniqueness of individuals and one of its it's anecdotes in there is the the the Air Force when they transition from propeller-driven airplanes to jet planes they you know wanted to figure out how to retrain all the pilots and and how should they accommodate the pilots well when they built a cockpit for the average pilot based on five readings they took from physical measurements they took from from 500 different pilots they discovered that the average cockpit didn't fit anyone right so this notion and their conclusion was well that's because every single person is built differently they are all unique in some in some particular ways and therefore you know the book goes on to describe why averaging out your SAT scores is a bad idea why you know education should be you know highly personalized and tailored to people and in the case of what you know oftentimes what we talked about why generating offers and an identifying kind of commonality and and similarity across the board is maybe to sweeping and that's why your your algorithms don't don't match as to what you might expect but narrowing in and getting better context might be a better a better manner their talent is overrated is really just the 10,000 hours kind of practice practice practice preaching I like Jim Gaffigan book about traveling you know traveling around the United States and discovering all the different foods there but his thing is a trek it's a journey is following paths following different different areas and then the last two that really kicked in for me are this revenge of analog book you know and it starts out with why is everybody buying vinyl albums again right and a lot of the rationale for that is well it's because not only is the fidelity better than often times better than what you get out of digital music maybe not as quite as good as this room but but it's oh it sounds better but it's also tactile right it's something to hold there's liner notes there's things to read there's artwork on it there's something or something highly visual so this notion of appealing to multiple senses for an individual is also ultimately a very graphic and the last one is a Jake naps book from Google Ventures on how to write you know how to build a product or run a sprint in like five days and how to execute that really really effectively across all kinds of design ideas and all kinds of product ideas so what I'm going to end up doing is we start to talk about this how do you get human behaviors which are very very analog into into the graph and to and do clever things with it that's kind of a much of this is is ideas born out of this these particular sets of books so as I'm going to go through this I'll talk about some of these analog styles of activities that you know that had kind of triggered my my adjacent epiphany we'll talk about analog to digital styles of applications and where and where our customers are actually delivering upon those we'll talk about the notion of graphs starting to get layered one on top of the other one serving as perhaps a knowledge graph that knowledge base that and we'll talked about this morning and another one is kind of the operational that or the decision-making graph living above it I will touch really quickly on design think on graph design thinking but that's only to make you stick around to the end of this to the end of the end day to see Alessandra a story about what it's really like to to live inside of a neo4j Innovation Lab sprint and then I'll kind of close out with some of the additional customer observations and activities that folks are doing that really tie these concepts together so about mice I don't know maybe my sixth week or something like that when I was here at neo4j and I'm reading all that you know I'm reading the the original graph book and I'm you know trying to get my head around what we sell how we want to bring it to market etc those get those kind of things I said to Emmel I'm like have you ever noticed that most graphs all have people in him and he looked at me kind of he's like really and you know and well it's not every graph but pretty much all of them you know a large percentage of them seem to have people in them is my what's my first observation and so you know they could be customers they could be users they could be administrators you know almost any you know in the organizational hierarchy you see they're they're you know an entire org chart your product subscriptions you've got a user and your network operations you've got probably customers and users on that and even and so you know of course social networks are all about different people and their attributes but then we start to explore this even more and there's other graph use cases that were that that we're being presented to me like these this notion of pull people object location and events well this is first applied towards a a law enforcement use case of you know how the cops can do do a better job of both assessing what happened and then you know diagnosing that you know taking their their clues and their their evidence and and then piecing back together a real story and but I've looked at that I'm like ah that's actually happens more often than you think in the graph so carry this thing in forward and one of the earliest examples that that we were exploring is this advertising technology firm in New York and they what they started to do was build a graph that housed nine percent of households in the country which means that that was probably about 270 280 million households that they're mapping their mapping what devices you own what you know what you're what you're looking at what advertising cookies are popping up and and then building a graph out of that to help their advertising network deliver more appropriate and better targeted content good graphic sample there's a magazine publisher that we're talking to just recently as well doing pretty much the exact same thing trying to assemble all of their different publicly they're different published websites and understand that if you go to this publication you go to that publication how do I piece you together and and and identify perhaps who you are based on your behavior your unique behavior another really good one was Emel talked about the the I CIJ right one of their members is Co is the Columbia School of Journalism and of course what what spiked for me about this particular use case is that you know these users are not very sophisticated they're good storytellers but they're not technically savvy so much and but what they were trying to do is figure out how do we decide on what stories to chase where do we come up with you know the the investigative paths that we can go and pursue who should we interview and of course my wife being a journalist and the they want to model the data that they're using as a story that clicked for me and then I started thinking about well you know what the the notions that we're seeing in this journalism news case and even I see IJ's follow the money style use case which will kind of dig into a little bit more it's got all of these different interesting elements to it it's got who's you know who's doing something what are they doing right where are they doing it that's location-based stuff how come they're doing it what's their motivation and how are they doing it what's the network upon which they're operating so I'm starting to look at all of our use cases and that you know through sort of this lens and it really became pretty clear pretty quickly that I'm perhaps I'm onto something so this is the Paradise Papers the data model and it's pretty easy to read the red thing is an officer that's a person they they have a registered address that's a location they're either an officer of connected to same name as or some other entity there's an object and you know and then there's another intermediary or other other elements in there right all of these are kind of fitting my mental map of how graphs are actually get built and of course this goes back to that Steven Johnson adjacent possibility kind of idea of okay so a little data is is is good like on the left hand side they're the you know the five hops is okay value but if you can explore the hundreds of hops that's big value it also kind of adheres to Metcalfe's law and network you know the value of your net value is equal to your you know the sum of the number of nodes your the the square of the number of nodes you have right that was the Scott McNealy you know the the the network is the computer kind of a kind of notion back when I started my career so we started looking at you know this you know these these augmenting these digital activities like fraud detection under this you know new banner of like alright what's really in there so you know you can do all kinds of discrete analytic things you know things that you would do in sequel perhaps looking for you know their their endpoint ideas you know what networks are they operating on where they go and what IP addresses are they using doing account centric things as you know or where'd the money go or where is it living but then getting into this cross channel or entity linking kinds of ideas around alright who knows who write what are the commonalities there Philip rathalu who's up next of course our had a product he has a great phrase which is you know fraud has a pattern and the challenge for our customers is finding that pattern right and recognizing it so you know first glance this doesn't look like anything terribly unique we've got three different account holders they have credit cards they have social security numbers you know each one has multiple counts looks kind of normal like any other person until you start to reveal you know wait a minute they have the same social security number right that's a good clue they have the same phone numbers the same physical address again you notice there's people locations objects activities that they're doing right also probably motives motivation that that's going on there too so it's hard to detect that when you're just when you're doing sequel activities it's much easier to detect when you're doing Graf activities I tau is doing exactly that so I tells the biggest bank in South America and they cover mostly Brazil but other countries as well they're you know they're huge they've got a you know almost 30 million credit cards deployed and the same number of debit cards deployed and so what they're trying to do is is build up a graph of all of their all the people that they know four million you know to more than four million people and associate them with as many things as they possibly can their car loans their insurance policies their bank accounts etc to figure out where's you know are people opening fraudulent loan applications for a car so what's interesting is you know they have these you know 4.2 million nodes that's that's a healthy but not an over at least you know large size graph but four billion relationships and that graph is pretty large right that's that's pretty big but their aspiration is fantastic right they want to get to 93 trillion relationships in this graph to really help figure out what's going on in their universe so back to my my fraud a diagram again and you know this is really worse where things started to click with me back to that Columbia you know they want to tell data stories about data using that you know who's in it what's going on where is it happening when is it happening why did it go on and ultimately you know how do you know how is this is this getting executed right what network is it working on and I'm like oh yeah I see that's where that's that's where my fonts guide so we have people locations etc in this slide so all right now you're going to carry you know some of these analog ideas forward right and of course when you're trying to you know I guess motivate people or or or influence them trying to build a better recommendation right start thinking in terms of the different senses that they happen to you have about them this is an exaggerated kind of version of the of the senses all right but you know of course there's sight and you know and there's sound like I got headphones I am like I said I'm a audio junkie I have headphones there's you know there's smell there's taste there's touch right it's my graph algorithms book unfortunately it's not available in audio yet but it is available for free out at the front desk over here so if you didn't pick up your copy yet get it right well you know this is a this is free to everybody I think all it requires is a badge scan but again my tangible object my lunch was it was my sandwich was pretty tasty the thoughts I've got are pretty good the emotions I'm feeling you know in terms of what how homers doing my bodily awareness right which is a pro prior prior ception right I got to get that word down and then of course what's the the motivation behind a lot of these things these are all the analogs that I'm you know looking at as populating the graph and then moving that into digital right operating in some kind of digital environment it could be you know computer networks it could be mobile networks it could be on your smart phone or your smart watch your self-driving car whatever is going to happen next and of course when you start to look at the graph itself you're like ah there's all kinds of analog II things in this right it's a the the nodes of people right the relationships of you know of how they are associated with each other you know the objects that they own or drive right or where the car is parked right those are all of the same kind of data that I'm talking about that are built up in the graph that actually start to begin to build that context that you want for whatever you want the graph to actually help do so let's look at some of these kind of applications that that are actually these transformation of these analog concepts into digital you know real applications that that customers have deployed and of course as you'll recall right it's a neo4j our ourselves under this you know practice practice practice a kind of notion we have more than 10 years experience going on of this almost two decades worth of experience of this the largest community of graph users the largest organ organization of graph technologists the most broad set of products that support graphs and then what I really want to you know kind of set the framework for is back to these analog ideas is when you think of a graphic aynd of idea your Kinnear when you conceived it right you've got this idea of connectedness and association in your head when you code it right in cypher you want to maintain that kind of fidelity as you move it from your brain to perhaps a whiteboard and then to perhaps the code that you're going to put into neo4j when it computes you want it to behave exactly that that same way but of course be fast and then when you actually run the application or deploy the application all of that you know kind of comes to to fruition so well you know I kind of love this slide in this context of you know the white board being exactly what you want to be drawing you're exactly what you want to be deploying this is your graph as you imagined it as you defined it as you brainstormed it right turns into exactly the the graph that you are you know you turn out in neo4j right it is you know your whiteboard model is your physical model it's your schema and then it's the way you query the system right so this is idea this is this I creation exercise when you form up this graph is also quite graphy right and oftentimes if you're if you're coming up with ideas you're putting post-its on the wall and you're like yeah that's what the user requirements want to be and an assembling your concepts that way you're circling things and connecting things well guess what you're building a graph Seifer itself right that you know the language as we go through it matching right a person named Dan who's married to you know whatever his and his spouse right you're going to return and as the name of his spouse that right it was maintaining the fidelity of what the book that the the drawn design is right in cipher the language and still being able to read it it's legible it gets all the way back into your head back to the analog and then when you make a recommendation engine out of it which our solutions team has done recently has come up with this idea of how you know what are the relevant paths for in you know for these intelligent recommendations right how do you gather the data that you want to use about your customer base or your clientele or your prospects and then how are you going to what pathways are you going to follow and deploying one or many engines to help make that recommendation decision right and and then using all of your available product data demographic data location-based data et cetera as your vehicle so this is you know computing it as a graph and then getting it into real live applications that you deploy and enjoy right or your customers deploy and enjoy so and you'll notice that you even in this application once it's done it's got people it's got product data it's got promos it's got personalization there's geolocation can you pick it up in store right it's got your your payment it's got your your social information you can share this etcetera all of those same graph concepts are existing in this recommendation system right the graph behind this kind of this kind of recommendation engine it's got product information it's got supply chain and delivery information it's got risk mitigation information or credit check them to make sure that there's there's enough in the account and again it's got all of these elements to it location people etc and guess who's doing stuff like that right your favorite retailers the most popular ones that you're that you're very very likely shopping in and oftentimes very likely like Walmart shopping either in in-store or online right again helping to bridge that in-store analog experience of you touching and feeling and and and looking in looking at evaluating the products also mapping that to your digital experience meri that's the same one EMA level had described this one is you know the pricing engine for all the hotels although that Marriott and Starwood owned right that's a big graph it's like they graph out every hotel and then when they started to customize that they figured out oh the corner room sell better right so we can make you know and the Oceanside rooms right price those a little higher than the the internal courtyard ones what was really interesting about this particular yeah this this use case though was actually the really which I don't think we've touched on yet were the benefits that Marriott enjoyed out of this right in terms of like traffic that they were able to handle on this pricing engine they went from allowing the hotel operators to you know to change around their pricing schedule every quarter to doing it practically in real time like every hour they can adjust it based on what they're booking levels are today or what they you know with what they were right at this minute so they got this thousand percent increase in the in their overall volume that they could handle in the system and decrease their IT spend by half right so a thousand X performance boost significant improvement to customer experience at half the cost right that's a pretty good ROI for that so start to talk about some of these ideas around layering graphs and I'll tell you about some of these customers that are doing this kind of thing and as we set the the stage earlier with this idea of knowledge graphs right this is your institutional knowledge the activity that you did before perhaps it's all your document you know your dear scanned documents or your maintenance records of equipment these are all elements that can help this this context rich knowledge graph the sensing knowledge graph is you know what's happening around me around the system and often these these involve NLP some kind of text processing to understand what objects are in there how they're interrelated and then bring them forward caterpillar is a cool example of this right this is one of those maintenance graphs or parts explosion kinds of parts assembly kinds of graphs and what they did is they took 27 million warranty and service documents all haen't you know oftentimes handwritten you know this tractor needs servicing replace the backhoe you know scooper part make sure it matches the right the right model number for the for the tractor itself and improve the predictability of when that's going to happen to all of its you know as a sibling equipment so mapping all of this into you know caterpillars parts assembly graph Thomson Reuters has actually spun out this this particular application this was a an example of a knowledge graph being at the bottom you know at the base of this system it's kind of a slow moving graph it contains information about all of the publicly traded companies in the world and you know and then the the related information about them like who are their suppliers who are their officers right how it you know what what are their revenues you know year over year over year what kind of products do they build that's part of that slow moving knowledge graph it changes certainly right officers come and go that kind of thing but it's you know it's sort of the decision base for for the fast moving graph above it which is a graph of current events delivered through the Reuters news feed or thousands of it's almost 7,000 news feeds and what they do is they figure out alright what's the effect on portfolio companies that are our traders are tracking based on current events so the one I like to you know kind of pick on is the or exemplify it's a even a customer of ours is what what was going to happen to the a380 the Airbus airplane when Emirates made a decision about whether or not they were gonna order more or not right that's the kind of real-time event that you know as soon as Emirates said now we're not going to take any more right we're gonna stop seeing the you know the couple of a380 is cruising around in and out of SFO so again a slow-moving grass living underneath a fast-moving decision graph right and we're starting to see that over and over again and they start to cover lots of different data sources right we mentioned early Amy's gonna you know mention again your your activities that you would do in your data Lake integrating more and more data to the system well you know the good news is it's going back to that idea of the adjacency principle of you know one thing it can spawn another good idea graphs are hungry for data right so feeding them more objects gives you better fidelity better context for these kinds of applications another interesting example here is a venture capital firm in the in the Washington area that called Inc you tell and what they do is they evaluate technology vendors of all kinds right it's not specifically software it's not specifically biotech it could be robotics it can be Hardware things so they take this collection this amalgam of technology good ideas that are coming out of research institutions that are coming out of universities that are coming out of Silicon Valley and they look at what you're what are the guts of that technology and then they try and figure out is there a common lexicon that we can create so we can kind of create a catalog of these ideas that are that are getting generated so that if I decomposed the you know the into you know more specific elements crack you know create create the genome of a particular product offering or particular vendors offering then I can evaluate whether I want to invest in them is one but then I can also disassemble that and reassemble it they call a recumbent assembly of technology reassemble it into a new type of tech tech meet the missions of their customers now their customers turn out to be the intelligence agencies I think spying is wrong but their customers are you'll give them particular ideas as to what to do and and what they're trying to accomplish so the intelligence agencies are the blue dots the the the vendors the technology vendors are the green dots and the things in the middle are actually the missions that they are building and assembling a technology stack for a bespoke technology stack for each particular mission so the example I've got is let's you know let's build a drone system that can drop in a 5g network in a disaster area and guess what right right after we started developing this particular story Verizon said you know sense start sending out there you know we have a drone that makes a 5g Network wherever you want like I knew it so let's start this so those are handful of customers that that are doing this kind of sets of activities but now let's talk about what might be the process that you would go to to have these ideas to turn things into a the graph of your own and your will use the principle of this design thinking how many people are familiar with design thinking you know here you are you guys employing it yourselves I ask this you know periodically where I mean when I go out to a customers of course this is where it all happens it was started at Stanford and Google Ventures jumped on the on the idea and near 4js Tom jumped on the idea so I'm not gonna spoil most of alessandra story but I do want to give you a sense of what it's like a lot of it is let's get the right people in the room right so you know the people can come from your data science your data science backgrounds your your data for your big data or data people your developers who hit you who have to implement the application but then there's also the business interests right whether that's the the chief officers of something or other the people who are gathering the market requirements etc right so connect the the innovators themselves who want to participate in this process walk them through the structure of these sprints right day one is is figure out what you're going to build day two is start to model it out day three is wireframe it and build your prototype day three to five finish it deploy it try it out with real users gain feedback move forward it looks like this right it's a very very graphi analog to digital kind of process we start with post-its those are analog things and we move our way through to get that data model into a form that is indeed both digital and meets the requirements that you set out to to deliver on Monday so Amy's going to continue to talk about graph analytics and how you know given your sets of data and how you know how to manifest a graph out of the data that you that you already have using both safe press cipher for spark or the graph algorithms themselves to identify you know things that she was talking about earlier the clusters pads etc and feed that into your next set of applications use the platform right because the cool part about the platform now is it too is designed to cater to different types of people right date your the your developers right they get the development tools of in near forge a browser in neo4j desktop they get the applications they get the other the examples your administrators enjoy the same kind of sets of features deploy in the cloud bring your own license we've got other other cloud projects in the works right now integrate your data Michael was talking about using kettle or you know any other kinds of data integration tools to get the data into your graph kettles were especially fond of that because of course Matt caster's the author of kettle is actually one of our solution architects and in our services group so you know we we have ready access to the guy who wrote that book just like we have ready access to lots of people who wrote the books and they're in their respective fields for data scientists we've got the more than 30 graph algorithms as well as and then for you know for non-technical users we have near forge a bloom write an experience so that people can visually understand what's happening in the graph using a drag-and-drop and NLP like search kind of interface and when you go through these exercises a lot of these you know what what I've just described of doing analysis in oolitic sand and data science and spark building an application that takes advantage of those algorithms and and and you know deploying it into a clever application like the ebay for google assistant right this is a conversational commerce application conversation analog commerce digital buying ok hey Google go on eBay and buy me a baseball mitt right oh yeah remember I'm left-handed I need a right hand and I need a mitt that fits my right hand contacts that we're talking about earlier about the people so that's a pretty good sized graph it's got 8 million noes 20 million relationships continues to grow and you can you know you can imagine you know a base sells all kinds of products through this this vehicle so now let's take take this probably you know one of my favorite case studies as I as I kind of wind down here is take this idea of all right you got your recommendation engine you talked about you've got the contextualization that we were talking about on a user by user basis but you know show me more of this this kind of stuff so and of course lots of customers lots of organizations like yours are doing these kind of things but I'll pick on the smart home and the smart home was kind of inspired from a couple of use cases here from you know a customer in Europe Telia right they what they were doing was that you they realized hey I have a million homes with routers in him I should you know and I can get information out of my router that was actually going to improve the customer experience you know in those million homes so they figured out just captain you know tracked the MAC address of who's got the phone and they know whose phone is whose so really easy to make that mapping and then they started building clever applications inside the router platform to differentiate their routers from their other competitors one of their clever ideas was well let's make the dinner party playlist based on who's in you know who's in the house at any given time look at their Spotify playlists and then assemble a an amalgamated one that is has all of the songs from you know that everybody likes so I'm like that was a cool idea what kind of novel right I pitched it to analysts and they were like it's a good idea but it's you know it's just a playlist like no no no but you're not thinking big enough yet so let's look at another one Xfinity x5 is it neo4j app and what x5 has of course you know they're quad play which includes of course their internet service of course their their cable a content service voice over IP for telephony and home security so there's your digital devices and your home security your nest doorbell with the camera in it your you know touch sensitive a lighting environment that you've got in the house and it's all designed to be to ultimately become very very personalized to you living in your house it'll send you a text when you leave the garage door up right and then you can say close it please it will do other interesting things like when my dad comes to visit right you can't hear get the joke anyway my dad my dad's hard of hearing so the first thing that I you know I have to do when he comes over my house is turn on closed captioning but x-file figure that out and do that for me right because he has closed captioning on at his house so this whole environment this is you know this is remember this is Comcast has the third largest network that they manage in in the world behind the Russian and American governments so it's integrating you know it's right now in three million houses delivering this kind of a very highly personalized type of experience so as we kind of you know summarize this up the you know graphs driving digital innovation just like Amy had put together the the waves of how AI is evolving graphs are evolving just the same kind of way it started out with you know your first order graph ten years ago was let's connect like things people to people computer Computers you know a mobile net you know cell phones to cell towers then they started doing context path work right you got Google Maps out of that it's a pretty good play so you know desire for more context gives you these this this kind of path following exercise then came the idea of cross connecting all these different objects so that's kind of our fraud detection example you know connect these people location objects activities motivations etc and you've got recommendations engines popping out of that you've got fraud detection engines popping out of that I talked about the graph layering exercise that we're starting to see now graphs beginning new graphs that's also happening inside of our install basis you know customers are like wow okay that metadata model really that I that I needed to deploy for gdpr reasons worked out really well now let's do customer 360 on top of it I have one slide left don't worry right and then this autonomous graph kind of set up this is what your you know your your driverless cars is going to be doing so kind of wrapping on this idea of you know what taking you know how does how does a graph help me in delivering this very very human set of analog requirements and turning that into a highly highly digital kind of experience it's easy right it's you know it's take all the things that you know about people what their interests are right where they get all their inputs right look at what they're what they're doing or they intend to do right the processes and activities what are they using to accomplish that there's other things around that your that will add context and then ultimately where is it happening and where's it happening is location based as well as network based so that kind of concludes my bit
