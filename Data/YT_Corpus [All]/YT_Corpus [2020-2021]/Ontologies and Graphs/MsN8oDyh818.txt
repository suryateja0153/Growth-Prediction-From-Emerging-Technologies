 [Music] my name is Chris Esparza and my being with me over the last four and a half years I'm based in the London office and I'm the head of telco solutions with Nia J which means that I work with our telco customers most of them and I also kind of this sort of a SME on the telco space [Music] those two things that I love about grass and and one of them is the flexibility of the model you don't have to spend weeks coming up with the perfect model so you can be very agile you can iterate you can without having to go through a painful migration every time there's a change so I like this flexibility a lot and then another thing that I'm amazed about Easter is the performance of graphs I mean native grass like me and for Jay in particular I mean I've been involved in a number of projects where um I work for you and have worked for the last four years but I'm still amazed by the you know the performance of these things like past reversals and somebody's local queries so that's these are probably the two things that I enjoy and I'm still amazed about near 4j it's funny because I've spent my whole career in in the graph space in a way so I when I finished University I did my PhD in and in semantic technologies and semantic technologies Hughes interestingly using use the same abstraction they represent the world as graphs as connected entities so I was doing graphs from from that time and yeah I did work for a company that was using these semantic technologies and modeling network topology so I've been doing telco and graphs for quite a while using using graphs but then I took a break I work for data integration and interestingly I I was following max de marzi and he he posted a tweet at some point later we're looking for an engineer based in London that loves graphs and say that's me that's me so I replied and he got me in touch with it so that's how I it's kind about something that was meant to happen at some point so yeah that's that's that's kind of the journey so it's been it's been all the way you know graph so all the way [Music] right so for me in particular I mean I I kind of had been through the high level modeling of domains as graphs so I was kind of familiar with representing things as connected entities but there's I came from as I was mentioning before I came from the RDF world where you know things are slightly different and so understanding this specifics of near v-j things like for example relationships that might be a bit too technical but things like relationships in me of J are uniquely identified and you can associate properties to them that was something that was bit of a change for me and then also another important very important element of the learning curve with me of J's you have to understand the engine you have to understand the storage you have to understand what we call our secret sauce how we store data because having a good understanding of that make it it makes it possible for you to to build the right models to write the right queries so it's so it's quite simple because crops are very intuitive it's it's very easy to think that you know I'm an expert from day one and it's true simple things are very simple in graphs but when you start building complex solutions it's important to have a deep understanding of not just the model or what's the underlying written things like storage and processing of the graphs so that I think these two elements were aware of the yeah the tools I found in my sort of learning learning process to me PJ [Music] well especially telco is huge of course and there's anything network management anything that that involves representing the network infrastructure all the physical or logical virtual all the elements study that are involved in delivering a service is a graph that there's no discussion then then there's another lots of areas you know more customer focus more service focus but I'll focus on this one anything that were related is it's just a graph I mean this this it's a no-brainer and and it's interesting because telco is is one of the industries where we have been stronger from from day one I mean it's not that we have had a campaign focusing but this industry have realized from from the very beginning the value of graphs and it's kind of an obvious match so I think anything network management whether that's coming up with a unified inventory with multi layer models that you can service impact analysis you know any of these problems are graphs and and I think that's the area and it's not just my intuition is the reality I mean I see that the leaders in that space all the software companies that are producing the you know the OSS system that the the software that edit any telecom they tell telcos in the world are using to run the network of basting graphs all the leading vendors in that space are already not only using brass but using a chain so that's that's the area where we are stronger and what I see even more growth [Music] right so I think now with with 5g coming up and and the Internet of Things will leverage 5g and and there's a huge trend in the direction of automation automation of services anything provisioning a service reacting to failure it's all about being able to automate the response to any of these things and that's perfectly aligned with a solution like neo4j because neither J will give you not just an accurate and timely representation of your network in the services and all the elements are involved in the delivery of a service but also it's an actionable platform is an active platform where you can build also logic that will simplify and accelerate these automation so I think that's the area we'll see more growth over the next few months years [Music] well my advice is just just just download neo4j oh go to star the sandbox and and play with it but when you're taking it seriously just call us I mean get it get it get it expert advice because I was saying before easy things are easy when when it gets complicated it's very important I'm not saying people I mean people do get me become experts with neo Vijay on their own sometimes but it's always good to get the advice of the experts and anything around best practices like I'm sure whatever the problem you'll come you're trying to solve we've done it before successfully with some customer with some other user and that's something with we love to share I mean we I think we were very very how would I call it when we produce a lot of content I mean we love sharing what we what we what we learn and what we do but yeah reach out to us and nothing that would be by advice try it of course get your hands dirty do it but when the when you want to take it seriously reach out to us [Music] you
