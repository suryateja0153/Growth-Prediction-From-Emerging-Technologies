 hi my name is Brock I reckon I'm the founder of this platform called Graff comments I think the what writes on the entrance text there is the things wrong or I think the program has changed so I'm basically here now for you guys to talk about and graph comments for 15 minutes so this is an online platform graph cameras comm where you can actually you know create graphs manually visually or import your data or just use an API programmatically to interact with graphs so it's an online service it looks like this when you log into this page it's an open collaborative platform it's free to use so it's the target audience for this type of product is basically everybody and mostly the types of people use this platform are like journalists activists artists you know curators archive researchers investigative journalists and so on and these people use this craft system because it's quite easy to use obviously just like a wreckin like the way you you know do hand-drawn diagrams on the whiteboard you can actually come and use this platform in the same way I'll show you some examples of that it's so it's quite accessible as well so just browser it's opened up for the browser and then you can start using it right away and there's currently more than 15,000 users of this platform around the world in many different languages people make graphs of you know a variety of different things and there are like thousands of thousands of graphs on the platform at the moment and we use a single instance of neo4j for this at the moment so the way it works is usually if it works yeah there's a little video here and there's a visual interface like this one you can just define a type and enter in some name you know make these notes then click one note click another one that's a connection define the connection you know you will wait or something and then you can just you know like the way you think in your mind you can start building a graph like that quite easily from a visual what you see is what you get interface you can make you know there's some advanced features like you can make multiple connections at once and so on also it can import from a spreadsheet like you know you know google spreadsheets or you know excels and CSV is and so on and and once you import it there's a certain structure for the template you just get this nice graph right and now we have these features they can instead be utilization interface obviously you can navigate through the graph by selecting like the way you select a file on your desktop and then highlight those paths between the you know between within a complex graph right this is something that we usually do all the time and we are dealing with graphs and on the right bar we have these features such as you know filter the graph based on some properties of these nodes you know they may have certain common properties so you can use them to filter and filter certain parts of the graph we also apply quite simple analysis like you know degree distribution off the graph or you know based on or the distribution of some property among the all the nodes in academia graph and things like that and the nice thing about graph cameras that is a social platform so people come here make these graphs also share online on Twitter Facebook and I was elsewhere and they can embed their graphs into like medium posts or you know like a YouTube video it becomes an interactive graph within a in a different page and so it allows distribution of the graph to acquire why the audience in the world also there's this place where you can start building a community for around your graph you know because this graph is also it's not just a drawing or a simple data set it's actually convening some information to you know audience about very specific information about to an audience and it allows anyone to explore interesting aspects of a complex issue that we have at hand right so usually that's why journalists prefer this because when they write an article that has lots of our actors in them they build up this story phase using a graph structure like that or an organization can do apply an organization organizational strategy for therefore the multiple actors who are interacting in many ways among each other using a simple tool like that so I'll show you a couple of examples and then finish this talk it's not gonna be long one short one we have an API as well so you can just basically in this structure graph nodes edge and none in that there's some no objects so you can just push in and then you see the graph you can query it back you can use some of the a park you know those more advanced calls to the to the graph itself and we had these nice options for selecting things within a graph because usually a graph is giant and then not everyone can stand everything at once so to be able to digest this a complex system like that you wanna really look at a certain area are gonna move slowly navigate the graph you know and step by step so for that reason we have many different options even like a system for making stories out of graphs so as an example like we can also provide all these options for PDF exports and and you know SVG exports will make exhibitions but this is one example this from the Moxie Museum in Rome city of Rome in Italy people make witchcraft comes again used they made these you know amazing work and then this is the journalistic work it's in Turkish in from Turkey it was about some you know corruption case that happened around the regime and then the organization published is vertically to video into the page and on the cover of the page it's something they are quite proud of so again on graph Commons people make you know all kinds of organizations use this like again academic institutions think tanks NGOs so not just individuals but also organizational use cases common and this is how actually we sustain the graph as a business itself a graphic common services itself so I'll show you some examples about that these are all life on the internet you can check yourself as well as public information and for instance this one is called braxnet so some enthusiasts or journalists I'm not sure who they are actually what they these people is actually one person what and all of collaborators of this person made this graph himself and this is basically the story of brexit you know in the UK and what influences breaks it in a lot ways and so on so forth so when you look at the details you'll see you know I'm going to navigate this right briefly there's obviously these parties you know in this Conservative Party in the UK and these are individuals who are influencing I think let's see what the connection is that they collaborating with this party collaborate and and you know these are all mobile obviously the interactive image so you can see in this graph like the green dots are like certain area I think the red zone other I'm not sure what they're let's look at this from the UFO and so in this info we have a little summary of what's happening in this graph the types of nodes what they are so we consider in this case players organizations breaks that campaigning groups which are black dots and then government institutions which are in orange and an interpretive connections type this person made these maps and use collaboration link between different nodes which among these active actors and also investigation so obviously Cambridge analytic I had some influence obviously in the sky in this issue so we have a map like that so I don't know much about this graph but I'm just you know showing you what I just see as well like the way you guys do I'm gonna show you other examples and maybe before moving on one thing is and the bottom you see it is a license so all of these graphs are licensed in Creative Commons license to the author of the graph the graph okay and you can get download this data as a JSON format and used in your own projects as well as long as you sorry as long as you reference back to this graph and the water and so on another example this is a journalist from Turkey who made a map about the Syrian refugees and there the support network around them this is international national local and regional levels if I so every graph at the cover page like that you answer you get the brief information you enter in you know in the graph you get the graph in the background now there are these different cities that Qatar is a big city is close to the Aleppo the big city of Syria and there are many camps around them the blue dots are the so the orange dots are the camps like these ones for instance here you can see many and we can zoom in some of them for instance like you on this one guy is in the city of art I and also the the this camp itself the container city and gets support from the effort which is a national organization like you know the Red Cross type organization in Turkey you can also see which countries and the world help to this conflict you know from Germany as an example on top yeah Germany so when I click on a note I see the detailed card here it was the information about this part of the note this can be a content this can be different properties or visible on the on the right bar I see you know different organizations from Germany actually active in this conflict for instance this organization called co-chair what and I cannot really read German sorry but they're active in Gaza on tips if you have guards down tip if you if you want to see here what what they do they just do international app campaign the thing about this type of graph is like obviously you can apply you know network analysis find sensualities this is this is a useful case when you have a graph with a very limited amount of edge types and node types right usually when you have a complex not edge structure which many different you know semantic properties it's really hard to apply it so there's in graph commerce there is no limitation to what you can do in those kind of analytical tools but at the same time people use it in different ways that they said this is an example where you have a graph where there's you know every edge may mean different thing and then there's actually a semantic poker structure in there so it's not easy to analyze a graph like this but the thing is in a graph like this you see these comments section there's a conversation going on like people are asking like you know what else what about this other data type that I know about this story can you add that or can you you know remove that you know things like that's more like contributions from the larger wider community into the graph happens on this right bar I'm gonna switch one more graph this one is about art so in this case what we see is that the connection between the artist any artist and and is being in a collection is the relationship so red dots are collectors black dots are artists and if there's a connection between an artist and a collection which means an artist is pieces in the collection an art collection that means there's a link between them and sometimes you have ticked lines which means how we see they're like multiple pieces from an artist in that collection for instance this person let's see as an example sang ma good with some artists and Andy's in like three collections here or we can see you know obviously some art collectors like this one it's quite big and they have many different artists in their PE work and if you zoom out a bit more you see it's in the right-hand side of the of the graph this means something there's a little sensuality going on there obviously and so in a graph like this you can start reading the you know the the influence of collectors in the art world and in certain art world just very functional there's no there's only one relationship type which is being in a collection and then there's two types of nodes you know artists and collectors another example I'm showing these because the two Nets thank you because as we know like in the in the world of crafts and they're like only 13 use cases like very limited and very you know me only apply to shipping you know systems or you know like you know security like in the previous session or or you know some certain organizational structures and so on and even in graph cameras people do all kinds of stuff quite wild and what they do this one is an example is an etymological map I'm a pathological Tamala G of alphabet itself so for instance this person takes a book and you know observes the book whatever is happening in the book and takes those the the dictionary basically of etymology and looks at different you know letters and where they come from and then makes those connections between these different you know verbs and you know phrases in the history so something I was I learned a lot from this graph like I'll show you one thing that I like I think this might is this one let me see yeah here this one the word RK is a Greek word is actually some that has so many openings it opens to an R key it opens the archive it opens the architecture it opens to archeology interesting like now this is something you can see is the visually this means this is a Turkish graph it means Ganesh means is from Allah Xie is from our share our she is from our sheõs which is from our Co Co Co cause here and so on ok so again very like like you know a mind flow of type of graph not really very well structured but actually if you can build this more in a very complex one you can access to analyze in these type of graphs in variety of ways something very technical in p.m. packages note you know note yes and then note like this programmatically done as you can tell from the background so I mean look at the since details the giant graph and shows how each node package depends on the other one right so its dependency of note pack or library is basically in the node package system very interesting graph and I mean this has been very popular there are like post about this online I can you can find yourself I'll show you one more example and finish this this is dog Jones is using graph counts and what they do is like they need a map of the the Hurricanes big natural disasters and how they affect which industry in what ways so they write a program behind the scenes which is analyzing this data and then they put it into this graph common structure and then it generates these graphs and then they can embedded to their to their own no Network effects page here like what we see a thing is it says club I know what story Zach Duke a huge company yeah it's like something here so it's like with geographic areas affected by hurricanes in 2017 your ma Harvey you know different places I guess when you zoom in you start seeing a city and then what kind of things happen like they made you know each node into events concepts and locations and it's complicated but I think still it's a good try so it's hard to model a graph in a good way as you know this very challenging thing but this is one example so there's you can go to this page and then check out yourself other examples oh yeah one more thing maybe and now I'll finish it so we also on graph comes Terrill of projects which are about crypto you know things about crypto in general Cooper networks one examples it was one which is showing the this is the analysis of the the the etherium tokens and then and the ownership of these tokens so in this little filter on the right hand side I'm just gonna filter down a bit these are the top hundred tokens with the highest market cap and if you zoom into this I just what I did here on the right hand side is the I reduce down to edge weight and then so we filter down and now we can see a for system token like REEP have joined share holders with other tokens as an example so you can with a map like this you know you can play this around also and see like who's more central in terms of shared ownership and so on okay thanks a lot for you for listening me and I'll just gonna tell you that you can see about learning about graph comments from graph comes calm and also add graph comments in all social media Twitter Instagram Facebook yeah okay thank you [Applause]
