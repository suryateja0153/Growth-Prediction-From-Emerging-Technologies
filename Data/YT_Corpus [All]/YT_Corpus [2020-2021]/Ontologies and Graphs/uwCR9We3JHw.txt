 welcome to hack my growth in this episode we're going to be doing an introduction to structured data we're gonna be looking at what it is what it's not why it's important and how you can get started with it today all right let's go are you looking to grow your business but you're not sure where to start that's what we can this your first time watching or maybe been watching awhile and you have not yet hit that subscribe button please do so now we create new content each and every week to help you get the most out of your digital marketing activities and don't forget to turn on alerts that way you know each and every time we create a new video alright let's get into the content so why should we use structured data semantic search is based around entities and Humminbird which is the core of Google's search engine is at the heart of semantic search and really Google's transition from strings into things in order for Google to understand a string which maybe is it's a line of text they need to understand the context of that so an entity is something that exists in itself so we can really think of like person place or thing this would be like a noun right now for search engines to know what an entity is they need a standardized language that can describe it so entities allow Google to understand how the thing you're talking about really fits in to the whole concept understand the attributes understanding the qualities and the properties with that thing possesses and as you can understand this has a huge implication to SEO because if you can supply more context and you can really meet the intent of the users query this can really help your page rank better but more importantly drive qualified traffic because it's gonna meet the end-users needs so in order for Google to understand more about our business or our value proposition it has to understand the following who our products and services are for so who's our audience why our products and services are the best option for that audience and then how they deliver value to the end users now they seem like basic questions but you can create the right semantic connections to these questions and this will again have a direct impact on your site's trust your site's Authority and its reputation if you're able to clearly say what you do and how delivers value and you can back that up that is gonna translate in more qualified traffic it's gonna translate in better rankings if you have a lot of the other factors in place too like so you can't just do structure data and expect everything to work you also have to have it optimize site on-page you need to have a good off page practices and you need to be doing all the other things as well but this can really help the right foundation to our Google fully understands who you are and what you do have a structured data help now let's look at this example this is just a very basic example but I think it should give a little bit of a visual idea of how this works so a web crawler will visit a page and the web crawlers starting to read the content and then it's going to look to see if it knows or understands that content so here the crawlers asking the database the search engine alright this page is about Jaguars what do we know about that and it sends the information over and and let's say the the database says ok this could be an animal and it could be a car but we're not sure you need to keep digging so and the crawlers got to continue to read and continue to look at that content to see if it fully understands it so how would this be different if this page had structured data on it well here in the same example the crawler reads it but now it incurs and comes across structured data talking about something specific so this page is about the Jaguar a South American jungle cat and here the search engine index will say great I can index this using the structured data provided that was so much easier on me and I really understand what the site's about so structured data is basically speaking the language and helping to make those direct connections with the content and the context of the page so this is really important structured data is not a shortcut to better rankings it is gonna make indexing cleaner it's gonna help the search engines better understand you but just because you have it on your site you're not guaranteed anything you're not guaranteed any reach bridge feature listing you're not guaranteed any better results it's not a ranking factor but it is still important structured data is a label and it's applied to markup formats that allows Google and search understand to better understand the data in its indexes so it's really essentially metadata and metadata is just data about data and it's specifically for the search engines not people people aren't going to read your JSON people aren't going to read your markup the search engines will and it's important and helpful for them the primary purpose is to help with better indexing and understanding so that is extremely important but as we know right now it's not technically a ranking factor in order to ranked you have to have high quality content you have to deliver value the content has to be unique you need to have links your page needs it has Authority I mean there's so many other factors that structured data is still important because it helps with indexing and understanding so how do you add structured data to your site well there's a couple of different ways that you can do this the three most common machine readable annotations that are actually recognized and processed by major search engines are RDF a which stands for resource description framework attributes you have html5 microdata and then you have Jason LD so somebody asked John Mueller of Google which type they prefer and he answered that they currently prefer json-ld markup you can see the source there to read a little bit more about this if you're interested but Google is preferring us to use Jason LD Jason LD is is a lot easier to write a lot of the times and then some of the others it's it's very easy for somebody who doesn't have a lot of background in processing structured data or creating structure data and the other types of annotations so this is the type that we also prefer and if you're interested in learning more about that we have other videos on this as well there's a number of different structured data vocabularies the most popular is probably schema.org schema.org is one that was built with Google Yahoo Microsoft and a lot of the other search engines and it's one that most of the markup today is based off of especially when we're looking at Google's rich features which those are things like the knowledge graft featured snippets the carousels of videos or images local business non knowledge graph things like that those are typically based off schema.org structured data but we have other types of structured data as well we have the open graph structured data this is typically associated with Facebook this is going to structure your content from when it's shared on that social channel you can use Twitter cards Twitter cards are very similar to Open Graph but instead of for Facebook they're for Twitter you also have micro formats these are things like hcar or age calendars there's a number of other micro formats as well each card each calendar are some of the earliest types of structured data and you can think of these like digital business cards or calendar links that you may have saved data into your your Microsoft Office you know V cards things like that that's really where these micro formats come out of there's also a number of other vocabularies and ontology z' which can describe a number of different things we're not going to get into all of those in this video because this is really just an introduction to structured data but know that you're not limited to just these types of structured data now it is important to understand which Google is preferring in which they're using which they're not so one of the ones they were using was something called Dublin core Google is no longer looking at dublin core structured data and they are definitely pushing more and more to schema.org which has made it obviously extremely important for anybody interested in ranking enriched features so one last thing Google and other search engines can extract entities and information from unstructured data so just because your site doesn't have this doesn't mean you're going to be penalized by following guidelines in structuring the information on your site it can have a huge impact on how your site is indexed by Google and also how its displayed in the SERPs how it's being shown to the users when they're typing it in owning these rich features can have a major impact on driving relevant and qualified traffic to your website so thanks for checking out this video I hope you found it helpful and intuitive this is just a basic introduction of structured data but if you're interested in learning more check out some of the other videos on our channel or comment below we
