 now that we've explored the yelp data a bit we're going to take a deeper look at business categories some of you may have noticed that there are many business categories in yelp that seem to be related but really aren't organized together uh for example uh we can safely assume that there's some relationship in food style and possibly some similar tastes between something that's categorized as a sushi bar and one that's categorized as a ramen shop and we can imagine how being able to group similar businesses is is essential for certain types of analysis such as you know finding general preferences but also just for creating an intuitive navigation for users for different types of businesses so our challenge for this section is to take a list of random businesses and random business categories and automatically create a taxonomy that's easier for users to traverse and since it would be tedious to do this manually on even a small data set we'd want to learn the structure and hierarchy of business that using the data that's already hiding there in the yelp information we'd like to use graph algorithms to to extract that information the overlap similarity algorithm is a perfect choice when we're trying to find hierarchy and data and want to create super or sub categories it this is related to how it measures overlap between two groups of nodes mathematically the coefficient that it provides is defined as the intersection divided by the smaller of the two groups the algorithm provides a similarity coefficient that represents the co-occurrence of items between those groups if we take a a bit of an example and take a look at overlap similarity we can see there's two sets here set a set b and the overlap between those or rather the intersection between those is orange and banana those are the two items that occur in both sets so the intersection is two in that case now the overlap similarity algorithm then uses the um the smaller of the two sets which one's smaller between a and b we can clearly see that b is smaller it has three items in it and then it divides that intersection by the smaller of those two sets in this case two divided by three which gives us gives us a 0.66 coefficient now if we change just one item here i've changed the apple for cherry here in in set b we can see how and visually see how we would get a overlap similarity of 1.0 because one set completely can is contained within the other set so although the overlap similarity can be used to evaluate general similarity it's often used because it because it uses the smaller of the two sets as the denominator it's often very very useful for extracting subgroups and of course finding multiple subgroups is is a very effective way to create a taxonomy by the end of the section we've updated the user's navigation to reflect top level categories of the yelp businesses you should be able to explain what the overlap coefficient represents and be familiar with the narrower than relationship to help build a taxonomy then of course we'll have a short quiz to evaluate progress
