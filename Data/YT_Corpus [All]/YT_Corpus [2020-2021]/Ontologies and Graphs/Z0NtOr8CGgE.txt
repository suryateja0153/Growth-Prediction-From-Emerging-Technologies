 [Music] okay I think it's about time to get started welcome everyone i'm cliff Lynch the director of CNI and I'm very pleased to be able to welcome you to the first project briefing session of the third week of our 2020 virtual conference this presentation is on ontology for scholarship the revising of the vivo and ontology we have two speakers with us today they will be presenting starting in just a moment and Violeta will lead off we will take questions at the end Diane golden Brookhart from CNI will be moderating the questions and we would invite you to use the Q&A tool at the bottom of your screen posed questions at any point when they occur to you and we'll come and take all of those questions up at the end so with that let me just say once say welcome one more time and turn it over to Violetta Thank You cliff thank you CNI for having us talk to you today about the vivo project and the vivo ontology both Mike and myself are presenting on behalf of weave ontology interest group we hope you are all safe and staying home so with that I would like to start off by saying that the vivo project provides an open source approach to collecting studying and showcasing the scholarly work of an institution and sharing data about the work using a common ontology the vivo ontology has experienced demands - it represents represent new forms of scholarship while adopting best practices into design and ontological development domain representation had emerged and much good work can now be incorporated in a revised and model arise ontology which is the goal of the vivo ontology tool a first domain has been isolated and a work product is available and that is the language ontology which is based on the iso 639 - 3 which can be used to represent the language capabilities of people and the languages of their works this is very important because we have learned that that's with eva being international there is many requests for being able to represent the language of the scholarship and the language capabilities of the scholars so in this presentation we will describe the pressure Sundin told you to modernize the domains of representation that can now be separated new forms of scholarship to be represented best practices for new logical development being adapted by the project and the current state of the work to revise the ontology next slide please it's not a bad thing this so why do we want to revise the vivant origin there are many reasons for this and some of them are improving the representation of scholarship the breath the debt and the consistency we would also like to address technical depth licensing issues methodology use of other anthologies what exactly is happening here this new ontology will with related ontology modules is based on community standards there are multiple tools documents and training available to work with the new oncologists and how of course because this is an open project open source project this is an open multi-year effort to develop test and implement the new ontology in the vivo software upgrade the existing data document and train the next slide vivo development has a goal of the coupling various components of the vivo environment the current software is heavily dependent on the ontology future interface software operates from a decouple index easily populated from any ontology the vivo ontology interest group has been meeting for more than a year to identify issues related to the ontology implementing incremental changes to the ontology is difficult in the current vivo environment it was last attempt at the 2013 with the significant difficulties a full-scale version upgraded ontology can be planned years in advance to include all the changes change management acquired ontological practice has matured significantly in the past 12 years since the vivant ology was created best practices can be implemented to significantly improved ontology and its related models so in the slide for the bf for the basic formal ontology is for data sharing and bf4 came out of the biomedicine because they started first doing this kind of work it's heavily using the open biomedical ontologies and the bf4 is an upper level it can be used in any domain which doesn't I just want to mention that this doesn't restrain it only to biomedical sciences every any ontology can be expanded if you use your vocabulary and I use my vocabulary for example we need to translate to be able to share the Oba standards are a good thing in the large community of urban ecology maintainer they have adapted best practices for ontology development and maintenance and we actually are planning on following those standards because to be fair we would did not do a perfect job it subsumption hierarchies we have a lot of stuff that are kind of misclassified and we would like to revise this ontology and put everything in place the way it should be so we will be able to easily share the data with anybody else and vivo does not fully comply profoundly because of the number cross names the name and in the way we version the ontology for example Oba required class labels to be unique and we don't do that currently we are working on all of this and the work will be share with all of you when we are heading in the slide the next slide slide 5 of course much good work has been done across many projects for example the Biba the ero there is research ontology vivo needs a consistent well maintained set of ontology to represent scholarship ontology is based on standards a lot for sharing of data regarding scholarship vivo Intel intends to capitalize on this good work to build consistent well maintained oncologist represent scholarship we found out unfortunately that as CC by licenses are not recommended for ontologies we would like to and we would prefer to use the CC 0 vices like mike says and tribution is polite but not required in the CC 0 but that's what we would like to be able to do to be able to build on other anthologies so the vivo ontology 2 will contain assertions regarding the relationship between terms in the vivo ontology and those in other on top and now our they'll hand it over to Mike okay so when you're building an ontology to represent scholarship you want to reuse as much work as you can and in version one of the vivo ontology we used quite a number of different ontology x' but that created some ontological inconsistency because the anthologies were not using the same upper level ontology it also created some potential like licensing difficulties as Violetta described and then over the years we found out that um some of these ontology were not actively maintained and so as we came to own our collection of ontological work we came to the kind of conclusions that that we just heard about with regard to selecting until ontology x' and then assembling them into something that that might be useful for representing scholarship our current thinking is that we'll continue to use the anthologies that you see there they meet the the criteria of being well main having BFO as an upper level ontology or being readily mapped to the BFO upper ontology and open license in an appropriate way we expect to be referencing a number of other ontology x' not directly using their terms and so when and and we may reference terms that are in wiki data for example which isn't actually an ontology but that's a set of a set of rdf terms that that are useful for representing things and so our ontology is likely to reference those things so the people using the vivo Oncology can find additional material about the terms that we're defining and using and then we intend to create modules that are complete ontological entities which may not referee may not reference vivo at all but can be used by vivo to represent oh we've always supported the concept of local module last extension of the beans but as we move forward we create ontological artifacts that can be assembled in a in a in a scalable way and Violetta described I've just got one of those little notes that my connection is unstable so I stopped talking whenever I see one of those things and Violeta described the language ontology which we will have a draft available to the public shortly the language ontology as you let it describe is a complete is a complete standalone ontology it's based on iso 639 3 and the common european framework for capabilities and kind of languages and can be used to represent the the capabilities of people organizations translation of works and represent the language of works and you see a github repository there I'm the VEVO domain is the domain of scholarship and this scholarly domain is can be quite broad as we all know scholars are involved in a wide range of different activities here we show you a merman thing examples of from a in a class hierarchy point from us our point of view for those noodle you know the this example you know a cat is a mammal alright so these arrows that we're seeing here are all is type relationships and so in the lower left we see an orchid ID and an orchid ID is a centrally registered identifier and then essentially registered identifier is an information content entity in this figure this is our proposed hierarchy the yellow items are from the BFO upper level ontology the white items are from an existing information artifact ontology that is consistent with with BFO and then the the blue of items are items that are introduced by vivo to create a comprehensive approach to representing scholarship as we move forward with with the you know we've been in a vivo business for the ontology has been around for about 13 years but there are areas in the representation that we currently have that need to be extended and improved so for example attribution I was not it has been an emerging topic over the last decade trying to create and improve our ability to attribute the work of people who participated in scholarly activity beyond that beyond simple authorship so we might want to know who created the figures so who did the data analysis or who wrangled the data or other elements of the construction of a scholarly work and that would be true whether it's a whether across all domains of scholarship whether its scientific domain or humanities domain we want to be able to get sort of inside the work and understand the nature of the participation of the people involved all of the other areas that we see up there have similar depth issues where we can go deeper in into representing the the nature of the scholarship we've done a fair amount of work to date trying to lay groundwork for the the work to come in in creating ontological artifacts and so we see thoughts about different parts of the scholarly domain and have we may choose to represent them in the work that goes forward all of these are links you'll have access to the presentation and then the presentation these are actual links to Google Docs that are publicly available I say you'll be able to dive down on any of the areas if you're interested and then for additional information about the work that we're doing you can you can check in with our ontology interest group and we meet bi-weekly and discuss all manners of representing scholarship and all manners of owning and operating an ontology in a public way and then there's a link there to the actual text of the current vivo ontology that version 1 and as we move out with additional artifacts there'll be both be github artifacts for those as well so with that I'd like to thank you for listening and perhaps we have time for some questions thank you very much Mike and Violetta it was really interesting I have to say it's been fascinating to watch the development of the vivo project over the last decade and really fascinating to hear these developments in the ontology so we appreciate you coming to see and I to share that with us at this point I'd like to invite anyone who has questions to please type them in the Q&A box which you should see at the bottom of your zoom screen you're also welcome to share them via chat if you prefer while we are waiting for folks to think about the presentation and some questions that they might have I just want to take an opportunity to remind you that this webinar is part of CN eyes ongoing spring virtual membership meeting which will continue through the end of May with lots of offerings yet to come and I'm pasting into the chat box there the direct link to the complete schedule of upcoming project briefings and this afternoon we have two more project briefings including the first presentation from our our call for proposals involving topics relating directly to the kovat 19 crisis that one will be starting at 2:30 this afternoon Eastern Time and then follow it followed by a project briefing on simply e about an academic ebook experience so I hope you will join us for those project briefings and many more throughout the next several weeks and with that it looks like we do have a question for our presenters and their question is could you please explain a bit more about what would be included in the quote teaching extension that you mentioned as a possible new direction sure so the in in the original vivo conception and and modeling teaching was handled in a very simple way we basically wanted to be able to answer the question who taught what and so we we could connect a person with a with an instance of a teaching thing but we weren't clear about what that teaching thing was and we weren't clear about the difference between the classroom experience as a from another logical point of view as an occurrence something that occurred in time akin to an event performance gathering that kind of thinking of a classroom experience from the concept or idea or term of a course the way the Registrar might conceive of a course as being an entry in a catalog of courses and so that's an information content entity clearly and appears in a in a in a in a in a collection of courses and then takes part in things like requirements for degrees so you must take this course in order to complete that degree that concept of a course is very different than the course concept of a gathering like this one that we're having today and so we we discussed that contention our difference between the course as an informational content entity and the course as a as a as a gathering it turned out that the University of Florida had clear language about this and had always considered these things to be completely and totally separate course was reserved for the concept of the information content entity the thing that would appear in a degree requirement that's called that is a course the thing that you teach is not called a course it's called a course section and so economics 101 might have many course sections one taught by me and one taught by somebody else and one taught by somebody else and the catalog or the you know the catalog says economics 101 and then the student finds a course section that they want to participate in 1/8 okay and so that language about teaching and taking courses that's about course sections hmm okay and that was very clear where I came from but was not very clear to others and so when we saw the vivo ontology originally we said course what's that and they said you know the thing you teach and we said you know like no we don't know what that is so so we started this conversation about separating those two ideas almost 10 years ago so and and the University of Florida immediately created a local extension and used course to mean the thing that participates in a degree requirement and use the thing that vivo sent us as course section so so we separated them immediately so yeah that's what we're planning to do is eventually separate them and then be able to say things like this course section consisted of course meetings and this the course meeting on September 13th was hosted by so-and-so so we could get all the way down to the detail of we had a special guest star appear in our course at that moment and and when you're representing the scholarship the people who are doing guest lectures or doing guest lectures and courses you need that kind of representation and and we didn't have so interesting that's great thank you thanks for that explanation and thank you for that question Nancy we do have a little more time if there are other questions similarly if you would like to make a comment or engage directly with micro Violeta this zoom environment does permit me to move you into speaking mode so if you want to raise your hand I can recognize you and allow you to address and engage directly with our speakers I don't see any more questions coming in via the Q&A except for now I do see another question coming through the Q&A so let me read you that question earlier you mentioned ontology to describe institutions and I'm wondering if you're leveraging a standard for institutions it's an excellent question oh yes we are this is yes we're like yes so this is this is difficult so there's two parts here one is the ontological work to represent an organization and what we want to say about an organization and then there's the data about organizations that we might use to create instances of organizations in an ontology the on both sides were interested in standards and on the data side there appeared to be at least three and and so we have been in conversations with war people at CNI actually a previous CNI meetings and and well before that we were working with the grid people at digital science before there was great so we were talking to them about how they would create grid and how the representation might work we mapped grid to the vivo to the existing vivo ontology and created a full RDF representation of grid in for vivo and put that in open vivo our our which is available on the web so open vivo org complaint contains a complete RDF representation of the grid data and we have the tools to update that as necessary now we'll do the same thing for the raw data and I and so we're we been in conversation about the raw data I think our last ontology meeting may have been about the raw data and so we're definitely interested in Rohr and establishing a standard for identifying organizations and for and for representing information about the month logically one concern we have about the raw data since I'm here is that roar is very focused on scholarship as are we but it turns out that in certain elements of scholarship they are very interested in large collect organizations that are not considered scholarly so an example might be the laboratory people I work with so I'm a I'm a funded NIH investigator I work with metabolomics people they buy equipment they buy equipment from companies it's important that we are able to represent what company made the equipment that is in their laboratory and so we have a chain from the investigator to their equipment to the vendor and the vendor is not scholarly hey but the vendor needs to be known and needs to be known in the scholarly realm and so we have the need to represent a large collection of organizations not just scholarly organizations and to that end we've also been looking at wiki data so wiki data has you know hundreds of thousands of organizations and has no particular interest in scholarship so they represent everything so that might be useful to us the ontological representation will be the same regardless the basic ontological elements of organization you know what kind of an organization is it contact information location information identifier information the ontological model but that we would expect to hold up regardless of whether we're representing grid data or or data or wiki data no that was really interesting and Robin says thank you Mike and good to good to hear from you interesting issue on operations and vendors and if anyone from Brewer is here perhaps they would like to weigh in very interesting observation so apprec very much appreciate that explanation and we do still have a little more time if there are any other questions for Mike and Violeta here's another question similar similar question is earlier regarding a standard for subject domains and subdomains what do you say about that well I may have flash by but we're currently four sub domains I think you I think you mean like topics so so so you want to say the person is interested in physics or this book is about aeronautical engineering that that what we mean by is that what you mean Nancy thanks know from which subject discipline does a teacher or scholar come from she means oh okay well that's actually that's that's interesting because those are those are vaguely related so of course we always represent the person as being a member of a department and so that that's like an explicit thing that has to do with their academic home and then vivo provides the opportunity to represent the research areas that a faculty member is interested in or anybody is interested in and those research in areas usually come from a controlled vocabulary and and maybe a lot as the expert on this so you want to talk about what the we use feel yes we use two vocabularies and we went by the way depending on the institution and needs of that institution was the focus where the some liberal arts colleges may not want to use the mesh vocabulary for example you can upload your own vocabulary in vivo and you can utilize that yes and fast we've used the fast okay February but fast vocabulary did not have the term for biostatistics which is my academic discipline so it had 500,000 terms but it didn't have that one so a local extension will always be necessary apparently I think it's time is that right I think we lost Violetta she said she had to drop off for - for another meeting oh I see okay and I think we're coming up to the time for your second okay how you do this well we we do have a little more time if there are others that have any questions Nancy wanted to thank you and then she comments there's always a problem with whatever you use that's correct that's why we have that local trapdoor for all of our for well with that I I will go ahead and close out the formal public portion of this webinar and thank you so much Mike and thank you to Violetta although I'm sorry I wasn't able to thank her before she had to leave but again we really appreciate you coming to CNI to talk to us a little bit more about bebo and we wish you luck with
