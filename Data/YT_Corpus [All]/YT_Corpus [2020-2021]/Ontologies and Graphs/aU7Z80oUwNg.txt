 Hello and welcome back to FIB-DM, the Financial  Industry Business Data Model. Now, this is   The third installment in the Semantics series. It's  called "Semantics for Business Users."   In previous sessions, we covered the background of the model and the structure of the model.   In this session, we will examine the business content and also explore the   methodology to work with the model. The session is mainly for Finance Users and also for   client-facing Data Architects and Ontologists who work with users. okay now understanding the   model scoping and designing with finance users  the 50m is enormous there 1,875 entities as of   now and it's still growing the maybe 2,500 NT  trees in a year from now and this is where the   fundamental concepts are bridge for ontology stand  data architects new to the model to understand the   design and content the concept maps are also  bridge between the data architect into finance   user and some of me may have seen the visual guide  to to the 50 M resources so fall modules come with   a little info card like like this no and so this  introduction is for all audiences and it it covers   the fibre definition concert hierarchy and the  most important associations so all fundamental   concepts are ultimate super types defined in  Fido foundation and that is a package in the   open-source 50 M core model now some entities  for security swaps and indices are only in the   commercial version but the con except all have an  entity in the open-source car and a sudra here you   you're very welcome to download the PowerPoint on  the 50 and website and to commend permitted well   the fundamental concepts are for all audiences so  for data architects and modelers if you're new to   50 m and you want to understand the design to  scope and customize the model you you can use   the 15 concepts to dive into the model and and  understand it and also you you should use it the   concept maps for reviews and joint design with  your business clients now the finance user that   means somebody who will be using an application  that is based on on the 50 and database design   or who is a subject matter expert pulled in in  modeling session with with the data architects   so here you will find that the business concepts  and icons and easy and non-technical business   notations so it's easy for you to understand as  opposed to the complicated data models so the   15 concept charts that we will see later on there  for business users and as an ontology um you can   use the very same concept to understand scope and  customized survival so just like the da you can   use concept Maps rather than the complex graphs to  to work with the business you know how does this   lesson fit in to the education path now before  we had a module scoping our first data model for   50 M and that was the practical hands-on exercise  just doing it just make a concept map and scope a   model without having all background knowledge  and now this one is more back to lecture and   study here we cover all 15 concept and we also my  explain the methodology in greater detail so and   what will be next probably decks and lessons with  more detailed coverage of all the 15 concepts for   data architects and oncologists and likely more  practical exercises and in my mind I have swaps   and I have consumer loans and please if you have  any ideas suggestions what should be in the data   model resources please email me or or ping me on  LinkedIn now we looked at the semantic enterprise   information architecture before now we have the  financial industry business ontology at the top we   have a sip DM the data model if um the UML model  and in this session we introduced the fifth CM the   concept map and notes notable is that the concept  map is fully in sync with both the ontology and   the data model the concept maps have been agreed  vocabulary once agree if all business users have   have done that you can do freeform diagrams on  a whiteboard or in some visualization tool the   concept map is is basically a diagram that depicts  concepts and circles and then it has arrows   between the concept and the goal could be named  and how the financial industry business concept   map has standardized icons for four concepts and  it has the conformed and agreed vocabulary for   labels so concept maps and vocabulary established  direct correspondence between the map and the data   model so the left hand side we have the concept  map and each concept in it is an entity in the   scope data model its relation in the concept map  is an associative entity or an association in the   50m data model near they are the 15 concept so  they all have mnemonic icons and abbreviations   so after a while as the business users when you  think about your requirements you will think of   them in terms of these pictures and as a data  architect when you about to extend or customize   a model you will think about which of these 15  ultimate super types am I going to to extend each   concept is an in-depth business taxonomy so here  we have the agreement taxonomy as an example it   has 79 items underneath so agreement breaks down  into contract we have credit agreements financial   instruments securities and so on and now you can  use ms excel or other representations to research   for items in the taxonomy know so you can filter  by the taxonomy name and then you search and and   other fit does too to see what is a examines the  definitions and so on so you identify items that   fit your business requirements and one thing  please don't create synonyms so for example if   he is a fiber chords at antiquity instrument don't  make up a stock instrument which is the same thing   under a different name not work with your data or  business architect to extends it's a taxonomy as   needed here on Fitness concept map relationships  come from vocabulary of more than two hundred   degree terms and in the hands-on exercise and we  had the example was JP manches and 176 billion   capital and we we concluded JP and Chase as a  stock cooperation which is an autonomous agent and   the amount is a monetary amount a reference and  see association between the tools the relationship   in the concept map is hairs it should capital now  how did we come up with it in the Excel workbook   there are several sheets with Zizi vocabulary and  there we can find Hesse it should capital we also   find nominal capital and others we pick the one  that meets the requirements and then we can exit   to the concept map basically putting a name on  the arrow zero relationships that connects the   stock corporation to the monetary amount the  relationship pertained to designated concepts   in other words they are only valid for certain  concepts and here we have the pivot table of   relationships and fundamental concepts and we  can see as a highlight that has issued capital   it indeed has association to one subtype of the  autonomous agent AAA and to ref the reference Jung   Lewis was that we complete the conformed concept  map and for this we can use the 50m data model   resources the Visio template with concept stencils  and more any other concept map diagramming tool   not some power designer modelers create a custom  model and maps it to the 50 M conceptual model now   who does this exercise it really depends on your  organization the people on the project no it could   be the business subject matter expert a business  analyst data modeler or a finance user so the 15   concept the taxonomies interrelationships they  express 80% of the business data requirements   into high-level design so for the data architect  concept map and data model so in the business   introduction I said that there's a direct  correspondence between the concept map and fifth   data model and de cemento enterprise architecture  chords v CM is simplified conceptual data model   in sync with 50 M and indeed just like we derive  the PDM from an l DM we can derive a c DM from the   concept map and we should reflect C DM changes  in the concept map so the controlled vocabulary   of v CM comprises of 50 and base and associated  entities and associations the ms excel workbook   derived from data model list reports the two are  in sync so fundamental concepts are ultimate super   types in the data model not so the 15 fundamental  concepts are entities that are not subtype of any   other entity and they are the most important super  types ranked by the number of the subtype entities   and was that we have 70% of 50 M base entities so  non associations a subtype of the 15 concepts and   we see that here in the table another sync enroll  is the biggest one was 278 followed by reference   arrangement autonomous agent and then at the  end of the list you you have a smaller concept   now I always get asked that somebody points out  that interval and time instant are combined into   one concept although they don't have a common  super type again there's the judgment because   from business perspective the same the two are  the same no fiber is correct not to put a common   supertype on top of these however I banded the  two together for the concept Maps and by the way   the same is was occurring in the current type and  also if we were just doing this by tzer's by the   count by the numbers then we could as some would  argue that that language and convention didn't   make it into the concept maps are also they have  more subtypes than account here it is my judgment   to overrule the number saying that the count is  more important than than languages and this also   hints at that the concept maps are a methodology  so the 15 concepts are not cast in stone as fiber   releases new modules these numbers may change if  you customize the model extensively the numbers   will change or maybe your business users come  up and say it this is really important from a   business perspective can we have an icon for it  and also adopt a methodology of concept maps but   you don't have to stick with these a specific 15  concept for the rest of your life so the fifth   texana me is the subtype hierarchy so the business  user sees economy depicted as a diagram a list   or p1 image Excel or any other visualization  and that taxonomy derived from the data model   so it's okay to omit certain entities from the  user taxonomy so here's a written contract if it   doesn't add any explanatory value we can remove  move it from what the user sees now however we   should not add classification items here in the  user taxonomy unless we also add them 250ms and   entity the concept map relationships our data  model associations and associated entities so   the exit happier it has the underlying data for  the pivot table that the user looked at okay so   we have a relationship code and here the child of  the relationship is an associate of the PM entity   the name and the code for it and we can look up  what the ultimate parent offset associative entity   is in this case has has issued capital has legal  form has lender and so on and then the parent of   the relationship that is the base entity and  in this case it's a stock cooperation again we   have the name and the code now the user does not  need concept or relationship hierarchies in the   fifth concept map notation it it would become too  complex so you as the data modeler resolves the   intricacies of how and where concepts associate in  the data model and now additions to the controlled   vocabulary of concept map relationship must  reflect in the data model as new associations   again the two should be kept in sync so how can  we get our head around a 2000 entity data model   now one common approaches is middle-out now we  can start on a specific requirement or like the   core report that we had in the previous session  and then investigate the subject of the subtype   hierarchy or we follow the five of modules 950  em they're all packages and there we can start   with foundation Explorer b-e finance business  commerce sick these derivatives in and indices   no and oh yeah babe by the way the oncologist has  it a lot easier because she can examine and query   sample data we cannot do that in empower design  our urban and the fundamental concept approach   is top-down so we examine the business content  the subtype hierarchy and the associations of   our fundamental concepts so now for the ontology  ontology and data model hierarchies are the same   the only difference is in the diagram notation  so here we are we are looking at the data model   hierarchy for autonomous agent and the 50  M concept diagrams they can help you as an   oncologist to understand the 500 RDFS subclass of  class hierarchies so by all means go to the 50 M   website and download the fully scalable diagrams  yarn also for the oncologist the concepts and the   vocabulary directly correspond to the ontology  graph so just like concept map and data model   is the same so it's concept map and ontology  concept relations derive from 5ho RDFS range   domain and the OE restriction so create concept  Maps to communicate your design with finance users okay now a guide to the reference sheet there's  one single page reference sheet for each concept   and it has the concept icon it has the concept  name and abbreviation and an explanation was the   most important subtypes high-level diagram and  the number of subtypes under age concept in the   note there's a 50m website has fully scalable  diagrams of the complete subtype hierarchies   so he can download the earth SVG files and  you can print them out on your plotter and for the relationships we have a mini concept map  of the concept and it's direct relations and then   then explanation and examples of concept  relationships autonomous agent AAA so the   fiber says it's an agent that is an autonomous  individual that can adapt to and interact with   its environment so the intuitive subtype of a  a is a person so there can only be one record   of you in an autonomous agent table and likewise  the legal person and organization and automated   system now for the significant relationships the  most important is that the autonomous agent is   the identity for sings in role so your roles  as an investor borrower guarantor all converge   to one person and then we have reference here IDs  identify the autonomous agent there can be various   arrangement to classify the a a and government  entities govern locations such as the country   or municipality and in turn agreements govern  certain legal entities and organization here is   the sync enrolled TIR a single role is a relative  concept that ties something to rule a place in a   given situation or context so an example of that  are agent enroll such as controlling contract   party reporting party of legal and manager assets  are things of values mostly as financial asset or   collateral the functional entity that big tax  on amis underneath for government entities and   for financial service providers and then in the  financial markets we have pools and baskets that   model in DC's and pooled investment again many  subtypes underneath and facilities here and they   are venues to cover financial market places so  beware here of the hormonal facility in the 500   and 50m is a venue not in the sense of a credit  facility not for the relationships a service   provider and functional entity the sync enroll  provides products and it provides services and   it's a party enroll for agreement the sync in  rural issues documents as a registry or agency   it issues identify us and identify as in turn  identify other functional entities or service   providers no such as the example we we had in the  previous session the FDIC identifier identifies   a depository institution reference our EF the  fiber says the concept that refers to or stands   for another concept and for that identifiers  are the most important subtype of rep so M was   identify us underneath we have currency codes  and we have all our many system generated IDs   now like for accounts for for trades and so on  and then registry entries are very similar but   here you have the Registrar issuing the ID an  examples for that would be securities IDs beer   bank identifiers the legal entity identifier  and if you recall from our first scope data   model from the FDIC reference number issued by  the FDIC and then family courts and classifiers   they categorize things and not like some codes for  example currency are also a subtype of identifier   so here was the currency code we have again  as a design pattern of multiple inheritance   and IEF also supports expressions formulas  variables and measures all these are subtype   of ref and in combinations and they are used to  to model complex expressions now looking at the   relationships here the most important thing for  that ref does for other concept is identifies   so the the social security number identifies  an autonomous agent also you would have an   employee ID at your bank and you you would have  customer numbers was various other vendors and   service providers so all these are refs and they  go with the relationship identifies and then we   also identify we also identify locations and  agreements so that something like a contract   number a policy number entry a we identify  transactions the transaction ID is a reference   and many concepts have monetary amount years  just as an example we Caesars a commitment and   it has an amount and it's a committed mountain  and likewise most of the entities agreements contractual elements they all usually have  amounts ceilings associated wizard and then   arrangement my may further define as a reference  and that typically happens in the classification   and then sinks in role such as registers say  issue reference IDs the arrangement ARR and   thing of the mnemonic flower arrangement  it's an organizing structure for something   and one of the major arrangement is other schemes  so these are typically multi-level classification   schemes and you have sees for four indexes for  identification and so on now collections are   simple lists of things without any levels and  what's mostly used for is in capital markets   so if we model baskets pools portfolios and so  on that's where we associate relates them to   a collection and then we have life cycles and  their sync of the trade and product life cycle   and finally code sets these are also arrangement  here sing-off seen standard industry codes north   american industry codes all these are our code  sets so looking at the relationships arrangement   define resaw a references and also a reference  for example an index can be an argument for   the arrangement the arrangement can apply to a  contract in other words serves as a contract the   agreement refers to to an arrangement we spoke  about the basket pools portfolios so here the   basket for example has constituents and these are  sinks in role and the role is to be a piece in the   basket and it's played by a financial instrument  which is in agreement so we would navigate from   the arrangement to the sink enroll and then  over an another relationship to the agreement   and finally scatter words they comprise of  occurrence kinds in other words event types you your document do see and hear just think of paper  in a binder no so that's something tangible that   record something and besides Word document  it could be a voice recording photograph or   writing that can be used to furnish evidence  or information another is important subtypes   of off Doc our regulatory reports and legal  documents and here with legal documents as these   are Moses is a contract document so that's  the actual contract in in writing the fine   print and also your your driver's license is a  document no it's an identity document which in   turn is a legal document subtype of GOC and the  third major subtype are publications and here a   menacing of published financial information and  these are things like market rates quotes and   so on now to the car go into the relationships  so documents apply to agreements and as they   are the written contract and documents identify  autonomous agents and and also and also sinks   enrolled also think of the business license and  so on and documents can have various and dates   and time intervals associated and typically a  sink in rule publishes or issues documents and sinks in roll rate or sororities not which are  autonomous agent central banks they for example   set market rates yeah as a service and now the  next page will be product and just one word about   the tools these are two different concepts and  while some industry model commingled to and that's   conceptually wrong so the five 150m they do not  have a common super type for service and product   and due to understand the difference just think of  how you consume music so if you go go online to to   hear listen to stream music that is a service that  you may pay for monthly on the other end if you   buy an album as a physical CD or you buys a set of  mp3 files as that's a product so fiber defines the   service as a type of economic activity that is  a intangible it's not stored on your PC and it   does not result in ownership a service is consumed  it's a point of sale and now important sub types   of service are regulatory services registration  services and the easy financial services and with   financial services there we have the major one we  have banking investment insurance and securities   listing are looking at the relationships so sinks  enroll provides the services and an account may   realize the service here's as a banking example  would be if I have if I have a checking service   that would be provided to through my checking  account and then an agreement may may specify   services not for example a listing service  may list securities agreements and a payment   service may involve a payment obligation which  is a commitment and then some legal constructs   typically government laws and regulation  applied to to services okay product PRD and   here just think of the credit card okay so it's a  commercially distributed good that is tangible and   it can be the result or output of application  manufacturing production but something that   passes through a distribution channel before being  consumed or used now the important subtypes of the   product are contractual products and financial  products and here an example for the contractor   product is the time deposit account and all other  types of accounts and and there are many financial   products banking products over-the-counter  products and packaged financial products   again here both as subtype of the contractual NZ  financial products note for the relationships so   service providers sings in rows they provide the  product agreements realize the product and so   do the accounts and a product may comprise break  down into more products and document characterized   or specify the product your agreements AGI and  just remember the handshake so it's a negotiated   usually legally and forceful understanding  between two or more legally competent parties and   there's a main breakdown in the sub type hierarchy  mutual agreements and mutual contracts securities   offerings and contracts and mutual agreement  just means that you cannot transfer it without   the other parties consent as opposed to security  said that you can buy and sell and now credit   agreements are all forms of loans and lending and  the big hierarchies underneath is written contract   so that's a super type for all service agreements  organization covering agreements and very   importantly financial instrument and many more  looking at the relationships so agreements have   sinks in role as a contract parties or parties and  role and then of course we have various dates that   set the terms for the agreement not like the start  and end date and agreements confer commitments   of the parties and they may also confer legal  elements accounts realize easy agreement and in   turn the agreement realizes products and also not  depicted here services and remember in financial   instruments are agreements and transactions are  occurrence kind so hence reference the Security ID   can identify an agreement and a transaction apply  to the agreement commitments um and here just sing   off the engagement ring as a commitment to to  marry it's a legal construct which represents   the undertaking on the part of some party to act  or refrain from acting in some manner and subtypes   here's a breakdown of commitment our payment  obligation depth is a commitment guarantees   they are all self-explaining and contract term  said they can be used for other commitments   or specified in the contract looking at the  relationships so contracts confer commitments   sings enroll for example at depth or whose depth  the commitment to payback and commitments can have   various dates and often they will have references  which are monetary amounts not so typically like a   guarantee will have a maximum guaranteed amount  and it will have an effect as an end date and   commitments specify a current kinds for example  payments interest calculations and loans and   swaps and finally a commitment can be broken down  into into further commitments and that is realized   through the hairs provision relationship so the  contractual elements ee and here just sink off   the individual paragraphs in in a contract so they  are general and special arrangements provisions   requirements rules specification and standard  that form an integral part of an agreement or   contract and examples of said the breakdown is  priorities such as in in lunes conditions terms   and there's a formal definition of a contract and  mostly contractual commitments are used in the   capital markets and we use them for death terms  settlement terms derivative terms and so on now   for the relationships it's a small concept they  aren't that many agreements and contracts they   have con contractual elements it's a more main use  of this concept and commitments can have SCE as a   priority level and finally contractual elements  can break down into sub elements so the legal   construct LC so that something which is conferred  by a way of law or contract such as a right when   we look at the breakdown here so the duty to pay  or fulfill the contractual obligation is a legal   construct and furthermore we have regulations  we have securities restrictions we have claims   all these are based on legal contract and the  legal capacity that breaks down into regulatory   capacity borrowing capacity and signatory capacity  in other words to to be legally capable to sign a   contract legally capable to borrow money legally  capable to regulate someone now the relationships   sinks in rule for example regulatory authority  issue regulations agreements may confer legal   constructs then services and also products have  restrictions that are based on legal constructs   the legal construct may imply mandate or apply to  other Elsie's and finally legal concerns struct   govern documents and they may have effective dates  account a/c and he a thing of the old books where   people used to manually record debits and credits  so it's a container for records associated with   a business arrangement for regular dealings and  services such as personal or professional services   and in particular bank banking so accounts have  as a main subtypes bank accounts and financial   services accounts and examples of financial  services accounts are investment deposit   accounts loan accounts credits and other services  and no it's still pretty small here with certain   subtypes but expect GL accounts in the future and  also the fiber team is working on loans and once   that is in production I will add it 250 m and  then we probably will see a lot more sub types   and unease account so the relationships sinks in  rolls nor mainly financial service providers that   provide accounts to the customers and the account  realizes financial service agreements and in turn   the underlying products and services and finally  the account number that identifies an account M   is a reference time TI these are also treated  to super types time instant and time interval   and they are very closely related so I combined  them under one business concept the time instant   is a temporal entity that is a member of the time  scale it doesn't have any extent or duration the   time interval is a segment of the time X's a  location and time with an extent or a duration   no and here are the two super types and to break  down the time instant is very simple so we have   date we have date and time and we have timestamps  and the time interval breaks down into durations   so they usually have a number that says how how  long they are from sync of a ten-year bond or   they are specified by two dates as a time as  a date period looking at the relationship so   every concept has time instants or hair says  intervals so ZZ person autonomous agent has a   date of birth an agreement as an effective date  documents have issue in states a commitment may   have a settlement date payment dates and so on  legal constructs has various dates arrangements   may have a recurrence interval and now here  the time interval in turn relates to another   time concept for the start date and the end date  occurrence OCC and here just sink of the ping when   you get another email in your inbox um that is an  occurrence and just like we had was time these are   actually two very closely related super types and  I combined them into one business concept so the   occurrence is a happening of an occurrence kind  and instances of occurrence kinds are types of   events each heaven in a description so in other  words the occurrence kind defines occurrences   and here the most important ones are transaction  events and under knees we find trade payments swap   events and accounting transactions then we have a  life cycle event and here an example is the trade   life cycle and when we look at the occurrence and  the instance of an occurrence kind it fall tree   follows the or current current structure now so we  have a payment occurrence and that is an instant   here observes a payment event so looking at the  relationships so commitments and agreements may   specify for certain or current kinds to happen  an agreement can govern the occurrence kind an   arrangement can comprise of occurrence kinds can  sink of a schedule reference would identify the   occurrence for example the transaction or trade  ID and an occurrence exemplify the occurrence   kind so that is the relation that we had between  payment exemplifying a payment event and finally   sinks enroll may facilitate occurrences here  you can think of the think of a a market ven   venue that facilitates trades or a payment systems  that facilitates payments and that's a sink enroll   a to recap the semantic enterprise information  architecture where we had at the apex the fiber   and the derived conceptual 50m model and the  UML model and in in this module we introduced   the fib cm the concept maps and they are most  notably in sync with the fiber in sync with the   conceptual model and they are a simplified option  for business users reference and further reading   so the 50m website is the current canonical  source for all data model resources and for this   education module you find the the scalable SVD  tree diagrams of the complete subtype hierarchies   so download CSV G file and you can print it  out on a plotter even forcing enroll and for   reference and it also has diagrams of the concept  maps that we looked at in this module now the in   addition the LinkedIn page sets your source for  news update and also to read and share comments   and and the simple reason here is unless you you  you are a commercial license see you you don't   want yet another user account in local non 50m no  and so therefore just follow the 50m linkedin page   and you will get it any update in your feed and  similar aims is a YouTube channel and that was   just like for me just like a file server where  I don't have to to worry about paint this and   storage limits but and recently quite a few users  and said that they like to combine 50m videos with   other education data modeling ontology videos  that they have in their playlists so all videos   they're there : sauce is on youtube and if you  subscribe to the channel you you get a note   when when new video comes out and of course  all honors to the enterprise data management   council and here on the web link that is where  you you find everything about the Fievel well   thanks for watching well still you can download  the open source core model on the 50 M website   and please email me if you have any questions  or comment thanks again and have a nice day
