 Traditional networks are expensive to purchase they are complex inflexible and costly to deploy and maintain there are too many touch points Ruckus Campus Fabric gives you a single IP point of management for all switches it easily scales to 1800 ports using any of the ICX 7000 switch families this single logical domain consists of a control bridge and access switches we call port extenders because every port in the fabric becomes a virtual port extending from the control bridge this fabric is self forming at a switch anytime you want switches get software and configuration automatically from the network eliminating manual provisioning steps all switches even entry level switches inherit advanced premium services from the control bridge or cost savings and better service quality simplified management and consistent features across the network lower the time and expense of maintaining and troubleshooting the network eliminating the spanning tree protocol eliminates the waste of active passive redundant paths link aggregation groups form automatically across redundant paths to protect against link failure while at the same time load balancing to optimize performance failover for switches or links as instantaneous and hitless this is a resilient network that is efficient cost-effective and flexible that's the Ruckus Campus Fabric here's where to learn more
