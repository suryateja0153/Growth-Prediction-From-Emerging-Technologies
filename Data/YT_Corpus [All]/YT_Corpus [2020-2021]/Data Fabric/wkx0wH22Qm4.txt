 [Music] welcome to section 2.4 in the CCT data center course in this video we're going to talk about fabric interconnects and fabric extenders topics in this video include what are the basics of what fabric interconnects are then we're gonna look at fabric interconnect specifications and install guides then we're gonna look at fabric extenders fabric extenders specifications and they're installed guys as well alright so what are fabric interconnects first off we usually refer to them as F eyes that's the abbreviation for them so if you hear me say fi or somebody else say fi that's what they're talking about so a fabric interconnects are in a central central part of the UCS infrastructure to have the embedded UCS manager which is what you use to manage the entire UCS fabric they also act as a gateway to the UCS fabric so they connect to the sand they provide a gateway to the land and when they can connect up upstream to a core device for the whole network and basically they provide access for everything to the the UCS infrastructure and then another core concept is that of the unified fabric that came about with Fibre Channel over Ethernet when Fibre Channel over Ethernet came about the fabric interconnects started having unified ports which mean which means that they can function as both Fiber Channel ports or Ethernet ports and this helps consolidate IO you can have the sand and the ethernet portion of the data center on the same infrastructure which means you're going to be less devices and it's going to be a lot simpler to manage so as an example we have the 64-54 the six says that it's a fabric interconnect then that second number the four is going to designate the generation so it's going to be the fourth generation and then the last two digits which are 54 is going to say how many ports are on that particular fabric interconnect so in order to understand fax it's it's good to understand what problem did effects is solve so originally in data centers there was end of rax which is a middle of racks which and all of the UCS hosts and servers would need to connect to a switch so if you had your switches at the end of a row or in the middle of a row it creates a lot of cabling between the racks so in the next evolution they started having top rack switches in order to minimize cabling they were putting a switch at the top of every rack and then in order to make sure that they were redundant they started putting two switches at the top of every rack and the end result of this is that the entire solution became extremely expensive so the faxes were the solution to all of this basically they're a completely unintelligent switching device they have no features in them so they're able to produce them much more cheaply than a full-featured switch which allows them to put one or two top-of-rack patch devices it's basically like a controllable patch panel that's how I look at it now these things cannot perform their own switching like I said they're completely unintelligent they do not have cam tables which means that they require an upstream parent switch that basically does the switching for it this can be either the fabric interconnect or there is a number of different Nexus switches that can do it so there are their switches within the five K Nexus line the 7 K Nexus line and the 9 K Nexus line that can all be parent switches so the fax this job is pretty simple it is to simply directly connect to the UCS servers and again the naming convention here it's the same principles as with the fabric interconnects the to the 2000 series is designated for the faxes so the 2 means that you're dealing with affects the second digit the 3 right there is going to say that it's a third-generation fax and the last two digits 32 means that there's 32 ports on the switch and the fax alright so now we're going to look at documentation for the fabric interconnects and faxes so you can see here we have the 64 hundred series in the 6300 series fabric interconnects the 6400 series is going to be newer and then down here we have these modules so these these faxes that can sit down here we have the modules so these these are the faxes that go directly into the UCS b-series chassis the 50 108 and again those provide the network access for the b-series chassis and when we're comparing the 6400 series to the 6300 series you can see that the 6400 series goes up Stu goes up to a hundred gigabytes while the 6300 series only goes up to 40 gigabits the 6400 series does have unified ports in it there are some models of the 6300 series that also have unified ports and now we're going to move on to the nexus 2k FX's so on that previous page that we were looking at it only had those modules the faxes that were modules that go directly into the 50 108 chassis because we were coming off of the branch for the UCS solution now these these ones that we're looking at here these full-width ones that are meant to be mounted and racks by themselves are actually part of the Nexus line so that's why they weren't on the other page all we're going to do is just come down here and click compare models alright so there is one distinction that I would like to say I know earlier in the video I said that the last two digits represent the number of ports it's actually the number of downs and now if you'll notice these four digits are accompanied by some letters afterwards so there is there's patterns to those as well the first letter is going to be the downstream port type so a t means Ethernet and the second letter is going to be the upstream port and P tends to mean 10 gigabit sfp+ can see T P and so whenever you see e it's whatever you whenever you see e that just typically means enhanced it means that the original version was released and then they released a new and improved version that usually cost the same so whenever you see the e version that's that's usually what you order we're gonna move on to the next gen here so here we have the the third generation and we have some second generation over here as well okay so yeah so this this version that we were looking at here these ones are gonna be gig only I don't even think they're sold anymore just because everything's going to 10 gig now I'm just adding a little bit more to the name a convention here the Q equals Q sfp+ which is 40-gig and the M also tends to mean SFP+ so it can mean the same as P and then the only other thing to note is that the 10g base T so this is going to be these are gonna be a primarily Ethernet based faxes and these ones are going to be sfp+ all right so I have googled cisco ucs IceWEB googled cisco ucs fabric interconnect installation guides the 6400 series came up so I'm on the product overview page and so with these fabric interconnects it's going to be simpler than with the UCS server since you're pretty much only looking at the front and rear panel but it is really important to understand this that unlike like if you're coming from the Ethernet LAN world with switches all the ports pretty much do the same thing except for the uplink ports that's not the case with the fabric interconnects as you can see this group one here represents the unified ports so these are the port's that can be either fibre channel or Ethernet so you've got 54 ports on the entire device and only a couple of or only 16 of those ports can be unified ports and another thing to know is group 3 this group can go down to one gig so all the ports on the entire device only four of them can go down to one gig and that's mostly because one gig isn't that relevant in the data center anymore and then obviously our group floor over here is going to be your uplink ports and then here is a view of the rear panel here's the 100 and the 108 ports fabric interconnect and the rear view on that and just real quickly here I've googled Cisco Nexus 2000 installation guides and it's going to be more of the same here it's going to the front and rear panel information how to read the LED lights and all the stuff like that alright so that concludes this video the topics that we went over were what our fabric interconnects their specifications and install guides and then the same fabric extenders the specs means guys for those two if you found this helpful give a like and subscribe and I'll see you in the next one [Music] [Music]
