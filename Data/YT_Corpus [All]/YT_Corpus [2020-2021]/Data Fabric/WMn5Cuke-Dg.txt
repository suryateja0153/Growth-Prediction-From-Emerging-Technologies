 let's talk about machine learning it can do a lot like detect the different patterns between cars buses even your dinner but when it comes to data science projects including the ones that make machine learning a reality there are a lot of speed bumps along the way why well to put it simply it gets complicated data lives in silos in different formats with different security and privacy requirements plus it's hard to set up new environments for model building and the lack of standardization means data science projects often can't get past the pilot stage all of this really means one thing time that's why more than 80 of data science projects don't succeed and if machine learning is going to advance the way we live and work and transform industries an 8 out of 10 failure rate is pretty scary so how do we fast forward to the future of data science hpe esmeral ml ops just the facts the answer is in removing the speed bumps and streamlining the data science process with hpe esmeral ml ops data science projects get what they've been missing speed the speed to clear up traffic jams with enterprise security to keep critical apps running and the ability to collaborate with shared code project and model databases the result more time to actually build models and unlock insights leading to more productivity and faster deployment and for added flexibility hpe esmeral ml ops is available as a service with a choice of software data scientists can play in any sandbox they like and processes are standardized across the analytics life cycle plus pay as you go means usage is tied to business goals okay so what does all this mean hpe esmeral ml ops accelerates model deployment from years to months it leads to innovations that help us live happier healthier and more productive lives and it's available as a service it's time to unlock the potential of your data and realize the possibilities of machine learning
