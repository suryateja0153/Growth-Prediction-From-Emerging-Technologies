 When the announcement was made that Facebook was going to Los Lunas, jackpot number one! Los Lunas was picked over a lot of other major cities and we're very proud to have Facebook here. It's nice to see the vision become a reality. When you see Facebook making this kind of sustained commitment and investment in New Mexico, New Mexico's on the map. The grand scale of these buildings, it's like nothing Los Lunas has ever seen. My father was a sheepherder on this mesa. I can just imagine; what would he think now if he saw this? Just trying to grasp the scope of it. Facebook has been amazing. We're enjoying the growth. It's promoted a lot of other small businesses to expand to our area. With that brings residential opportunities, and of course jobs. You have a community who hit the jackpot. They landed Facebook. Small town, big possibilities. Think about what happens when you have an anchor company; it's almost like the cool kid table right? Facebook the cool kid that comes sitting at the table with Los Lunas, and then all the other cool kids want to come and join that. That's economic development to me. There's been so much work and so much energy from the town to the internal employees and I can't wait to share that with the whole town and state to say that Facebook is open for business. Thanks to Facebook for taking a chance on New Mexico. We look forward to a great partnership for a long time to come.
