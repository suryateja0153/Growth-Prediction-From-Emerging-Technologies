 from the cube studios in Palo Alto in Boston connecting with thought leaders all around the world this is a cube conversation LeBron welcome to this cube conversation here in the cube Studios in Palo Alto we're here for remote interview we're continuing with the co vid coverage the quarantine crew I'm John for your host of the cube got a great guest crystal beam on the CEO of Talon just joined the cup in the middle of the pandemic crystal thanks for joining us and and nice seeing you it's a pleasure to be here thank you for having me well I think it's a really great conversation to have a couple of threads that are interesting to me one is talents coming we've been covering for a long time obviously their their position in the marketplace we've been following their their trajectory you're new to the company but you join right in the middle of as Co vid was going down and we're still in this mode and it looks like it's going to be for some time I'd love to get your thoughts as as we're in this mode first what attracted you to talent your new and what's it been like there's since you've been there you can't meet people face to face you must be doing a lot of remote interviews then I wrote the conversations well you're right about that I had a very short window that I could get out on the road and I'm so grateful that I did because visiting our offices our customers and our partners is critical to you know really surrounding ourselves with amazing people that we have a talent but you know I'll just go back to why I joined talent and it really goes to the customers our customer stories just captured my my attention right away the way that talent shows up to drive outcomes for customers that are tangible that are quantifiable and that are game-changing was something that interested me and it really is that at the heart of every conversation is data so it was a simple decision for me to say those are the types of things I want to be involved in and so talent was definitely something that became very attractive it's interesting we've watched the progression of the big data market in now ten years in and the explosion of cloud obviously everyone's talking about data as a key ingredient for application development and you're still seeing kind of the challenges of how do you manage the data and then how do you put that into action for insights because now you have these connected experiences and even more highlighted with the kovat and emic you still got to run the business you still need the data the workforce is remote the the future of work workforce workplace workloads and workflows all have data this is a real challenge with now the connected experience being the number one problem and making that good and making that valuable what's your take on that's right I couldn't agree more you know we talk a lot about digital transformation for years quite frankly and I would say you know we've been in a digital transformation evolution and I think what has happened now is COBIT is an accelerant and it's a now it's a digital revolution and at the heart or maybe the cornerstone if you will of but any data digital transformation is data transformation you know you think about digital transformation is about mindset it's about changing the entire way that you operate as a company it's not just about systems and technology that's a really critical part but everything that fuels the ability to get out comes out of a digital transformation is data and so the ability to leverage like you said there's connected data there's more data than we've ever had and that's a massive opportunity but having a lot of data is not always the answer sometimes that becomes a big responsibility with regulations and also something that if not carefully governed not really something you can leverage properly to run your business and so data is at the heart of all the things going on at this moment it's interesting too you know a lot of the main trends outside of kind of inside the industry and discussions around data and the role of data the consumer side of it is seeing it with fake news you're seeing it with the data around kovat anyone can make data tell a story there's always you know causation versus correlation that discussion but we start thinking people being exposed to the data problems there's an opportunity in there and one of the big things is trust what data can I trust what's authentic and then how do I make sure that it's not just supporting a story there's all kinds of was going on around it it makes it seem like a broader challenge trust seems to be at the heart of it what do you trust who's the source it's just all life now is data infiltrated in all of our lives it's certainly now supposed you couldn't be more right on that one and you can see it play out in the media you can see a play out again this this accelerating set of circumstances that are playing out every single day as people are staying so closely you know watchful of data informing decisions that everyone's making around the world in a lot of different ways and you've seen a lot of times where there's a question about the quality of the data the accuracy of the data who's providing the data and you know that's the the environment that talent you know really supports and lives in you know even prior to kovat but it just underscores the importance of not just having a complete set of data and I would say even taking it further than just having what we would traditionally call quality of data and really taking it down to something you used a really important word is trust how can you make sure that the data that you're making decisions on is something you can trust and when it comes to health and well-being that's certainly something that you can't afford not to have and it's a it's an area that is underserved right now that we've spent a lot of time thinking about and and how we're starting to show up to provide those solutions to our customers I want to get into the customer conversation I think there's a lot of use cases I want to unpack with you but I want to first get your vision on how you guys see the future what is the vision of Tallinn how do you see it what's the plan what's the big story there you know there's a couple of things I look at this and say right now in the industry and in our customers which we cover all different segments all different sizes of customers all around the globe they have a variety of use cases if you will a variety of needs everything from the most simple ingestion to some of the more complex transformation and governance projects that that they're running and first and foremost we show up uniquely as a platform a platform that allows people to activate and utilize is different parts of our of our services that we can provide to an entire organization and that's something that is really important to us and we also look at how do we make the process in which they're using talent and the skills that are required you know really push the envelope on making those as simple as possible the ability to get to time to value as quickly as possible is our ultimate goal and then looking you know finally you know the third kind of the third Lane is to make sure that we can provide not just as I said the completeness of data but that it's really data that they can boil down to something that has intrinsic and quantifiable trust because all the time we spend all the money that's spent on collecting the data is really only as good as the you know ability to say I can in fatica lis trust it and I can tell you why and I can show you the footprint of that data and that's something really important right now more than ever I was talking to my my family got four kids and they're all kind of growing up now and you know we're having these conversations on Kove it and and the question of AI comes up all the time an AI is very you know cool for kids but they don't really talk about machine learning so I got to ask you around how you see the machine learning piece come in because data feeds AI I mean you got it's a real no that's how I describe them my kids data is the fuel for AI and you got to feed that in there but it's not that easy what's your reaction to that because I think a lot of cubbies are saying I have to automate things the devops world and agilities come into the mainstream operations of businesses and there's a agility piece there's a value of the day that's being recognized but now I got to put into practice what's the PlayBook what's your reaction to all that yeah I think you're right I mean first of all AI and machine learning have a really important role in the simplification the ability to move its speed and to you know perform functions that quite frankly are going to move us into an entirely new realm of possibility I still will contend whether you're you're speeding that with you know anything that you feed data into with data has to be really good quality data you know AI machine learning is only as good as the information that you're feeding it with and so it is really really critical that we you know we leverage these technologies to their fullest extent but that we make sure that we feed it in the right way so I think it's a really big part of our future I think it's something that's gonna be important but we have to have the certainty that we're using them in a way that's coming to you know a place of the right outcome and that starts with what you feed it to use to go use to improve the processes Christel one of the patterns we're seeing is that decision makers and CXOs are looking at the Cova pandemic and saying okay i did my thing with triage now I got a reset and get the foundation set again and look at the projects that are gonna be important and I got to figure out the holistic architecture cuz I need a growth strategy and I got a reset maybe some of the team members projects and whatnot what's your view on this because now new decisions have to be made roles or might change as well so this is gonna change how come is going to make decisions what's your reaction to that with the customers they're trying to figure this out what's your advice yeah that's absolutely right and this is about reinstating a business reinventing it in many cases a great example is Domino's who is maybe surprising lane for for some a pioneer in you know digital transformation that's been a number of years in the making that really has shown that with being in a state of being able to adapt quickly to circumstances and to be forward-looking how critical it is and so I think this has been a wake-up call for organizations across the globe to say we have have to be on the ready we have to be able to be instrumented in a way that we can make quick decisions in Domino's case if it became you know originally the ability to you know they were the first pizza delivery to try out drones for pizzas delivery and you know to have gaming devices where you can order pizza because that's where the customers read and you know when hope it hit contact lists became a criteria and so you can really see how they are able to separate themselves you see people being leaders that have been further along in transformation so I think what this stunt has done is as exposed some vulnerabilities quite frankly and this is a wake-up call for companies around the globe that can no longer afford to be in a state where they can't pivot quickly and looking backwards is no longer the thing that informs people in a state of something like Kovac because there really aren't examples are patterns to look at so reinstating the business is really critical data has to be transformed to perform better for companies it's interesting you bring that the point about the pivot and the kind of people's resetting and reinventing for that growth strategy is that you're seeing brand impacts and also financial results are directly related to its if you're not ready this has a could have a real detrimental impact on the brand value and ultimately financial results and this is kind of forcing people to say it's not just an IT problem it's a business model change and data is shown now to be the key ingredient because that's where the agility is gonna come from that's where the value is there and this has all been talked about within the industry before but now it's kind of gone mainstream this is now the new reality that my brand opportunity and the financial results of my company are at stake can you comment on your thinking around that because this is a top line a high order bit if you will conversation among the top boardrooms yeah it is and I agree with you you know many of these conversations have been going on for a while now right and I think this just exposes the criticality of what happens when you're not in a state of being able to really reinvent yourself or like I said we instrument and if you're already in that state how much better off you are brands are taking a hit in terms of their ability to show up and it goes beyond just their ability to perform you know as a business but to really show up differently for their customers support people in a different way and really make sure that they can respond also from a social perspective you know how are they going to help and contribute to what the world is facing and so you know it really is asking companies to really fire on all cylinders quite frankly I want to get your thoughts on two two thought tracks and then they're kind of connected so bear with me one is we've heard a lot from the marketplace that with the pandemic the reality of the IT teams that collect the data and the business team to have to make the decisions are changing honestly with the with the work at home and all the different dynamics around the app every architecting and then you have the competitive advantage now which people are pointing to a speed and scale so you've got you know internal kind of organizations that are managing wrangling data ingesting data the business teams were the customers and that's kind of it was the slow rolling way it was before now you got that changing and now you got pressure to be faster and more scalable so scales of competitive advantage speeds the competitive advantage these are court and kind of flywheel elements of the new models that people are being successful with what is your reaction to that I couldn't agree more it is a competitive weapon quite frankly it is an operational accelerant and it is an innovation catalyst and you know time is no-one you know one's friend quite frankly you know it's one of those odd things right now where for all of us that are working from home and time has this odd sense of reality to it but it's you know really quite frankly you cannot act fast enough but what's interesting about enabling companies to to act fast that has to come down to the ability for them to be able to you know spend the time in the right places so for example when I think about the number one thing that we can do is it takes a lot for organizations sometimes to put the information in the hands of the right people at the right time so that the you know the time that's being spent by an overall company not just an individual within a company but the entire company you have to be able to decrease that so that the time that they're spending is actually on helping drive outcomes and so some of this and you you just struck the chord on in everything I think about is how quickly we can get the right data in the hands of the right people because you know in AstraZeneca case for example the difference of being able to do that they're their highest cost in their businesses clinical trials being able to get information you can use and reduce a month of you know how fast they can bring those clinical trials to bear is saving them hundreds of millions of dollars but you know that right now AstraZeneca is an important player in helping us solve for this so you think about how important it is to get information to the right people and and time is a critical essence right now yeah it's interesting y'all's meant is that business model of eating but also you got a lot of that's an opportunity for many but there's also a lot of I won't say heavy lifting but maybe a drag since I might call it compliance you know gdpr or what not balancing that kind of I won't say Dre I mean I think it's a drag personally but I think we haven't have those things in place you want to maintain the compliance rigidity that's out there but also have room to innovate that balance is very difficult and it's really mostly highlighted in the data business because that's where the action is around data privacy and those compliance things but if they got an innovation formula there that you're talking about and you got compliance if you get one wrong and right you got a balance it what's your take on that because that's a huge challenge it's one of those things that's kind of not talked about much but it's pretty much there you're right and it is it is a complete balance but you can't have one without the other in highly regulated industries especially with things like Astra Zeneca but really if you think about any company the the ironic thing right now is that when you're looking at even a single report but certainly across an entire company or a line of business right now you can see that there's quality measures and governance that you know we put into play but the ability to actually quantifiably say on a single piece of data that you can track you know where that data's been who's touched it how complete is it and really kind of put a measurable trust score against it there's work to be done there but you know with gdpr with HIPAA and interestingly enough you know we're looking to you know kind of challenge some of the norms with obut that says we now want to collect data that is it formerly considered privacy you know and maybe something that would be regulated and now we want to share it for the greater good of you know making sure that we can on track and trace where people are at that maybe are infected and so forth and so you're starting to see this this interesting conversion of challenging the fact that we've got at least be able to support people in their governance of data but take that a step further really awesome final question you had Talent Connect which is your big kind of confab what best practices are emerging out of Tallinn these days for customers if you had to kind of highlight the top use cases or best practices that customers and your potential customers could leverage right now with data what are you guys putting out there what are the key best practices because everyone has a new reality that's know as we talk deeply about it but what's the best practices what do you guys offering well I think you know one of the things that I alluded to before is really making sure that we show up as a strategic business partner and this is really important to us you know they all miss these things that we've been talking about they are their heavy lifting for organizations to really look at how they bring the digital revolution to the forefront there's a lot to consider and so our part in that is to say we believe that when you power your business on Talent and you're able to solve for a number of different problems across a platform but that's really important that we show up in the way that we can meet our customers where they're at so that's one making it simple you know really pushing the boundaries on the level of expertise the specialization the time to value of making sure that they can leverage again spending their time on the things that are important which are making sure that they're spending it in in quality data and data they trust and then really making sure that that final lane is covered up saying you know we want to make sure that data is accessible when you need it and where you need it you know things like IOT and edge devices this proliferation of data is just becoming immense and so taking the data getting it to people but in a way that they can have confidence it's the same thing you just said before you know there's a lot to consider and there's in a way a burden of people not knowing maybe all the data they have and how it's being used we feel responsibility to make sure that we're part of helping that become easy and identifiable and really taking it to the next step beyond quality so it's really across all of it just simply putting people in a position to be able to make good decisions and not have to do so much of the heavy lifting and making sure that they know for a fact that it's something that they've made a good decision around because of the data has been trusted and they can have the confidence in that awesome we think data is embedded advantage of something more important ever and as the days go on so great gradients like crystal thank you for that insight before we end take a minute to put the plug in for Talan what are you up to you guys hiring you're looking for folks what's the business plan why you guys winning what's the hot products take a minute to give up a quick update on Talent sure you know we're in a great situation where you know this is a point in time a talent where you know with the great trajectory in front of us we see speed and scale of our organization that has an opportunity in front of it to really help solve problems for every part of the market you know whether it's the you know smaller businesses who are certainly in at a point where they're you know having a big impact to the largest organizations and we feel that there's a set of solutions that we can really work to drive as a partner to each of those customers to solve for the problems that put them in a position to really be able to reinstall it and to reinvent their business and when we partner like we have with the companies that I mentioned dominoes and AstraZeneca and many others you know it comes back to why join talent we have the ability to change the outcome of really separating organizations from the pack and data is the competitive advantage it is the thing that will put people on a different trajectory and I'm excited about what we bring to the table and I'm really excited about what's to come and how we'll continue to push the envelope for how we help our customers that's awesome congratulations congratu started a new role of talyn's the CEO crystal be my video talent data is at the heart of the value proposition we've been saying that for ten years now more than ever it's exposed that the value is there speed and scales the new table stakes for competitiveness and business models for the applications again Gregg cube cash has great insight crystal thank you for joining me today I'm John Fourier host of the cube it's been a cubed conversation thanks for watching [Music]
