 hey guys welcome to Intellipaat so in today's video we are going to talk about one of the most essential components of blockchain technology that is hyper ledger we are going to discuss what it is and why is it and we will discuss each and every aspect in detail but before we do that do subscribe to Intellipaat's YouTube channel so that you never miss out on our upcoming videos now let me walk you through the agenda for today's video first of all we will see what is hyper ledger and its goals followed by how does it work after that we will learn about hyper ledger fabric and then finally we look into some benefits of using hyper ledger fabric also guys, if you are looking for end-to-end certification training course on blockchain technology then do check out Intellipaat's blockchain training certification course the link is given in the description box below so now without any further delays let's get started so what is hyper ledger but before understanding what is hyper ledger let us understand what it is not exactly so it is not any kind of company or a crypto currency neither a blockchain rather it works like a hub for open industrial blockchain development now let's see what exactly it is so hyper ledger is an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross industry blockchain technologies exactly so it's a global collaboration hosted by the Linux Foundation so this include industries like finance IOT supply chain manufacturing and technology so the main goal of hyper ledger is first one to create Enterprise creat open source distributed ledger free works and code bases to support business transactions and then to provide neutral open and committed driven infrastructure supported by technical and business governance it also helps in building technical communities to develop blockchain and shared ledger vocs and then it would educate the public about the market opportunity for blockchain technology and also it would promote our community of communities taking a toolkit approach with many platforms and frameworks now let's see what all free mod it has got for you so it offers frameworks like hyper ledger BURROW fabric Indy Iroha and finally sawtooth so in this video we are mainly going to be focusing on hyperledger fabric so what is it let me tell you guys that hyper edge of fabric is a blockchain framework implementation so it is intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture and also it leverages container technology to host smart contracts which are called chain code and this actually comprised the application logic of the system now hyper edge of fabric is the modular scalable and secure foundation for industrial brockchaim solutions now the most notable change in here is that that peers are decoupled into two separate runtimes with three roles and these are endorser committer and concentr now let's see how actually it works so to make you guys understand it better let me take two characters so now meet mr. Rick at your left hand side who runs an organic market in the US and then we have got mr. Bob at your right hand side who grows vegetables in India now Rick uses blockchain technology to kind of run his transactions from various let's say Crewe's marketers shippers banks and others now consider that Bob has agreed to sell his vegetable to Rick at a discounted low price however Rick needs other markets to buy the vegetables at the same standard price so other than that to get the product from India to the US a lot of third parties are required to complete these transactions right then these third parties may have to verify other aspects of the project just like Quality Assurance logisitics verification payment verification and much more but then they do not really need to know about this special deal or the contract between Rick and Bob so they actually should not be able to access Rick's confidential information and the details of Fricks and Bob steals in fact Rick does not want this transaction even to appear on the Ledger itself so how will this be handled well so hyper edge of fabric handles all this exactly so - fabric looks up for membership services and then shares the transactions only to the peers no any third parties involved now in this two-party agreement the transaction requires both the parties to render the same result and then third parties who carry out the transaction only get to know the exact amount of information they actually need to know with the help of of course permission and regulations live either on the network now if Bob wants to check anything with respect to the agreement and deals it just has to look up through an app and after the membership has been validated the two peers are connected and the results are generated and then these results or the generated transactions are now sent to a consensus cloud for ordering so just to sum up in short let me tell you guys in this way so here we have got Bob who wants to sell his products and that is why he looks into the app for Rick's address on the network okay now the app looks for the membership service relatives Bob membership and once the membership is validated Hyperledger fabric connects both parties with the reads or deals now both Rick and bob generate the result which is the consensus cloud to be ordered and verified and now once it is verified Rick will receive his products and the same will be generated in the ledger Quicken for guys if you are looking for an end-to-end certification training course on blocks and technology then do check out Intellipaat's blockchain certification training course the link is given in the description box below now let's continue with the session and now let me tell you guys what were the benefits of using this hyper ledger fabric into the transaction so first of all it establishes a decentralized trust in the network and then exposes only the data that you want to share now tailors the blockchain according to industry need with a pluggable architecture and also easily programmable with all the languages now some of the tools that are used in hyperledger fabric are hyper ledger Cello Explorer and composer now Cello aims to bring the on demand as his deployment model to the blockchain ecosystem which would reduce the effort required for creating managing and terminating block chains now then we have got Explorer so - each Explorer can view invoke deploy and query blocks or any other relevant information stored in the ledger and then the hyperledger composer so it is a collaboration tool for building block chain business networks accelerating the development of smart contracts and their deployment across a distributed ledger now let's take a case study and understand how actually hyper ledger is used in real time industries so here we are going to take a case study of MonetaGo so monitor go is a software development company based in New York that works with financial institutions and central bank's across the world now MonetaGo wanted to lower the risk for financials on the network so their main goal was to help this small and medium enterprises to gain better access to financing through the real-time exchange for a secure and fraud proof invoices now many small business owners would like to sell the invoices at a discounted rate and then the third party would worry about connecting them but then many firms were too small for any bank to work with so they won't put a lot of time into factoring small invoices when they could easily earn more processing invoices from a larger enterprise for example factoring in India delivers are reported two hundred and nineteen billion dollars to the country's micro small and medium enterprises but then this leaves another 188 billion dollars on the table as unmet demand so monitor who actually evaluated and selected the best blockchain platform to use and that is the hyper ledger fabric so the business logic and hashing were developed to prevent fraud and then go live with the production system and monitor its performance so in just three months after going live the network already serves a significant percentage of the factoring market in industry processing thousands of invoices dealing with no duplicate financing so this volume is going quickly with companies representing the vast majority of the market lined up to join so today hyper ledger has an impressive list of more than hundred members you can simply see in the image that how big industry leaders are working with hyper ledger so considering the trends and advancement in the technology the high volatile platform looks pretty bright and this is the right time for you to start your career in this field if you are interested in blockchain technologies and then there are various opportunities awaiting you so you can simply become a fabric developer a hyper ledger developer a fabric architect hyper energy architect or a hyper ledger engineer so many options to choose from and you can also see the average salary of blockchain or blockchain hyperledger developers which is so great so after watching this video if you wish to learn more on hyper ledger and build your career in Block chain technologies you can simply visit our website and you can simply choose blockchain certification training course so you can grab an opportunity to launch your career up high Intellipaat offers the industry designed blockchain training that is directly in line with clearing the blockchain certification so you'll get hands-on experience by working on real-world projects and upon completion of the training you can apply for the latest or best jobs in the industry and now with this let me summarize what we have discussed in today's session so first of all we started with the definition of hyper ledger and then its goals we also focus on high pillage of fabric and its working mechanism with an example then we moved on to its benefits of using hyperledger fabric we also saw a case study and finally colored opportunities into this domain quick info guys if you are looking for an end-to-end certification training course on blocks and technology then do check out Intellipaat's blockchain certification training course the link is given in the description box below so this brings us to the end of this video if you have any queries then do leave a comment in the comment section below and we will get back to you at the earliest thank you for watching
