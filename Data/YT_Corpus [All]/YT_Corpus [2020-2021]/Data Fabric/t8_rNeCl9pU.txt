 [Music] welcome to the vine resources podcast show with your host David Lawrence welcome to another edition of the vine resources podcast show I'm absolutely delighted to have with us today Adam Ola Becker Adam is the co-founder and CEO at fabric in New York Adam thanks for joining me it's great to be here thank for having me on Adam you've got a great story you got a great business there why don't you share with our listeners a little bit about your company please sure so fabric is where parents come to start their families financial life and we think about that in a really holistic way you become a parent really everything changes and you need to think about things you've really never had to consider before like getting life insurance setting up a will organizing your family's finances and coordinating with your partner and so we make that really easy in a way we make all that hard stuff very easy you've obviously in your sort of single life thought of you know checking accounts credit cards and all of and all of those things but you've never really had to think about what it means to really take care of a family over the long term and we want to help you out with that fantastic and and how does that how does your tech technology solution for example enable that and help you and help you help your customers sure so it's really a one-stop shop for family financial well-being you can download the app in the App Store or you can use our website and the really easiest way to get started is to set up a will so it takes about five minutes you can do it on your phone we will run you through a series of questions once you're done we'll send you a PDF you can print that out sign it today you still need to get everything wet signed in the United States like for it to be legally binding and then when you're ready you can also set up a list of you or financial accounts and share those accounts with your spouse or partner that's what we call it both feature just so everyone knows where everything is all in one place and then we've also developed a life insurance product that allows you to go straight in most cases without a health exam we do it fully digitally and really have brought a lot of modern thinking and technology to that process whereas before the traditional process took you know eight to ten weeks multiple meetings with an insurance agent in order to get coverage so we've really rethought that process from start to finish Adam what's the what's the reason that most people perhaps in the u.s. don't generally have a will in place I think most submit is just about apathy there are three and five US adults who have kids and they do not have a will and really the most important thing about having a will is just ensure that you have stated who the guardian of your children are if you don't do that a court can appoint a guardian for your kids and I don't think anyone wants to leave that important decision to a court so it's beyond just deciding who receives assets and what not really the most critical thing is to name guardians for your kids I think that's a great point and I know me and my wife went on a long-haul flight not too long ago and that's one of the reasons we needed to update that as well so especially when you're on the same on the same plane together what what about and just finally what about updating it so it's always a challenge where people's life circumstances change constantly of course and they might need to update that is that something that can be done quite easily on the fly yeah yeah so our will feature is free for anyone to set up a well it's always free for you to go back and change it and it's just as easy as going in updating a few fields and getting that done brilliant Adam look we're gonna jump in and talk more about the business and the questions but thanks for explaining that I know obviously your team's your team's based out out of New York I think you were around 30 35 to 40 people is that right yeah we're about 30 people right now fantastic that's fantastic okay so tell me a little bit like this you've obviously been through a pretty amazing journey starting the business but what does a typical day in the business look like for you as their as the leader you know there there really isn't a typical day what I what I like to try to do is structure my days so that you know you have blocks of time where you can do you know good uninterrupted heads-down work so I'll set aside some time in the morning to first review email I just called sort of quickly skim through and make sure that there's nothing that that requires immediate attention you know other than that I'll I'll then schedule a block of calls and then a block of meetings and I'll also set aside time for Priority One projects about you know three hours a day where I can do like sustained thinking and heads down work you know I can't sort of do that every single day so I'll do that you know about three days a week and block off a morning or an afternoon to do that just making sure that you have that uninterrupted time which I think is really critical to getting you know good work done who perhaps has had an impact on you in in your in your role and perhaps how have they helped you on your journey at the company within the business so far yeah you know my my my first job out of school was a was in investment banking and I think that was there was there was a really great sort of you know I thought of it almost as like graduate school after after undergrad learned a lot about finance learned about you know really would have meant to work super hard and got exposure to working with a lot of great clients but you know what I would say is that you know my my first job at a start-up was at a company called colloquies and that company was an early AI company we built bots for customer service and my boss there was a guy named is a guy named Steve Kline and he really helped shape you know the way that I work and and think particularly in in this in a start-up environment Steve is an incredibly smart sharp witted guy and I think the the most important sort of characteristic that he imparted was just the sort of bias towards action and making decisions there are a lot of really really smart people who work in startups and in business but I think it unless you can think quickly and make decisions you're you're really at a huge disadvantage and so it's much better to actually take a decision then to put it off until the next day and and Steven Steve really taught me how to how to do that fantastic what are you what are you doing from the the top within your company to really keep your team engaged yeah I mean we you know everything here really starts from the mission and you know we believe that every family deserves a secure financial future and and all the work that we do is in service of that you know the the culture and the people who are able to attract really help bring that bring that to life and you know we're not we're not the kind of organization that invests heavily and things like you know we're not we know how to have a lot of fun but we're not you know sort of like the ping-pong table culture we're really about making sure that people are aligned towards our mission that you know we we are valuing the the work that we are doing and providing in the products that we deliver to our customers and you know we want to make sure that the work that the team is doing is fairly compensated and that were you know we're working towards the same goals together as part of that we've we've rolled out okay ours we've been doing that for a good while now okay ours are objectives and key results I think it's something that Google is known for but you know it's something that that really helps us with our quarterly planning and making sure that it the the objectives that we're all running against are clear and that we're able to measure our progress against those goals with the key results on a quarterly basis what's the biggest challenge that you see business leaders facing right now you know it's I think it's always about talent and making sure that you are attracting the right people and ensuring that you're able to retain those people and and so much of that is about you know the mission of the company and the culture that you're able to create it's something that we've given a lot of attention to you at our company and you know it's not something that you can sort of backburner ever and certainly culture something you need to set early on and and make sure that that you are staying consistent and living up to the ideals that you've set yeah understood what some was the best piece of business advice you've ever received gosh you know I think a lot of it is about being able to make decisions quickly you just you just need to be adaptable you know if you're if you're smart great but if you're not able to take those decisions and move quickly then then then then I think you're at a huge disadvantage but I would say really like the the most underrated power is the ability to think for yourself you know so so many so many of us can get kind of caught up in the the stream of information and news that's coming at us from all sides but the ability to sort of quiet that noise and think for yourself and make decisions is very much underrated hmm well what's the what's the best way that you kind of help your your team your your your team around you look after the well-being and and improve that is there anything that you do particularly well you know we've we've set up our work week so that on Wednesdays if you want to work from home or if you want to work you know remotely you can okay and so flex Wednesday's is it's it's actually been it's been great for everyone and you know whether or not you're a parent and you want to spend a little bit of extra time the mornings or get home a little bit earlier I mean that's it's really been powerful for us and it just allows you to take out that commute and spend time heads down thinking and working in a way that I think gets you out of your your day to day and it's also been super helpful to us as we've had to deal with the the corona virus outbreak you know given that we already got this muscle of being able to work remotely in an effective way so that's been pretty powerful we also get together as a as a team for nights in we all eat lunch together on Fridays you know for us it's really about just having the team get together the the team works super well together and and it's a very tight-knit group and so any opportunity that we have where we can get together and have some fun is something that we take advantage of what what's your what's your go-to tool for for youth for internal comms you know we we're big on slack you know we'll use slack for both text and video you know for other means we Google meet and and that's that's probably our preferred mechanism for for video conferencing and you know it's it's I think none of these tools are perfect as it was who's tried them as found but you know we you know while we always prefer to be in person these tools are powerful enough where I think you know versus maybe 5 10 years ago you know we're we're in a much better place when we need to get work done an effective way in a remote environment is there is there a perhaps a story that you could share from your your childhood that's really influenced your work I think in later life you know I would say just sort of generally I was you know privileged to have parents and be in a community where there were high expectations for for what you you'd go out and do you know I think too too often and of the the grown-ups in people's lives they don't have those kinds of high expectations and are enable in it for one reason or another to provide the kind of support and positive kind of enforcement that a lot of young people need and so you know I I would say that it's more than any one particular thing it's really just about the the support and love that that I feel like I've gotten from you know my parents my family my friends and and it just makes everything so much easier when you have that kind of team behind you you know no one's success is is individually derived you know we're all part of the team and it's so critical to to have people around you could believe in you and who can support you absolutely what if you had your time again and you're a young man anyways it is so it's not that long ago but if you were giving one what one piece of advice to your 20 year old self Adam what what would you say looking back now yeah you know I would just say do hard things you know really challenge yourself and and do that inside and outside the classroom looks like if you're interested in technology well you know go learn learn to code learn to use sequel you know learn to sort of fish for your for yourself you know if you're if you're really scared about speaking in public go and join and if you're in school join a Toastmasters club you know seek out positions of leadership where you can where you can speak and and and kind of you know challenge yourself to get over those fears you know I do believe that I don't know if this was the Lord of the Rings or similar that you know the strongest deal is forged in the hottest fires and if you go out there and challenge yourself then you know I think you're you're setting yourself up for for what's gonna be you know a lot of ups and downs in life and and and it'll help you be more durable through that through that journey I meant to ask you at the start as well because you talked earlier on about you know having a very clear mission where did where did the idea spring from that that that launched the company what was it that drove that to be to continue to start the business so my co-founder Steven Sarnia and I we met when we were building simple which is a digital Bank and Steven ran the data engineering team I was the the chief operating officer and we were both at the same stage in our lives where you know were starting families and when we went to go and buy life insurance we were just shocked at how arcane that process was that you know you can buy pretty much everything just online these days but if you want to go and get life insurance it's a completely different process you know in person a lot of papers involved yeah working with a broker and agent who is really a sales person who's trying to sell you you know whatever they think is best that may net them the the biggest Commission and so you know we thought like Tony Robbins would be happy with that yeah well you know we're doing our best it really just provide that that transparent easy buying experience yeah because it really is a fundamentally important product for new parents who are just getting started in their careers may not have the assets that their family will need for the long term in case you your family were to lose your your income yeah absolutely Adam it's been great asking you
