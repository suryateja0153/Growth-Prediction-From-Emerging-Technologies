 Thanks I will presently probe an imagined levitated optimize fabric structure using a lager affiliate research it's a project I work on with a share motto III subrahmanyam and ego martini our goal was to offer a method for creating levitated a structured bigger than four millimeter and non spherical shape in midair or approach relies on acoustically transparent piece of fabric and bit that act as Alou levitated ankles this project rely on our policies that a given number of anchors can hold a specific piece of fabric and at the same time we are able to create animation by moving the bit for instance with one bit can levitate a bigger fabric we can manipulate its location with two bit we control the orientation of the fabric and finally with three or more bits allow us to manipulate the fabric with up to six degrees of freedom before describing the detail of Libby props I will show previous approaches for limited a bit previously researchers have been using multiple levitated bit to represent after objects represent data in abstract way for example where a flattened char is a modular display that limited multiple bits for composing dynamic chart another example is chollet which use levity particle to form a grip of beat that act as a screen and also can flip the bit with electrical film however as this project rely on a standing wave bits can only the best can only be move up and down and they are made of individual points and in general the separation is four millimeter this mean that it cannot produce a continuous display but recently song researcher has investigated how we can manipulate and control multiple bits in 3d however as a display is still does not come support continuous content other researcher has investigated how to limit a larger particle or more complete geometry which can be seen as a continuous content but they do not support free 3d manipulation but creating Larry Probst is not as simple as a sticking bit to the piece of piece of fabric particularly the stiffness which measured this summation of forces that the anchor can sustain depend a lot on where we place these anchors the definition of the stiff-necked can be taken from cold-cocked potential for more detail about the stiffener multiple and levitation algorithm confined in there in the paper but the key idea is to have a method to quantify the quality of the traps this lead to the approach that forms the main contribution in our paper as we realize that the position have fed the overall stiffness we first run a study to see how much a stiff neck chain how the manipulation that is moving or rotating the the probe affect the stiffness now we knew that the relevant of the bit position and the manipulation that did affect the stiffness as a I will show later sun rotation do not affect the overall stiffness of the reverb but some other do based on that we produced an algorithm that given a initial position and intended animation of the of the bits we provide an optimum location the one that maximizes the stiffness and we then provide open source tools to support the creation of liberal their design and their physical fabrication and finally we explore proof of counter applications and demonstrate the capability of limit probes so first we evaluated how the position of the bit affect the over stiffness given the two most established multiple levitate in a levitation algorithm eternity by propagation and knife but propagation in the first plot we have two bits we separate them horizontally and show the resulting a stiffness we do the same for vertical separation and the same process has been done with with other 3d geometries with three four and eight bits increasing their their size the remarkable aspect is that by only changing size a little stiffness can change by the huge amount for example this peak and Valley is only two millimeters apart so if we place the bit properly we can get five five times the amount of a stiffness and the decision of where to place the anchors in the fabric became a key factor for successful Levy probes this indicate that our very location of the bit or just a few millimeter contents for a battle-ax be probe into an optimum level this is a key aspect of our approach as is indicated that given an initial initial geometry design for liberal it should be possible to design and to refine their position improving trapping stiffness even with the minimum anchor this premiere from the initial design another question is even if we optimize the bit location will it affect the structure when we rotate or move the little probe well we select the optimum geometry identified from the previous study the pics and we apply some transformation as moving in the x-axis or rotating around the x and y axis as the geometry are translated across the the levitate or the trapping quality follow a predictable pattern be maximal the central area of the levitator Allen early decreasing on the structural move toward edge of the levitate oh we cannot serve as well that relative stiffness between geometry are generally retained there is no line crossing so this allows us to not consider the FL translation of the Tropic the traffic quality or level props given that a lip levitator is symmetric around the vertical axis rotation along the y axis showed neglect over a set as well on another hand the rotation around the x-axis can show very significant change in stiffness for example in order that in horizontal structures the small one software a large variation on the stiffness depending on the angle so the important idea here is they're fed out rotation various depend of the axis of rotation of the levitate prop so how can we build a levee broke how come we calculate the optimum location well the software of the leper is based on the creation of several the levitation primitive we call it and for example this butterfly has the its main body the base primitive but then their wings can rotate a flap independently so the wings are made of several primitives combined into a single interactive prop there the whole butterfly we defined the primitive as a set of one or more bits that move together and can be animated independently so each primitive in illiberal contain a coordinate system the position of the bit and the rotation range allow it for the for the primitive this first primitive that user will create a is colored based primitive and if the designer wants to create another primitive we call left wing primitive or if primitive based on the initial primitive here describe the position of the bits and the matter which describe the pivoting except for rotation or the the rotation of the primitive in the example the blue primitive will rotate from minus 10 to 10 degrees and has only one bit and in the second leaf primitive is independent to the previous both primitive and it will rotate it from minus 5 to 5 degrees the primitive in a literal are structure in a hierarchical way doesn't mean that the transformation to the best primitive will affect all the other points in the labor prop but transformation on the lift primitive has as the blue one will not fret the point in the other primitive okay if you understand that so how can you design elaborate probe and how is the algorithms going to look for the best position based on the user input so we provide the software that the we provide so with the user have to import the shape of the label probe then design the number of the bit primitive and the pbot for rotation each color represent the group of primitive that that belong and the line are the people word the points aren't going to rotate the red area are the space where the algorithm is going to search the best position based on the stiffness all this feature can be modified by the user but the optimal position of the B actually is calculated by the simulating Anila algorithm comparing the stiffness in the tendon position and translation and important here is that the software calculated the best location of the beat depending on the area's the bit will place it and the intended rotation but also the tool output a file with the shape the circle of the the best position of the bit and the people line later our the user only needs to send this file to the Catherine he will create a delivery problem this is basically their what I said is an example in the with the software so he said that the initial shape decide the number of the location of the anchor the Peapod the the perimeter of the people and other people and the primitive and it calculated the the best location and this is this video only show how to actually build it it is really straightforward you only need to place the fabric between two papers and the laser cutter will cut the shape the people line and the circle the best position and simply the spread is that for as well just when we need to glued the bit to the circle the market position that the last cutter cutter so once we know how to optimize this position for maximum for maximum stiffness we tested the maximum size of labor probes can we could create so we use a drop in death with several size and for different structures in this value we can offset that with one bit we we were able to levitate a piece of fabric up to nine centimeter side also when we increase the number of bit is decreased the side of the fabric that we can limited but Akutan limitation has many application domain that include mixing liquid fiscalization education and so on as levy produce a specific material for building the physical represented representation of this place or even our complex shapes is offer a lot of flexibility for designing the shape depending on the target application here I will show a couple of example that we can create the first star rocket that we can rotate in the 90 degree and move it up we as a storytelling the second is that tangible a notification that the user can place with the barehand and also they can create shape inside the fabric the third one is my favorite is the pong game I call it I call it research as well and you have to live it probe and they are interacting with the with the bit the this one is the limited midair display that it can rotate 360 degrees and we can project it on top of that and the long one is really beautiful it's a butterfly that you can move around it and at the same time is flapping well our exploration has demonstrated the feasibility of using liberal to create a structure that can be manipulated in midair as well as interactive interactive possibilities however liberal are not free of limitation we can only limited a small number of labor groups at the same time for example the pong game only is able to levitate to the algorithmic does not consider the distribution of the fabric along the geometry and even the fabrication process is simple but requires some practice a small error when you place in the the bit can result in a final judge geometrical confidential that differ to the lift run or the tools output and users should be about directly stretching the fabric as this change the relative location of the debate as well so if you pull in the edge of the square Libby brought will the ferment into a rectangle and the fabric would retain such a shape to sum up we studied at wrapping a stiffener asserted on the multiple track depending on the geometric arrangement and some algorithm used for calculating that trap and we also perform a formative study to investigate the largest piece of fabric can be levitated depending on the number of bits and geometry also we create a software that enables designer to build limited a structured and optimize the initial position of the bit according to the design input and I needed to use method for cutting the shape of the fabric with the last cutting and gluing the bit of the market position and the last one is a mainly many proof-of-concept application that showed different characteristic of libros such a different fabric size number of beat displays and animation so thank you again so much and I will and I will answer any question questions no questions after that awesome talk so I have a hard question you get stuck with my hard question that applies to a lot of the projects is given that augmented reality headsets are becoming more and more practical why do this physically this is so much harder to do so why do it and another is yes I understand that the bitter realities you can have many things but you have to put the stuff and so here it just plays that and you're moving and if you want to explain something someone you can create a totally prop and they can interact each other another thing is I come back to the game but the people love that kind of game like a retro game and I saw people that crazy tell me how can how they can buy that they like yeah yeah sure so I don't know it's dependent for me and it's another way and this is only for this fabric but you can export it in another way if we can manage to create another fabric so I don't know that's something that you can operate in impunity right now so the texture you can appeal and the tangible interaction for example you can place or that you can feel it that texture you cannot do it in my opinion any other questions yes this is leaning from Carnegie Mellon I have an easy question oh thanks for the great talk and the demo sweating stiffness you know even mechanically I understand stiffness as the resistance to a body towards a deformation right Travis even seems important for your research I just wonder if you could clarify a little bit and whether that term is related specifically to the fabric it's about the truck so the imagine that the fabric is doesn't have to be here is some transparent so what you need is so what you need is a strong forces that trapped the the beat and with that is the stiffness that tells you what is the quality of that truck I don't know if I answered that it's a invented term by you guys or it's like a classic term from us it's like a laplacian of the girl cough so is it's like a spring so with that you can defer what if they actually forces what you are making in all the direction of the of the beach thank you okay let's thank the speaker [Applause]
