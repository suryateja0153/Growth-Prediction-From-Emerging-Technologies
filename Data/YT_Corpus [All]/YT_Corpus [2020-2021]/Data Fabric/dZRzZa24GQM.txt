 live from Boston Massachusetts it's the cube covering AWS reinforced 2019 brought to you by Amazon Web Services and its ecosystem partners okay welcome back everyone cubes live coverage of AWS Amazon webster's reinforced their inaugural conference around security here in Boston messages I'm John for a day Volante day we've been talking about blockchain has been part of security but no mention of it here Amazon announced a blockchain intention but it was more of a service model less of a pure play infrastructure or kind of a new game changes so we thought we would get our friends to come on the Kuban tell tell us about it Val birch Avicii CEO and Founder a pencil day that cube alumni formerly of NetApp among other great companies and IDI view founder and CEO of strong salt welcome to the queue tell us why are we tell them a blockchain at a security conference on cloud computing where all these resources different paradigm is decentralized what's your take [Music] in fact and reinvents about six months ago and he jazz he mentioned that they finally understood AWS the enterprise software opportunity and it was the integrity value - the complexity and even announced a specific product pre-announced database should be available maybe by [Music] the cryptographic verifiability of transactions - the complexity of smart we are the ledger first are you party with Amazon we are hosted on Amazon that's always the first way to start and here's our house too versions right one for distributed they abuse cases right like [Music] well the Amazon wants to be that hard in topic like you said complexity but the reality is they're there their world is targeting a new generation it starts 14 with this show it is the new generation of developers the new generation of David they were so about this on our intro and I'm hardcore on this because it's just so obvious I just can't get them behind myself if people don't see this out quicker the new developers are younger and older systems people there's a range of Ages doing it there they're seeing the agility and it's a cultural shift not just the age thing yeah edie this they're not here right this is the missing picture of this show and my criticism of reinforces big gaping hole around crypto and everything is very hard to put people understand that's actually the basic piece one of the things we actually launched is strong thought that allows you to actually see the grunting I don't think that [Music] basically just like what well Saturday report everything you need to update us you always have a single source of truth I think that's something that people should understand here okay I want to get your thoughts on this because you made a comment about security native being the Fein here and security native implying that DevOps what they did for configuration hardening the infrastructures code you have to consider this token economic business model side of it with with the application is a decision is still an application okay blockchain is still an infrastructure dynamic there's software involved I mean we're talking about the same thing is there lost in translation in your opinion well yeah I think that you know to your point value if you can abstract that complexity away but the fundamentals of cryptography and software engineering and game theory coming together is what's always has fascinated me about this this space and and so you're right I think certainly enterprise customers don't want to you know they hear crypto they go oh no although it's interesting you know it was just at a conference IBM yesterday they talk a lot about blockchain they don't talk about crypto yeah yeah to me they go together but of course IBM they don't like to talk a lot about job loss and automation yeah but but but the reality is it's there and it's it's and it's has a lot of momentum which is why you started a company yeah we're actually seeing it all over right now and again our thing is around reducing if not eliminating the friction towards adopting blockchain so less is more in our case we're explicitly choosing not to do crypto wallets or currency transactions it's it's that Andy chassis observation the integrity value the core integrity value for financial reconciliation for detecting supply chain counterfeiting for tracking assets in inventory across to tear distribution unifying multiple source you know systems of record into a shared state those are the kinds of applications received culture and and you know there's so many different use cases obviously right so in Amazon likes to use that word well words will raise the bar which is you know more functionality but the other phrase is undifferentiated heavy lifting there's a lot of details involved in some of those complexities exactly that you're talking about that can be automated away that's goodness but you still have the security problem of immutability which is the beautiful thing with the blockchain actually a lot of times people actually forgot to mention one thing that blocking allows you to do that's actually different from before was actually privacy there's actually not just security is also privacy which actually is getting bigger and bigger as we know it's something that people feel very strongly about because it's something they feel personal about and that's something that in fact oak economics encourages a lot of things that being enables privacy that was not able to do before well look at Facebook what do you guys think about the face I'm one of the few you know I'm a public Facebook critic I think they've done an atrocious job on the privacy front so far I'm protecting our data on the other hand if you know it's kind of like the model report if you actually read Facebook's white paper it's a VIN it's another launch it's an announcement it's a technical announcement it's a well-written design so far and it's Facebook doesn't completely control it they do have a vision for programmability they're evolving it from being a permissions to ultimately a permissionless system so on paper I like what I read and I think it will start to you know popularize and democratize the notion of crypto amongst a broader population I'm not gonna take a much more weight C approach and just you know it's wrong I love always love Facebook I think they've done at Rochas job but I'm addicted I have all my stuff on there centralized they're bringing up their bring in an education bitcoin is up for a reason they're bringing the masses they're showing that this is real market this is kind of like when the web was still viewed as kitty you know playground for technologists cuz AOL was so slow and that was kind of for dummies and you had the web World Wide Web so when that hit that same arguments went down right this has been a crypto thing that's going for years but with Facebook coming in it really legitimizes that well if you bring two billion people to the party exactly a lot of good now the critics of Facebook is they basically copied hash crap kind of a model and there's no way they're going to get it through because the world's not gonna let Facebook run and run commerce and currency it's like it's like and they don't do it well anyway so I think it's gonna be a game changing market making move I think they'll have a play in there but I don't I think Facebook's not gonna have a global course there's a lot that you get a hundred companies to put up ten million sorry yeah already the first accomplice you don't read any more money but they're to us but still the power of yeah right but that power of that ecosystem to me and I was I'm a big fan of this because I think it gives credibility so many companies get get interested in it and you know I'm not sure exactly what's gonna come out of it it's interesting that you know bitcoins up everybody said oh sell your big corner but yeah this is this is a mature well I think open it's gonna always win if you look at even though the web's kind of one example of kind of the maturity argument I think the real analog for me at least my generation value probably relate to this gave is used well headed you know I haven't been born yet a you are right but you know tcp/ip came after SNA which IBM owned the decnet was the largest network at that time to Nigeria says yeah well Novell was laying all three for private area network operating systems so proprietary gnosis decimated by tcp/ip so to me I think even their Facebook does go in there they will recognize that if unless they stay open I think open will always win I think I think this is the beginning the death of the clothes platform yeah clean def Forster I think they have to open it up because if it didn't open up people won't trust them and people won't use them and therefore blockchain if you don't have community behind it there will be nothing well so the thing about the crypto spraying and everything is you put the crypto winter but but to your point tcp/ip HTTP DNS SMTP those are a government-funded or academic funded protocols and people stop spending money on them and then the big Internet companies just co-opted know that's what gmail is built on well I've always said so but let me finish the thought is all this crypto money that came in drove innovation yeah so you're seeing you know this new internet emerge and I think it's it's real I think people you know sort of overlook a lot of the innovation that's coming I've always said Dave that Facebook is what the web would look like if Tim berners-lee took venture financing okay because what they had at that time was a browser and the way that stand-up websites for from self-service information they kept it open and it tried Facebook became basically the web's version of AOL and Linkedin does the same Twitter has open but they have no developer communicate so yeah I think Twitter's the only company in my opinion it actually does a good job opening up their data and now they charge you for that if their earnings up but we still haven't and crypto is the only community that's entire ethos is based upon openness and community you mentioned yes and that is a key word in traditional media will of course focus on you know the bad stuff that happens but you know those of us in the business too who pay attention to it see there's a lot of goodness - there's a lot of mission-driven a lot of openness and it's a model for innovation what do you guys think about the narrative now to break up big tech you know you're hearing you know Facebook Amazon Google coming under fire what are you thoughts on that so I wrote a blog that maybe was ahead of its time about 18 months ago is coinciding with Ginni Rometty at Davos in 2018 not 2019 talking about data responsibility the reason we're having this conversation is that the tech industry by and large and especially the fang stocks or whatever we're calling them now have been irresponsible with our data the backlash is palpable in europe it's law in Europe the backlash we knew was going to start at the state level here there's already a head of my personal schedule federal discussions FTC DOJ as of a couple weeks ago so it's inevitable that this sort of tech reckoning is coming and more responsibility is going to have to be demonstrated by all the custodians of our data and that's why we're positioning Changkat as a chain of custody as a service to demonstrate to your regulators your customers your partner's suppliers you know transparency irrefutable transparency using blockchain for how you're handling data you know if you don't have that transparency you can't prove it we're back to the same old discussions were packed back to you know uninformed old legislators making you know Internet is tubes type regulation um so here here and and DOJ you could argue that that they may be too slow to respond to Microsoft back in the 90s I'm not sure breaking up big tech is the right thing because I think it's almost like AT&T that little text will become big checks again right but they should not be breaking the law I think there's a the reason why is there's actually a limitation of what is possible in technology because they understand and also Facebook understand as well is that it's actually very very hard to have data that's owned by your customers but you are the one who is actually keeping track of everything and you are the one who using the data right it's it it's like a no-win because if you think about encryption cryptography yes you can make the data encrypted that way the customer has the key they control it but then Facebook can offer the services so now you have a Congress thinking well if there's no technological way of doing this what can you do in the legal perspective you know and the law perspect it's how they make it so that the customer actually own the data we actually think that is a perfect reason why you have to actually fix democracy actually technical should be built on our platform because we actually allowed them to have data that's encrypted and still be able do operations validator if the customer give them the permission to do so and I think that's the perfect were way to go forward and I think blockchain is the fundamental thing that's bringing everybody together in a way that actually benefits everyone else taken into is playing strong soldier project what about what's the mission where are you so we see strong saw as actually privacy first we literally are building a platform with developers including Facebook LinkedIn Salesforce can actually build on top of a platform right so what happens when you do this is that they actually give the data governance to the customers the customers own the data but because our photography the they actually can offer services to the customers when the customer allowed them to do so for ample we have something called searchable encryption allows you to encrypt the data and still be able to search and operate on the data without decrypting the data first by giving us power to developers and also to community then you can have our apps that you currently use but they're not hard to use that frictionless and still have the same service that Facebook or sales cloud offers the favor so you can do some discovery on it you can do things to programmability around right exactly even though the data is encrypted but customer owns that they are so the customer has to give them permission to do so right those and we actually launched the first app that actually I told you it's called strong vault you can download an iOS or Android and you can actually see the blockchain at play literally you can see the blockchain in your fingerprint I mean finger a fingertip to see what happens to a data you see everything that happens when Sheriff I or you open a file or something like this congratulations valve give a quick plug for your project chain kit I'd see the new branding there like it penciled data where are you and your project so after nine months of hard selling we're finding out what customers are actually paying for right now in our case it's hardening their apps their data and their logs and wrapping a chain of custody around those things and the use case at a security conference like this is actually quite existential when you think about it one of the things that the industry doesn't talk enough about is that every attack we read about in the headlines was to reprove llege escalation so the attacker somehow hacked your web server managed to get administrative credentials and network or domain administrative credentials and here's what professional attackers do once they have godlike authority on your network they identify all the installed security solutions and they make themselves invisible because they can after that they operate with impunity our technology the security use case that we're seeing a lot of traction is as we can detect that we're applying blockchain we're agnostic so bring your own blockchain in our case no but we're able chain kit a product is it a development environment locally available service host of AWS restful api s and fundamentally were enabling developers to harden their apps to wrap a chain of custody around key data or logs in their apps so that when the attackers attempt to leverage that administrative authority and tamper with logs tamper with a service not a front of software it's applied it's a developer oriented service but this is one of the biggest problems is challenges the security today as you see the static and after you get infiltrated it takes 250 or 300 days yeah to even detect and I have not heard that number shrink I've heard people aspire keep numbers freaking this we can get it down to Rosa Prime the tip of the spear and that's you back yeah that's what we're excited to be here we're excited to talk about one of the dirty secrets of the security industry is that it shouldn't take a year to detect an advanced attack guys thanks for coming on Cuba sharing your insight congressional process ahead bell great to see you likewise and thank ya spj for having us on here and we're looking started coming back and yeah we appreciate you absolutely thanks for spj and thanks for you it was always paying it forward of course really the most important conversation in security is going to be a blockchain type of implementation this is a reality that's coming very soon but we're here at a do is reinforce talking about the first conference with Amazon Web Services dedicated to site CISOs CIOs around security I'm Jean Rudy blunt they stay with us for more coverage after this short break my name is Dave
