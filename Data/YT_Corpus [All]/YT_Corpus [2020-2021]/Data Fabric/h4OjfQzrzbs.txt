 from around the globe it's the cube covering HPE discover virtual experience brought to you by HPE hi and welcome back I'm Stu minimun and this is the cube covers of HPE discovered 20/20 the virtual experience gonna be digging into Green Lake and help me with that happy to welcome to the program first time guess Arwa fedora she is the vice president of worldwide sales for green lake with hewlett-packard enterprise are well thanks so much for joining us thanks for having me alright so as i teed up you're relatively new in the role so if you could just give us a little bit about your background what brought you in HPE and and what your focus is there yeah absolutely thanks for having me um week seven so definitely new in the role on came from sort of a public cloud cloud native set of experiences through microsoft and maybe as to that it was xamarin where we focused on a lot of mobile application development um ultimately what brought me to HPE to be honest is the fact that while cloud has brought a ton of innovation to you know many companies many industries many applications i think i also see the opportunity that it's not just about public cloud but it's about bringing cloud experience everywhere and so looking at the agility the innovation the speed and you know some of the cost savings that the cloud has brought companies i believe that from a green lake perspective we now have an opportunity to modernize IT infrastructure and bring it to our customers in a way that they've never seen before and so ultimately that that was what brought me to HP alright well our what excited me about having the discussion with you is you talked about some of the application modernization cloud native pieces that you've got history on you know my background infrastructure but it has an infrastructure person we know the role of infrastructure really is to support those application a term i've used for a number of years now is you want to modernize the platform and then you can modernize the application on top of them wonder you know what are you hearing customers you know when I talk to developers often it is you know hybrid model of how they're building things it is no longer monolithic things are changing and moving everywhere data of course has huge importance so help us understand that role of the application and data when it comes to green light yeah and I think one of the great points that you know whether it's research or our customers what we ultimately know is 70% of absent data remain on-premises today right whether that's the data center it's in colocation and or at the edge right and that's for a good business reason that they have to remain in those data centers right we have things like you know latency that we have to deal with we have governance and security we have data gravity we have application dependencies right and so being able to think about well how do you solve that problem for the remaining 70% of applications so if they can't move into the cloud well how do we bring the cloud to them right and that's exactly where Green Lake but then which is let's create that cloud like experience from everything for you know the obvious things the pay-as-you-go the sort of the self-service they managed for you right bringing that in to the customers you know data center again Colo the edge I think becomes a really powerful value prop and again from my experience right not every application is going to be a cloud native application that is being built newly for only capabilities and there's still a lot of great applications that can still be built on Prem with cloud like experiences that are brought to you by Green Lake all right so are where you you have the you know the the sales title and when I think about HPE HP's had a number of offering out customers along that journey towards that cloud model that you're talking about a lot of them you know I think back you know go back you know seven years ago it was very much you know here is our stack and we have hybrid models and we're working with service providers Green Lake is very much managed service so help us understand a little bit you know from from the the go-to-market standpoint the sales standpoint that mind shift of going from you know here's gear or here's this stack we're doing to you know really it is a managed services offering so III would think it's it's a different pitch if you will it's a mindset it's different necessarily who you might be selling it to absolutely and I think if I had to think about what we're announcing at discover right and how we're evolving Greenlake it really starts to focus on launching new cloud services like containers virtual machines storage compute right sort of the core cloud offerings but then also adding things like machine learning offs you know data protection for cloud and on-premises right and from a green lake perspective I think if I had to think about the go-to-market it's yes manage services but what does that mean right that means new self-service cloud experiences via Green Lake Central which has very detailed sort of consumption and billing data to allow you to have that transparency it also gives you self-service capabilities right so that you can you know spin spin up virtual machines or configure the services that you need or that you've purchased from us and then also having the ability now to have new workload optimized sort of t-shirt size building blocks right so being able to very quickly find out from our customers what is it that they need having sort of small medium large capabilities again thinking about those workloads that they're trying to support and then in under 14 days being able to deliver the capability to their doors and have that spun up and ready to go yeah one of the advantages of course is you know rather than thinking about ok I've got all of these products it's now more like a Service Catalog I have a lot of different ways and and you've got things that like oh wait you know can that run in there you talk about the the ml and of course HP's done a few acquisitions in the space to help enhance that like map bar I know we've been talking a bit about you know blue data and the like I'm curious from you know the the touch points that you're having in customer is it shifting from you know it's not necessarily I think the person that you know buys the server you know cloud often was the line of business driving from the application down so how does that alignment between the field and the customer shifting and how do you expect Green Lake to kind of move that along even more yeah that's right it becomes a business sort of driven conversation right so what are the outcomes that our customers are driving for from a business transformation perspective so if you think about what they're trying to do is they don't want to have to worry about delivering their own IT which often is slow maybe contains supply chain risks and then of course they're sort of the over-provisioning risks that come with that as well on the way I see our role from a go-to-market perspective is we do have to engage and we are engaging new audiences that we probably haven't been as intimately sort of familiar with in the past and that includes the line of business that includes also you know the architects internally within companies that are designing sort of best-of-breed architectures to deliver the technology infrastructure that will power their next generation of internal applications or even their own solutions to the market it includes you know if you're talking about ml ops it includes talking to data scientists right and understanding you know what is that specific machine learning scenario that they are trying to you know train a model around and how do we help deliver the best solution for them because we also know that putting that in how most of the time is too far away from your data or the edge from which you are collecting data from which again becomes super expensive you have latency issues and it's not a really great way to solve analogs right we we feel like we have a much better solution and in talking to some of those audio says that are trying to solve those business challenges within our customer base we are finding ourselves also talking to a lot of new audiences and you know one audience that I'm intimately familiar with is obviously the developer audience right developers don't want to worry about IT infrastructure they don't want to have to walk over and tell someone that hey I need you to configure XYZ in order for me to start you know testing my code or my you know sort of MVP they want to know that it's all managed that it's quick time to value and that when they're ready to go the infrastructure is there and ready to be deployed against the project that they're trying to execute so those are really important audiences that I feel like we are starting to nurture and we will have a lot more content and relevance for going forward with Green Lake yeah really important point there what also you know how do you kind of there's there's a big ecosystem around Green Lake so you know give me a little bit about that you know the differentiation of hbe compared to some of the other hybrid solutions out there and because I look there's obviously hardware and software solutions that HP has internally but then you've also got you know VMware Nutanix Red Hat and others that are that are partners you know how do you help customers sort through those yeah absolutely and I think it begins with delivering choice to our customers right at the end of the day we need to make sure that we're optimizing for what our customers are looking to do so there has to be an element of openness with HPE Green Lake that we're pretty proud to deliver so we have multiple ISP partnership you know partnerships you mentioned some of them you know VMware and new tonics with respect to delivering some of our solutions I think from a competitive advantage you know I go back to the fact that you know the 70% of apps and data that are still sitting on pram or you know in Colo and edges our competitive advantage comes from being able to bring a true cloud experience to those apps and data where I would argue no one else can do this in a way that has you know speed from a time to value perspective scalability right being able to sort of go up and down a managed for you a true paper use model and billing at that level of granularity and the self-service right allowing you to self provision and do some of those things once we've delivered the core capabilities for you um so from a competitive advantage I feel like we cover off more of the cloud like experiences than anyone else that does in the market and then we also have the partnerships and the ability to bring in some of those third party is V solutions that work incredibly well on Green Lake yeah one of the challenges we've seen in the field is you know customers they do have I guess we know I always added so you know you mentioned you know their shifts but customers absolutely they have their data centers they're using often multiple public clouds out there and they are about the edge so help us understand you know where Green Lake fits and you know how the portfolio helps customers as they need to be able to manage and optimize what they're doing across all those disparate environments yeah I think you're absolutely right customers first of all are going to have a multi cloud and sort of a multi modal strategy right some things they're going to put in the different public clouds and some things they're going to maintain on Prem or Anna Nicole oh and and then some things of course work better in an edge scenario the great part about Green Lake is we solve the on Prem estate problem in a really effective and cost effective and time to value perspective really really well but with Green Lake Central we also give you the transparency to manage your public cloud footprint just as well so we allow you to unify across the the different footprints that you want to have and we're also you know not proprietary when it comes to Green Lake Central right you can plug in other pieces versus you know maybe some of the hyper scalars that are trying to create more of a walled garden or a lock-in scenario where yes you get transparency but only as long as you're within their solution all right so I understand there's about a thousand customers or you passed a thousand custody haps in Green Lake according to another interview that I did so you've got sales gives us a little bit you know what we expect for kind of customer adoption and what else you expect this us to be looking at from the green like offerings yeah absolutely and I think from you know a customer momentum perspective it has just been fantastic to be part of this journey at least for me for the past seven weeks and to see our customers really embrace this new way of how we deliver IT infrastructure to them I think in a way that meets them where they are right as they're transforming we're bringing that on-prem cloud-like experience to their doorstep without them having to feel the pressure of migrating everything whether it makes sense or not into the cloud um again in terms of what's coming new I would you know reiterate the fact that it is looking at all of the basic services like containers vm storage compute it's also starting to optimize around specific workloads again to the point earlier about emma lobs but from what's new and exciting I get really excited about hey I don't want our customers spending time thinking about how to architect and how to design the right IT or infrastructure offering I want to be able to do that for them in order to deliver that experience that they need and again what that helps our customers with is cost time to value and the ability to get a pre-configured solution that is already optimized right we don't want our customers spending all of their time having to configure an architect IT infrastructure we want them to worry about the business outcomes and then tell us what they need and then we create those pre-configured solutions on their behalf given their input so so again it's a very cloud like way to deliver our value to our customers and I think it also frees up our customers to focus their resources on the real innovation that they need to drive at their business level versus focusing on things that you know we're experts in and we can bring to them in a much quicker and more value and absolutely thank you so much yeah actually what we've heard loud and clear customers they need to be able to shift away from things that they don't have differentiation and don't add value to the business and focus on this business after our congratulations on the new position and definitely watching the continued progress good buzz around Green Lake antastic thank you Steve thanks for having me all right stay tuned for lots more coverage
