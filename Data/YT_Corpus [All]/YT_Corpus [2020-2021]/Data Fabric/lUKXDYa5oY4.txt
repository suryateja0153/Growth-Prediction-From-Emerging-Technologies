 We also announced an as a service container offering built on our HPE Ezmeral container platform software. This container service brings speed and portability to both your cloud native and non cloud native apps using open source Kubernetes, and we have a unique data fabric that provides persistent container storage for stateful apps. Let's take a look. With HPE GreenLake Central we can create a cluster right here from the main dashboard. Here, we click into the container widget, give our cluster a name, select a blueprint, and create the cluster. Now our cluster is ready for our developers to use within the platform. That's all there is to it.
