 how complete is your hyper-converged solution many hyper-converged infrastructure solutions simply focus on software-defined storage delivered on x86 compute however there are dozens of discrete functions and technologies that can be consolidated for greater simplicity in the data center this includes networking legacy networks are complex and were not designed to accommodate the latest generation of distributed applications that produce east-west traffic in addition these networks often require specialist staff and expensive maintenance HPE composable fabric offers a new approach it delivers a software-defined networking fabric that's purpose-built for workload driven performance and scale it also enables true hyperconvergence that stands apart from one dimensional hyper converged infrastructure solutions delivering operational and cost efficiency HPE simplicity with composable fabric is a single scalable platform that delivers the equivalent of up to a dozen discrete infrastructure functions managed from a single interface by a VM admin easily pool networking resources and provision as needed in real-time or incremental escale within Iraq between racks and across data centers without disrupting operations run any VM anywhere anytime improve performance by defining and automating affinities and desired workload behavior or isolating critical workloads to ensure exclusive access also provide power to your admin who can now easily manage the entire stack and spend more time on business critical strategies find your TrueNorth with true hyperconvergence learn more about HPE simplicity with composable fabric when you visit HPE calm / info / simplicity
