 I'm Justin Tomlin I am an HR program manager for a company called NetApp that's based out of RTP here in North Carolina I've been with them going on three years now and so I started my journey with NC State I came in didn't see state in 2012 as a chemical engineering major dad set on being a physician assistant and go into PA school and quickly learned that I was gonna be miserable and chemical engineering if I didn't get into PA school and that was kind of my back-up plan is to have a degree I could be successful in the new I would just not enjoy my life if that was the chemical engineer and so I backed out of or I'm transitioned into biochemistry and was in there for a semester and then took a nutrition class and in charge of nutrition class at NC State my sophomore year of college and fell in love with it and realized that it would be a much better route for pre PA and preparing well and be more proactive with my approach to medicine that I you know that I'm more in love with and so switched into nutrition as a result of that spend the next three years explore in that degree and realized that PA was just not the route I wanted to take so ended up understanding that I wanted to help people just in a different capacity than medicine allowed me to so moved into a couple different clubs that were business-related and found a passion for human resources and sales and some would have been combining that into recruiting even and so now I work on a university relations team specifically so managing programs for interns and new University grad hires that are going to be coming out of school and working with them that just really help them identify careers they're gonna love and the best jobs that fit their skill sets and where they want to go and matching them with their long-term goals and ultimately running the programs that help our NetApp University grad hours and interns be successful so being in a different field than the one that I majored in there were certainly still some classes that were very impactful for me to take it was nice because the degree allowed me and ultimately stay in a fifth year as well allowed me a chance to take a few additional classes that were outside of the core nutrition curriculum and so some of the most impactful classes or as an intro to HR class that I was able to take which not only taught me a lot about the HR field and ultimately helped me discover my passion for it but it also told me taught me a lot about the interviewing basics and how to get into a job and how to make the most out of it and so there were a lot there for navigating that first job and coming out of college so how to design your resume to best fit for the job you're applying for how to sell yourself the best in an interview setting in those types of skills so I think a class that would be a very impactful class that helped me I think another one is some of the ones that as a science major you can get locked into this feeling feeling like why do I have to take all these humanities or why do I have to take all these random classes that don't pertain to what I'm going to be doing but in reality they do and there's a good reason to have a well-rounded curriculum built to help you get exposure to different areas and so one of the most impactful classes I ever took was co-ed foundations of cultural confidence at NC State and it really just explored the different cultural aspects that are out there and how to not become not didn't make me culturally confident you can't become culturally competent but it helps you understand the differences that exist in valuing diversity and a different life and not you know we have these aspects of diversity that are typically advertised or talked about but diversity is so much deeper there's so many things that are on the surface level then people get latched onto from a diversity standpoint but then diversity is an iceberg there is so much below the surface that exists within a comic within a person that a lot of people you don't see at face value as far as clubs I've joined Alpha Kappa side business fraternity definitely helped me out transition because that was predominantly nutrition focused in science and I was in pre health club and a lot of different nutrition focused organizations and it just realized if I was going to be transitioning out it allowed me an avenue where I couldn't change my major because I was so deep I was already gonna be staying a fifth year that I went ahead and had to look at and get creative with how I was gonna get exposure to the business world and the realm I would ultimately head into so Brielle club was the club that I was in and I was the blood drive coordinator for them and organized the to organize the blood drives for about every other semester once or twice a semester we would have blood drives that we would host on campus and what that opportunity really allowed me to do was grow my leadership skills because I had several people that would show up as volunteers and coaching them through the opportunity that they were getting to volunteer how to check people in and really just show that I was capable of taking a leadership role but it also gave me some great project management skill sets which relate really well to my program manager job that I'm in now but ultimately program management all every individual is a project manager in some capacity because we manage our lives in our day-to-day you know our grocery list or you know moving moving apartments moving houses all of that is a project and so learning the foundations of project management and how to eventually take on a bigger project with a lot of different stakeholders and objectives it was a nice entry-level role to showcase my leadership skills but also develop sage program or project management skills that have now helped me tremendously in my job now so there is no typical day under that's probably cliche for a lot of folks but there's really no typical day in my job it really depends on the season so my job and the university relations space is very cyclical in nature just as they hold so basically it depends on the season you're in we're doing a lot of recruiting going out to campus pulling in the students and getting pipeline for positions that we will eventually feel and that is takes place in the fall on spring but once they're on boarded in the summer time frame is when the majority of our interns do on board for our Americas region and that's the one that I managed so for Americas we've got if it's a day in June I'm running around helping interns get on board and making sure they're getting to their orientation and got everything set up for them that they're getting having great conversations with their managers having very clear goals set in conversations with okay what am I going to be doing for the next 10 to 12 weeks that I'm in my internship if it's a day in October I may be heading out say NC State to go to a campus recruiting event maybe presenting to a classroom maybe attending a career fair we're actually recruiting spokes and actually having conversations around what types of jobs we offer and what that all looks like so having that conversation letting them know what lemon is all about and what opportunities we may have that students can head into if it's a day in February it's a lot of prep work so we've got some of the campus taken care of in the fall and now there are some of not seen that's still out on campus heavily recruiting in the spring but my main focus then shifts to planning for the interns so we bring in about a hundred and fifty interns every summer depending on the year for the entire Americas region and so I've got interns in ten different locations across the country so it's meeting with different stakeholders and different psych contacts that those individual locations to make sure everything is set up for their summer and whether that's organizing it the speaker series where the CEO comes in talks whether that's organizing that all of the logistics that go into the mentoring program that's growing really really well over the past couple of years and a truly impactful experience for our interns or organizing some of the bowling or social advance team-building activities that we do throughout the summer as well I would say there's not a lot of overlap between specific nutrition and my job now as an HR program manager as you might assume there's not a ton of overlap but I think nutrition one thing that's special about nutrition is a degree is it's relevant and it's practical no matter what you end up going into because there is a lot to be said for just how you live your life and understanding aspects of food and just nutrition and how it interacts in the body anyway so just the way we live our lives but there's ultimately a lot of skill sets you gain from the nutrition degree that are helpful regardless of which field you head into as well so for me understanding study design survey design analytical skills understanding that data is only impactful if you know how interpret that data and whether it's relevant statistically significant you've met balance right so understanding those aspects certainly trickle over to any type of field you head into because it gives you a different lens that people then people otherwise might have if they grew if they majored in some non technical field post-grad life taught me a lot about myself because it's in a much different scenario than you are as a student so I think you go through a lot of life changes that happen and you're you're really out in the real world because even if you're doing an internship you're balancing intern full-time you know baby you're doing a full-time internship you've got school going on you've got internship and full-time work going on as well there's not a lot of time to spend thinking for yourself and kind of what you want to end up being or what your long-term goals are and I think one of the biggest things as well is when you graduate when you're in school you know what your end goal is it's to graduate when you get out of school the world's your oyster yeah and it becomes this situation where you the world's yours I mean you can do whatever you want to you can set whatever types of goals you want to there's not a real clearly defined trajectory and I think that's been one of my biggest learning lessons is now that I look back three years back from when I graduated so now two-and-a-half years three years since I've graduated what have I done and how many goals have I said and how many of those have i realistically achieved because it can be very easy to just get into the day-to-day grind and get caught up into different things and not clearly work towards any type of thing in particular so having a clearly defined goal post out there that you're working towards and having some type of plan of action to get there is very important because it is very easy to get caught up in the day-to-day and rush through life and all of a sudden you're looking back they can spend five years and I what have I truly accomplished it can be a big it's not as clearly defined as when you're in school I think it's interesting because I was watching a Netflix documentary actually recently and one of the things that they're learning about the mind is being able to be creative in your thinking and envision solutions or envision the future is completely contingent on your past experiences and so I think there is value in understanding your own leanness as a person which is the space that you stand that no one else could occupy and Nilla for merchants is the individual who is to coin that term own leanness and I think it's a very important one for everyone to understand because it truly is there is no one like you there's no one like me out there in this world we may have a lot of shared experiences and maybe we both went didn't see stay maybe we're both nutrition majors but there's a spot in this universe that you stand that no one else could and that's based on your past experiences and so I think that it's important not to neglect it's important to learn from your past and your mistakes even but not to neglect or disregard what you've come through to get to a place you are because yes I could say that there are certain things in my life that I would change or do differently but ultimately if that was the case if I did have the chance to change him I would not be Who I am or standing where I am today our ability to predict the future envision the future or be creative with our solutions hinges on our past experiences make an effort and diversify those experiences if you have a chance to go abroad go abroad if you have a chance to make friends with somebody that is totally unlike you do that find that one common thread and then the rest of it that's different learning and explore that because that's what's going to give you the opportunity to be creative in your solutions down the road so my advice for students would be three things and that would be to continue to set very clear goals for yourself always have something you striving towards to constantly push your comfort zone and ultimately understand that our minds are relatively poor at predicting what's going to make us happy in a lot of ways and so getting outside of our comfort zones can be very scary at times but it's critical to do that to not only just grow and develop but ultimately to discover our new passions and things in life that are gonna make us happy and things in life that we continue to strive for so I think that would be the second piece and the third piece I think also do not sell yourself short everybody has something to add everybody knows something then another person don't doesn't and it's important to understand I like to take this mindset with myself is everybody's an expert at something and even if I am very knowledgeable in HR nutrition or whatever it is that doesn't mean I'm the smartest in that and it certainly doesn't mean I'm the smartest at everything out there so everybody has something to give everybody has something to contribute everybody has something to teach and so I Pro take that mindset and take that growth mindset forward through life is understanding that people around you have something to give but you also do as well and what you have to give is based on your unique experiences and the spot you stand in the world in your own leanness that no one else can can mock and can stand in that same spot and so it's important to understand what you have to offer and to do a lot of self-reflection and self-discovery to find out what that is but do not sell yourself short it would be a big piece of advice as well
