 Across industries, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have the potential to help organizations innovate and deliver real business value. However, implementing AI at scale is hard. Many enterprises dabble with AI, but very few can scale up their AI/ML operations to deliver high-quality and reliable machine learning models in production. In most enterprises today, data science and machine learning workflows do not have the standardized processes – collectively known as DevOps – that are commonplace with software development. Most data scientists are still building models in silos on local machines or laptops. And the variability in development environments makes it hard to share code and collaborate. Limited access to infrastructure is another challenge and results in lost productivity and delayed time to value as data scientists wait their turn to train their ML models. Once the model training is complete, it is handed off to software development for deployment with little to no visibility into model performance. Monitoring and retraining are ad-hoc and opportunistic at best, increasing the risk of an inaccurate prediction. HPE Machine Learning Ops is an end-to-end data science solution that brings DevOps like speed and agility to the machine learning lifecycle. Data scientists operate in a shared workspace. And can instantaneously spin-up development, training, or production environments with their choice of machine learning tools in a matter of minutes. With a project and model repository, model handoff is standardized, and DevOps workflows executed before full production deployment. HPE ML Ops provides native capabilities to deploy machine learning models to scalable, load-balanced, and secure endpoints. An intuitive dashboard provides full visibility into utilization across all infrastructure resources. Integrations with 3rd party tools provide model performance monitoring and interpretability. With HPE ML Ops you can standardize your ML workflows, reduce risk, improve team productivity, and accelerate the time to value of your ML projects.
