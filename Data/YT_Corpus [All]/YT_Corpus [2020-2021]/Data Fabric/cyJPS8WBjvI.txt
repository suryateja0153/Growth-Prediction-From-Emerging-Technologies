 the world wide web is the most successful information integration project in human history it contains a world of information from facts to photos from music to masterpieces the near sum of human knowledge spread out across the entire planet but accessible through a single browser window it is in short a proven model for large-scale complex information integration now from a technical perspective we can view the web as a decentralized graph of connected documents my previous videos describe how decentralized graphs have the potential to revolutionize enterprise data integration and here's the cool thing the web gives us everything we need to create a decentralized enterprise knowledge graph straight out of the box let me put it more simply an enterprise can use the tools of the web to connect the near sum of all of its data together allowing it to be viewed through a single lens on the web battle-hardened technologies like HTTP servers URLs HTML and hyperlinks allow anyone to connect their documents to anyone else's regardless if they're based in the flat next door or on the other side of the world I guess at the general level at least you already know all this but over the past few years some very clever people have worked out how to use these technologies to do the same thing for data to give you an intuition currently on the web if you click on a link you get the web equivalent of a Word document back with the tech these guys have created you get the web equivalent of an Excel spreadsheet at the heart of this idea is that URL each data item be at a sale product or person gets a unique URL just like each webpage on the web does and where one data item links to another they connect together with hyperlinks this is data integration on the web scale and unbeknownst to most people a third of all web pages now contain these little islands data but if it can work at the web scale why not use this tech stack behind the enterprise firewall it gives us everything we need to create our decentralized enterprise knowledge graphs let's drop down to the implementation level for a sec first of all you have data websites so each application within the enterprise runs an HTTP server and publishes its key data in RDF giving each data item a unique URL the applications are then responsible for connecting their data together using hyperlinks this architecture is scaleless as the data stays where it is and is simply exposed into a vast connected layer and it is decentralized as it's the application teams themselves that are doing the data integration now just like you don't load the whole of the web into your web browser so a given user or application does not need or even have the rights to access all of the data in the enterprise you can think of this as splitting the graph into a vast slow distributed graph the enterprise and a fast can pack one for each user users get their own data browser that provides a window onto all of the data in the enterprise but a user can only pull back and cache the fraction of the data that that user actually needs and has rights to access by connecting information together the web has made humanity more powerful not everything about it is good but at a species level this rich network of connections has made humans faster more efficient and more adaptable to change now I know for large enterprises that the data interpretation problem can look insurmountable and frankly it seems ridiculous to talk about connecting all of an enterprise's data together but the web shows that it is possible to connect information at scale it gives us a model for success so take the standardized battle-hardened tech stack that runs the web and apply it to the data within the boundary of your enterprise firewall the result is a decentralized enterprise knowledge graph that is capable of integrating the near sum of all your data together into a richly connected network connecting your data this way will make your enterprise faster more efficient and more adaptable to change in short it will make it more powerful and much better positioned for the oncoming AI tsunami
