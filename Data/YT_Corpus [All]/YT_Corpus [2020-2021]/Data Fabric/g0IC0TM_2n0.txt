 in this video I'm going to show you how to make this super easy, simple headphone case. For the headphone case you're going to need two pieces of fabric five inches by five inches then you're going to need this little bit here which is four inches by two inches you're also going to need a zipper that will fit across your fabric and a key ring. First of all decide which fabric that you want to be the front of the headphone case and then you're going to cut one of these fabrics in half so here we go I chose the cherries and this is the one that's going to have the zipper. Now before I go to the sewing machine I'm going to prepare my tab I'm going to flip it over to the wrong side so the pretty side is facing down and then I'm going to fold this in half and I'm going to press once I have pressed that in half I'm going to open it out and I'm going to fold one side in on itself like so and press. Now I'm going to turn it around I'm going to fold the other side in on itself like so and press. Now I have two pieces folded in on itself like so I am now going to fold that and I'm going to press as you can see I have all of my raw seams enclosed and it's ready to sew down don't worry about these raw seams at the end because they are going to get hidden later so before I go to my sewing machine I just want to ensure that I get all of my non sewn related items completed so I'm going to take my other five inch square and I want to turn it around so the pretty side is facing down I was able to find a circular container that fits this piece of fabric perfectly and I'm now going to draw a circle around my square so now I have all of my parts completed and I can head over to the sewing machine without having to stop and start. There are two different types of zipper feet that I can use for my machine there's this guy here and there's also this guy here which is also the piping foot but I prefer to use this foot also for my zippers so I'm going to attach this to my sewing machine and now have my foot attached to my sewing machine and we're ready to sew. So I have the front part of my headphone case face up and I'm going to place my zipper face down onto the fabric like so if you like you can clip your project into place so it doesn't move on you now I'm going to keep my needle in the down position so every time my sewing machine stops it's going to be in the down position at all times now I'm going to start to sew and I'm going to go very slow so I'm going to take a few stitches forward and I'm going to back stitch to secure them stitches in place and then I'm going to go forward again sewing my zipper all the way down and back stitch at the end now fold this flap over take it to your iron and press You're going to have something that looks like this now you're going to get the second section and you're going to line it up with the one that you've just sewn Grab your clip if you have to and take it back to your sewing machine to sew in place. I'm at my sewing machine so I'm going to go few stitches forward and I'm going to reverse to lock them stitches in place and I'm going to sew the rest of the zip down you can go as fast or as slow as you want and backstitch at the end and you're finished. So open up what we've just sewn down take it to the iron and press, what I'm going to do next is top stitch these sections in place you can keep your zipper foot on if you like or you can change your regular foot whichever works for you so once again I have left my needle in the down position on my sewing machine and I'm just going to start to sew and back stitch and go all the way down make sure that you use a matching thread unless you want a contrast so sew all the way down and backstitch when you come to the end now you're going to turn your project around you're going to put that needle in the down position and we're going to start off and we're going to back stitch I'm going to sew the other side of our headphone case just sew all the way down and back stitch at the end now you have something that looks like this now we are going to finish off our tab here I am going to remove my zipper foot of my sewing machine and put my regular foot on what I'm going to do with my tab piece is, I'm going to sew a row of stitches down each side just securing it shut, i'm barely on the edge of the project so I'm just going to start I'm going to back stitch and I'm going to sew all the way down, now I'm just coming to the end I'm going to sew a back stitch there we go now you can see what I've done here just sewn all the way down and it's right at the edge and I'm going to do the same on the other side as you can see again needle in the down position back stitch and sew all the way down the tab coming to the end and we're going to back stitch and there we go so that's your tap complete. You can trim these ends off, it's a little bit messy all that's left to do is to piece everything together so I am going to put this piece face-up and this piece facedown and then I'm just going to pin these in place I have my project pinned in place and before we do anything I'm going to open this zipper up I'm going to do it about half way across because if you don't do this you run the risk of not being able to get into your pouch once you've completed it so I'm just going to put an extra pin here so we'll now have everybody secured so remember the circle that we did before I am going to cut around that circle and there we go now we have the circle cut I'm just going to point out again at this point you want to have your zipper open! Now you decide where you want to have your tab it's up to you I'm not going to dictate I'm going to just do it slightly, probably here so your tab here wants to be on the inside and your raw edge wants to be hanging over like this so the loop is like this and then we are going to open, and we are going through wedge in between here See what I'm doing, I have this loop section here and I'm going to put it on the inside and this is why it doesn't matter if you've got the raw edges because we're going to sew them shut like so, so just to show you again so these are the pretty sides of a fabric this is the loop this is the raw edges and we're just going to shut this down I'm going to pin this in place so this is the headphone pouch nearly complete we just need to sew all around the ends here so once again needle in the down position and i have this awesome feature of my sewing machine which allows me to have the pivot key turned on so every time I stop and start my presser foot is automatically going to raise I'll just show you that so take a few stitches forward back stitch then I'm going to stop, you see this foot here raised without me having to go behind the machine it's such an awesome feature now as we're sewing around this project I want you just to push on these zippers so they're not open they're going to want to open because there's nothing there to hold them shut so I am just going to sew all the way around and sometimes when you get to the zipper teeth it's a good idea just to back stitch over them.  So just do it a few times just to secure it and then just go slowly all the way around what you could have done is you could have used pinking shears to have cut your project pinking shears create like these kind of zigzag cut into your fabric so I'm just going to sew all the way around here slowly and just be careful that you're not going to ride over any of these pins as you're sewing along go slowly come all the way around you're coming up to with the zip apart again and just back stitch over a few times forwards and backwards and forwards and then we come up to this tab so it could be a bit bulky so here we go, just sew it slowly and when it comes to tabs I like to do another back stitch forward and backwards a few times and then go all the way around and then I'm coming to another pin here so just take that out we don't need him anymore and sew all the way to the end and then just back stitch so we have sewn all the way around this project there's going to be a few things that you want to cut off just cut this tab off and cut some of these threads off and if you wanted to you could finish all of this seams with a serger that's easy peasy - all that's left to do now is turn this right sides out so I'm just going to unzip the zipper and then turn it out and I'm just going to take it to the iron to do a quick press you're so you're all presses I have attached my keyring and I'm going to pop my earphones right inside my pouch and now I am super organized so seriously how simple was that let me know in the comments down below and don't forget to hit that subscribe button so you don't miss my next video thank you for watching bye
