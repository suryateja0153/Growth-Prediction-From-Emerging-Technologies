 although we dream of colonizing the moon traveling around the solar system and one day beyond to the stars space is a dangerous place not least because of the radiation from our Sun and galactic cosmic rays we only found out about the bands of trapped ionizing radiation that surround the earth Van Allen belts just after the launch of Sputnik and these have been a fertile ground for the moon hopes has ever since claiming that they are so dangerous but no one could ever get through but as we venture deeper into space for much longer duration missions like those to Mars and beyond how do we protect the spacecraft the crews the control electronics and computers from radiation [Music] [Applause] [Music] this video is sponsored by Magellan TV now Magellan is a new documentary streaming service run by filmmakers which is something I can appreciate because I do the same thing and I know what it takes to make something that's interesting engaging and something you believe in be read about history science space or nature and that's what I see when I watch documentaries on Magellan if you're finding you have some more spare time on your hands these days Magellan has 2,000 plus documentaries available with more being added each week and a wide selection of those being in 4k for no extra cost or you can stream them directly to your smartphone or tablet wherever you are if you're watching this then you're probably interested in more space videos and I have a couple I can recommend on Magellan TV the first one is faster than light and looks at what it will take to get to the newly discovered exoplanets around nearby stars and the second is powered by spice reinventing space flights about using plasma as the future for rocket engines and the solar system and now you can watch these and many more by getting your one-month free trial by going to a link for this special offer right at the top of the description below and I know you'll find Magellan TV as worthwhile as I have when most people think of radiation x-rays nuclear power and atomic bombs normally spring to mind all things that we need to be relatively close to to be affected by that in space the radiation comes from millions or billions of kilometers away and often much farther the Sun is the biggest source of radiation in the solar system emitting both electromagnetic radiation like x-rays and some gamma rays but also a huge amount of charged particles the nucleus of atoms with the electrons stripped away as well as the electrons themselves the other source of radiation are galactic cosmic rays these are mostly gamma rays and high-energy charged particles that were created in events like supernova explosions or even millions of light-years away these types of high-energy radiation are called ionizing radiation because when they strike a normal atom they have enough energy to knock the electrons off leaving just the nucleus which is then called an ion this is where it becomes dangerous to us and electronic equipment we used to control and fly spacecraft with when electronic devices are exposed to ionizing radiation a single charged particle cannot thousands of electrons loose which creates electrical noise and in modern digital trips like CPUs and memory chips it can cause transistors to turn on and off changing the bit data from a 1 to a 0 or vice versa scrambling information and causing things like computer crashes with a high enough or long enough dose of radiation the chips are physically damaged and stop working correctly since Apollo control system computers in spacecraft use radiation harden components and have redundancy built in because he's thought that in normal operation it's highly unlikely that both the main and backup system would have the same error this type of redundancy was built into the IBM flight computers that control a Saturn five rockets which we also have a video on if you're interested in the human body these ionizing particles act like tiny subatomic bullets which can break apart chemical bonds killed cells and damaged DNA leading to cancer at low levels like the background radiation we live with every day the damage is not a problem because the body can replace the damaged cells easily it's when the radiation level rises that it becomes a problem and it also varies depending upon the amount of energy the charged particles are carrying but in general the total cumulative doses where it matters a moderate dose over a long period of time can cause more damage than a single very short hide as the body is unable to repair the consistent ongoing damage fast enough this is why it's okay for you to have an x-ray every so often but why the radiographers are behind shielded doors and glass to keep their cumulative dose as low as possible you might not think it but astronauts are radiation workers too once out in space very exposed to higher levels than they are on the earth because the radiation can go through the walls of a spacecraft they are in astronauts on the International Space Station where dose aa meters to measure their accumulated amount though the ISS stays relatively close to the earth is protected by the Earth's magnetic field most of the time once they have reached their lifetime radiation limit their job as an astronaut is over this is due to the increased risk of cancer that any continuation of that work would give them however the ISS also regularly flies through the South Atlantic anomaly this is where the Earth's inner Van Allen radiation belt comes closest to the earth and the radiation levels can become much higher the Van Allen radiation belts are areas where charged particles mostly energetic electrons and protons which come from the Sun as well as galactic cosmic ray particles are trapped by the Earth's magnetic field when the Apollo mission went to the moon they knew about the radiation belts but chose routes that would take them through the least dense areas with the lowest levels of radiation and they were only in them for a couple of hours going there and coming back with time in between for the body to recover the outer skin of Okuma modules in the Apollo missions were made from a stainless steel sheets with a honeycomb structure in between and lined with fiberglass the inner pressure shell was made from a similar honeycomb structure but this time made from aluminium which might not sound like much but he did work counter to what many think having a thick metal shield like lead in a spacecraft could actually make things worse as well as making the craft too heavy to get into space this is because of the bremsstrahlung effect when a charged particle hits another charged particle or the nucleus of an atom in this case foreskin of the spacecraft it slows down this releases energy in a form of x-rays which been going to affect the crew or the equipment the best way to shield against charged particles is to use a material with a high hydrogen content that absorbs them in the original Apollo command module design a tetrafluoroethylene plastic tissue was used in the ionizing chamber walls to help absorb these particles but it was also flammable and this helped the fire spread in the Apollo one accident that killed the crew of Gus Grissom ed white and Roger Chaffee afterwards to reduce the fire risk aluminium was used in place of a plastic tissue even though this was not ideal from the bremsstrahlung point of view but in recent times a new approach has been developed using Z graded materials the idea behind this is that you have several layers of material which get progressively lighter by their atomic number from the outside in there might be a tantalum outer layer with other layers such as tin steel copper through to aluminium or polypropylene and boron carbide as the innermost ones this graded shielding would scatter the protons and electrons as well as absorb gamma rays each of the layers would absorb the x-rays created from the bremsstrahlung effect by the previous layer and the boron would absorb the neutrons in the end the amount of radiation would be lowered to a safe level but requiring less of it compared to a shield comprising of a single material the most effective way to shield a spacecraft is with the simplest of materials water this is because it's two-thirds hydrogen water is so effective at reducing radiation that it's used to store highly radioactive nuclear fuel rods for every 18 centimeters of water the radiation is reduced by about half a cylinder of water around the crew quarters about 1 meter thick would give enough protection for a crew on the journey to Mars for six months or so but they would have earth-like levels of radiation over the transit time the only problem with this simple solution is that water is very heavy with 1 cubic metre of water weighing in about 1,000 kilograms providing a 1 meter thick shield for a tube-like crew quarter measuring 5 and a half meters by 22 meters would weigh well over 300 tons greatly increasing the number of launches required to get the mission into orbit plus extra fuel that will be required for the acceleration and the acceleration of the extra mass once in space another method which is being looked at is to create a magnetic field like one round the earth but around the spacecraft itself using superconducting magnets this would be effective against charged particles but it wouldn't have any effect against x-rays or gamma rays so you would still need traditional shielding methods - so for a foreseeable future we are going to be using shielding which is as light as possible but with the best possible shielding and absorption characteristics this basically means that it will do just enough to protect the crew to perform a mission safely but with little margin for unexpected events like solar flares so what do you think about radiation issues that future astronauts will face let me know in the comments so thanks for watching I don't forget to subscribe click the bell notification thumbs up and share you
