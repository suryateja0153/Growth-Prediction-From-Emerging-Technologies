 our first session is on the cell or at the scale of the cell or sub-cell a thought-provoking question that we'll we'll answer after the panelists after the speakers when was the first microscope used functionally it's a very broad and big question but when was the first microscope and then when was the first image of dna so have that in the back your mind and after our speakers before we get going to the panel we'll we'll share the answers our panelists our speakers for the cell are dr ashwin gopinath dr peter soh and dr timothy swagger we'll hear from ashwin on democratizing single molecule nanoarrays we'll hear from dr peter soh on interferometric imaging for studying sickle cell diseases and we'll hear from timothy swagger on using dynamic lens systems for biosensing again we'll hear from the speakers one talk after the other cue questions will be asked after all three speakers have presented with that i'll turn it over to dr gophenoff thanks brian and thanks for inviting me to share some of the work that uh that we've been doing i'm i'm fairly new to mit i just started my lab a couple of years back uh so all the work is is just stuff that has happened in the last couple of years so um in between all the co with craziness so that's that's unique uh it's it's like a testament to my postdoc who's able to do all of this so uh that's it so i'm gonna be talking about democratization of uh single molecule nano rays and uh so it's kind of a little way to understand what i mean by that so i i just want to kind of take a toy example of what it is like to do single molecule optical experiments and then jump off from there to tend to say what it is that we are doing so if typically if you want to interrogate single molecules uh uh using um any kind of optical microscopy you take a surface you put a whole bunch of molecules on the surface and then you uh these molecules will have either fluorophores on them you're doing fret there are different kind of analysis that you can do and you typically end up getting in a cartoon picture this is the data that you end up getting now that's not necessarily the most optimum use of the surface you could increase the concentrations and when you increase the concentrations you would have an overlap of a whole bunch of these molecules very close to each other and because of diffraction limited problems you you'll have to use advanced super resolution techniques to kind of eliminate a whole bunch of data points or to use uh to integrate and understand what is happening on the flip side if you actually reduce the concentration the amount of data that you can end up getting on that surface so within the setting the question is what would be the ideal organization of single molecules to maximize the amount of data connected and the answer is kind of simple it's just you know you all you put the molecules such that uh the distance between them is just a little bit over lambda by two there is the uh dielectric constant uh in there but let's ignore that for the time being so if you have a hexagonal closed packing of single molecules guaranteed to be at lambda by two periodicity that's about as much of a data you can actually get from the surface without using a sophisticated single molecule resolution or like super resolution techniques so that's the question that we are trying to answer but what is a technique that allows us to do this now uh uh and and the tool of choice within my lab is this technique that was uh uh uh invented in the mid 2000's about 15 years back when uh paul pollardman at cal tech uh took a long single strand of dna and folded it into arbitrary shapes demonstrated that you can actually fold it into arbitrary shapes using short dna strands and uh what makes uh origami uniquely special is because this technique is extremely generalizable that's just uh by changing these uh staple strands so the strands that folds this long uh uh long single strand into a particular shape you can get any shape of your shirt you can make two dimensional shapes so you can make three dimensional shapes and curved shapes solid state solid structures anything that you can think of and uh uh just bear in mind this is all made designed in a computer made and the uh it's all the constituent elements are all the same there are just dna uh and these are these are viewing dna as a building like a polymer a programmable polymer rather than thinking about it as a biological entity so this extreme amount of modularity that is that that that dna origami brings with you but beyond this what makes dna origami kind of special is er so let's think about an abstract map of a triangle for instance the constituent element every single constituent element within this structure is unique so it's a unique set of dna strands that form this particular structure so you can label a particular point within the structure using using a unique dna what that means is if you may if you design the structure and make it and the next day you decide i want to put three different molecules on the inner vertex of this triangle bear in mind the inner vertex is 30 nanometers and the external edges are about 120 nanometers all you need to do is change three molecules in the design and you can attach now now it's ready to attach three other molecules uh that has dna tag on them and you have left with another triangle now with three molecules on them and for the last 60 years people have been trying to attach dna onto anything so you have nanoparticles quantum dots carbon nanotubes you name a nanomaterial you can attach a there isn't a chemistry available to attach dna onto and what is even more interesting about dna origami is every single point every single multiplication point is five nanometers from every other point so you can think of this origami as a breadboard with five nanometer resolution now when i say five nanometer resolution is different from the minimum resolution in the cmos of like fab setting it's basically saying this is the minimum length size on which you can organize other molecules or other entities that you can tag with dna over the last 15 years people have been trying to attach carbon nanotubes gold nanoparticles proteins polymers quantum dots other proteins this is a small subset of origami-enabled devices these are all devices wherein you've taken the core dna origami used it as a breadboard attached other molecules onto it to build a sophisticated structure out of it but the problem with all of this is that these are all in solutions you can't create connections into it and can't you have not created a uh uh you know a link to the solid state world and what does that give you that gives you if you have the ability to organize dna or dna origami at specific locations since you can uniquely modify uh the dna origami with individual dna strands you can now attach individual proteins or individual carbon nanotubes or any inorganic structures or any other molecule that can be uniquely tagged with dna onto a solid solids solid surface and the way in which uh uh uh the the the technique that i developed to do this involves a chemically patterned surface you take a typical chemically ah planar surface you uh do a self-sustainable monolayer to create a passivating layer and then you create patches in the shape of the origami in this case it's about 100 nanometers in size very easily accessible using standard fab and uh what and and because of the nature of the interaction between the origami and the uh dna and the surface you can have unique uh uh assembly capabilities for instance in this particular case you have a binding site that's in red and you have origami uh in blue with blue strands and you have these magnesium bridges that actually link them together because it's a cooperative interaction it acts as an energy minimization process so if you have a simulations of the binding site and the origami it wiggles around and slots itself into the particular binding site and this is not just a theory we can have experiments to kind of demonstrate this and that allows us a lot of uh a room to tweak different parameters you can tweak depending on the concentration the size and things of that nature you can design the entire pathway and what you're left with are surfaces like this this is a silicon dioxide surface in which there is an origami every 400 nanometers and on the origami you can modify just a single entity or a defined number of entity and we get we can do this on multiple substrates we have a line interval less than eight degrees not only can we put molecules on the surface you can also carry reactive groups within the origami to do chemistries under the surface and so you can design on a surface it's possible for you to give me a particular point and i can go in and put a particular molecule there and just have a single reaction that's doable and this is all done on standard uh uh microfabrication tools so the lithography is all standard we just make 100 nanometer features and everything else is done by self-assembly and this is also scalable and this is so so this is a work that we did a few years back when we took 65 000 different photonic crystal cavities and the intensity of light that comes out of any given photonic crystal cavity is dependent on the location and number of molecules that you put in there so it's not an art piece it is to basically say that if you have 65 000 sites on a surface i can put a defined number of molecules exactly where you want so if you zoom into any one of these pictures each point is a pixel which is a photonic crystal cavity so a suspended silicon nitride membrane and inside which you have a certain mode distribution for the electric field and depending on that i can decide where i need to put a particular molecule for a certain intensity of light to come out of that and by that i can pick and choose given an x y coordinate i can put a molecule and get it to interact uniquely with the photonic crystal cavity resulting a certain intensity of light that comes out not only can we put molecules exactly where we want we can actually even control the orientation well that means now and that that is all done it's the same uh underlying physics when the assembly is the same uh you can actually uh put uh you just change the shape of the origami and when you change the shape of the origami you can actually orient it in a particular direction and we have better a better alignment better efficiency and things of that nature and it allows us to do any interesting things wherein you're playing with the orientation of molecules here when you have in this this is a polarimeter where you have a 12 pronged wheel where in every prong has got an origami in a particular shape a direction and a dipole in a particular direction so when you change the intensity the the polarization of light only the ones where the uh the orientation of the molecules align with the excitation with that will it light up it's done in oil so it's used you see junk kind of floating around so it's 65 it's now it's 35 3500 molecules not only can we do it on a surface we can actually do it on photonic crystals as well you can change the orientation keep the x xy position same just change the orientation and control the interaction between the cavity and the molecules but all of this sounds good but the problem here is that everything is expensive doing this in a clean room is very expensive so you can actually do this you can make these kind of hexagonal grids but it's expensive so you can't use it for like high throughput it's like you can't do it as a mainstay within an experimental biophysics uh lab so the question was can we actually reduce the cost and can we do it for under a dollar without using it without ever getting into a creep and get the same same heat so what it turns out we can actually do this what you have to do is you take a surface you just put a poly a polystyrene layer on top of it and it self-assembles it when you get the right under the right conditions and you end up getting a periodic grid of uh uh microspheres uh and depending on the size of the sphere you have a certain periodicity and you can use that as a shadow mask to create a self-assembled layer self-assembled motor layer and regions where the origami can unite uniquely impact so it can act as a unique form of lithography and then what you're left with is is a protocol to basically make these kind of single molecule arrays and the cost of everything is less than a dollar so so so so this is this is reproducible extremely high throughput and and uh uh the yield slide you take a hit on the yield because the the quality of the uh uh lithography is not as good but you can get it's good enough for many of these experiments and so so what you end up ending up getting is traditionally single molecule optical acid looks sort of like this you know each of these spots is a particular molecule which has a fluorescent fluorophore on it and depending upon its you need to do a lot of analysis to basically figure out whether there is one or two and make sure that two molecules are not interacting with each other and things of that nature so that limits the amount of data that you can get but now what you can do is you can make grids like this so this is post-processed grid so these are each single pixel each and the point is a single molecule on which a certain assay is being done so you have a 50x improvement in the number of usable data points and this all costs less than a dollar to actually put a particular uh uh a particular substrate and these are all the same substrates on which traditional biophysical experiments are done so you can start doing like single molecule counting where you're counting the number of let's say zika virus in this particular case um because zika virus was hot when you're doing these experiments uh uh and we can do improve the super super resolution imaging on these settings uh we can also do like traditional temporal dynamics all of these the data the amount of data that you end up getting is way higher and all that is is is because the way in which you can actually combine different forms of self assembly q position single molecules at the specific location so that's it i want to thank the folks involved richard is my postdoc fantastic postdoc and and rosalind paul are my collaborators from arizona and cal tech and these are the folks who've been generous i mean during my time at caltech as well as my time here at mit so that said welcome questions good afternoon everybody um um i am peter so so i would like to tell you a little bit some of our work on developing novel microscopy for a number uh for the study of a number of disease since the time is sought originally my title in cool sickle cell disease and also cancer metastasis just to make the story a little bit simpler for the time that we have i will tell you mostly about sickle cell disease for many of you already know that sickle cell disease is a very common disease in the world about 200 000 children are born worldwide with it and they're about 100 000 patients in the u.s one of the um one of the uh complication of sickle cell disease is sickle cell patient even in advanced countries like us still have about 10 to 15 years certain life certain life expectancies as well as they have so-called vassal occupation crisis as is seen here for normal people that do not have sickle cell disease rapper cell flow through the capillary bed in uh in a normal way but during sickle cell crisis some of the cells due to deoxygenation and they sickle and they become more rigid and more sticky and they effectively caught up the vocabulary that of the patients and because of that patient feels significant pain today there are very few drugs um that are available to treat this disease hydroxyurea is one of the drugs that have been used for many decades right now we have two other drugs but none of them completely remove rascal occlusion crisis so today we have interest of developing method that would allow us to find biomarkers that would um that can be uh used on the blood obstacle cell patient such that we can develop more new drugs for this disease so in order to do that i want to tell you about a optical imaging method called interferometric microscopy that allow us to look for biophysical markers of sickle cell disease specifically the uh the part of the methodology that we developed is a method to measure the figuring of the red blood cell membrane that typically have amplitude fluctuation scale on the nanometer range and also very fast fluctuation on the millisecond time scale by measuring this type of fluctuation we can extract mechanical parameters that go back into a red butt cell model that allow us to extract theological parameter of the membrane of the sickle wrapper cell so we so we believe that some of those parameters would allow us to identify new biophysical markers but before i tell you about how we applied interferometric imaging in some of our study of sickle cell disease i want to tell you what is in the interferometric imaging so the idea is very simple if we have an object that have different refractive index than water for example the red blood cell when you have light wave going through the cell the wave fund might be distorted and the distortion of the wavefund is proportional to the if i know the refractive index is proportional to the height or the thickness of the red blood cell there are many ways to measure the wavefund distortion you can do a normal interferometry as shown here but what the way that we have developed is a much more stable method is called diffraction phase microscopy the idea is very simple we have the rapid cell sitting on the sample space and then we have light coming in illuminate the sample generate the plane wave and if we put a camera at what we say the gradient plane that would be just abnormal white light y field microscope instead of doing that we put in a grading at this point so that we generate two diffraction orders and one of them we do a spatial low pass filter so we generate a reference a plane wave fund that interfere with the signal from one of the order that generate what we call in the philogram and the change in the fringe pattern of the interferogram allow us to defuse the thickness of the red blood cell with nanometer actually sub nanometer scale sensitivity and so what we have done is apply this method to study blood from sickle patients as it turns out if you look at the blood from sickle patients they have different cell types and they have different densities you can first do a centrifugation and do a density fractionation you will find that typically we can separate the blood of the patient into four different fractions so the red bar corresponding to sickle patients that have four different fractions they are not on hydroxyurea one of the drugs that i mentioned earlier the green bar at the patient that on hydroxyurea you can actually you can't really tell a difference in the distribution there's no statistical significance there however if you look at a normal person that have no sickle cell disease typically for normal people they only have the lower density faction of one and two whereas there is no higher density fractions so one of the things that's very interesting if we so one of the reason that we density fractionate the cell first is because denser cells have more material we have higher effective index as i mentioned earlier in order to calculate the thickness of the cell i need to know its refractive index so using the density vaccination i can identify a population of the cells that have roughly the same average reflective index and then i can calculate for each fraction what are the fluctuations that i showed you a little bit earlier and we found that the more lower density fraction of the cell fluctuates more whereas the higher density cells fluctuate less that means that actually if we go back to the biomechanics model we found that the lowest uh density cell have lower shear modulus whereas the higher density cell has a higher shear modulus whereas the bending modulus are constant and the good thing about interferometric microscopy is we not only allow us to extract biomechanics co-parameter we also at the same time measure the shape of the cell so we have geological parameters for example we can measure the eccentricity how elliptical the cell is surface to warning racial the volume of the cells and you can see statistically except for the bending motors all four fractions are very different so if we take a look at patients that's our own drug versus off drug can we use this biophysical marker to look at the difference of them so as you can see here um all of them are statistical significant except for some of the uh measurement in the eccentricity so both the bio physical parameter like fluctuation and shear modulus and some of the morphological parameters lysa volume and surface to volume ratio we can for each faction statistically distinguish whether the patient the group of patient is on drug versus off drug so one of one of the questions that one might ask is how does this correlate with some of the mechanism of hydroxyurea works what what people postulate before is hydroxyurea most we work by increasing the fetal hemoglobin concentration of the patient so as it turns out for fetal hemoglobin the hemoglobin molecule do not have the the molecular defect of the sickle cells is only when when we become an adult adult hemoglobin have a subunit that have the defects so by increasing the fetal hemoglobin concentration one of the hypothesis is that it allow it allow the dilution of sickle hemoglobin but therefore it have lesser chance of having vascular occlusion crisis however if we take a look at the low um fetal to sickle hemoglobin racial versus the height which is the light brown versus the dark brown color you will find that for all four factions there is no statistical difference between the fluctuation or the modulus um on the other hand another parameter that people have also looked at that for a long time is the capucilla volume which effectively how big the cell is and in this case we found that um that is all in all 4k concentrations there are statistical difference for cells that have higher mcv they tend to have uh have a difference between whether patient is on drug or off drug so this is an interesting measurement um seems like biophysical marker provide better correlation with better patient is on drug versus off drug compared to some biochemical marker such as fecal fetal to sickle hemoglobin ratio so what are the limitations of the method that i showed you earlier one of the limitations is i need to fractionate the cell into four fractions one of the reason is because i need to know what is the refractive index of the cell itself in order to calculate the height and get the dimension so the thing that we would like to do is is there a method to improve our technique such that we can for individual single wrapper cell on a single cell basis measure not only the um the shape of the cell the biomechanic of the cell but also measure the refractive index of the cell and from there we can relate it to the concentration of hemoglobins in the cell so one of the method that we have developed i won't go into the detail of the math is in additional to mass we can measure the waveform distortion which is related to the refractive in that change i can also measure how much the light is transmitted through the cell which is related to absorption of the light by the hemoglobin so because the refractive index and co and extinction coefficient both is a concentration of hemoglobin so if i measure both the transmission of light the amplitude and the and the phase image i can simultaneously solve this set of equations and calculate on a single cell basis the concentration of the hemoglobin as well as the height of the cell and so this is the result the data that comes in uh the phase map and the amplitude map that we can get both from the defection phase microscope at a single shot basis from there we can on a single cell basis calculate the shape which is the height and also the concentration of the hemoglobin on this in the cell so right now what we could do is able to in an image of many cells for each of the cell now identify both the concentration and the volume and we can now also compare this type of measurement to some clinical measurements so right now so for typically when the sickle patient give blood so that the clinician can monitor the disease they they typically use a butt analyzer that gives an average measurement of what is the mole golden concentration on all the red cells in the sample as well as i mentioned mcb they give you the average size of the population which is the the mean value that is have been measured with the current clinical measurement but the good thing is with our new method we not only have the mean but we can measure the distribution and that potentially can provide a lot more new information so i would like to wrap up my talk um and i would like to say that such as quantitative phase microscope is a very promising method to look at individual patients rapid cell population and that allow us to extract biomechanical and morphological parameters and some of this biophysical marker appear to have better correlation with whether patient is on drug or off drug compared to some biochemical markers and so some of them might have potential use in screaming for new drugs and i would like to thank everyone that does the work most of the work are done by a graduate a former graduate student who yahoo cine and also a research scientist in the lab sahih yaku and have funding from nsf nih and other and other institutions thank you very much hello i'm tim swagger of department of chemistry and today i'm going to tell you about our work on liquid lenses for uh biosensing and what i'm showing on this first slide is something looks like a bunch of flying saucers it's actually showing a couple things ones that we can orient these droplets they are actually spheres but only half of them are are showing up because they're index matched the other side are index matched to the the continuous phase which is water and the reason we're interested in these types of systems really is drawn upon inspiration from nature so if you think about the fidelity which biology has to uh conduct you know molecular recognition know one cell from another really has to do with the fact that on the surface of a cell there are all these functionality here they're dynamic they move around the lipid bilayer here that you're showing the kind of compartment the inside versus outside of the cell is liquid crystalline it's very dynamic it's technically a fluid from physics standpoint so we've always been interested in how can we create sensors that really emulate these dynamics this ability to have things to cluster to come together in unique ways to create the same fidelity of interaction that is in a cell and do it in something that we can do sensor measurements with and so what we work with is creating things that don't really look like cells normally but they have similar dynamics and surface characteristics of cells and we're working with what fluid droplets in a water phase so what i'm showing here on the right are two are poly spurs they're different different sizes of of droplets the inner side that is uh in red is dyed red it's a hydrocarbon and the outer one is a fluorocarbon and we can make this with a variety of different liquids but in general these have surfactants on their surface that look a lot like these these lipid bilayers and they have the same fluidity and hence uh mechanics of the cell and so the way we can make these in in high precision is to use microfluidic devices uh you can you can you can buy these you can make a mini droplets a day you're making them kind of continuous so it's a continuous manufacturing method and we can make them monitor dispersed as i'm showing here over a range of different sizes now the way you control the structure of these droplets is you have to think about their surface tension in particular we're here we're emphasizing the surface tension with regard to water we have to sometimes worry about the internal surface tensions and i'll mention in just a moment but if you want the fluorocarbon to be on the outside what you do is you take a surfactant that looks like it has a little piece of teflon on the end which is the fluoropolymer and a polyethylene glycol which is a water-soluble polymer often used in biology and you put that into your water phase and it assembles on the surface and the fluorocarbon goes on the outside and you can see we get if we they're monodispersed we can basically make these nice little crystalline monolayer arrays just by letting the droplets settle in a petri dish or we could use a hydrocarbon surfactant and put the hydrocarbon on the outside now we can take mixtures of these two and we can create a continuum of different droplets and one of the things that's important is they're all round okay they are round because the dominant interfacial tension is between the water and the outside either the fluorocarbon shown here in the bottom or the hydrocarbon on the top and it turns out the fluorocarbon hydrocarbon mixture we're using in this case has such a low uh interfacial tension that it doesn't really mind having you know a bigger surface area here here on the left you see it has a very large surface area on the inside it doesn't mind that okay so we can keep everything perfectly round and just let the minimization of surface tension which ends up being a perfect sphere drive these shapes now another thing i'm showing here i'm showing that these droplets the fluorocarbon is always on the downside here and that's because fluorocarbons are denser than hydrocarbons so one of the things we're going to use in this is we use gravity alignment of all these droplets we can also do with magnetic alignment and that's the fact is how that first slide i showed on my my title slide was made but but we're going to use this gravity alignment here of our droplets and so if you take these droplets and you put them on a surface and you project light through them you take collimated light and you direct direct it through them you get a series of of ray diagram patterns as shown here this is work that was done in collaboration with my colleague matthias cola who's in mechanical engineering an expert in optics and his is a student sarah niagara who's the lead author on this paper but anyway we have these perfectly round droplets they all behave as lenses as you see the first three at the right here they're all have focusing conditions at different focal lengths and in fact as i showed you you can see this is very powerful because i show you those three uh droplets these are actually photographs of them if i were to show you those on flash cards i don't think you could probably tell the difference if i were to to show you them repeatedly they but they all have very different focal lengths so very small differences can get very large focal lengths now one i'm going to tell you about today that's actually relevant for just what i wanted to describe today is the one here number five and this is what we call the perfect janus and that's uh composed of droplets that have exactly equal interfacial tension between the hydrocarbon phase and water and the fluorocarbon phase in water that is we balanced it and we had one to one by volume of both of those fluids and so we get something that's just a perfect uh hemisphere that's half fluorocarbon and half hydrocarbon and when collimated light goes into it collimated light comes out and it will transmit images through it and so so we've made use of all these different optical properties here we can have again the perfect janus which will transmit an image as i've shown down here in the bottom the whole happy face looking out from underneath but if we basically uh change its morphology we can do that by having enzymatic reactions for example at the surface of these droplets uh we can get to this case the divergent of the light so we have defocusing optics and you can see that happy face is now not readable uh we can also take droplets and i'm going to tell you i'm going to focus today on this topic where we take droplets if we have them in this perfect janus state which again will transmit an image but if we can somehow bind them together and cause them to tilt or this is called agglutination we can get a highly scattering state and and up here at the top it's just showing some of the refractive indices that are necessary to get these things to work we have to match things uh uh properly with water but uh it turns out to be pretty easy to do uh just with fluorocarbon some hydrocarbons so how this can work now to create a sensor so if we take uh droplets and they tend to perfectly align as shown here in this this janus perfect janus droplet and we put them in we look down from a microscope up above uh we'll see that we won't we won't see the the the actual structure of this because we're looking from down above and remember they're they're perfectly aligned because of gravity and if we put them over the top of a qr code we can image the qr code we can image it with a smartphone however if we now throw in e coli now e coli uh we put a a sugar a mannose on the surface of these droplets and and e coli binds through what we call a polyvalent approach that is there are multiple connections between the e coli and the sugar molecules what you can do is you can bind the the droplets together so ordinarily if i didn't have e coli around i could basically tap this this this this this array of droplets they would tilt on their side but they would come right back again into their normal position but we have e coli around they get stuck together and they tend to scatter light and so that can cause the the qr code to be unreadable so this is a very simple way to detect bacteria it can also work to detect other polyvalent things such as antibodies or viruses they'll talk about at the very end now we can uh we can detect these with smartphone you can actually even count the number of these uh these agglutination events to get quantitative data so you can either do threshold or quantitative data now sugars are great but they're not as specific and so we're going on to make other types of sensors we link antibodies to our surfaces we use the conventional kind of close called a click reaction to attach these antibodies and we we confirm the antibodies are there by just using a fluorescent protein that binds generically to the stem of this antibody and you can see here that we get fluorescence indicating that indeed we can bio conjugate we can put things on the surface so we can do this we've used this to detect listeria we're using listeria anti-listeri antibodies and you can see now that without the stereo around they're all nice aligned but when we have the string around we see these dark areas and there's little round circles here or something that we've done through an automated image processing program that basically will count the number of these these events and we can get a calibration curve and get out you know limits detection you can see we get down under 100 uh colony forming units per uh milliliter or cell viable cells per per milliliter in this now this is this all works great but you look at these dark areas and say how do you know that's not just a piece of debris and so what we've been using now is to go and put in different optical methods particularly dies that can help us discriminate between when a droplet is really tilted on its side or glutinated and when it is a knot and so what we have here is i'm just showing you kind of schematic i'll show you the chemicals in a minute for those of you that are interested we put in uh two dyes one that is kind of like a we call blocker dye kind of a dark dye that doesn't absorb it i mean it doesn't emit light but it just absorbs light it absorbs light going through it absorbs light that might end up in the lower layer and try and re-emit light and so what happens is that just blocks everything and if you look at these with a microscope they don't show much color you might see a little orange bleed through it's one droplet here at the bottom but you don't see much of a color so if you look at it with an op with a bifurcated fiber optic doing fluorescent imaging you won't see much data or much signal however if we agglutinate them now by exposing these antibody labeled droplets to listeria we're going to tilt them on their side now you see that red dye is exposed and so we do this by basically creating dyes that have orthogonal solubility in this case we have one that a fluorescent dye that's only soluble in fluorocarbon uh i a other diet is only soluble in hydrocarbon and we we choose them so that their the absorption of the blocker dye overlaps uh the emission of the emissive dye and we we decide what wavelengths to to measure that by looking at ratios of their extinction coefficients and here on the lower right you can see that indeed when we put that block or die in we can lower the emission coming out of these uh droplets and so the way that these this works now just to show you kind of an animation so that we're all clear about this is we have antibodies on the surface of our droplets uh they're they're aligned with gravity but when listeria comes in and it wants to bind these it agglutinates them and you can see that they get turned on their side initially you can't see the red dye when looking at it from the top or or measuring the fluorescence from the top but now when they're glutenated you see that red dye exposing itself and so when we look at this with our fiber optic assembly we see an increase in the fluorescence with the e coli with the excuse me the listeria concentration in this case and we can get calibration curves that now are getting us uh down to again a similar ballpark of of a hundred colony forming units per per milliliter and very rapid tests for listeria so this is actually very useful for for processing for food processing where you might want to determine in rapidly if you have listeria in your food before you send it off to grocery stores and this is actually a real problem there aren't technologies that are efficient enough and fast enough to make this happen uh so we can do this from the top as i've shown you before here but we could also switch things around and do it from the bottom where we switch these dies up and put you know the the blocker die on the bottom and the other die on the top and this has the advantage if you're going to go through turbid solution so remember the diet the droplet's going to sink to the bottom so this way we won't have to go through a bunch of solution to get our fluorescence signals out any this is just a plot showing you works just as well as the other way and so we can do this now in very complicated highly scattering media so just in summary we have invented these liquid lens systems that have high fidelities to create ultra sensitive biosensors so the detection limits we have here in terms of the rate the limits of detection are basically best in class they have really high fidelity they basically you know emulate cells and so you're not putting things on you know non-compliant surfaces uh they're also through the agglutination method it's capable of detecting viruses and antibodies both which have the same sort of multi-point or multivalent types of associations and we have now transferred this to uh basically make covet 19 antibody tests with limits of detection of 0.2 micrograms per per milliliter which is uh considerably below what you would express if you basically have been exposed this disease and developed antibodies so this has ordered a magnitude of of of sensitivity beyond what you need and we think this could have uh clinical relevance uh in the future so uh one of the special things that about mit is the people i mean perhaps the most special thing is the people and i've been fortunate to be able to have a really a talented and large group of co-workers this is a research group proper here shown on left in front of the state house and then also my my most valued colleague and collaborator matias kola and his student sarah are shown at the right and so with that i'd like to thank you for your attention and look forward to the panel discussion ashwin and peter and tim thank you very much um so we're giving our speakers a chance to walk out of their virtual uh stage and join us on the on the on stage together um while we're doing that let me just share with you the the answers or my answers to the questions of when did the first microscope uh come into existence the first microscope happened way back in in 1590 uh some folks that were developing lenses for optical lenses for sight um combine them together to be able to have the very first microscope but the first microscope was not used to see anything at the really small scale until maybe 1675 where the first bacteria were actually observed and you can see the mechanical translating the little knobs the mechanical buttons that are on this uh the schematic of the of that very early microscope um now much much much later we started using electrons instead of just light to image that gave us the ability to see things at smaller scale and so the first tunneling electron microscope came about in about 1931 and then about a decade later later the scanning electron microscope that gave us now sub micron resolution 50 nanometer resolution and in a more modern uh version of that you can see a a a hermite holding on to a strand of hair on a person's body so the first microscope's a deep and reach rich history now the the first image of dna um happened in 1952 this was called photo 51 it's basically it took 60 hours to generate the image and used a technique of an electron beam passing through a dna sample and scattering that beam to create an interpretable an image that was interpretable to reveal the structure of the of the dna um so with that now i think our panelists are are are waiting and um i'll welcome them back um ashwin and peter and and tim uh thank you very much for your your very captivating talks and so um participants i know we have some questions that have been coming through i'm trying to synthesize a couple of them um i will direct questions variously at the individual speakers and then maybe some for the group together to get some conversation started um but if there's a first question that i'll ask of ashwin um in this area of of self-assembly um what are the opportunities to actually have multiple molecules being assembled together or are we only constrained to use a single molecule or can we start to stack things together like legos and combine them in interesting ways so so the short answer is yes you can do it um and there are a lot of different ways in which one could actually do that um but uh as you increase the number of uh molecules that you're gonna try to put together the error rates kind of go up in in a certain variation of error rates go up so um currently there are papers that are trying to take let's say three molecules three of these uh origami structures for instance putting it together and making slightly larger structures and the uh the larger limit is something in the vicinity of like i think 64 or maybe even larger specific structures uh but the errors kind of you know it needs to be worked out so the short answer is yes you can do it but the longer answer is there are there are still you know kinks to be worked out technical things to be worked out but there is no reason why we can't actually go like solve it and just make much larger structures that are uniquely uh addressable all right very good thank you um so actually i'll take the the next question um to to peter as a question that came in on i'm just out of curiosity the the impact of transparency on on cells and actually the the more narrow question was are are all cells transparent um how important is it to have transparency in in being able to tease out all these various properties of the cells yeah um so the answer is the cell is not fully transparent because of the fact that i have been talking about sickle cell so i'm looking at red blood cells so hemoglobin actually i the property that i use are the refractive index that's assuming that's not looking at how fast the light moving through the cell which is related to the density of the material but i have been also looking at the amplitude of the information to allow me to extract the mobile concentration in that case i am assuming some absorption so the extension coefficient measures the absorption of the hemoglobin going through the cell so so in typical biological system most single cells except something that id bands that have a pigment like hemoglobin they are very transparent um but on the other hand they always have a refractive induction very good thank you peter um the the question uh that was coming in on um with for tim that i'll first ask um just uh maybe a clarifying point um so with the the janus lenses and this approach of imaging you're not changing the shape of the the lens or the micro fluidic lens it's more the the orientation of the lens is that correct yeah in in the things i showed today that is correct but we have a number of other assays we developed that actually make use of that i alluded to an enzymatic reaction that uses it but we can also do other molecular recognition and we get confinement effects uh and you know total internal reflection inside the the different phases and and other things like that but uh we do both but today i focus mainly on just orientation of them without changing their internal structure very good thank you uh so let me turn this maybe a broader question um to um to the three of you um in terms of looking at the perspective maybe in situ of of single molecule sensing in a flow setting whether it's in the body or outside of the body how do these techniques uh various imaging or characterization techniques um translate to a scenario where the cell is not stationary and moving in some way is there opportunity there maybe i'll take the first step i i mean um single cell if you can do a labeling in in the body you can detect it in the blood vessel and a number of techniques have been developed by the master's choices general hospital group on doing some of this sort of work but looking at single molecule is probably a little bit more challenging uh both single molecules work uh uh on external to the body in many ways and in that case if you can label it it's not a big issue um if i mean even doing it in front it's not a major issue that's almost you have pray enough ashwin or or tim any any any concepts on on how your sort of approaches and and discussions today could be used um in a flowing uh scenario well in vivo i think it's gonna be as peter was saying you know you know laboratory stuff yeah but in vivo is is really difficult to imagine how you you might do that but but certainly in very controlled environments i think you can do it but but in the in the body that's that's a big dream yeah so so um in the body i mean again i i mean i i second everything that timothy said uh uh it's sort of um you know if you want to put origami in the body or if you make a sensor with with the origami kind of uh adding specificity do it in a control setting totally do uh but putting it in the body it's going to be challenging there are ways that one could think of it not easy we are far from it so yeah so so small steps as as we as we figure out before we start to do it in real time and in live um yeah so i might also add that i think that one of the recent call for proposal from the secretary foundation is actually not as ambitious as what you want to look at single molecule in the body but they want to go as deep as they can beyond whatever we can do and just to follow single cell if one can actually do that i think that would be already be a pretty big pretty big breakthrough if one can actually study single cells very deep in the body so not necessarily flowing but just being able to see uh inside the body and characterize my pro and they might migrate right i think that's why it is interesting to look at individual cells so if one can imagine looking at white blood cells that are in some cancer solid tumor deep inside would be interesting um right now most of the model kind of expose the tumor and or put an animal put it in the surface so you can get to some depth but not in a really in-situ setting very good thank you another broad question here was um i think it may have been a directed to an individual speaker but i'll ask it a little more broadly but you know the the how could these various approaches be used to characterize the um the proteins on the surface of cells so the g proteins that sort of control how we're interacting with things outside or inside of the cell how can we sort of characterize that cell surface phenomenology or chemistry uh with these these various approaches well so maybe i i can i can do that so we've done things not exactly like that but we have aspirational dreams to look at those but we we certainly can uh if you change surface tensions by having things either cluster or or expand you change the morphology of the cell and basically one of the things we can do is we have the ability to kind of open up little apertures that let light in or out of our droplets and so you can do uh things like that with these droplets through a change in morphology so what one of the one of the advantages of origami is the fact that it's made out of dna and one can think of basically combinatorically putting ligands on the origami at specific orientations at specific locations and doing kind of like a binding assay and then reading it out by sequencing to kind of figure out what are the organization of ligands and uh like clustering of surface receptors that would be harder to do in a traditional setting at least especially in a really high throughput fashion so because of the fact that everything is built out of dna and you can actually tag specific locations of the origami one can imagine a way in which you can do uh these microscopy prop like changing these kind of microscopy traditional microscopy problems into a sequencing problem so efforts in this direction is coming out of pong's lab over at harvard but that's just the beginning there's a whole bunch of other things that one can think of there and the the question of like gpcr itself uh the you can do uh tagging of the origami with let's say little nanodiscs that carry a gpcr or a particular kind of receptors and then you can actually you know figure out what is what kind of binding is occurring and things of that nature there are inklings of this work kind of starting up but there is it's it's open there's why what there's a there's a large slew of questions that one can ask that using this as a tool very good thank you um another broad question it was originally directed at um i think um tim swagger um but in terms of the the sensitivity of the microlens in particular but but broadly as you talk about the the sensitivity of these various approaches you know what is their spatial temporal limit and are they reversible and i'll put that question first to tim in terms of the sensitivity the micro lens in terms of the minimum concentration that can of bacteria cells that can be detected and then once the the tilting happens does it untilt if the bacteria goes away is it reversible yeah yeah so uh so first of all we can i think we can get down to a um you know bacteria detection it's it's more about time and how you know i think when you're getting the single one you got to find the droplet it's just they're they just have to find each other and uh and and uh that's that's that's what takes a lot of time sometimes but i would say in terms of when you get to really high sensitivity usually what you're needing is a really strong binding event like an antibody antigen binding event which you know by most cases unless you're profile you're finding some sort of mechanical or or some sort of uh energy to cause it to dissociate is going to be largely irreversible i mean it's like a bond right so they're bound tight enough and they may even be bound through multiple locations once they get on there so uh when we get to a really high sensitivity type of sensors they're they're dosametric they're essentially irreversible unless we you know you could maybe use high shear or things like that to cause them and we have done things have seen that but by and large we treat them as irreversible kind of dosymetric signals but the good thing is these the droplets the things we're using basically cost nothing i mean the containers you're using cost more than the fluids you're using just you know you know sub microliters of fluids and water and surfactant just you know you know some you know just very you know sub nanogram quantities of of surfactants and uh recognition elements and so the cost is nothing so you really kind of use them as kind of disposable one use types of sensors you don't really think about them as being reusable any comment on sort of on sensitivity or sort of the repeatability of of the sensing measurement technique either ashwin or or peter yeah so i think all the different techniques uh all three of us have talked about very different techniques and certainly sensitivity are also very different so the technique that i talk about sensitive on the almost 10 pico meter scale so if i want to look at the formation of things i can see that uh very accurately and very fast so so one of the applications is in biomechanics and in just to link back to some of what team have been talking about there are some idea that we have not pursued of looking at uh protein binding to surfaces and from there cause of his tension change and we might be able to detect it very sensitively based on the high spec high height height displacement sensitivity that we have so uh um the the everything that we are doing we are just basically taking existing um highly sensitive uh detectors be it like surface plasmon or you know micro ring resonator there's a lot of single molecule sensitivity sensors that are nano fabricated and it's available the designs are available the problem is basically making it specific to actually have a putting a capture site exactly in the hot zone wherein the the sensing actually occurs and that's the problem that we are trying to solve with it's solved so now the big question is to kind of pull uh like to do to increase the amount of multiplexity so that you can actually simultaneously be looking at let's say a hundred different kinds of molecules all of them uh at single molecule uh sensitivity but with specificity as well that's one arc of problems the other one is trying to take ideas from dna nanotechnology when you're constructing exquisite little uh constructs wherein you act as a molecular transducer when you're you're looking at molecular interactions and those those interactions leading to a measurable cmos signal be it electrical optical whatever else so you have on the surface exactly where you want some kind of molecular event occurring be that just two proteins interacting with each other when they're close to each other it has a certain signal further away it has another signal so something like that sitting on top of a transistor of the transistors or turn off on off characteristics is going to change depending upon whether the two proteins are close to each other or not so now it becomes a real-time measurement of trying to use protein-protein interactions that's useful for things like drug discovery and stuff like that but there are it's basically you know once you solve the problem of how to connect the molecular world specifically to a detector then it you're left to the creativity of how you actually what are the molecules that you put on top of it and what are the questions that you can ask from there so that's what we are focusing on very good thank you um so ask one question and sort of pose this to each of you uh it's an interesting question the way that it's posed um are the technologies your various approaches um translatable to the real life but specifically can we just use dirty examples can we use dirty samples or how purified of a of a of a bacteria or cell or material do we need to be looking at or can we take a real world sample and directly characterize or how do we sort of make what's that translation step to make it um applicable to those to those dirty samples i'll i'll start uh so we we do have a startup on the droplets and one of the things that's actually uh we first did is before we we got enough confidence to go forward we went to the to the usda and did a test of salmonella and chicken wash so chicken wash you take a chicken with salmonella and you put it in a bag and you mix it all up and if you put your hand in that it's greasy gross stuff you know and so the concern i had was gee you know this there are proteins that behave like surfactants here couldn't this mess everything up well you know we have a lot of fluorocarbon in there and the fluorocarbon phase has nothing to do with the the biology they really just do not interact and so that tends to give us uh really the ability to do things in pretty you know i would say uh confounding or you know you might call dirty is what the question was environments and so we you know we found that our methods will work in dirty samples and we are working to commercialize it for me it's a easy answer because most of the work that we have done that i described in this talk is doing sickle cell disease so i wouldn't call it dirty but they are patient blood so they are but that withdrawn our clinician collaborated drawn by patients so they are real work sample or violation sample and and clean or dirty i think but they are real they are as clean or as dirty as they should be so so in in in our case we've got the organization of the origami basically down to we've pushed it about as far as we can get within an academic setting and we are trying to basically get that out into the foundries to basically try to see if we can automate auto optimizes so to be able to actually put single molecule binding sites on top of transistors or other kind of detectors or just on an array and then it's just a question of what are the kind of biochemistries that you put on that spot to make it useful and we are exploring that so i would say we are close but i wouldn't say it it depends upon what you're going to put at on those sites like for instance if you put antibodies on those sites it becomes useful for protein detection you can do single molecule counting there you could put you know you could make other variations and themes and variations of that that flavor of sensors the question is what is the what what what what is it going to give us and that's a question that we are exploring right now at the same time that we are scaling up and just basically trying to get these kind of single molecular arrays done in a non-academic setting uh and very good thank you the real world limitations and opportunities of of characterizing and measuring at the cell and sub-cell level uh ashwin peter tim thank you very much uh for getting us through the the very first session and participants thank you for your questions you
