 uh we also have uh recording is on oh  i was okay recording recording is on show time um so maybe every before i  start with my like formal presentation   maybe everybody can briefly introduce themselves  to me because i haven't i haven't got to know you   yet just like with one sentence we i see we also  have shouting fun here she is from ntcri hello maybe king you king hello hello so this project  we work with taiwan national craftsmanship center nice to meet you i heard a lot  about your center from above tonight yeah um so how about you just give me a call  when you think i should start with my kind of   presentation but again i would like if everybody  who is now in the in the talk would just briefly   say hi to me so i know i'm  not talking to kind of a wall   of the internet so i'm a bit aware of  that there is some people listening   uh maybe maybe uh yeah i know a fairy uh ferris  star and uh li min chong do you do you want to say   hi to mark just to motivate me a bit job hello  hi parker hello we just need a moment because   everything takes time to delay on the internet  so everything is slower to enter the conversation   um i live in miami i i'm looking  forward to hearing from you thanks i just know first time she studies the volume  i'm also interested in her field oil yeah i don't know that word petrol that's wrong  maybe go to you just give me a you tell   me when i should start about uh okay and we  also have a weighty lian here he just got in   he's he's an indigo indigo dying  artist from taiwan right now very good yeah welcome um i think  we have enough people to get started   okay please some opening word about yeah i just  i know i knew market in china once incentive and   it was his organization it was his event he  organized this event called gosh gathering a   open science hardware so that's how i met him and  then i knew i knew as a normatic a workshop piece   anyway he's he also he's going to show us some  nano switch play but uh i'm more interested in his   journey and his friendship all over the world he  kind of had built this network or friendship zone   by sharing knowledge and he took me to many places  and i'm very happy to have him here to share his   personality and everything thanks um i  will try to share as much as possible   um yeah so hello everybody as about said my name  is mark um just a briefly what how i was seeing   this presentation is that i will introduce also  myself and a bit my practice within the hectare   network because it's related also to i think  this project so one third will be an overview of   of my activities and this hectarea open source  biological art network and another third is like   going a bit more specifically into some nano  hacking some experiments we have been doing   like using this hacking mindset and do-it-yourself  mindset also for nanotechnology and the other   third is your part so whenever i say something  and you don't understand and you want to know more   please raise your hand and abba will then  maybe stop me and we can maybe look at one   detail a bit in more depth or we can also  maybe translate a few things that i say   in chinese um i will go very very fast so the idea  is just i give you a very rough and fast overview   of some activities i've been involved and projects  so that we can then pick one or two later and go   in more depth um the ones you are interested the  most also this should give you kind of an overview   of some projects that i i was involved also some  expertise i have so in the upcoming couple of   months when you continue on the project i'm happy  to assist as an advisor if someone has an idea   about some material science or nano technology  issues you know you can also just call me   with some whatever call my contact should be  somewhere on the on the heck that that was sharing   um did you understand this kind of framework so  one third of the presentation or at least one hour   should be moderated by you people like saying that  i want to know more about this and then i can go   deeper and explain something in more detail um  so i start and also i have two screens you see   there's only one person that is called mark that's  me but you see if you click on the right windows   you see another mark you see that just not  your head um i will use one now to share the   to share my site and on the other one you  will still see my face and a bit later in   the in the presentation i will also show you  some experiments that i have here on the table yeah good i'm sorry i  started sharing my screen now um so you should see the opening slide  and it's up to you if you want a full   screen on the slides or if you want  to see all the other faces um so   one thing i'm really enthusiastic  about is what i call the laboratory   um what is a laboratory can someone give me one  word that comes to your mind when i say laboratory   hello great the first thing that comes  to your mind when i say laboratory tools experiments what else mouse very good i show  this photo specifically because i don't i i really   don't want to focus on the tools or on the on  the experiments we're doing there or also the   like mouse we have here i think the core thing  of a laboratory is the people that work in the   laboratory so the laboratory is just a pla it's a  place of labor labor means work and the laboratory   is where people work together using a shared set  of tools techniques knowledge and so forth so the   laboratory is a place where we work together  it's not um it's not the equity it's the place   where people are and because of the projects maybe  complexity you have to have a group of people and   on this photo you see mostly women working in  the laboratory from the middle age alchemists   and so we have to focus the laboratory and all  this i think it's part of this project as well   it's not so much about the specific experiment you  do during the hff it's about having friends in the   future it's about the people that fill this void  this laboratory with thoughts with experiences   with human beings i'm good sorry mark what is the  name of that painting do you know i don't know um i think i just googled like alchemists or  alchemist laboratory and i found this this   painting um good question i should put i should  figure that out so this comes from the middle age   alchemists like before the scientific revolution  um what i also like about this painting is that   there is a window in the back so the laboratory  is open the the public can see what these   alchemists are doing inside and they had a strong  idea of open windows in the alchemist laboratory   you know why not only because the people  can see it's just to not poison themselves   so there's like some anticipation um in the  new laboratories it's quite close and so we   with this kind of art and transdisciplinary  laboratory as the one i'm sitting here at the   moment i think this openness toward the public  audience towards the general public is crucial   um so this is a photo of myself um that's  me um i'm involved in many projects   um one project is hectaria this is kind of a bit  the framework where i'm presenting this today   and another group is the swiss mechatronic art  society it's kind of a makerspace uh community of   electronic artists geeks and nerds that we run  a space here in zurich um and what about already   mentioned i'm also involved with a lot of global  kind of organizations and networks and organizing   meetings and conferences like the one inch where  we met the gathering for open science hardware   i'm also building synthesizers i have a company  called the center for alternative coconut research   and some of the stuff i show is by my close  friend and collaborator gowdylabs which is   another laboratory in switzerland that wars is  doing a lot of um hardware development and we work   very closely together abba has already visited his  laboratory and he said it's even better than cern   um this is like my first laboratory that i  have been involved it's a house i luckily   own in switzerland in the mountains i  call it randalab it runs on solar power   there is a toilet in the forest no running water  and what you maybe see if you look very closely on   the photo is there is a group of people again the  laboratory is not the equipment it's the people   that that fill it with life and thoughts and this  was a typical event in randolph there's people   from indonesia nepal south africa and switzerland  so i think a lot of this has been to connect and   travel globally and bringing interesting people  together that share a similar enthusiasm on let's   say transdisciplinarity hacking art and social  activities um what is this the strange yellow room anybody has an idea what this is these people um so in the in the years of 2000 to 2005  i was doing research in a kind of material science   laboratory specifically in a nanotechnology  laboratory so you see this laboratory looks   totally different again you see these people  um has anybody an idea why it's so yellow   avoid the uv light very good um exactly so  some of the process that we have been working   with in this nano technology laboratory they're  very um sensitive to blue light to uv light   and so there's a lot of filters  in there so the normal lighting   is more in this like yellow reddish  wavelengths talking about nano do you know what is the wavelength of blue light anybody oh tough question tough question in fact wave like the visible light that  we see it has a specific wavelength that's   kind of you know how many meters it is from  one bump to the next valley to the next hill   and in fact blue light is about 400 nanometer  or 450 it doesn't matter the numbers so we   talk nanometer when we talk about blue light we  already talked about nanotechnology we talk about   light that has a wavelength uh in the range  of 400 500 nanometers and uv light what we're   just discussing before has a lower wavelength  maybe 300 maybe 250. so in our daily practice we   talk a lot about nanotechnology when we talk about  colors for example and this is a bit kind of the   ideas i want to give with you nanotechnology  is not something out of our human experience is   something in our daily life and we have been doing  it since the beginning of humanity but of course   working in a nanotechnology laboratory myself  i was trained there i did my my research of my   phd there um it is a strange place um because  why do i wear this protective suit not because   i protect from my myself from this dangerous  nanotechnology no i have to protect the stuff   i work with from humans and so we have we emit  so much crap all the time we sweat we stink   uh there is when we when we speak there is rumors  about all these particles that move out of our   of our mouth like we talk about it a lot  at the moment because of its corona kind of   aerosols so in a nanotechnology laboratory  we want to protect our experiments from human   interference that's why we work this protective  suit so it's not to protect us but it's protect   our materials because one single breath  emits thousands or millions of nanoparticles   i am a smoker so my breath even contains much  more of these small particles and of course if   i work on a length scale of a few nanometers let's  say if i make a computer chip and there is just a   small piece of dust on my production it will not  work so that's why we wore this strange clothing   as i said feel free to interrupt me i'm  happy to tell more stories um so in fact what   what was my maybe driving motivation for doing  this kind of nanotechnology research was to cross   different disciplines i'm from engineering  specifically from material science but i was   interested to also bridge and work with other  other disciplines in the university research i   want to work with biologists with engineers people  manufacturing and so forth and so since this time   in nanotechnology i was really enthusiastic how  can we work together with different backgrounds   and nanotechnology is exactly where there  is no more disciplines and that's kind of a   inspiring moment for me to find out that if  we look at something on a very small scale   we will not see a difference between biology  between physics between chemistry and so forth   specifically i've been working on the interface  um an interface is where two different worlds meet   so the interface of a material this is a piece  of metal or a piece of glass and the living well   which is usually liquid it contains proteins it  contains cells and so forth so my research was   studying this interface where the engineered  material reacts or interacts with the living world   and to understand this interface we have to  look at the atomic scale we have to look at   the molecular scale we have to look at  the microscopic object um examples of   these interfaces are if you put something in your  body like an implant a screw in your bone another   interface is if you put a contact lens in your  in your eye um so something will happen something   will interact and it's not that the metal  interacts with the body there is a lot of layers   of molecular interactions that we have to look  at and in the end it is molecules that interact   on many different length scales but also on  many different time scales and just interrupt me   and um i have a few examples also on the desk here  that i can show you later this stuff um you know   if you do research in a kind of experimental  research laboratory it's not that i can   buy something and do an experiment i have to  build the experiment myself i have to build the   equipment to do an experiment that has never been  done before so in fact maybe the image you have of   a research laboratory nanotechnology looks really  fancy all these high-tech stuff but in reality we   have to build our own equipment because we do  an experiment no one has done so the diy method   in certain disciplines are very normal i  i was grinding stuff i was you know gluing   stuff together to build this experimental setup  to test my my kind of new processes this is   maybe something people don't don't get it so the  experimental research can be very do it yourself   uh with all the problems that you have like you  know the glue will not stick and stuff like that   um specifically i was looking at the interface of  how cells like living living tissue like a part of   a body like flesh interacts on a piece of plastic  so i can grow these cells to make kind of a   burger in a petri dish um while we were  studying the very micro scale interactions   molecular interactions and so forth and  what i was personally doing was developing   manufacturing processes like do-it-yourself  manufacturing to make experiments   how to study this interaction in three dimensions  so the cell like the human body and each cells in   us are three-dimensional beings so we have also  to create an environment for them to grow that   is three-dimensional so it was a lot of like you  know making small holes using high-end equipment   replicating them in polymers and plastics  coating them with different colors made   out of proteins and so forth and then using  mostly microscopy to study these interactions   and you know this allowed me that on a  microscopic scale i have control over   the areas on the nanometer scales where certain  molecules are present which then lead interaction   with living cells so they grow in specific  patterns it's not so visible in this photo   but maybe you can see that there is a two  letters an n and a w um this is like some   kind of acronym so i can make cells grow  in specific places having certain shapes   so this is a bit what i was doing and this needs  kind of microscopic control of another molecular   interactions why good questions this we have to  leave for another discussion um but some outlook   at that time like from 2005 that if we grow like  living tissue like parts of humans like organs a   bit of liver a bit of heart a bit of brain if we  grow it on a chip are you still here by the way yeah yeah i need i just saw i need to plug in my  power but if we're able to grow certain organs   outside of the body we can maybe replace the human  or the animal to do experimentation on so we don't   need the laboratory mouse but we have kind of a  artificially grown mouse-like creature on a chip   that responds similar to let's say if we wanted  to check for drugs or toxins and so forth so that   was the outlook from 2005 this still is gonna like  happen in some kind of a future but some of this   stuff is real so i have stuff here i don't know  if you can see this i turn the camera a bit around i don't see anything i can't can you see this now on  the open camera not on the sides no no okay am i still here with this second camera  so does anybody has a question i tried   to start the second camera  again i think it shut down why the light was yellow not great yellow is kind of you know  it's already on the red side so   if we remove blue from the rainbow we end up  with yellow because we still have a bit of   green yellow and red so do you you know  what i mean so means it's safer i mean   you know just some some of the stuff as you  said correctly if it's exposed to ultraviolet   or blue light it will change its properties  and so we just don't want that kind of   blue light we're going to get developed or  something you know for example photography   developers um so i'm i'm if you want to  briefly maybe look at the second camera   you can click on the image where  you see like stuff lying around are you there look at slides yeah so we should  go uh yeah i saw it yeah so you can you can you   know switch to another camera view you see  some blue and you see for example this chip   and in this chip we can grow like living  things like cells or brains to record   stuff from them so this is kind of a interface  between the electronic world and the living world   and it's maybe i know it's maybe difficult to  see but inside there is some computer tip and   outside there's a ring so we can put some drop  of liquid inside and in this liquid there will   be proteins there will be maybe brain cells and so  forth so this is kind of nano technology because   this interface that i mentioned before is very  crucial this molecular area between the electrodes   and the living world this is where the  interaction happens and if we want to   measure something on our with our technology  we have to understand this nanometer layer   between our engineered surface and the big  living world out there which might be a cell   so so this that hole captures micro  voltage yes even smaller i think   okay one electrically we can measure ultra  ultra small stuff that's not even the problem   the measuring of electronics is not difficult  but that interface to see and control what's   happened there have it stable over time that is  let's say the biggest challenge why so many legs i didn't understand why so many pings   it's cool i don't know these are standard packages  maybe not all of them are used actually it looks   like a bit like this all the heat warms  with this yeah but here you put brain yeah i'm sure it's like a different  like you know application   the same technology but a different layout and  this is a similar technology but do it yourself so that's a bit what i what i need now when i  continue um if there is no question about this   background of nanotechnology i would like to  go into the kind of other story are you ready very good um i put this camera here again um i can't do it but it is a bit down yeah so um i continue you  see my slides and so after finishing with my my   research in nanotechnology through  my interesting culture and music and   interdisciplinarity i kind of shifted and  went even further into other disciplines i was   interested in electronic experimental music and so  we started a kind of community and a hacker space   called the mecca lab in 2006. so of course this  looks now very different so suddenly i i leave   these high-end laboratories and i started building  kind of maker spaces with friends with artists   with creatives with musicians  that like experimental music so   since then we have this kind of active community  and in fact now since a few weeks we have a new   laboratory that i was involved in setting  up dedicated to the hectaria open source   biological art projects and networks in our new  space this is where i'm sitting at the moment   so i really like laboratories on the lower part  of the image you see the whole space at the   shared space as a hacker space collective  with different organizations with with like   a makerspace with like a digital kind of computer  research lab with a woodworking lab but also a bio   nano chemical experimentation laboratory and it's  the first time we have a space dedicated for this   um i don't know how much you have about  this bio hacking or do-it-yourself biology   but for more than 10 years  there has been a global movement   of hackers makers and creatives to not only work  with let's say electronics or with computers but   to also work with bacteria and with genetics as a  creative medium outside of the formal institutions   um building a biological laboratory also for  genetic experiments it's much easier than you   think it looks more or less like a kitchen a  lot of the equipment it's relatively cheap to   to buy on ebay on earlier alibaba or  you can make the equipment yourself so we started a project called hectaria  in 2009 um which brought together the   ideas of this biohacking and do-it-yourself um  movement brought it together also with a more   kind of creative and critical and artistic  approach so it's kind of artists working with   biologists and hackers working with teachers  and because it's our foundation with andy   gracie and yasha shetty we had a strong  foot in india where we found the bacteria   it's a friend of mine who works at  our school in bangalore in india   so also of course what we have to do if we want  to work on biology or nanotechnology outside the   institution we have to build our own laboratories  and building a laboratory it's kind of a crucial   step to take ownership of your experiments  and of your skills instead of just going to   a finished place i think building a laboratory  together is a very nice process to go through   our first project was looking into kind  of this do-it-yourself space biology   research how can life survive in outer space  conditions um we kind of made um somehow   we tried to mimic um the light and magnetic fields  of jupiter or something like this these are poetic   projects so they're not research projects they're  artistic poetic projects and our friends in india   started to teach a course on genetics called  synthetic biology for artists and designers   at the same time and we all came together and  thought we should start a project called hectaria   that should teach creatives artists designers  makers teachers on on these modern tools   of biology of the life sciences um of course  experimenting with different ways of communication   we make graffiti to explain how can we can make  a bacteria genetically modified so it emits light and personally i added a project to this kind  of knowledge a starting point that we can also   build equipment for doing microscope microscopy  a microscope is maybe one of the crucial tools   to see in the small world so one step towards the  nanometer towards nano to towards nanotechnology   is building tools that makes a sense that  makes us feel makes us see these phenomena   on another length scale that is not possible  to kind of perceive with our human senses   and a lot of science is about this instrumentation  to extend our human sense and so building   microscope was my hobby for a long time already  and i have done a lot of workshops on using a   cheap webcam a three dollar webcam and turn it  into a useful microscope to be able to see single   cells uh yeast cells or many other things of your  body and this made me travel around the world   developing different methodologies for the  workshop different setups for the microscopes   and creative uses of this scientific instrument  the microscope to use it in a sound performance   using for vting and so forth and doing these  workshops in india it was very inspiring to   see that there is this culture of do it yourself  to use like a limited resources but to come up   with some kind of innovations or solutions um  which is a project that is not called hacking   it's a provides up an approach that is called jew  god these are these kind of self-made cars with   from people that usually have no training as a  as a mechanic but they somehow manage to to build   a car out of stuff they find somewhere on the  somewhere um so the do-it-yourself the do god the   hacking these are all the different approaches on  how i personally um try to approach new projects   so jugaad is this very kind of rough do  it yourself you find leftover things and   there is an example from from our like  10 years ago where we built something   it's called a thermocycler it's something  that can heat and cool very very precisely   it's a important tool for every laboratory for  genetics it's called polymerase chain reaction   thermocycler and what we see on the top this is  just a hair dryer and an arduino that controls   the temperature of our sample and on the bottom  side you see that for people like gowdylabs   they have developed these rough projects into  products that are now sold and used in in schools so feel free to interrupt me um i should  go a bit faster these kind of projects   building synthesizers building microscope um  i got invited also to indonesia to taiwan and   other places and i've from 2008 to 2015 i've  done a lot of international collaborations   making this very do-it-yourself workshops on  on scientific equipment on working with biology   but also in electronics another photo of like  a micro microscope so when we use a microscope   we suddenly see animals that we don't see by eye  and this is by the way a tardigrade it's also the   logo of the hectoria project having a  strong idea of sharing and open source   so one method of sharing because it's not like  digital code that we can copy it's not open source   that you just can copy my file it's knowledge  that we want to produce as open source so we have   to write instructions we have to go physically  to places and teach people on how to do stuff   with the hope that they take this knowledge  change it adapt it and develop it further   open source is not about copying something  it's about taking existing knowledge   and adapting it to your own needs improving it  and sharing that knowledge back into the original   source or community and this was happening so  building microscopes our indonesian partners   have developed like more microscopes to be used at  their university um they have you know developed   a product out of it and that's the best thing  that can happen if someone takes an idea in an   open source community and develops it further and  even sells a kit out of it your job's done because   someone else has continued the project it's much  better than keeping the knowledge for yourself   open source design also allows that there is many  different versions of something and maybe one   school in one place prefers this way of doing  it because they have this and that material   available while another place has other materials  available so having an open source community it is   much more robust to that the knowledge can be used  in different setup settings um i think i have to   go a bit faster um so i just skip a few things we  have a website we have a wiki um for more than 10   years where we kind of put all these knowledges  inside where we document rough prototypes it's   not finnish stuff it's just like notebooks that  we share with many oops something happened there   rejoin um does anybody have a question  to what i have been just showing hello too much information um for me yeah but but i think some yeah  you show me some show us some equipment   to proceed in to perceive the  information in different dimensions   but it's interesting but uh  we don't know the application as uh-huh so i have been showing two things one  is the microscope i think this is most people   know what it is it's kind of a lens a magnifying  lens so we can see more than their eye can see   we can see stuff that is so small maybe only a  few micrometers um we can see visually because   we use a microscope and the pcr it's it's how  can we see a gene like genetic information we   need this kind of tools it's a combination of a  healing system and some molecular kind of system   so a lot of the when we when we when we discuss  nanotechnology or genetics we need these tools   to be able to perceive the information from this  other zone that our human senses cannot perceive   and microscope is one thing pcr like polymerase  chain reaction is another thing it's also the   same way how we can detect this corona virus this  is the pcr method so how can we see these small   things a virus that is only a few nanometers  in size so we need microscopes pcr and many   many other tools and so a lot of these hectarea  workshops are introducing these tools to artists   and creatives and also demystifying them by  building these these instruments ourselves   this opens up a possibility also for creative use  oh i can oh i can just use it i can break it apart   instead of having to go to a specialized  laboratory and so forth which brings me to   this question um open source biological art so one  end which is their instructions it can be used by   teachers by independent researchers but what is  this art there anybody wants to comment on this no why art because there has always been art like if we look  back to the caveman they had these paintings on   the wall so why should we do this biology and  this research on technology without art that   would be even a stranger question so in fact all  life all human activity has involved art and we   should continue doing so that's kind of an easy  explanation um it's like a cultural culture you   know i yeah so maybe art makes human activities  let's say science into culture because there is   also some kind of culture and art involved  yes any other comments about that art thing   also earlier you referenced the  symbolic um and metaphorical   nature of some of your work that it operates  on a different scale than industry or scope and realm so sometimes we can  do things in art as a way to show possibilities for things that we we can  we can only imagine or are starting to   create now i totally agree with what  you just said any other about any   anyone else wants to kind of comment a bit on this  kind of why do we do this scientific equipment   and this genetic manipulation and  within these arts circles as well   it's a park in society it gives you  opportunities to to get away from the system   it's also true but in fact partially partially  working within this art context it gave us a   lot of freedom um to really kind of experiment  with weird ideas to do something also that is   not directly opportunistic for a product or for a  new grant or something so it gave us also freedom   to experiment in these collaborative environments  and also there's there was not a huge but there   is a group of artists and creatives that want to  work with these technologies and with these new   knowledges of science and nanotechnology and  so we tried to provide it to them and there is   an interest in fact not huge but there is some  and i think some of them are in this course   i think i have to skip so we organized a lot of  meetings where we bring people together in this   global network very much focusing on the physical  presence and two three weeks of working together   across cultures across disciplines and without  too much pressure of what comes out but in fact   a lot of things came out sometimes not at the end  of these events but maybe a year later like new   friendships new projects idea that they were  picked up in a collaborative manner two three   years later we did events in switzerland in india  in nepal in indonesia and a lot of this spirit of   bacteria has been influenced by this global  and intercultural dialogue by also some work   styles of india indonesia and since two three  years i was really eager to you know work on   something together with abba also to organize  something in taiwan we ended up in okinawa   this spring we organized a small event  where almost no one came because of the   like travel restrictions but soma i think some  of this idea of collaboration and kind of process   you know based um camps i think has also  influenced our discussion with abba and maybe   also this project that we're all now participating  um i'm having a short break though this was the   first part of like the background i've used a  bit too much time does someone want to pick up um   a topic or wanna should i um maybe it would be  nice if someone says something so i can just   get a bit of kind of air um a question  or a comment to what i was just showing   what about like the materials you know and  like the early days how did you saw flick   or materials and like you know can you  repeat the question i didn't understand   they asked like what about the materials  you were using like in all your   like early days of bacteria and stuff like that  you know how did you actually source them or   did you make them yourself you know i'm very  broad but i think finding the materials is one   of the key skills that you need to become a bio  nano hacker or something and it's something very   difficult to um something very difficult  to teach people it's a skill and we do   this at workshops we go for example to the flea  market and we talk about the stuff we see there we share by kind of you know distributors  where you can buy certain things   and also just motivate people to to to use the  daily everyday materials they find around them and   and open up that idea you can go to the trash find  some old computer equipment some fans some motors   some kind of webcams and you can start to  build a biological laboratory so by by i think   it's difficult to to convey this message that  if you don't have a material you can find it   somewhere that's maybe the hacking mindset a bit  and the diy mindset and a lot of people maybe   an artist without a training in biology it's  very distant to them and so we want to make it   closer by by using this recycled material to build  equipment by using household objects and so forth   does that explain a bit your question but  certain materials are difficult to get   certain like um but it's something why these  groups are very important so we can share i   found this you can order it there but of course  what you can order in us is not the same what i   can order in switzerland in israel or in taiwan  so this is also local knowledge that's why a   space like this is important to kind of ah  where did you find this and stuff um so any   other question otherwise i go a bit into some  nano hacking experiments that we have been doing is that a yes yeah so i tried to put this camera again on my stupid  holder but do you see the second camera again um so you can maybe also see my face  here so maybe you should not see at   the share screen but you should look  at my live camera at the moment um   so can maybe a brief exercise can  anybody everybody that is still listening   tell me something that comes to their mind  that has somehow something with nano in in   the name or in the use or something of what does  it trigger what kind of keywords does it trigger   when you hear technology maybe everybody  like the stuff that you cannot see small the stuff that you cannot see  good more ideas more keywords or maybe a specific technology  that has something to do with nano   that comes to your mind or an  application no no but nanobot very good anybody else wants to comment what is a nanobot i got tiny micro fluid tiny microfluidics do you know something that  has the word nano in it or something like a nano coating no no coating  very good yeah so these are these very thin   layers maybe a few nanometers that change  totally the properties of the surface   very good i have something here i don't  know if you see it anybody knows what it is it's a capacitor white basic electronic  component and he has it says here nano farad   so in what i want to say is like nano  doesn't mean anything it means kilogram   microgram mega it's just as an order of magnitude so if it's something it's really small capacitor  it's nano farad there is even more there is even   pico farad but we not talk about pico technology  on our technology when we talk about capacitors   but all that nano means it's one thousands of  micro it's one thousands of one or milli exactly   and it's one thousand of just basic units and  when we talk about nanotechnology in fact we're   not talking about any technology we talk about  nanometers we talk about the length scale like   how big is something and it's really really really  small so one person already said what comes to her   mind what's small that's all it is there's  no magic there's no special technology like   like a motor or something we just talk about the  very very small thing or phenomena or object or   interaction or layer so it really there  was a bit of a misunderstanding because   we say nanotechnology although there is no  technology all we talk about is nanometer scale all the stuff you see on this table is big  but we have a lot of of course phenomena   that we can observe that happen on the nanometer  scale and so maybe we can go back to the slide   um the slides you can click  somewhere and you see again my   my shared screen there should be something  written small is beautiful yes i agree everybody can make things bigger more complex and  more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot   of karash to move in the opposite direction this  is from economics but anyway it's just a quote   um so what i just mentioned nanotechnology  is not really a technology it's all the   technologies involved all the equipment involved  all the all the phenomena involved that happen   on the nanometer scale how we can see stuff there  how we can modify manipulate stuff there how these   phenomena on the nanometer scale have impact in  daily lives and so forth so in fact it's better   to call it nanosciences or something there is no  technology um this one also shows it properly so   this is in german faus kyle is the hand axe this  kind of caveman tool later we had the steam engine   now everything is nanotechnology and this in  fact is an advertisement by a construction   site so nanotechnology is already how the local  construction company advertises themselves so it's   totally out there already paints in the way we we  kind of you know communicate in our computers it's   not something new it's totally already abundant  everywhere and it was for all the time um what do   we see here looks weird um this is um i've tried  to pick up a topic from also traditional crafts   this is something in the museum i think it's  made two thousand years ago in old rome it's a   glass cup if i drinking glass and if depending on  the light that goes through it it can shine in red   and if the light comes from the other side the  color changes in blue and these are traditional   glass making there are a lot of ways to make the  color into glass and in fact these colors how   do you think you make these colors with pigments  no sorry for all the pigment geeks in this group   there is something much much smaller than normal  pigments it's called a nanoparticle in fact   it's in a way too small color like a pigment but  somehow because it's so small on a quantum level   it interacts with light and these different colors  that you see here on the next slide it goes blue   there's like a green and some pink and something  this is all the same um pigment it's not a pigment   it's a gold nanoparticle so we we have gold in  such a small scale that it's only a few hundreds   of atoms of gold that it interacts in with light  in a very different manner normal like indigo   pigments and so with the same material depending  on the size of your nanoparticle you can change   the color in all different colors and so this is  a phenomena that has been used in glass making for   2000 years already they didn't maybe understand  but they just grinded a bit of gold dissolved in   something and i don't know did something and  suddenly the color changed and with the same   source of gold to changing the process a  little bit it might be red but can also be   blue so this is uh something i wanted to share  with you to kind of connect a bit to some of   the traditional craftsmen so nanotechnology and  using this phenomena on the non-meter scale it's   something we have been doing for the age of of  humanity um someone mentioned also the stuff that   we cannot see um on this graph on the right side  you see what we can see so we can see a frog egg   we can see an individual hair this is like about  one tenth of a millimeter that we can see with   the human eye we can use a microscope it means an  optical microscope and we can even see something   that even less than one micrometer and all life  forms are bigger than one micrometer bacteria   or cells or heats they're like 10 microns  2 microns 100 microns and so forth what we   cannot see with the microscope is the high risks  they're even smaller they're maybe 100 nanometers   10 nanometers and dealing with viruses is  that nanotechnology maybe not that's just   human immune system so we already interact with  a lot of stuff out there using our immune system   our body is built from cell blocks from dna from  proteins and so forth so there's all these other   molecular interactions that fundamentally  influence our life and of course we can feel a   virus because we get sick so there is interactions  happening on the nanometer scale that have a human   global level impact uh but what we have now so  when we say nanotechnology we have since the 80s   we have built new tools new better microscope  they're not optical microscope and suddenly we   can visualize and get information from this small  scale we have even tools to to to poke it to to   push it to feel it on this nanometer scale we have  new manufacturing methods to produce components on   the nanometer scale modern chip manufacturing that  you have in your computer the structures on there   they're like 5 to 10 nanometers in size to build  billions of transistors into your mobile phone so if we look at the next slide what i said in the  beginning the cool thing about the nanosciences is   that all these different disciplines come together  like the manufacturing and engineering now we can   build computer chips on that small level chemistry  has always worked with even smaller things with   molecules and atoms biology already has this kind  of cellular structures and proteins and viruses   that are in the same length scale so when we look  at this length scale what happened in the last   20 30 years is that we suddenly start to use the  same tools and start also to use the same language   and because these disciplines move together this  allows us and maybe that's the most interesting   thing about nanotechnology to integrate  all these knowledges into new applications   into new knowledge into completely maybe  unforeseeable futures um does anybody want   to comment on that someone said nano robots and  i gave this little bit kind of convergence of   different disciplines that i'm very interested  in here are some pictures of nanorobots um these   are kind of famous on the internet anybody  wants to comment on those nano robot photos maybe not these are totally sci-fi crap if you  ask me if we build robots which means engineered   systems on the nanoscale they will not look like  spaceships they will not look like a machine   they will not look like gears and cocks they will  look like the existing biological structures that   we already have out in nature they will like  look like soap bubbles like cells like viruses   and so a lot of the science fiction imagination  looks too much into this engineering mindset from   the 20th century building rockets big machines and  cars and just makes them really small and i don't   think that's the way nano sciences is pushed  forwards it is from inspiration from biology   that already always worked in the nanometer  scale all our cells our immune system   our genetic cell multiplication works on  these nano levels um anybody has a question so from 2010 to 2012 and since then we  have explored this kind of can we do it   yourself can we use hacking strategies  also to work with these nanomaterials   not in the high-end laboratory and in  these collaborative labs and processes   mostly in slovenia we call it nanosmano nanopunk  and hacking of the future we explore together this   very household approach to nanotechnology it was a  collaboration again a very collaborative and open   culture mindset with artists poets musicians all  the researchers hackers these are just some photos   of the people involved and we look a lot into  the history also of microscopy of seeing things   and we wanted to explore how can we see this  phenomena or these materials on the nanoscale   how can we feel it how can we perceive it  with with smell and all our human senses   and of course beyond the microscope there is  always lasers laser is the key instrument to see   effects on a nanometer scale and it's very very  easy because a laser can magnify a phenomenon   a lot if you point the laser towards the wall and  the wall moves a little bit the reflection of the   laser one kilometer away moves a lot so you can  magnify movement by just shining a laser on it   and if you look at this first scientific  equipment to manipulate and observe   matter on the nanometer scale these are totally  self-made objects some tubing some duct tape   and they just put it in an oven or something  so this is the first atomic force microscope   um as i said in beginning experimental  research in in a research laboratory you   have to build your own equipment because you  do an experiment no one else has done before   and to reflect on this feeling how can we feel how  can we touch a material and perceive its nanometer   phenomena this is what an atomic force  microscope does it touches the surface   we can maybe do something like  an acoustic fuck microscope   so we point the laser and we focus the laser on a  on a record player and we look at the reflection   by looking i mean we add an electronic  sensor and suddenly we can hear the music   and if you look at the record player these  are microscopic like structures but we can   make use a laser to make it audible instead of  mechanically like a normal record player works   how can we move things on a nanometer  scale i think a lot of you know   some of you maybe know what is a piezo microphone  or gets a speaker there's also one here um have you used piezos  before i know you have about eyeballs sure why do i bring  a piezo into nano hacking um so if we can make sound with a piezo speaker  we can listen to sound in fact there is a material   a crystal that is called a piezo crystal and  if you apply a voltage let's say three voltage   it expands or it shrinks so it grows and  it grows just a few nanometers in fact   so when i put voltage on a piezo the  cheater the crystal there the material   will grow maybe 100 nanometers so there  you go you have nanotechnology on your desk so what we did is we stretched we scratched   uh a piezo so we have four parts of it and  then we apply voltages to these different   corners which means it's not just gross it also  kind of warps it deforms and we put the little   needle on it in the middle so we can start to move  a needle like sub micron resolution this is like   just on with the piezo and and some hot glue and  four wires so so in this case only for direction   it is totally random it's it's not random but it's  not controlled but we can move we warp it so it   kind of moves this maybe i can you see this so i  just move somewhere i can go there i can go there   i can go there i can go there can go a little  bit up a little bit down but this is so small   but we can magnify this 50 nanometers movement of  the piezo by making it warp so then a long stick   may make a big movement and the short sig will  make a small movement so we were experimenting   with all this stuff so there is this 50 nanometers  pizza movement by adding a stick and these four   corners we can make it visible with our eyes  that we can move it but it's still ultra precise any other questions to them what sorry but  what is the relation between these two pictures it's on the right side this is like a high  quality this is mechanical magnification   so when when something moves  here really small here really big   you know a lever and the machine on the right side  it the move the movement on one side is massively   magnified on the whole wheel so this is like an  old mechanical um i don't forgot the name of it   you move something really small on one  side and on the other side it moves a lot   mechanically yeah it's like a pentagon or  something you know exactly something like this   yeah and i know this is some kind of middle-aged  machine to also magnify mechanical motion any other question um we also built crazy on useless stuff like nano  kunst kunst is the german word for art and we work   with more other nano materials um we again we  build our own laboratory in a public bar um we   invite more hackers and researchers and again  we want to see we perceive with our eyes these   nanoparticles how how how do they sound can we use  it for a sound experimental music performance how   do they smell uh and in fact how you want to see  a nanoparticle you have to go really really close   that's how they do it and i mentioned before  light does interact with on a nanometer level   light itself the wavelength is on the nanometer  level that's why we see rainbows by the way   anybody has an idea why there  is no pink in the rainbow why why is there no pink in the rainbow because it's political there is  no pink in the rainbow i just i have looked at many rainbows you don't said that   there is no pink in the rainbow there is  the color pink does not exist in the rainbow and it's my favorite color so i really miss it i like rainbows and i like pink but  they're not both in the same group   yeah we have to figure it out maybe you have  some time to figure out why there is no pink   in the rainbow um and we also grow materials  like we use like biology to grow nano materials   and we make circuits electronic circuits that  make us also perceive these nanometer changes   these different surface coatings these  layers that we can add and this is a bit   a last experiment i want to do with you um  with this i'm kind of done with my slides   so i maybe even stopped no no i leave  the sharing on um so it's all right   already an hour gone so we about we have  started a bit later what's the time about it's uh 11 12. okay so we kind of an  hour because we started 15 minutes later   um so i think everybody should switch  to my video camera then you can see my   work desk and you can maybe comment i will  just do something a little bit maybe you can   ask another questions or give a comment or it's a  lot of information i know but this is how i do it   why you choose to study nano and what what  was it what was your first nano experiment   or nano arts when i think i mentioned  something that was interesting for me   was this very interdisciplinary character of  material science it's not you know chemistry   it's chemistry physique um and this same idea  of interdisciplinary or even cross-disciplinary   this drove me to this nanotech because this is  where all these different disciplines meet and   maybe the same drive to go into these different  disciplines and make people work together from   different backgrounds drove me into my current  activities as a global kind of hacker artist   organizer yeah and then i also have some questions  that and they had then for you the hectaria is   like a hobby for you or what's the aim for no it's  my my main mission is where my heart is ah okay   um they always told me when i was young oh you  know it would be great if you can make your hobby   your job i did long time ago it doesn't mean i get  a lot of money and get really rich but i really   i think i made the hobby my job my job means my  main activities my main daily activities i really   organize workshops you know set up hackerspaces  write grants travel around the world give talks   experiment with other crazy enthusiastic  people yes also involved in some local   hackerspace i teach once in a while  at universities or in informal places but then you're not doing any  more this serious technology or   are you surprised it's even more serious  at the moment but what means serious okay i don't take life too serious but i think it  is serious if you bring these technologies to   the real people i think this is a serious job  to do doesn't matter if it's paid or if i have   a work contract and if i write scientific  publications i i do think this is serious   business i maybe make a lot of jokes but  you know making jokes means it's serious um what is this scandal a candle um i showed  you before a bit some of these like high-end   brain interfaces let's put them on to the way also  this i showed to about so this is an implantable   brain interface to remotely control a rat we made  this with silicone and conductive ink it's like   handmade in the laboratory for a single prototype  experiment on remotely control the rat there's   only 10 electrodes that you put somewhere in the  brain and it's kind of a flexible stretchable   silicone kind of oops yeah this stuff is what  we do in our lab we have to build these devices   do you have a red sorry i don't have a rack  so this is an old prototype i just have in a   drawer just to show people that we can build  this neural implant not only even can do it   and we have done this already  10 years ago what is this what is it that's the word a prism yeah and about 500  years ago people have found out something   really really strange i don't know if it's  possible but if you look through a prism   at a single point light source  like a candle you see a rainbow so suddenly we can observe with our human  eyes tiny differences in the wavelength a few   differences in the wavelength of  light so we see blue and red there huh   what we don't see pink but this is another  thing so very simple object like this can   give us some information on the nanometer scale  we can maybe also see let's say if we look at   the color i showed you in the beginning of  the gold nanoparticles or of your pigments   these are nanometer effects with  the gold particles with a prisma   we can see this um and we can  just put light sensor here   and this is made out of plastic by  the way and i order it for one dollar and so then i have something else here it's a  circuit the one that i showed you on the slide   it's a very simple oscillator  electronic circuit and when i press here you hear this so when the resistance changes on this  between here and here it creates a tone   if the resistance is really low the electric  resistance that tone goes really high and so if i touch it you hear this um so i put it here on these two  pads so between here and here but this is not nano why is it not nano  where so look what happens if i blow on it vomit here well what happens if i grind it it's like a pickup what happens if i take it in my mouth so i just blow on it so before you sand it  yeah i had to sand it to get a nice surface so what do we hear why do i hear this when i blow on it any idea why can i hear this when i've blown it   because it's like a resistive um  yes so there must be something here   that is a resistor and when i blow  on it this resistance goes down what could be what could i do with my blow i ate indian curry for lunch  i don't know if that matters so there's something in my breath that changes the  resistance on these two copper pads or in between i have no idea oh that's new  to me yes yeah i guess it's   what did you say that your breath is  like a bit wet and then you get good   i think you would just want a price i also think  it has something to do with the humidity when you   blow on a piece of glass you know you see this  water condensating i also think i blow here   and a bit of water from my breath will will  condensate okay surface and it will change the   resistance because there is from the grinding  there is already some stuff and maybe i licked   it before it you need to kind of prepare the  surface a little bit that this is possible but   very small kind of change  in humidity from my breath   is that or something and the layer of water  that i put there it's very small it's a few   molecules of water maybe 100 nanometers of water  and it instantly evaporates it goes again away um so let's make these let's make  something else what is this a candle what can i do with a candle i can burn it like what comes out above  the candle heat and some other shit um   you know what happens when i cool down  a candle at a flame a candle so when i   cool the flame i put some piece of metal scissors  inside it starts to smoke black smoke comes up i don't know the chinese word for this black smoke  how's it called in chinese in english it's suit what is this black stuff  that comes from the candle huh so if a flame doesn't burn properly there  is this black stuff coming out it's called soup   and i can use this to coat my circuit now oh come on here yes and now  you see it's a bit black and the tone is fixed it's really high tone  now it's not going away because it's now   this resistive this is very thin layer of  carbon we put there but let's put even more now it's really a terrible high  pitch so i just clean it away again   so we have to do some we have just  done some nano technology we applied   almost nano particles like we applied a lot of  particles of carbon from the from the black stuff   there is microscopic particles but there is a lot  of nanoscale particles in this black stuff a lot   we put them on this we created a very  thin layer and look what happens now failed i have to do it again i cleaned it too well so if there is this carbon layer on it i can blow  on it as much as i want doesn't matter anymore so because we have this  very thin coating of carbon   the water will not go there because  water doesn't like carbon so again so   these are very simple experiments so we can't  change the properties on this terrible sound so it doesn't work so well  anymore it kind of doesn't   so by changing the surface with  this hoose with this black stuff   it doesn't like water anymore so the water from  my breath will not condensate on the surface   so we can you know these are nanometer  coatings that have a real-world impact so i think i play a bit more with my candle until it's totally black nice black and of course if i put water over it it will just point point going we just dropped  over because it doesn't like water that's why my   breast wasn't changing the resistance anymore kind  of yeah well so these are these experiments are   trying to do um working with nanomaterials in a  very household and very kind of direct accessible   trashy matter with this experiment i'm kind  of over and i i changed this camera to my face um so now it's your turn maybe you can  make me tell more stories or give me some   maybe interesting insight there is the lab yeah i hope i have confused you all a lot um  so now it's up to you maybe to give me some   questions or maybe to repeat one part of the  story where i was before and go in more detail i will not continue talking until  you tell me what i should say you can tell us like on what  you're walking now these days i can so in fact i work a lot on  this the whole space nice   so we just moved in here a few like months ago  an empty space and i have been very physically   manual labor building walls painting moving around  furniture repacking everything to set up this new   space which was in fact fantastic in all this  kind of online presence and kind of not being   able to travel it was really good to materialize  some stuff and we can be here for five years   and finally set up this laboratory  sorting all the components so can we build an 80 tiny from scratch at  your new lab i would love for so like making   computer chips making transistors is in fact at  the very fundament of nanotechnology when the   drive came from manufacturing like sensors and  rockets and stuff and making household computers   but the tools developed for making these small  chips like an a tiny like an integrated circus   these are exactly the tools that led also  to what we now perceive as nano technology   because we wanted to have more precise  knowledge of small semiconductors so in   fact i think the history of nanotechnology starts  with integrated circuit electronics manufacturing um i know it would be nice but i think one to  make our own transistor one single one would   already be good enough i think we should start  not with that whole kind of microcontroller   yeah i guess the the diode is like the start i want to try something what happens if  i start this microphone can you hear me   yeah i'm now using the microphone from my  i'm going to turn off the other microphone sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah hey i don't know  yeah so what about all the other people in   the in the that were maybe listening to the  presentation you have a question you can also   maybe ask a question in chinese to about he  will help translating my chinese not so good okay one more so in our new lab one thing  that maybe some of you have already heard   and one of the partners in the lab she's  working a lot with kombucha maybe you can charging kombucha maybe you can talk about a little bit what  i just thought about this just reminds me of   fermentation so maybe this reminds me indigo  dye is also fermentation so but but i realize   you don't know about indigo diet process and so  fermentation is a very broad thing fermentation   means that some living thing for example a  bacteria produces something interesting instead   of just like eating and living and for example  these bacteria in kombucha they produce this slime   and this slime is not cellulose these are  fibers cellulose fibers that are much much   finer and smaller than the stuff we  use for paper from the trees and plants   so also bacteria can produce cellulose fibers in  the nanometer scale and i've been experimenting   with the material that maya was growing to  put it in different chemicals just water you see this so this is also nanotechnology  it looks like alien slime but it is cellulose   produced by bacteria through a kind of a  fermentation process that has nanometer   fibers and pores so it's like it's like doping  stuff what you're doing what did you ask if it's   like all like the doping process oh it's  like something different like when you do so now i have to cellulose matte and i'm just  trying a way to clean out the cells because i   don't want the cells in there anymore if i have  to if i have the material i want the cells to   be washed to be dead so it stops stinking so i'm  trying different washing so that i'm only staying   with the cellulose and cellulose is a biopolymer  and like a natural polymer and if i put it in a   this one base it gets really nice and white  don't you see it's really white transparent and why is paper not transparent and  this is transparent although both is   like made out of cellulose because these  fibers are so small in a nanometer scale that   their interaction with light is different so it  becomes transparent so this is transparent paper and this is a very traditional fermentation  process which is to put some sugar and some   nutrients in a pot and we put some bacteria  and it grows this material takes two weeks   this is hydrogen also very white but maybe it will  become brittle so i'm testing a bit some kind of   washing of this cellulose  nanocellulose material that   is grown by bacteria and now i touch the  dangerous liquid so i have to wash my hand so what kind of chemicals are you  like one is hydrogen peroxide like   this is what you use to bleach hair  and the other one is sodium hydroxide   but not too high concentration but  enough to wash and fill out all the cells does it have like all kinds of interesting  properties rather than being cleared   like with light or conductive it's not  yet conductive but of course i want to   make it conductive yeah and you so it's kind  of nice to make a substrate that's transparent   when we grow it with bacteria it's not a cheap or  good way but it's kind of fun to grow a material   with bacteria that is transparent and it's  very strong it doesn't rip so easy like paper   it's much more stronger but then maybe we can  paint some conductive nano technology on it to   make it conductive on one side and not on the  other so it's still transparent but also but   also conductive i think these gold nanoparticles  or silver fibers or something that are so small   so if something is very very small it usually  becomes transparent because light is too big   to interact with this really small stuff only on  the quantum level so i'm looking into this kind of   as a substrate to experiment maybe for electronics  but not really for a specific use just because   it's fun to do this growing some bacterial  nanocellulose and by having more material   soon i hope i can experiment and come up with new  ideas i don't know yet where i want to go with it i just want it transparent clean and white and i  want the cells to be gone so it stops stinking it   stops smelling like vinegar more like so i have it  more you know just pure lettuce paper transparent   anything else i i personally wanna know how to coat  special materials on fiber textile fibers   but i think that is a complex question  you might write it down i'm on i do so   for all the grouper if you maybe find some  information that is maybe technical material   science i do understand language as well i i have  started i don't have a lot of let's say experience   in other fibers because that was not my field  but still i do understand this kind of literature   in material science and nanotechnology and i can  maybe translate it into a more understandable   language so if someone you know has a question  throughout the next couple of weeks i don't have   the solutions but i can help translating let's say  the technical jargon from this kind of how to code   textiles into an understandable language for  craftsmanship and artists nice translate you mean   what translate what i can translate because some  of these technical if you read a technical um   let's say scientific paper uh yeah if you're  a craftsman it's difficult to understand the   language and material scientists i can help you if  you find something that you think is interesting   i can help you understand some of the technical  terms also maybe can say if this is something it's   possible and do it yourself setting or if it's  something that is high-end kind of manufacturing   yeah absolutely i get like  a simplifying the process   will help us a lot yeah i can maybe if it's  possible i can help simplifying the process but   some of the process cannot be simplified and so  because i do understand the language i can maybe   judge if this is something that we can do diy  or if it's something that we cannot do with diy   because i you know i i know a bit the technical  terms and the stuff so if anybody in the class   has some stuff they may be interested but  they don't understand they can send me and   we can have a little discussion as a kind of  material science translator into human language when i say materials i don't mean let's say these  traditional materials i think there's enough   other experts in this environment but more  or less these high-end let's say code beings   or this kind of materials or special  conductors semiconductors polymer fibers   stuff like this i can help you to understand   some technicalities and also help if it's possible  that this can be implemented easy in a diy project what do you say about this uh cardamom soup stuff  what do you think you make light sensors yeah   i've been looked into it in detail it's like well yeah i've just briefly clicked on the link you  sent but i have to look at it a bit more closely   to give you yeah actually it's very interesting  because it was like used like a yellow pigment   you know you know and all kinds of stuff so but  this material by itself it already is um light   responsive yeah so but then it's maybe how  to process it or can we use it as a coating   or what is your question it's like how to produce  like a foil out of it like we need to make a foil and some of these powers by the way they  might also be toxic if they're not processed   so i can also maybe help you and if someone  is unsure i can look up so every material you   have there is something called the material  safety data sheet but again this has some   cryptic language no one understands but if there  is a big red sign usually it means there is some problems nice so uh we still  gonna talk with you you know   we are we are doing it all today already you  know yeah we talk anyway so me and zora we talk   regularly so that's why maybe someone else can  maybe say goodbye or say a last kind of comment um yeah i really appreciate your thoughts with too much information all right it was really  interesting it was like the first time   i am listening to your talk so it was  really nice but now it's like way time
