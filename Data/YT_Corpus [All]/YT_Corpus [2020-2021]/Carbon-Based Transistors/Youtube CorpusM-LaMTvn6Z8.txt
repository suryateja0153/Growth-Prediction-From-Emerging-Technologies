 Sheen dengan is a semiconductor and automotive parts manufacturer this video will explain what a MOSFET is and how you could evaluate these parts through the spec sheet a MOSFET is a type of transistor all transistors can turn on and off just like a switch at home there are several types of transistors bipolar Junction transistor field effect transistor and insulated gate bipolar transistor MOSFET is a field effect transistor type we can select the appropriate one based on your application here is the structure for bipolar Junction MOSFET and IGBT each terminal name is different and every character is also different link switching speed a bipolar Junction transistor has a collector base emitter and it has NPN and PNP structure to turn on an NPN transistor turns on when the current flows through its base PNP transistor turns on when no current runs through its base the usage or application will determine whether NPN or PNP is required a MOSFET has a drain gate and source and it has n channel or n CH and P channel or PCH this device also has a different turn on structure we will provide more information how this works later in the video every transistor has its own advantages for example a MOSFET has good performance and high switching frequency and low drive power conditions but a higher current level is not suitable high current and high power are more suitable for IGBT but IGBT is not suitable for high switching frequency this frequency is involved in each application and transformer size next we will explain how a MOSFET works MOSFET is simply a switch if the voltage was charged into gate and source the MOSFET is turned on with RDS on partyís on simply means a resistance value which is involved in how much current can go through and has a high temperature there are two methods to turn on a MOSFET there is n channel and P channel if the voltage between gate and source was charged the MOSFET turns on the most important point is which side has a higher voltage at gate side voltage is higher than the source and channel MOSFET turns on if source side voltage is higher than the gate P channel MOSFET turns on an electrical engineer can design and select which MOSFET is better for each circuit in the next line we provide tips on what you should know when making your spec selection We strongly recommend checking to items in the spec at first that is VDS s and ID when developing your product please do not exceed them absolute maximum ratings you can check these ratings through simulation or pass samples then please check the voltage level for gate and n-channel or p-channel if the gate voltage level is not exceeded on your absolute maximum ratings you could use a MOSFET in your circuit in this page we mentioned RDS on RDS on would be the key performance when selecting RDS on is related to thermal dissipation which is involved and how you would put a thermal counter measure such as a heatsink if you have BD SS ID vgs and RDS on you could select a part MOSFETs key performance are related to Q G CIS s CR SS and cos s next we will give tips on MOSFETs key performances this water gate illustration makes it easier to understand how much current is available on a mosfet ciss is like a bucket QG is like adding stones to a bucket adding stones to the bucket lift the wall up and allow water to flow if charged by qg the water starts to flow is any QG level acceptable the answer is no if there's not enough qg RDS on would be high if too much qg RDS on would be low if the bucket percy ISS is too big it takes too much time to fill with stones or qg oppositely if the bucket percy ISS is too small the stones for qg fill up the bucket too fast it means that the current comes too soon a MOSFET is constructed by small cells we can select how many cells we should use on MOSFET based on the performance required MOSFET cells are related with RDS on CISS and qg if fewer cells are on a MOSFET the MOSFETs characteristics would be higher it means that RDS on is hi-c ISS is small the needed qg is low it's easy to turn on but has a high RDS on on the other hand if more cells are on a MOSFET RDS on is low see ISS is large the needed qg is high a semiconductor manufacturer selects what spec is required by selecting the quantity of cells on a MOSFET what is a good MOSFET we can understand how good a MOSFET is through figure of Merit or fom figure 12.1 illustrates a good in poor MOSFET the blue point is poor and the green point is good one of the indicators is RDS on x CI SS you can see the fom is the same with others even if the spec was different if you want to evaluate the mosfet of each manufacturer this fom is a good indicator to compare thank you for watching
