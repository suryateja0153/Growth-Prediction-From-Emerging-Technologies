 hi welcome everyone and thanks for joining today's visiting scholars conversation today we have a researcher from the world's most prestigious research institutes with us dr pascala scupades i'm daphne faber your moderator today and junior in engineering technology education in purdue polytechnic before we introduce dr guppa dennis a brief word about the visiting scholars program this is a partnership between the honors college and other campus organizations and colleges to bring thought leaders creative visionaries and those at the forefront of their field to campus to engage with our students and our community consequently we want to offer a sincere thank you to purdue polytechnic for making it today possible now let's dive into dr guppa dennis's impressive credentials pascala scupa dennis earned his phd in material science from ncsr democritus athens greece in 2014 during his phd his research focused on ionic transport mechanisms of organic electrolytes physics of ionic-based devices and of non-volatile memories following his phd in 2015 he joined the department of bioelectronics emsc france as a post-doctoral researcher for his research focused on the design and development of organic neuromorphic devices based on electrochemical concepts he is currently leading the organic neuromorphics group at the max planck institute for polymer research in which his group is developing various concepts of organic based devices for neuromorphic processing sensing and actuating thank you so much for joining us today dr guppa dennis uh i wanted to start off by asking you for the audience who might not know about the field of neuromorphic computing could you give a general description of your most recent research project yes sure first of all thank you for the introduction uh daphne it's a great pleasure to be here with you even virtually this time um so to start with uh with the field so as you probably know uh there is there is a great interest right now to find alternative ways to process information to store information and the the main source of inspiration as as always i mean is is this is these are the biological entities which means the brain so the main uh let's say scope or they let's say long-term goal of neuromorphic engineering or computing is to understand first of all the workings of the brain and then to emulate these workings of the brain or let's say to mimic these workings of the brain in a device based level i mean microelectronic device or a circuit based level in a sort of let's say a reverse engineering process to put it in a framework so what do uh what type of devices do the the teams in your research group work on specifically so in so these are microelectronic devices there are many different ways to emulate biology with microelectronic devices so for example and components so for example there are solid state devices and technologies made of silicon for example which is a traditional technology there are also emerging technologies which are in let's say in a mature or an early research level and among all these technologies and we also have a small portion of let's say this field which is the field the field of organic neuromorphics which are these are devices made of organic materials and these organic materials have several advantages in order to emulate biology so this is the key let's say advantage of using uh organic so they because they are organic they are carbon based they look closer to biology let's say because biology is also carbon based so what materials uh organic materials specifically um are commonly used in your research so it's so these are materials and devices which uh in contrast with to the mainstream which which are electronic devices so devices that conduct usually electrons and holes these are the carriers of information in our lab in many other labs of course we are developing organic materials and devices which are able to conduct not only electrons and holes but also various ions molecular ions larger molecules neurotransmitters so these are all carriers of information that you can find them in biological entities or in biological neural networks or even in the brain so and because of these things intrinsic capability of this kind of devices and materials to process this information these carriers of information then again they have the capability to to emulate biology more precisely let's say or in a more realistic way so what are the advantages of using neuromorphic technologies over more traditional non-biology based technologies so yeah this is a really nice question so everything depends on the technology or on the needs right so there are for example a special applications or th there are several areas of applications which at which traditional technologies are are really well suited and nobody has to touch them like i don't know traditional computing or traditional storage for example traditional cpu but for other applications of which we don't really care about uh let's say the performance but we care about extracting specific information we care about interfacing electronics with other environments for example biology or mechanical structures for example or other entities such as such as even plants for example or other entities which are a large scale for example and we need electronics to surround them then these are special applications at which a neuromorphic uh computing or uh you know unconventionally computing uh techniques can be can be very beneficial so i'm i'm not claiming or the community is not claiming that neuromorphic computing which will substitute everything or traditional computing systems but these are you know two two ways that they will go on parallel and they will deviate in certain applications at which classic computing is is not enough or it's very high performing maybe it's very expensive maybe it's not uh it's not suited for or interfacing an environment for example so there are many small scale applications at which neuromorphic computing can can be suitable for for computing several different concepts yeah those are all uh really interesting applications um kind of going along with that how do you see the field changing within the next five years five to ten years let's say yeah so right now we are yeah so right now we are i believe that we are in the beginning of a new era so we know i mean as a community uh what are the capabilities of artificial neural networks i mean neural networks which are running in in classic computing systems that these are you know for example a pattern recognition processes that you use every day in your mobile phone or in your search engine for example so we know that the capabilities are more enormous there so we are only at the beginning of this space emulating biology just with software or just with classic computing again is not enough if we want to take full full advantage i mean of of biological computing systems and to answer your question i i believe that right now we are in in a state which is similar to what happened uh a few decades ago when we had these fixed lines for for uh for making phones and you knew that it was a really great i mean there was a great potential to communicate with others but you always have to have to be at home because you were always limited by by a fixed line and by the time that these mobile phones were introduced then there was a completely new era so this is what will happen with artificial intelligence now we are you know at the beginning there were only this kind of artificial intelligence in large data centers or large supercomputers or specific computational tasks right now you can run some let's say algorithms even in your phone but again for for specific computational tasks and in i don't know five or ten years we will have probably in the market i'm not really sure yet but we'll have in the market many different technologies of neuromorphic chips which will be dedicated for four different tasks so your the artificial intelligence will be on your hands in five or ten years and one when i mean in your hands i mean even integrated in your body that's really interesting kind of along those lines as well um what applications would you like your work to have uh within your lifetime within my lifetime man i believe in in the short term now i would like to see devices or computational concepts let's say that would be able to integrate with biology more efficiently but we'll be able to talk with biology on the same time scales let's say with the same language which is not trivial right now and this kind of devices which are some of them are already there with some specific limitations but some of these you know platforms are already there but in the future we will have either more or i would like to see even more advanced uh systems that would be able to cure or detect diseases on the fly or in an even you know preliminary stage or even to detect [Music] let's say some some kind of metrics before the actual disease i would like to see devices or systems which will uh let's say fix or even replace the operation of organs all these are you know neuromorphic systems working on the interface with biology and in in the longer term i believe that we have to you know understand biology understand how the the brain is processing formation which is not trivial it's it's a neverending problem and um i would like to to as long as we understand what happens in the brain i would like to really replicate uh or mimic um with really highly efficient circuits uh what happens in our brain and another interesting aspect now which is probably between long short and long term applications pro probably towards the long term applications i would say is that apart you know from bioelectronics energy from detecting diseases or from replacing organs and i think there is also a great potential in in the communication between you know us human beings even if we like it or not i'm not i'm not a supporter or or not of this approach i mean but even if we like it or not we are limited on on the way we communicate so everything usually is verbal so we are based in a verbal communication or in in a written communication and you know in order to convey complex messages we are we are somehow limited in our language for example even if if we talk another language i mean there is suddenly a barrier if we come from different cultural you know backgrounds there is also value and so there are also non-verbal other non-verbal communication i don't know processes which were involved in during the history for example arts arts is another way of conveying let's say complex concepts with non-verbal techniques for example painting poetry music instrumental music for example there are also you know some some sort of specific diseases which they saw how complex the brain is or how complex our you know understanding or our our thinking it is for example um pathological disorders like schizophrenia or other orders which are not so serious like um synesthesia for example synesthesia it's a it's an it's a really nice nice it's an interesting let's say this function of the brain at which the brain confuses different senses and statistically many artists have synesthesia so they smell their voices for example and this is these are just you know some examples which show how how complex do you know the the processing the processing in our brain is and how you know specific individuals under certain conditions can communicate this this this inside of us and this looks very weird to us so as long as we have i will not call them devices i would call it a technology or a platform that would be able to or would allow us to communicate as human beings nonverbally this will not save us you know an enormous amount of data but it will also open you know new avenues of you know understanding each other there are a lot of ethical issues inside this statement but these are processes that will not happen you know in the next five or ten years so what do you think would have to happen in order for all of these things that you've kind of described to come true and especially to make sure that they come true in a way that is ethical this is this would be at the end a collective effort an effort of a community itself which means that every every small part of the community has to place a specific role and sometimes you know a community these are examples that we saw i mean in scientific progress so sometimes you know the community is taking the wrong way and then it returns back in the right way so the scientific community has these mechanisms you know to create a feedback and uh you know correct let's say errors it's it's a slow process but it happens so we have to be sure that whatever we do conforms with the needs of our society respects us as human beings everything is ethical of course every everything in in a practical way everything does not harm us if we are talking about devices that interface biology we also have to respect uh private data to some extent so there are many different uh you know aspects of technological development and there are many different uh uh let's say um communities that they have to work together not only scientific communities and i think there is a cross let's say cross communication between communities technical communities non-technical communities communities that they are working on on ethics on health issues at the end i believe that we will bring the best out of the technology because always the technology has a dark and the bright side everything yeah something that you um kind of touched on there was the need to involve people from a lot of different backgrounds um i know that the max plaque society has a value to multi-discipline disciplinary approach to research which is something that we also value a lot here at the honors college so as something if you could i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about um your experience with research in multi-disciplinary teams yeah this is this is a great question i mean i'm i'm i keep learning i mean from this process and so um to familiarize you with the institute i mean it's a max prank society not the institute it's it's a society which consists of of 85 institutes the background is really diverse so you can find institutes working from i don't know music and cultural is up to astronomy there are always you know these cross collaborations between institutes and um it's a great place to uh it's a great it's a great place to work and if you really want to do in the disciplinary races you have you really have to try and you really have to train yourself i will not say in a specific way but you have to be open for example in different backgrounds you have to for example be able or you have to train yourself to talk different languages for example if there are if there is on the other side of the river if there is a let's say a community or a society that you have to approach personally i don't expect the other community to speak my language i have to do both steps to reach the other community which is hard i mean it's not i'm not claiming that i'm always successful but you have to be able or you have to train yourself to speak many different languages by speaking um many different languages do you i assume you mean like in a metaphorical sense versus you know literally speaking many different languages metaphorically speaking so if if you start you know collaborating with with people from different backgrounds you at the end at some point you end up talking about for example the same physical phenomenon but people they you know they are using so different language technical language and they don't even realize that they are talking about the same thing and the job for api for example is to convey this message to the others uh to to make it clear that every community has its own jargon or i don't know its own uh let's say language and our duty is to build bridges and between different communities so do you have um recommendations for undergraduates who are looking to be involved in interdisciplinary research teams maybe on a maybe not a a high level research scale but on a more lower level scale for things that they can do to make sure that there's mutual group understanding no for me there is no low level high level skill you have you start from the basics and after that you start building but i don't you know i don't consider the skills of students low level skills and the others higher high level skills so it's something that you built gradually and so regarding your question now again someone has to be motivated that has to be good someone has yeah has to be motivated to understand other disciplinaries they have to be willing or they have to understand that multidisciplinary subjects demand you know they to see a subject from many different areas so they have to be dedicated on maybe on studying different areas maybe they have to be willing to sacrifice let's say quality uh sorry one qual quality also a quantity for quality so they have to be really of a quality and there are on the way there will also be some you know some successes there will also be some failures they don't have to take very seriously the failures not the successes also neither and and you know interdisciplinary race there is also a game it's a game like many other games so there are specific rules i mean on that and if you are you know if you are very dedicated and you understand the rules uh of course there are many cases that there are not rules at all i mean but if you understand the game i mean you are dedicated and you train yourself i think that they are going to succeed at the end they have to have an internal need of understanding you know an entity a phenomenon a project from very different aspects so this is the key for me and acquired it right thank you do you think that when you were an undergraduate you had these skills or do you think you had to to build them no of course not nobody is born with these skills i'm not i wasn't perfect and of course i'm not perfect now i mean um gradually you realize i mean you build up some interest for something and you understand i mean that you have a lack of knowledge so you have a court expertise on something which is you know your background it could be i don't know semiconductor physics it could be biology or something but as long as you understand that you want to be involved in a specific i will not say project bacteria you immediately understand that you have there is a gap of low village in your core expertise and this is what i i was trying to build and this happened gradually and this was a a slow and some sometimes you know disappointing and painful experience i mean but it happens i mean it takes time so as long as for example like if we are talking about my for myself i'm a physicist for example by training and my core expert i used to be a physicist i mean now i'm a little bit of everything my core expertise was device physics and semiconductor physics i was involved in many projects regarding device physics transistors memory devices and when i realized that these traditional technologies have several limitations and we have to at some point to jump to biology i immediately understood that i have to learn biology and for doing that you have to be self-motivated so there might be many courses that can teach you in some other cases you have to be self-taught which is okay i mean it's not a problem and it's you know and always it's it's a continuous process i mean and uh it never ends right yeah yeah that's really interesting so um it sounds like through your own motivation you were um and you encouraged yourself to uh find these to make your own interdisciplinary experiences or were there other experiences either in your undergrad or your graduate programs that helped you develop these desires to learn other subjects so if i if i go back in time i mean there is no specific answer on that i mean it's it's a mixture you know of an internal desire of my background maybe of some random processes people that i met on the way mentors people that supported me the right time in the right place so i don't have a specific answer about so the only advice that i can give is that they have to be dedicated on their own students they have to be dedicated on what they are doing but they always have to be which means that they have to be focused on their on their target but at the same time they have to to to go far away from from their problem but that they have to solve on or from the target and see what happens around so at the same time they have to be focused and localized at the same time well can you talk a little bit about what your first research experience was a lot of students here at the honors college do research in their undergrad so a lot of them had questions about whether you did research in your undergrad and if not what your first experience was so i was i had experience as an undergraduate uh as an undergraduate in uh in research and so if i remember correctly according to the regulations at least of my school i was obliged either to choose a couple of three courses which is almost half of a one semester i would say or a research project at the end if i remember correctly i did both so i'm not really efficient but what i did was that i i realized that i would like to work on on practical let's say on semiconductor semiconductors i approached the right person and i ended up as an undergrad to work on on the physics let's say of semiconductor devices that were commercially available so i was working in a technology node from from an industry and i'm i'm not now that i'm i remember myself i feel really lucky that i have this opportunity by back then because i was really you know measuring devices that were um on the market and this you know fueled my desire i mean to understand more about microelectronics um device physics and my conductor physics understand their limitations understand moreover why i don't want to work with classic electronics so after this experience i mean i had you know i came up to several different conclusions that's really cool um so what in general was your undergraduate experience like a lot of students haven't had the chance to be exposed to what um undergraduate study is like in other countries yeah so it's it's been a long time i mean but uh yeah i remember i i you know i was i was studying hard on the same time i really had a good time with my friends because you have to combine both aspects in your life to be healthy my personal opinion and back then i wasn't very dedicated i don't believe that i was very dedicated i didn't know i wanted to do it i just wanted to do research uh so in my first i would say in my first second or even the third year i wasn't so you know it wasn't so clear in my mind what i wanted to do so this this was clear after the fourth year and uh you know as every life i mean has its ups and downs i also have several disappointments i also have i also had many successes but at the end you know the sign was supposed i guess if you're comfortable could you talk about some of the disappointments you've had um even when things didn't go so well in your educational career yeah i mean everyone appointments i mean uh for example i mean it takes time and to understand the subject for example um i think if you want to be a good scientist you have to you have to be honest with yourself and you you have to self let's say examine yourself so you have to to find ways or internal mattresses i need to understand if you understand the subject and this doesn't happen not only with your pizzas i mean it's an internal process it's a personal uh you know travel journey and uh i had many of those disappointments for example in in actual courses uh in in the first research experience for example because by the time that you start you believe that you know research let's talk about experimental research because this is my my expertise initially you believe that research is is only you know touching buttons pressing buttons and taking the results but it's it's also a process which takes time i mean to understand the value of uh or to start from from pressing buttons and to understand a full phenomenon for example and this is this is a you know this is a journey that takes time it has many disappointments it has a lot of successes there so it's uh but everything is normal for me the trick is to to to learn and get used to it i mean and by the time that you have a disappointment you go directly to the next step i mean you understand what are the sources of your disappointment or failures but by the next day you go to the next step if you could go back and change anything about your educational experience would you choose a different degree program take different classes maybe join more clubs some anything like that so if i go back in time man i don't know if i want to own something maybe um maybe perhaps it would be nice for me it wouldn't be nice for me to have some courses in uh in neuroscience for example in biology or more courses i also appreciate uh for instance pure mathematics i found them very elegant and but anyway it's it's not like i i i want to change completely in my past i mean maybe some things i would have done in another way i mean but anyway as researchers and nasa academics we all have a poor expertise but after a while you have to learn or you are trained i mean always to change your expertise so even if uh as an undergrad i i didn't you know do the the necessary steps i mean for for training myself for training myself you have a whole life i need to fix this these mistakes which i don't consider them as mistakes but and this is the essence of racial timing you always you you have to continue learning new things so it doesn't so it's not like everything stops in your your phd for example or your master's degree everything starts there from there yeah do you have um any recommendations for young researchers on experiences they should pursue so they have to they have to follow their dream they have to follow their heart they have to be dedicated in what what they are doing they have to have a they should have good time with their friends in parallel and it would also be beneficial to spend time in different labs with different people of different cultural backgrounds ethical backgrounds i don't know if i use the right expression maybe they have to spend it's nice to spend time in different countries and to have multiple mentors for example um to be or to always try to be in a diverse and vibrant environment so these are my advices i don't want to be you know very specific because it's it's not really important i mean but if some follows all these things and mostly follows his or her heart yeah someone will be successful so you've touched a couple times now on mentorship has been really important um who were your mentors and what did they do to help you just as a person yeah mentors so you mean scientific mentors or in general mentors uh okay let's say in general mentors so the the list is the list i think is really large so to buy you know to begin i don't know from from my parents that they they are always supported every time in every success in every failure my wife who by the way she is expecting our child now so this is the you know this is the first public announcement that i'm doing congratulations she's very supportive she's always you know trying to convince me to give let's say a second opportunity or even a third opportunity to people my some of my advisors or supervisors so for example my my postdoc supervisor george malliaras who is really nice i mean he has his own way to to let's say motivate people to be hard-working but uh at the same time to to be open-minded he's a he's a really good not only mentor but a good friend and many other people max planck in our own institute blonde professor bloom my brother who is mother is for example he's he's working in the stock market so he's a he's he has a weird combination of a golden boy and a nerd i always you know remember him so he was he's sitting on on the desk um at the office and he has on on the one side he has two or three screens he's watching uh you know the stock market different indices i don't know nasdaq whatever i don't know how you call them and on the other side he has different equipments electronic equipment so for example i don't know oscilloscopes voltage generators whatever because he likes to fix things at the same time and he was you know the person when i was uh younger that she transferred to me this this this microbe of of of research although she was not a researcher or a scientist by himself and other other people my students of course the group members they are mentors for me really i'm not only their mentor they are also vendors for me because they are they are working really hard and what we see i mean the results that we we see basically it's it's their own work not my work i'm only i'm only you know monitoring the process and i'm trying to motivate them to know what they they do even better than me and yeah more or less these are the of course friends in in different straight stages of my life we had and we we still have really good time in many stages in my life they were the best let's say psychologists for me after a couple of years outside tonight so there are many different people oh we have had a question come in that i think is really interesting what challenges are opportunities for international collaboration you see in this moment and what do you think research especially international collaborative research will look like post pandemic hospital yeah i'm not trained sure i'm not you know this kind of person that i believe that you know by the time now that we have this condemning there is a switch and everything will be completely different as human beings you know we still have the need to interact with with physical presence i mean so i believe that after a while that the condemning will will go at the background uh i still believe that people will always need to have these exchanges between different lots going into gold harasses uh for you know maybe for communities or societies or countries which were not really developed in in in digital aspects i mean maybe this was a great opportunity for them i mean to catch up with other countries this this is a good thing that happened uh but i think yeah postponed i mean i think and i hope that the situation will be the same or even better yeah maybe with um with more digital tools but we still you know with we need this physical entire exchange between different universities exchange collaborations exchange of knowledge we will still all have these things and after i don't know in a year from now i guess or in a couple of years and as you know as a group i'm always happy to accept students for example i mean i want to learn from them and uh i hope that they also want to learn from us yeah and we are really open i mean all the time of course now there are specific regulations i mean today that we are talking i'm talking uh about you know under regular situations now so how has um covet 19 impacted your lab the lab now we are getting yeah this is this is a sensitive now question now don't worry so the situation is getting back to normal now of course it's with regulations in the now in the labs uh we have to to be connected a little bit more in a digital way of course and we realized that uh because there was no other choice for many people they didn't have time or they didn't have the means because of the lockdown to spend time on the lab we understood that there is also a great value of staying at home understand what you did as a phd for example student understood what you did in the last item of six months or something write down a report or a technical paper or whatever and think about your project from distance so if you you know if you if you are working intensively all the time you don't really have that you know this this this quality of time uh to to stay from distance and understand what you are doing so for me i mean it was it was from one side it was a hard time but on the other hand we all had the opportunity to understand you know ourselves uh our real needs as human beings because at the end i mean we had single needs and uh out of a sudden in one night that all disappeared and i for me it was it was a good experience i mean with of course with many serious side effects for for our communities of course yeah so are there any um lessons from this kind of time period that you think is going to um shift how your lab does things in the future like more working from home or something like that i always have this mentality that you know people go to the lab whenever only it's necessary so i don't want people around around you know the corridors just to be around the corridor so they have to be in the labs for spa for a specific reason a all these all the other side work can be done i mean whenever they want or wherever they want and so the lessons is that we can be as as you know as labs our uh as i don't know society as as our department we can be more flexible but still efficient it takes a little bit more effort to do that people have to be willing to communicate in a better way we should have this sense of of this community like sense that we share things because it's impossible i mean if we share labs and we have you know limitations of of capacity we all have to be a little bit flexible and we have to be willing to communicate with others and to also understand the other side the other person that we have in the same office um so these are these are all lessons and these are all you know the new skills that we have to to have for for the for the next phase uh of this pandemic i mean you know this although the end of it this is the end of the curve let's see so we still need some skills i mean to be still effective yeah very interesting um is there anything else that we haven't covered that you'd like to add something specific eh it's a really nice time of their life really some of them you know i i know that they are very busy they are some of them are very anxious for their lives for their degree and for their future but really it's a really nice period of their life because they are learning and not you know not all uh all careers are based on learning so it's it's a really nice period of their time so they have to enjoy that they have to work hard enjoy that make friendships and make connections and if they are dedicated and they if they have a vision their own vision i can define a vision so if they have their own vision everything will go awesome perfect for them with many well thank you so much of course yeah well thank you so much dr guppa dennis uh it looks like we're about a time for today thank you to uh you once again andrew purdue polytechnic uh for this um the opportunity to have this wonderful session a reminder this is going to be posted on the purdue honors college youtube channel and if you'd like to go back and rewatch it or revisit a moment or share it with a friend you can find it there thank you for your time and your attention and have a good day everyone you
