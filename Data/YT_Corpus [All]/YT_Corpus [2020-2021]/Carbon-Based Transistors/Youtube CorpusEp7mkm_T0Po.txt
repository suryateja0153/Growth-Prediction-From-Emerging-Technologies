 we are talking about semiconductors today yeah yeah yeah and um i finished our exam 2 concept map that i thought maybe you guys would find useful this is much like the last time when i gave you guys the concept map i'm just giving it a little earlier this time and here you can see all the connections right between the um uh the lectures the recitations the problem sets okay um the quizzes and uh the quizzes over here the goodie bags and the exam topics and speaking of the quizzes tomorrow there's a quiz and so you could look up here and say okay well what's going to be on that quiz right might cover some molecular orbital theory might cover uh the bandgap stuff that we did on monday and that you covered in recitation yesterday oh and your uh intermolecular forces we also do and you're asked to bring to the quiz um uh the voltmeter and these uh these large leds okay now i'll talk about that a little bit more about this in in in a in a few minutes okay so remember to bring that laura will also send a reminder email about that okay you have voltmeters you have vote meters how many of you have ever had use of how many of you this is the first time you're using a volt meter okay how many of you haven't used one but you've never seen one you've used it before but you've never had one this accurate as the 309 one right yeah oh you never know when you need a volt meter you should always carry it with you with the periodic table now on monday this is what we had i'm gonna this was a conduction band this was a valence band and then we had a conduction band and a valence band that were a little bit closer together and then we had this case where maybe it's uh it's it's filled up somewhere in the middle of a band and remember the valence band is filled with electrons and the conduction band is not right in in the simplest picture and this this this this difference in energy between this vbn right that's the vbm the maximum level of the valence band and the cbm the minimum level of the conduction band that energy difference is the gap of the sum of the material right here you can see energy gap equals zero well in this case it's a metal or if you want it's a conductor and we'll talk about why it's a conductor uh more on friday but a little bit today why metals are conductors today i really want to focus on this case all right so that's a metal when there's no gap in the material if the gap is large then that is an insulator insulator right oh what do i mean by large well what i mean is it's not in the range of this special case which would be say zero less than the gap less than around 3.5 electron volts this is the case that i want to talk about today i want to spend today talking about semiconductors those are those are called semiconductors let's write that here semi conductors uh sometimes semiconductors sometimes you'll see them called metalloids other you know sometimes you'll see them called insulators with small gaps they're all kind of right and and the reason but so metalloid thank you okay now the reason why we classified these and why this range of gap is so important is what i want to convey to you today these are really special materials these semiconductors okay now before i do that i i want to i want to just clarify one thing okay and i'm going to use diamond and graphite as an exam as as an example on monday what we did is we we talked about the concept of bands with a very simple 1d model right this was a 1d model of s orbitals 1s orbitals i said well if i have a mole of 1s orbitals then that goes into a band and i called it a 1s band right i would say well if you fill it in different ways that is what determines the properties but i want to be clear and i stress this on monday i want to stress it again all right whether this forms this and then the next that you know whether you get like a 1s that forms a band like this and then a 2s that forms a band like this and then another one you know maybe 2p like this or whether there's breaks in them or maybe these kind of overlap so you get like overlap and you get sort of something like that right all that depends on more than just those atomic orbitals it depends on more it depends on how these things are bonded this is such a great example i've got the same element here it's carbon there's nothing else in this system carbon pure carbon everywhere is carbon but on the one hand i've arranged it in a certain way and on the other hand i've arranged it in another way and their properties couldn't be more different right and and so so like you know just to take this a little further right if i if i think about diamond on the left diamond is an insulator diamond has a gap of five and a half electron volts five and a half electron volts it's an insulator right now is it but okay that makes me think of methane remember methane you have these sp3 states sp3 sp3 sp3 okay and the reason it formed sp3 is because all these h1 1s states came along right h h h these are one s's one s right and so carbon came along and it said well if i arrange if i got four of you here like this and i arrange myself if i arrange my orbitals in such a way that then i can arrange the atoms so that they're minimizing repulsions that gives me methane that gives me the ground state of methane but the only way to do that is to have four equivalent orbitals those are hybrid orbitals we talk about this when we talk about hybridization the idea being that if i took one of these and one of those right so now you can imagine how it's going to look you know all this now right there's a there's a 1s orbital of hydrogen you know that those will form a sigma and a sigma star and occupy that bonding orbital that's the idea of methane that's the idea of molecular orbital theory with some hybridization right and it's going to form those bonds along each direction but now i'm talking about something different i'm not talking about such a simple case i'm talking about one mole of sp3 that's what diamond is look again the carbon atoms have done the same thing they've said hey wait a second okay that's not four hydrogens it's like 10 to the 23rd carbons all in one small space how can we organize to lower our energy and so they form well we know this that it's going to form a band but it doesn't just form a band and then half fill it that's not what diamond does no actually diamond breaks this apart so that you have a huge gap and those are filled and that then those are not so this is not and the sp3 band in diamond breaks apart into a valence and a conduction band the valence band is full the conduction band is empty why well you don't need to learn the specifics of how to get from there to there but i wanted to show you how complicated this is i won't ask you whether the sp3 band splits or not i just wanted to show you how dependent this is because now look you can understand this now right so i got four electrons per atom going here there's a huge gap and then nothing in there that's diamond 5.5 ev gap one mole of sp3 in diamond now it depends on the structure if i had just put them together in some amorphous soup with no oh amorphous that's a word that's coming later but if i just put them together with no order i wouldn't get this this splitting if you take graphene which is one of those sheets and makes stacks and you got graphite it's another form of pure carbon in that case you've got your sp2 bonds to form in the plane and those also split and they fill but now you've got your pi bonds right and those don't split so in graphing right so in diamond so in graphite what you get is you've got your sp2s right you got a mole of those and you got your your peel your p electron remember those right now you do a mole of that and you got the same thing but see now you got these are the sp2 bands sp2 bands it also split and remember i've got my electrons here my sp2 electrons and those there but now i've got the pi bands that didn't split graphene graphite is a metal you can understand it by by looking at the bands of these materials now again let me emphasize i am not going to ask you to know when something splits like this or not why didn't the pie band split into two like these did when do two when does an s and a p become a single band versus an s band separated by a p band i'm not going to ask you to know that but i wanted you to see it it doesn't just depend on the initial states it depends on the structure right of those atoms depends on how those atoms are bonded together good okay now what about this semiconductor what about this semiconductor well if we take a semiconductor and we look at it i told you this on monday there are two things that you can do right in your goody bag especially one is you can take an electron and you can shine light on it and it's going to excite this electron up just like in the bohr atom right you can absorb photons if the photon energy is the energy between one state and another we did a lot of this earlier but see in a semiconductor remember i've got an almost infinite number of states here and so and so what i need is for that photon there's not an exact value here there's a continuum ah but here it's forbidden just like in the bohr atom there's no states there's no electron right so here the energy the photon the energy of the photon absorbed let's write this out absorbed has to be greater than the energy of the gap right this is the energy of the gap this is the energy of the gap now by the same token i can take the same semiconductor and run it the other way i can put a current on it and feed electrons electrons from current so i can attach it to a battery and there you go this is a semiconductor where i'm literally all i'm doing is i'm feeding electrons into its conduction band and but now when those electrons fall down into the valence band they emit a photon photon emitted and just so i have room with energy of the photon emitted is going to be exactly equal to the energy of the gap you can see that because these electrons i might i might inject them into the conduction band anywhere but they're going to wind up very very very quickly going to this minimum conduction band state and that gets me to another important point which is on the absorption side i can overshoot this like i said i can i can absorb higher than the gap i can't absorb lower but i can absorb higher and if i do if i absorb higher than the gap right so let's say this is my state then that electron so if my photon comes in and it kicks an electron up really high it's a high energy photon then that electron very quickly will go back down and that's called thermalization so what happens is that electron electron loses energy loses energy to heat to get to the cbm okay we'll come back to this later that's thermalization so the electron can be kicked up by light to any level but it's going to very very quickly go to the cbm that's why when i inject it that's why these are the same color you know these are these are high quality leds clearly oh they work that's a good thing um and you know so the batteries might be slightly different yeah and the currents might be different a little bit i might be injecting electrons at different parts of these conduction bands but this is always green and this is always red and that's because those electrons very quickly get down to the cbm and the vbm and the cbm and the vvm are determined by the semiconductor inside by the semiconductor inside okay well you've also got you know so this is a photon emitter right here i've made a light emitter right but i've also got a detector which is what i said on monday so now i take an led and i hold it and it goes in tight this is what's inside of the emitter it's the same thing it's a semiconductor but these two semiconductors have different band gaps that's why the light is different they have different band gaps now i've got one with some band gap and i hook it up to my voltmeter and and i just look is there a current or not right if the if this thing conducts through it it means that electrons have been promoted from here to here and that's something we're going to talk about today electrons cannot move around easily if they're in the valence band but once they're in that conduction band they're free how do i get them there well you've got power shine red light on it does it conduct check the volt meter right i'm literally holding two semiconductors and doing these two processes right here in in each hand it's a power that i have i have semiconductor making light semiconductor absorbing light or maybe not if i shine red on this and i get no current well it means that the energy of the photon from a red you know from a red light source is too low it's maybe it's able to excite it up to here but not up to here given whatever the gap in here is you see that right so the semiconductor has this powerful maybe i take a different semiconductor and red excites it or maybe it doesn't so i go to a higher energy photon right you are with this goody bag you're touching and feeling semi-conductor physics and chemistry and chemistry because band gaps and materials are rare you see if you look at the periodic table and you classify it by metals metals and non-metals right so insulators conductors and then these weird things in between there aren't that many of them there aren't that many of them but as you can see these are really really important technological materials right why because you can this is visible light the semiconductor range here is in the range of light we care about visible uv so i've got an electronic material where the electrons in it can be can interact with currents small currents even and wavelengths of light that are things we can see you can imagine how important this could be for example for making leds but i need a lot more flexibility in in in my material set and that's where chemistry comes in so this is one why this matters for today so look you know i mentioned that getting red was hard back in the day for color tv because the red phosphors were difficult to make for leds it was blue and in fact there was a lot of work around gallium nitride here's gallium nitride in one structure oh notice this there's gallium nitride it's not on here darn it gallium nitride and other structures have different gaps oh there it is there's one okay but the point was they wanted blue they wanted blue and they needed to make a material that was both cheap to make and lasted so it didn't like degrade and gave you blue light and that was really hard and that's what the nobel prize was given for in 2014 because without blue you can't make white light right so there's all sorts of technologies you simply can't go into with leds until you get blue how did it happen it happened because of chemistry because people figured out how to change the how to take one element and another element and then maybe alloy them together maybe you take gallium nitride and you alloy a little bit of aluminum in here and now all of a sudden that means mixing in right now all of a sudden you've got a different band gap okay band gap engineering is really the centerpiece of the semiconductor revolution now the conductivity we've been talking about connectivity and we'll talk about metals on friday okay here we are insulator is really low at least conducting 10 to the minus 25th hook your voltmeter up to teflon 10 to the minus wood right low conducting materials but but we're interested in these and look these are kind of in between they're not very good conductors that's why they're called semiconductors right yeah but the fact of the matter goes back to what i've been saying and this is the next point i want to talk about which is i cannot i cannot have so in a semiconductor there's no electrons if there's no electrons in the conduction band then there's no electron conduction now i've said this before i said this on monday i said it already that why not on monday is it well the electrons are stuck what does that mean they're stuck stuck in the bonds stuck in the antibonds they're stuck in states now the point is here that here you've got these this valence band is filled now if i want an electron to move through a material right which is what conductivity is after all by the way siemens conductance one of our ohms okay if i want electrons to to move into material they need freedom they need freedom right what does that mean well it means that i i'm trying to move through this wire and and for an electron freedom means i can go to any state that's nearby state a wave function a state of probability that i can move to and then to that one and then over here and then oh there's there's something there i don't want to be and i got to go this way that's a bad thing over there it's scattering me i'll go this way but if electrons don't have the ability to move into a free state they're not going to conduct that's why you got to get the electron up here why because the the conduction band i shouldn't really fill this in i'm just showing you empty states there the conduction band has 10 to the 24th states freedom freedom so as soon as an electron gets up there it's like oh i go anywhere i want i can be there i can be there i can move in response to this field that i'm that's pushing at me right i can conduct i can't do that unless i have conduction unless i get electrons into the conduction man this is okay now this is why you can see right there metals are clearly good conductors based on our band picture because those electrons near that you know that line there you fill them up and they're halfway in a band but right up above their almost infinitesimally small energy away is an empty state and another empty state so that's why those these ones you can see it's going to be hard i'm going to have to shine really high energy light to even get or or really high temperatures again semiconductors are special because their gaps are right in that range where i can get electrons to go from the valence band to the conduction band in different ways and there's two different ways that i want to talk about okay now the first way is simply with heat and this is why i mentioned this on monday actually no matter what there's some probability for an electron to have a high enough thermal energy yeah electrons get hot too right everybody feels the heat and so it but so that thermal energy can be enough to get the electron to knock it up above to knock it up above so with thermal energy you can get um let's see at room temperature for silicon so this is the case of silicon which has a 1.1 electron volt gap silicon 1.1 electron volt band gap this is a really important semiconductor and for silicon at room temperature i got about 10 to the 10th electrons in the conduction band okay per centimeter cubed of material this is how we think about it we think about how many of these do i have per volume right it's a good way to measure it these are also an electron in a conduction band also is called a carrier so you say for silicon at room temperature i will have just because i can't help it because there's that many are getting i'll have about 10 to the 10th elect carriers carriers in in the conduction now what the carrier is a carrier of electricity that's why it's called the carrier right it carries electricity so those are the ones that are carriers the ones that made it up now but if i go to 600 so now i'm going to go to 600 kelvin oh we only use kelvin kelvin is the thermodynamic energy scale temperature scale 10 to the 15th carriers per centimeter cubed this seems like a big number but is it a big number what's a big number we know and like in this class the mole so like roughly ish is this a big number per centimeter cubed or not it's actually very small right but i i need them to be there if i want better conductivity if i want conduction in these semiconductors i got to put electrons up in the veil up in the conduction band remember that i i just as as a important point i mentioned the energy of room temperature the thermal energy of room temperature kbt is about 0.025 electron volts so that seems way smaller than 1.1 ev it is but that's because that's not what temperature really looks like temperature is a distribution is a distribution now you don't need to know that for the band gaps we're going to come back to distributions boltzmann distributions when we talk about reactions reaction kinetics later but that's why at room temperature the tails right hot means a range of energies hotter means a wider range of energies and it's those tails that have enough energy to get over the gap and into the conduction band okay it's those tails that's why i got a little bit of electrons that get up there at room temperature now if you look at a plot this is here's a great way there's the log conductivity of silicon it's from april and there's the log connectivity on this side of tungsten that's a metal totally different behavior how is that possible well we're going to explain the metal on friday today we're interested in this i'm this one now we understand thermal energy excites carriers into the place where they can be free and conduct right so as i increase the temperature hotter and hotter there's the temperature in kelvin right i just gave you examples from down here and now we're going higher and higher i get conductivity up orders of magnitude higher for silicon you know why now i'm populating i'm getting over this gap and i'm populating the conduction band so the answer is we just need to run our semiconductor industry and our phones and our lights at around a thousand kelvin right no problem all our devices no that's obviously not a good idea how do we get around this the answer oh such a good word it's chemistry chemistry gets us chemistry saves us as always you've got to know your chemistry and in particular this is not the doping that you may read about in the news related to olympic athletes this is this is the introduction this is the introduction of some small amount small amount of an impurity and impurity is something that wasn't there normally it's like something i mixed in that's not normally there but if i put a small amount of something in it then i can tune the properties and in this case i'm talking about i'm talking about the connectivity okay so how does this work if i look at this case so i'll do one case here all right i've got my silicon atoms arranged in this solid that gave me a band gap and again that is due to the arrangement of them if i didn't arrange them in this particular way i might not have that bad gap i might not have the same band structures right it depends but this is what i get for the silicon arrangement when the bang gap is 1.1 ev which is the one we use in most of our electronics right but the thing is i want so this would be silicon this is just silicon by itself valence band and here's the conduction band cb vb now i want to add electrons into this material and so you can just kind of imagine how this would work right if i look at if i just look at a lewis dot diagram for silicon let's just forget about the structure for a second okay silicon has these four valence electrons so you can imagine you know silicon might look something like this right and okay i'm going along and i'm going along it's tetrahedral and stuff but now i'm going to take one out i'm going to take this out and i'm going to make it phosphorus well that what what is phosphorus it's wait where did it go huh panic and then i'm recreating what happens for you guys i found it ah oh that was close but yep phosphorus is right there it's right next to silicon it's group 15 instead of 14. it's got one but it just has one extra electron right so maybe it could do the same thing but then have this one extra electron that's doping where does it go because it's all about freedom it looks down it says wait a second there's no states here i can go to no states i can't go anywhere here so i will have a state because i have picked phosphorus carefully and because of the way the chemistry and the bonding works with phosphorus in silicon this will introduce a state near the conduction band and that's the key so now we've got the valence band and we've got the conduction band and what's happened is there's a new level here that is called the donor level that level is where the extra extra p electron goes it can't go in here remember this is all filled right so now i've doped with dope with p and oh but look if i've got an electron here now this difference in energy is really small it's really small i've engineered it this way i've thought about this so if i put phosphorus in here that extra electron isn't sitting far away anymore from the conduction band in fact now it's so close that room temperature just kicks it right on up so effectively it's going to go up here because that's a small delta e between the donor level and the conduction band this is how doping works this is how doping works right so i put a phosphorous atom in there's an extra electron that comes out of that the extra electron needs a state it gets a state that's called the donor state donor makes sense right because it's donating an electron into the conduction band right once i get the electron into the conduction band i'm home free because now i've done what temperature was doing before but i did it with chemistry right and and so you could ask questions like this right how much phosphorus do you need to substitutionally dope substitution meant just what you substitution was i took a silicon atom and i substituted it that's substitutional doping to substitutionally dope a mole of silicon and get a free electron density of 5 times 10 to the 17th i'm going big here because look temperature and gazoon type temperature okay maybe i'm willing to run my semiconductor in a really hot room my phone at 600 kelvin i'm still only at 10 to the 15. i want 10 to the 17th now how much phosphorus do i need well you can solve that problem i'll just write down a couple of the steps right so the volume of one mole of silicon is uh one mole right times 28.1 grams per mole oh and i got the density on there too right divided by 2.33 grams per centimeter cubed how did i get the density i looked it up in the periodic table right and so one mole of silicon is going to give me 12 centimeters cubed of silicon one mole of silicon is 12 centimeters cubed but each i need 5 times 10 to the 17th electrons in the conduction band right per centimeter cubed that's they see why per centimeter cube is a good measure here so that means i need 12 times that total right so i need 12 times that so i need 5 times 10 to the 17th p atoms why p why do i need that many p atoms times 12 right it's 5 times 10 to let me just write my units here to be very careful p atoms per centimeter cubed times 12 centimeters cubed that's how many p atoms i need in this mole of silicon to get what but it's one to one because each p atom had one extra electron those other electrons are in the bonds they're not going into the conduction band it had one for one one electron went to this donor state went into the conduction band per phosphorus atom so if i want that many carriers if i want that many free electrons i need that many atoms well you guys can look up the phosphorus grams per mole and you can get that this is 0.0003 grams of phosphorus that's really not much you see why it's called an impurity right you see why it's called an impurity that's not much i i have all this silicon and i only need 0.0003 grams of phosphorus and i've bumped up the number of carriers by orders of magnitude not only that i've done something really important as well and you can see this because now if i plot something like you know temperature versus number of carriers well you know you saw the graph for temperature before right it was it was it was like this that's the graph from a couple slides ago but now if i do it with chemistry it's flat i can choose at any i can until the temperature gets really hot right i could give myself more room here because that's kind of the point right number carriers i can make this now flat from doping from temperature and and so you can see okay at a certain point at a certain point yeah you know the the the temperature goes up up up and a certain point the temperature is going to be so hot that i'm adding electrons even beyond this right but you saw what temperatures are a thousand degrees kelvin no this allows me to have a predictable flat number of carriers in the conduction band no matter the temperature just think about how important that is this is why semiconductors were kind of discovered in the 1800s but it wasn't until physicists and chemists were able to control the band gap and how to put carriers in and out of it until they could really work on the semiconductor revolution which is what led to snapchat did i get snapchat still used yeah i knew that slack okay now you can do the same thing going the other way you can do the same thing going the other way because if i've now put if i now put gallium so if i dope with gallium well you see gallium has one too few electrons and so if i dope with gallium what i have so the gallium is there you see where is it it's on the other side where's silicon okay silicon right phosphorus is over there group 15. silicon is group 14. gallium is group 13. one fewer electrons but it really wants to make those four bonds the material isn't happy if you break one right and so what does it do it it steals an electron it takes it it says i need an electron to be happy so it takes one out and that's called an acceptor level acceptor level where what's happened is the gallium has actually pulled an electron out of there and that leaves behind a positive charge this is called a hole that's called a hole a hole is and think about it if i take an electron off of an atom it's positively charged if i take an electron out of the vbm there's a positive charge in there that's really important because these positive charges effectively are like electrons they're like negative charges but they're positive so they also can conduct they also can conduct right and that's really important so these are these are two different types and you can imagine the brilliance of the naming these are p-type because it's a positive charge and these are n-type because it's a negative charge those are n-type semiconductors what does that mean i've used a little chemistry sprinkled a little something with extra electrons it's got negative charge in the conduction band p-type p means positive it means that i have introduced states here because i needed an electron and say i need an x-ray i'm going to grab it from somebody i don't care who and so you create a positive charge in the valence band that can conduct electricity just like a negative charge in the conduction band can this is what the entire semiconductor revolution has been based on and really so much of the focus was on simply taking these elements in particular silicon and germanium but then many many more as i showed you in the led graph many many more have been used to make to engineer these simple what are seemingly simple properties right the band gap and the doping and so i'm not going to go through this in detail i'm just leaving it here so you have it but you get charts like this right so like here you have okay carbon is up there and what can you do well if you dope it with boron you can see that it's p-type you see that because i've got one fewer electron than carbon so i'm going to grab that from the valence band create a positive charge p-type right i could also dope silicon and germanium and i'd say silic carbon silicon germanium so i'm looking in this middle column doping it with either side that's it why can't i put you know why can't i put aluminum in carbon why didn't they list that well because there if i try to put an aluminum inside the carbon network the network gets all messed up doesn't fit so that's also important right can it fit but it's through this that the semiconductor revolution started it's only through this this kind of control and this knowledge of atomic orbitals really if you think about it right and the structure of the atom now i'm not going to talk about transistors but this did lead to um the development of the transistor if i take there's a night really nice video there it's like eight nine minutes i suggest you wait until your friday night uh social um but you know if i take a p-type and i take an n-type and i take a p-type and i put them together some really important things happen so important that it led to this which is the very first transistor that's the transistor it's it's a dope semiconductor one type next to a dope semiconductor another type now those are the three uh people bardeen shockley and bertain who who won the nobel prize for this work and that's the first transistor does anybody know how many transistors we make today per second that's the that's the only time metric we can use yeah it's something around 10 trillion we make 10 trillion transistors per second today this is a big deal this started at all and it's all about chemistry and then the physics of this device right this led to diodes and photodiodes this led to the whole revolution and what i want to point out here is and you know that this also led it called on chemistry so i love this chart this is actually unfortunately they didn't update it but this is intel's an intel chart that they used to show and what they're showing is how are they making chips right how much of the periodic table do they need to make the current chip well in the 80s there's almost nothing lit up here there's a little bit over here that you can't see stuff we just talked about but look at the 90s and look at the 2000s and today it's 75 of this it's literally 75 percent of this is in your phone now why the reason is exactly what we've talked about today because they need more and more and more flexibility and ways to tune the band gap and the semi-conducting properties of these materials and the doping why do they need new waves because they're making them so darn small you know they're so small it gets harder to figure out how to do it right how to do it in a way that's also stable over time for example right so they need new chemistry this is a call to action to the field of chemistry and chemistry responded right and there's there's the the data on the cost i thought that was kind of cool okay so you know these are orders of magnitude of of uh a cost and and number of transistors um and i'll i'll say one more one more why this matters um because the semiconductor is also the same thing we use uh to to take electricity from the sun to generate electricity from the sun and you can imagine this is what i you know you are doing that in your goody bag right you're you're literally using this semiconductor right to generate electricity okay by shining light on it right why is this important well i like this comparison right all the coal oil gas known to humans is what you get from the sun in about 20 days um this is the sun now we've seen the sun before this is how we see it in our class the sun is is a spectrum of different wavelengths and intensities and this is already on planet earth right because you can see those chemistries that are in the atmosphere have already absorbed right remember ozone down here helping us with uv radiation and out here you got a lot of water and other things co2 those are absorbing that's why it doesn't look smooth yeah but the point is i you know i want a semiconductor to absorb as much of this as possible if i want a good solar cell right i should absorb as much of this as possible um and but the problem is that it's a constrained optimization problem so let's let's see if i uh i'll just use this if i have a you know i'm now this goes back to bore by the way remember bore absorbing light it's just now i've got an actual solid i don't have an atom right i've got a solid which is what you need if you want to generate a current i got to hook leads up to it right so but my solid is a semiconductor and you can imagine say well if my gap were really really tiny then any amount hey almost any amount of this spectrum would uh would excite electrons right and and i might grab most of that spectrum i might absorb most of it but the problem with that is that then all of these will thermalize like i said in the beginning loss to heat loss to heat so if my band gap is really small i absorb a lot of the light but i lose most of it as heat but if my band gap is really big then there's so much of this light that i cannot absorb so i want a big but by the way also the voltage that you get out of your solar cell is essentially this band gap so if i get to really really small band gaps i have almost no voltage that's bad too right but if my band gap is too big oh i'll get a high voltage no you won't absorb any photons so it's a constrained problem it's a constrained problem and you can actually solve this and you can plot in fact here's a little animation oh energy comes in from the sun it excites an electron this is how powerpoint sees it leaves behind a hole and you get them out that's the solar cell okay and this is the chart i want to show you because you see if if i take this constraint into account that i don't absorb light if the gap is too big but i do absorb light and it all goes to heat if the gap is too small it means there's some sweet spot there's some sweet spot and that's what is plotted here this is the band gap of a semiconductor and this is the maximum that that solar cell efficiency could be that's the maximum that it could be for that gap so you can see the sweet spot is right there is right there that's a thermodynamic derivation called shock liqueur of the maximum efficiency you could ever get out of a single material and notice if you put the materials here silicon is 90 of the solar cells you buy today and and notice that it's not quite at its maximum potential it's also not quite in the middle where you'd want it should have a slightly higher gap you get to higher efficiency right but these materials out of gallium arsenide they do have the right what is gs that's not an element gallium arsenide it does have a a better gap but it's it's much more expensive right and so we go and a lot of solar cell research is on getting as close to this point as you can see you guys on friday you
