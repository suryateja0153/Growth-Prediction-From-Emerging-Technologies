 hi my name is Paul Ritchie my name is Fred fort and we created the star control series [Music] well before star control to the air Quan masters there was star control 1 and we began it in late 88 early 89 and the game industry back then was quite a bit different than it is now in the kind of games people played quite different so if you think back then games like Empire I don't know if you've played that but it's a great sort of expand and conquer game and it comes I think from an early school system game running probably on a teletype what other kind of games were there back when we made star control 1 or even earlier than that well it's about that time start control 1 well you yourself made some games yes world tour Agathe golf I was still in the corporate world or back in the corporate world I started making games in the early 80s well PC games we had made a golf game and that was because of the console and cartridge crash back in the mid 80s so a lot of us shifted over to PC development thinking like IBM pcs are kind of formal and serious and this is going to be around for a while and of course they had like 4 colors if you're lucky and so in terms of the other games that were available around that same time part of what was exciting about that was the appearance of new computers like the Amiga which were just revolutionary in improvement in terms of number of colors and the pixel size and digital sound yeah that was maybe one of the most big developments because before then we've been fiddling around with sound synthesizer cards like the ad-lib just really really primitive digital sound but the amiga had 8-bit sound that could run at sample rates that didn't sound like horrible monsters and that was part of why we got into digital music before start control to the air Quan masters was star control one famous battles of the irk on Alliance conflict I can't remember it had a big long name but we were playing games ourselves back then and so we were what were you playing oh well we played a lot of empire it wasn't it wasn't designed back then but it was something that kept us occupied on the long lonely nights of between between takes of our game it was a transition from the days of computers like the Commodore 64 through the PC which was of course evolving in graphics up to the Amiga which was the appearance of this great new computer with with new kinds of capabilities so we were inspired by some of the new computers that were coming out like the Amiga and we were playing games like lemmings or blood money from DMA designs virus virus and can't remember who made that DMA designs later went on to do the first Grand Theft Auto games so there was this evolution of game developers working on PCs and very small games too slowly getting larger and larger but I think perhaps the most influential games to us was space Wars the stand-up arcade game which was implemented in Berkeley although it was based on a game that ran on PDP once at MIT and I think it was made in 1962 but we were also influenced by games like star flight by Greg Johnson and binary systems which had started expanding this idea of what a science-fiction game could be we were asked to port star control 1 to the Amiga and so as part of that we looked at games that were on the Amiga and the first thing we noted almost immediately was the digital audio that it brought to it and that really influenced some of the directions we went going forward with star control 2 and especially we played Blood Money lemmings my wrists certainly thereafter fairytale adventure I think one of the things about the Amiga was it was made by a crew of guys and gals who were really dedicated to high quality audio visual capability and they believed in the potential of developers than taking advantage of that and some of the same people who worked on the chipset for the tari 800 and the early Atari computers worked on the Amiga guy named Jay miner and those systems really celebrated color in ways that the other computers didn't they really celebrated processing power or kind of the future of classical computing but then on the Amiga the demos were all about you know the sound of a bouncing ball or something that's just visually spectacular and that was so compelling and inspiring to us making games so when we talk about starting star control one history before that's a little important both Fred and I had been making games for for almost a decade before we started on star control 1 I've been working with a variety of teams mostly published through Electronic Arts and I had been working for a company while I was gonna tend in college and they made games for the Japanese market so I worked on a number of Japanese computers that weren't even sold over in the United States and produced games that were sold in Japan and I had been working under contracts with Electronic Arts and they were publisher developer contracts very unlikely to be signed these days but effectively they were deal between you and the publisher you would make a game for the publisher they would sell it you'd get a royalty back and then when you were done you'd sort of go your separate ways well I finished up a contract a game for Electronic Arts called World Tour golf and decided that I wanted to make a science-fiction arc on over-the-phone game an arc on was an earlier game I'd made with John Freeman and n Westfall back in the very early days of Electronic Arts but I wanted to do a science fiction game that combined space Wars you know that high-speed action through your fingers and then also kind of a person versus person hybrid of strategy and action so I drew up some drawings and eventually I decided the best way to pitch it to Electronic Arts was to mock-up one of their ads they had a very particular cool ad style back then so I made this advertisement for a game called star control and I showed you know a dreadknot and other ships fighting each other and it wasn't exactly what we ended up making for sure but my producer at that time ended up moving to accolade games which was a spin-off of Activision from the old and she said hey I can get you a much better contract a 3-game deal working with accolades so I signed up with them at that point it was just me and just me doing three games seemed even unlikely for me because I'm not really a programmer so I was very fortunate that we had a common friend before we get away from our condo I want to mention that and it's it was obvious to us because we intended it that way but star con is really our con with an st in front of it our con being a strategy game on top of a one-on-one combat game and that's what star control one was I was doing video games in the early 80s as I was going through college and when I graduated with a degree in computer science I decided that I needed to do something that was corporate and I went to the Silicon Valley and I worked for some graphics companies I did that for a few years I was in the wilderness and eventually I said why am I not doing something I like versus something I think I should be doing and so the company I worked at there was a couple of mutual friends two people who grew up with Paul they knew I wanted to leave and they knew Paul needed a partner and so they introduced us to each other yeah we were going to a game night board game night at Greg Johnston's house and Greg's the one of the designers of star flight and toejam and Earl and Orly drama a story and a ton of great games anyway he had a regular game night at his house and so we sort of had a blind date there and decided yeah let's let's start working on this game and very rapidly start control evolved into what it became from the earlier design but one of the secrets of my success is having great friends so in high school I stumbled into an artist friends named arrow Otis and a writer friend named Matt gender and to sort of make money at D&D conventions we wrote some books of monsters and treasure and magic spells for use in role-playing games and ultimately that led to Errol and I getting jobs at TSR hobbies and working on Dungeons and Dragons and a D&D in the early days and he's quite a famous artist from that time then when I came back from cold Wisconsin - nice beautiful warm Bay Area and or Nia I had some familiarity with computers and computer games and I had run into a gent at a D&D convention who had founded one of the very first computer game companies called automated simulations and we founded freefall games and did to of Electronic Arts first two games along with another friend Robert Leyland who ended up programming Electronic Arts contract number one and he'll come back later both as helping us on star control one particularly on the Sega Genesis and then later on he comes back as the hardware inventor for Skylanders about 20 years later and so he's absolutely essential to the success of that he also has a technique in star control 1 & 2 of planetary gravity whip which is called the Leyland gravity with after he was the one who pioneered that in our play testing first Paul had agreed to do three games with accolade so when I came on board he actually was trying to run two games at the same time it took a little while for us to find our footing and our work rhythm so star control one was kind of a honeymoon period where we were learning each other's work habits and what worked and what didn't work and it maybe wasn't as as good as it would have been if we had had an ongoing relationship but we still think we did a pretty good job with that yeah so we began the project in late 1988 Fred actually just finished up his job and joined in early 1989 and we started with this premise of let's do the most atomic component of gameplay which is flying a spaceship and shooting missiles and so pretty much the first thing we made was a two-player version of asteroids and Fred was able to get the controls right and get the collision between the missiles and the other ships and the asteroids and the collision is really beautiful by the way it's like pixel perfect you can shoot a laser across an enemy ship and you'll just see that collision dance right along the edge of it that's really important I think for a PvP game to have crisp responsive controls so from there you know we knew more or less the direction we were going but we wanted to get spaceship combat just right and so we began building other alien ships and it was important to us that each alien ship was highly differentiated and it began this idea of asymmetric PvP gameplay that we've used over and over since then and what it means is unlike say Street Fighter where your characters are supposedly balanced with one another our ships weren't balanced at all one on one one could be very weak and one could be very strong but the idea was your fleet of ships your selection of ships in total was as strong as someone else's and then it came down to which matchup did you find and one game reviewer called it rock scissors vapor which I thought was a great expression there had to be two sides there's the hierarchy in the Alliance side one one was nominally bad and one was nominally good and so that was the setting for the strategic part of the game where there was a globular cluster of stars that looked like it was rotating around in 3d and the sides were positioned in different typically opposite each other in this cluster and and the cluster was connected via paths and whenever you met at the cluster at at a at a single star whenever opposite sides met it would resolve in space combat where whichever ships met at that star would resolve in this one-on-one space combat where that was asymmetric and when one ship lost he'd picked the next one Intel until there were no more ships left and then whoever was left would win that star there was also a separate mode which we called melee and star control one where you could fight the hierarchy which was composed of seven races and the Alliance which was also composed of seven races and when we were coming up with the alien races I mean if you look at the very first sketches I did for the game you can see the archetypes you know there's a Battlestar Galactica like fighter ship there is a sort of triangular space Wars style ship and those end up being like our starting points and foundations for some of the ships but then ultimately we start telling each other stories about you know well why are these guys launched in fighters well maybe someone's you know commanding them to and who's commanding them and wow this is the biggest ship so these guys need to be leading and then what do we want to call them know they're an old alien race so let's use the word ore which means old in some ancient language and Quan because it just sounds cool so that's how we're Quan came to be and then Fred drew a sort of a crescent-shaped spaceship and that ended up becoming the yay hot and so then we said well it needs to have a shield so it was a very iterative kind of layer at a time and each time we would make a new alien ship we didn't want to use the ideas we used before and then we started figuring out that there were styles of play there was distance so like the human ship is largely about remaining away from the other opponent and shooting across the screen whereas the yay hot is about getting in close but having very high speed use of your shield and we balanced all of these powers using energy consumption so you had an energy meter and your different powers use different amounts of energy and your ship regenerated energy and different rates and in different ways and so all of that controlled how you flew the ship and in particular how you used it against another enemy but it's not like we had all of that defined up front and we were just following a recipe we would it was really important for us to test our designs immediately so we would we would make a ship and we'd throw it in there and give it some powers and we'd say this is no fun let's change it or this this needs a better sound or it was all very iterative with playtesting not so much a formal design that we were trying to follow and then as we were going through we knew that the humans were on a good guy side because of course humans are good guys and then we wanted to add in some more humanoid characters so I think we added the cyrene on the hierarchy side and they just started off as these sort of beautiful attractive powerful women they end up being much more significant in star control to in a way what we did was tell very short summary sentences about each of our alien races the show fixed ETA hot melon or May sorry that's star control 2d burn her and then in star control two we sort of had to figure out why it was all of these races behaved like this in a way that kind of makes sense and is interesting so why is it that you have an alien race in New York Wan that want to go around enslaving people that's a bizarre thing to do it's very energy consumptive you know you could be at home watching TV why are you doing that so there is a certain amount of sorting out the psychology so whereas star control one is this tight strategy action game but fairly superficial in terms of story I think we really wanted to go in and investigate those aliens and that's what pretty much led to start control to in terms of thinking back before star control 2 and what happened with star control 1 we were really excited about releasing star control whining we loved the game I played it every day with Greg Johnson we had these grudge matches and we still kind of have a grudge about it and I wrote an article on strategy this very detailed article for computer gaming world on strategy and it felt like we had created something that mattered in terms of fun and so we wanted to follow it up so so I started thinking about a sequel and at this point Fred actually led the creation of the Amiga and a lot of the Sega Genesis version and that was a maturation of technique and technology for the digital sound yeah that's where we learned about mod music which was an Amiga phenomenon which is all of the music and star control to our mod files which were pioneered on the Amiga and that's what the digital sound is what prompted me to to actually implement digital sound on a PC speaker which had never been I don't think has ever been done before or since on a released game yeah now you see nowadays your PC box kind of goes beep and maybe makes 2 beeps if something's wrong but back in those days there was a speaker in there that people did all their sound through unless you had like tons of money and you could buy an ad-lib sound border we're really rich and can get a roll into mt-32 sound kit so making that speaker assumed enough different positions to simulate some kind of waveform was a real remarkable thing to do and also at the same time reading the keyboard and doing graphics doing all these things simultaneously we take that for granted now but it was kind of hard to do that fact then so after we shipped stock control 1 on the PC we were asked to do ports to not only the Sega Genesis but also the Amiga and the Amiga especially opened our eyes because it it's supported digital audio and star control one was all synthesized we shipped star control 1 in 1990 and so this was at the end of 1990 beginning of 1991 while we when we were doing the ports and when we were doing the ports Paul was was getting ahead on the design of star control - and he was able to hear the digital audio and in fact converted some of the audio samples for star control 1 into digital audio for the Amiga and then we incorporated that into the Sega Sega Genesis when we began porting star control to the Amiga and to the Sega Genesis it was 1990 maybe 1991 and we wanted to find a new digital sound format but that required searching it out there were no books there was no internet exactly the way we think of it so we ended up going to bulletin board sites BBS sites where you could upload and download files hunting for things named dot mod which told us it was a digital sound module and there was one from the first doom game that was awesome called worm sine I can remember the name of it I still hear it in my head and we ended up looking for how do we play back these files and I think where did you end up finding I don't know where we ended up finding it but we ended up finding saw software somebody had written in Finland and the reason we know it was written in Finland is because all the comments were in Finnish so we had to re reverse engineer the Finnish language to determine what exactly was happening in the software but we did we did make use of the software which was sort of the base base for our mod player on the PC what that told us was that the artists who were making this sound weren't this music weren't the same musicians that we were used to using for games they were somewhere out there and so that leads to star control 2 because we embraced digital audio completely so we had to find a collection of artists whom we didn't know we'd never met and that led to our famous infamous mod music competition we also didn't have very much money to spend on music so we had to get creative about how the contest would operate where there would be a fairly substantial first prize and then a million second prizes that were not very substantial from my side started with taking this idea of alien races those we wanted to work with person versus person combat with spaceships and then saying how do we expand out into the other aspects of sort of star faring fantasy and whether it's Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica or even books from the ancient past Larry Niven and Jack Vance we have built into us a sense of what people do when they go out to have an adventure in space they're in the planetary orbit they take off from a planet they're in planetary orbit they send landing-parties down to the surface they go into hyperspace they meet aliens they talk with them they fight with them they trade with them and ultimately they discover some grand conflict that you as the hero play this absolutely crucial role very unlikely hero story and you save the day and so it was figuring out how do we pull all of that together in a way that we can actually implement and then what are the parts that turned out really boring and how do we throw them away and replace them because there's quite a bit of that too so the controls in star control are based on space Wars and anyone who's tried to play star controller star control 2 knows that there's an adjustment phase when you start playing because they're really unlike any other game and based on the cert the cons are the standup arcade version you have buttons that are sort of rotate left rotate right thrust forward fire and special and so you have these inertial controls that I just love to pieces some people maybe not so much but they come from those games however they introduced a very specific problem when we translated them to the PC the reason it was a problem is because we really wanted to support two people playing on the same keyboard using their keys in quick succession and sometimes thrusting for a long time or turning for a long time that multiple keys would be pressed simultaneously on PCs that's in theory allowed on their keyboard but what we discovered fairly quickly was that each keyboard could be different and different keys could be locked out so somebody might be turning left but couldn't for us tat the same time or the person he was playing against couldn't fire when this person was pressing his thrust key so we we solved it in the the easiest way we knew how which was to supply an additional program along with the the game that allowed them to probe their keyboard and see which keys could be all be pressed simultaneously without locking somebody out and so they were able to configure their keyboard hopefully in ways that worked for them so that they they weren't playing twister on the keyboard that allowed them to then play without interfering with each other and it exposed this this truth about hardware which is it wasn't consistent at all the surface that the players interact with typing that worked but what's happening underneath is totally different seemingly from keyboard to keyboard and of course our development keyboards were the best we ever found because we didn't run into this problem when we were making the game it was our publishers our producers at accolade or like this isn't working and we've tried to figure it out then like No everyone's different so we have to let everybody custom-crafted and we've talked to people who would play melee like several times every day and they and their friend would like be cramped really close to one another trying to fight and one person was saying that he his hands were almost injured by the postures he had to create that brings up a more general problem of PC development which was that each PC was its own beast it's not like a console where every console is exactly the same so besides keyboards and keyboard lockout there were sound card issues and graphics card issues and just operating system issues that had to be Qaid so whatever you system you were testing on wasn't necessarily representative of the general public or or even even a significant segment of the population we didn't experience this keyboard problem for months you know maybe almost a year and we would play every day and it wasn't until we actually started sending versions of our game out to be played elsewhere that we started hearing these reports of problems that we've never seen and at first you just go you don't know what you're doing you're not pressing your keyed hard enough and then there's a note I swear to god it's not working and so we would actually have them bring their keyboard over and and that's when we discovered the problem back when we were developing star control 1 we would actually hand-deliver floppy disk versions of our game to our publisher they were down in San Jose immediately adjacent to the Winchester Mystery House so sometimes our producer would meet us just at this like truck stop or guest you know rest stop halfway between it and we would hand off disks and sometimes you'd hand us a check for a milestone payment it's very physically oriented and looked like a drug deal maybe but so that is when we would start you know exchanging like keyboards or they would give us a box of disks because we ran out of floppy disks for each player and there's two you need left right forward fire special so that's five and usually it's pretty easy to hit three at once on each side so you're talking six and if you know how to block your opponent they're dead there's no way they're gonna be able to you so that was a it was very critical that we solved this for any sense of competitive fairness what else besides keyboards would have worked as a control mechanism maybe a joystick I mean I guess we did have joystick controls but we really wanted people to experience the space war style control and a lot of joysticks were single button so weren't even supportable and when we got to the Sega Genesis there was no keyboard to work with so we did have to switch to controllers controls and we found a system that was okay when you think about what you could have installed on your computer now its software back then it was almost all specialized hardware that really differentiated machines so you might have a joystick you might have a keyboard you might have a numeric pad you might have a very custom sound board that needed all kinds of specialized settings DMA channels and irq and in addition you might have something might have more memory than somebody else but there was memory that was directly accessible and then there was paged memory that you could bring in and RAM disks and so it was this complete flea circus of possibilities there was Windows back then it was early Windows but almost nobody made games for Windows back then it was all DOS based and so you were much closer to the metal even though Windows wasn't very good at at abstracting from the metal at that point we knew the core was gonna be the same which was one on one one two players based combat but we also knew that we wanted to use digital sound in that space combat and we wanted to add more ships in that space combat and we we actually planned for expansion for that we never we never did expand it but each of the instead of being built into the game each ship was separate and was its own chunk of code and art and sound that would be loaded dynamically as the as called for by the the one-on-one space combat but we also wanted to take a different direction from the strategy game that was on top of that and start control one and that's where Paul's ball comes in actually there was a bunch of tools that got created in the making of star control one that greatly sped me up in working on star control 2 so shifting way back to like the early 80s when we made games I did art on graph paper and I would convert the graph paper to hex numbers and then I would type those hex numbers in and hand them off to the programmers then something called deluxe paint came along from Electronic Arts a guy named Dan Silva who had been at Xerox PARC and knew all about graphics programs built us a custom illustration program initially called prism adult for Electronic Arts artists developers and it was a mouse based program that just let you draw in a way that was so fluid and so fast anyway it revolutionized game development and I still know all those controls in my hands to this day so for us to I draw all of our spaceships in deluxe paint was great but then we started learning how we could take their animation format files and pull all of the images from those and what that allowed me to do is greatly accelerate the rate at which I could create lots and lots of pieces of art so as you fly around your ship rotates and so we were able to create those much more swiftly as we built the kind of the representation of interstellar space we had lots and lots of planet rotations and there's no 3d and star control it's it's all bitmap tricks and in some case synthesized imagery that Fred came up with but it was the development of taking art that it was easy to make relatively easy to make and then automatically translating it into data that Fred could use so that more and more we isolated code and data tasks and Fred became the hungry data monster yeah so besides besides the off-the-shelf tools that he was talking about deluxe paint I would create tools that uh that would take the deluxe paint format that he could work and exclusively and translate them into data for the game so so instead of him telling me hey could you move that over a pixel programmer I would say move it yourself you have you have the tools that wasn't just because I'm a mean guy but it was so that we could each do our work independent from each other because if either of us is a gate for the other then then we're a gate and we the more that can be done without the other person being a filter or a gate and that philosophy ended up influencing the development of choice for Bob we were dedicated to the idea that each participant could work independently and have an extremely tight iterative loop introducing new kinds of art new kinds of sound new kinds of gameplay without having to run through the gauntlet of everybody else in the team and that philosophy led actually all the way up until today it's not just that they don't didn't have to expose their work to other people but some people have different working hours and style that somebody who wants to be working at 2:00 in the morning and hits it's something that stops him because he has to pass it by somebody else's isn't is no longer working in the way they want to work and there's a different philosophy which is the if there's a problem assert and fail and so that means that throughout the entire team if anyone makes an error everybody goes down and that actually is a philosophy you can choose because it means that you will fix the problems really fast because an increasingly large number of people will run over your desk and yell at you but that isn't what we wanted to do when we originally pitched star control to to accolade we very modestly said well we're just gonna take the excellent things in star control 1 we're gonna add some new alien races this very light role-playing game it won't be an epic story at all don't worry it's not going to take that long and then we once we got approved pretty much ignored all of that and we went off to make this giant space science fiction game using the tools that Fred had created and tools that we were finding finding talent to help us was one of the biggest challenges particularly in music it's not like it all rose at the same rate we knew that the core of our game was still melee which became super melee and so we worked initially to upgrade that and then we knew we wanted to land on planets so we investigated how how would how would that work how could that fit into our game and we knew there was going to be travel through a large galaxy we knew there was going to be conversation with aliens so we were gonna have to be able to go through dialogues with them and each of those systems kind of came online over time and not not at the same time so the chain of dependencies was such that most of the writing happened right at the very end we knew the basic skeleton of the story that we wanted to do but the actual real meat of the data came way at the very end one of the first things we defined in sort of changing the game from being a very narrow focus to this more galaxy wide was the star map and I knew I wanted to lay out constellations because you know constellations sort of tell a story they have names they have shapes and I decided that I needed a tool to do this and and that I would go ahead and program it which again if you ever hear me say that any of you don't let me do it so I spent weeks and weeks and weeks on this star map editor kept him out of my hair that's right yeah then I got it ready and I used it for about a day and I was done never used that tool again so that was that was the starmap but that defined set the table essentially so we had these alien races from the first game and we asked the question well what happened to them what happened to the Andersons what happened to the cyrene and it was literally like buried you got wiped out by something ok well that's interesting what wiped them out well there's actually a new alien race where Dee Anderson for example should be and so initially that was sort of the simple description and you know thus the the cyrene are trying to sort out what happened to their homeworld you know I wanted to sort of describe why are these women flying around through space and you know we're like capable but seemingly kind humans why are they like that and so we set this whole star map up with the races and they're essentially basic intentions then we defined what they look like their personalities and then I structured over time and actually you know in the last third of the game all of the conversation structures for how you communicated with them how that changed game states and that ultimately turned into this immense number of handwritten flowcharts start control to celebrates paper more than anything else it's the last hurrah of paper designs for me everything else largely becomes digital thereafter but what that means is although tons of the digital stuff is evaporated all the paper remains all of those flowcharts handwritten text you know descriptions of aliens all of that survives in a way that is wonderful and miraculous to go back through we were trying to to develop the whole framework of the game which which the player would interact with over and over again some of that was easy we had super melee as as an example of something that worked from the previous game so we knew we were going to do that we knew how to iterate on that that was easy developing planets was something the graphical part I think worked pretty pretty well and pretty quickly where we would procedurally generate planets but then we had other notions like would come into a solar system and you would have your main ship and you'd have support ships and we thought well gee it would be fun to send your support ships around to the planets which is probably what you would think you would want to do to investigate what's there to clear out any enemies and so we had this whole make up a task force as you come into the solar system of your escort ships to you send this these three over here and these four over here and maybe this one here and to do various things and it just became a lot of bookkeeping rather than you are passive at that point you'd sent out these ships that operated on their own granted they tried to follow some minimal instructions that you'd given them but you weren't participating in the action it was a lot of setting up orders and bookkeeping and not a lot of fun and and we sort of kept an eye kept convincing myself you know just one more thing and this will be fun so what if you can name your teams what if we have alien officers and so alien officers can give your individual task force a little buff or something and it all worked and we just sat there anyway and there was just this moment of like this ain't fun I think we spent two months on it I think and if you think about a game that's two and a half years two months is a big chunk so we had to throw it away and we went back to well there's a rule or a lesson that I have to relearn periodically which is don't let the computer do something that's fun for a human to do and over and over I keep making the same mistake but when we said okay what's the fun thing about going down to a planet surface and it's like driving it around and shooting stuff and picking stuff up okay but I sort of go down to my lowest reptile brain gamer and okay let's do that and then sure enough shooting stuff was fun and like dodging earthquakes and lightning bolts and stuff like that okay that's fun that's the basic stuff how do we add color to it you know you make different alien creatures have you know now we have to have some sort of storytelling interaction where you find something that we want to give you some dialogue out how do we do that and also kind of related we learned in kind of a related way that that realism is only as fun as you can make it and sometimes you can't make it very fun and so when we were designing the planets and the characteristics of the planets we initially went for a very scientific algorithm to determine what was on the planet what it was composed of and that just tended to give us very homogenized planets and it just wasn't very fun it may have been closer to the real science of how things worked well to give Fred credit he didn't go down this rabbit hole I did because I was fascinated by the idea of real alien worlds and he often will give me a lot of rope here so I said let's let's figure it out you know the the world of alien planets was just coming into sort of scientific truth at the time that we started star control 2 there was zero alien worlds our exoplanets that had been scientifically verified in late 1992 the first one was and now there's thousands so so we were right on the cusp of knowing what it was like but we kind of had a sense of what they could be made of you know rock lithium hydrogen helium carbon dioxide the chemicals that we already had seen through spectroscopy we knew that planets would be made of them if they were there so that we sort of started with like well we know the brightness of the star the color of the star that gives us the energy flowing off of it I have this concise encyclopedia of science and technology that I go look for equations in and I said okay so we'll create this theoretical ball of chemicals and elements and then we'll start shining light on it and that light will volatilize the lighter elements and chemicals so like the helium will go and Leonard the atmosphere you know hydrogen and then the carbon dioxide will volatilize and at that point as it's warming up when the carbon dioxide goes all of a sudden the planet becomes a greenhouse and it starts heating up very fast and as it heats up other stings starts volatilizing it the mercury volatilizes and the LED volatilizes and you've got Venus this incredibly hot planet and if the Sun in if the solar in radiation falling on the surface of the planet fell below a certain level it would maybe volatilize hydrogen but then that was it it was an ice ball and as much as we tried I tried to program and calculate a cool world where you'd have you know some liquid water and some you know vaporous water nope we got ice balls and Venus's and nothing in between and you know it all looked right I was but in retrospect what I was trying to do is recreate the most difficult problem in the world which is like weather simulation or or you know like global warming simulation those are incredibly complicated things and I am NOT a scientist I I like to read about it so what we decided was well you might notice a common theme here which is when I give Paul his head is when I don't I don't believe in what's happening so I let him program the starmap because I knew that was a one-off thing no matter how badly it turned out it would it was okay because it was one-off and this I knew I was pretty certain wasn't going to be what we ended up with because well did the did the description just now sound interesting maybe this maybe to some people but even if we went to all that work to accurately recreate what it what it was to make an atmosphere and to have rocky planets and gas giants and totally accurately mod modeled the the user would not appreciate any of that well Fred had been letting me pursue this as an extra credit project and I had pages and pages of handwritten calculations and I was seeing the writing on the wall and I think I page so I probably been working on this again maybe two months on and off with doing art and writing but but there just came a point where I had to say Fred this ain't working can you help me fix it maybe you can fix it by yourself and so I think he even said well what's what is a cool planet when you say these aren't cool what is cool you know hey we've got like eight months left maybe we can figure this out and they said well I want like a cracked world like lava coming out of these crevices on a dark alien surface or I want a Treasure Planet which is like liquid gold is shooting up and so we just cut through the chase you've got you know treasure world you've got the ruby world you've got the cracked planet and all of a sudden they become stories I went to the cracked planet and I dodged the you know the magma chasm or I went to the Ruby world and was blinded by the glittering light of the star off the surface of the planet that's that sounds good yeah I'll go there fight some blood monkeys on the surface so it was realizing that we had to define the templates for a set of specific worlds that was rich enough and interesting enough that they inspired your imagination but not so many of them that they all just became variations on a theme and a lot of the material of like the elements and the chemicals that do occur in space we ended up using those as generated pickups on the surface of the planet so there was enough of this reality ish material to make you feel like you could suspend your disbelief but yes there's a ruby planet and yes there's Orko diem down there but you know it's enough real to make you enjoy it and not think like this is nonsense but still we didn't let reality get in the way of fun on that topic anymore this will keep coming up the whole battle fleets thing like watching your little dots go off to planets it wasn't fun that was probably the worst one because that derailed both of us the the planet thing pretty much only derailed him I had other work that I could do that I knew was gonna be in the game so it was okay for him to derail himself there because I was still I was still being productive and on some of the alien planets another thing is so we had these world types and some of them I mentioned like Ruby treasure some of them I just be pawing through the concise encyclopedia of Science and Technology and I would hit like a kind of rock like you light like yeah let's have an O light planet and that was like that turned me on because errol otis a friend of ours who was doing art and who i'd worked with since high school he when he was working at TSR hobbies in Lake Geneva Wisconsin was one of the first artists to illustrate the drow the Dro however you want to pronounce it and they're really sort of evil elves that appear in Gary Gygax his work and become very popular characters so one of the persons writing a module an adventure created a drow artist named rule yurts which was just Errol Otis rearranged and Errol would do these illustrations as rural yurts and so he's sort of had a nickname cool for some people and so when I saw it Lula and I'm like yep that's arrows planning so I wrote that down and another one was in a Louis VI and ylo geo us I think and it turns out that v'l Ogas just means the chemical that is vinyl but I thought that's a cool sounding word so a lot of these just honestly I would see words that turns me on and figure out how to retrofit those into of our planet system oh gosh oh yeah halide a halide and then Sumerian that was a good one so most people know Sumerian from Conan the Barbarian who was a Sumerian warrior Sumerian I believe relates to sunset that time of darkness in sunset and it also relates to a particular old civilization but I just loved the idea of a world where Conan could be or something that brought to mind that primitive powerful sense of an adventure we also had rainbow worlds so Fred built a really cool system for synthesizing planets because it would generate them in a way that looked cool but unique and it gave me a bunch of control over how the color and elevation related to one another effectively how it worked was there was a flat plane of pixels that all started at zero height and I would make fractures I would I would draw lines on this flat plane and the pixels in the middle would be pushed down or up and I would just do that over and over and over again with different orientations of lines and that would create a height map and then based on the height and the template the planet template we would use would tell us how how the pixels should be colored I got a I could create a little chart or a little list of numbers that would say well between 0 and 16 height let's use this colored sphere behind the the rotating planet and then so for example if you put white at the very top and then gray slightly below it and then brown below it you would get something that looked like ice cap mountains but you could have like green water and yellow land and then on the rainbow worlds I remember just saying I'm gonna go nuts so I just typed in crazy numbers and we got this really cool rainbow planet that didn't look like anything sensible so we're like what is that like maybe that's like an alien waste dump where they put crazy alien waste that's rainbow colored and eventually we said this is actually the best world to go to we'll use these as sort of some sort of precursor sign pointing to where they went so you would discover them and they would not only be valuable to discover because they had great elements on it but one of the alien races the melon or May really wanted to know where they were located and the reason is when you actually went to the star map and looked at their position it was an arrow pointing towards the galactic core I believe and that was to give a sense of where the precursors went because you know they vanished 250,000 years ago where did they go and this was leading to the sequel which would be you know where the precursors went so when we say it was pointing towards the precursors there is an earlier version of where it was pointing well nobody's nobody's ever seen a precursor so we can weaken so there were these alien gods maybe fake alien God's Dogon and Kazon who were worshipped by the ill wrath and they were just absurdly evil over-the-top crazy funny evil if you followed the arrows you found a conversation with Dogon and Kazon who looked remarkably like just our floating heads and we had this whole system laid out it was sort of a hint system it was sort of this immense ego trip we were maybe people having to say how much they loved Dogon Kazon in order to get those hints but we were getting really late in delivering star control like the very first press release that accolade put out you know you know the creators of star control 1 if made star control 2 and it's going to be out in March and I have this this print out of it where I've circled I was proofing it I'm like that seems a little optimistic March and not in November yeah so that the later press release describes it accurately as November so accolades stopped paying us you know they they wanted it in March or earlier they kind of didn't care how finished it was which shows up also in the Sega Genesis version of star control 1 and so we just Fred funded the project entirely by himself for those last six months and that's when we decided yeah but you know that conversation with our floating heads maybe that's a little too far because it would've had to been Qaid and we in fact there was a furor in QA at one point because because everything was procedurally generated we changed our random seed kind of late in the project and so all of a sudden although the stars were in the same place because they were laid out by Paul all of the planets changed not only their types but their locations and most importantly the elements that were yeah most yeah and so QA had to start all over again cueing the product well it didn't set us back at all QA was mad at us for making them retest stuff that they had already tested I suspect QA was set back a week at least because they had established like the fastest way to go through this immense body of space to collect enough money to test all of the features and then we just scrambled that and then ultimately when it came time to writing a hint book they just kind of threw up their hands and said can you guys write this and so I just had Fred export all the data from every star and then sort through it and you know that's the the 3,000 or so of them too so so that's where we discovered that we had neglected some start so some of the constellations have like Perseus a Perseus B Perseus C and then Perseus II and we we forgot d Perseus D exploded roughly three yeah so here in the hint book we would just make up a story for why one of the planet the solar systems was missing her and it also the the clue book was a lot of fun hang it's called resource guide because it did let us fill in the cracks of some of the stories and provide a little bit of depth and also frankly there were chances that people would miss some of the cool stuff that was optional we wanted to make sure they knew about it and how to get to it the problem was we didn't think it was a big deal I mean for us we knew that the overall populations would work and we weren't really testing that aspect of the game at that point we were throwing in data so fast our disbelief hadn't been suspended we knew it was all just numbers and stuff underneath it but the test Department for them it was the universe of the game and we had just casually discarded it and started over some development decisions that led to dead ends set us back worse than others and the Paul's attempts at generating realistic planets wasn't so bad because it was only Paul that was occupied with that and I I was able to make progress on other things while he was working on that but the task forces in the solar system where you could order ships to do various tasks for you and the solar systems set us both back because we we worked on it together he would he would come up with the design and I would work on the implementation and and so that that occupied both of us for a couple of months until we came to Jesus yeah I think nowadays you simply couldn't do that you would have to figure out in advance whether or not you were gonna do that or not because you couldn't throw away two months of a full development team so that makes modern design I think a little bit more careful and that results probably in better budgets but it definitely doesn't result in trying crazy-ass solutions several of which didn't work I think also it it reinforced to us as we continued with the design of the game that the player really has to be the agency behind the progress in the game so that it's he feels empowered rather than just a passive witness one of the core tenants at the beginning of star control - was that the player started off as the hero that they just had to live up to that through the course of the game and that's I think in part because we hate this idea of you starting out as a grunt and that everyone says all right scum prove to me that you're worthwhile and that isn't what we wanted we wanted the sense that this is you this is your destiny people acknowledge you as the hero and they want to help you write off and so it's all up to you and so I think to us that is a core part of what makes star control to work is that you're a great hero and that everything in the game is about you proving that I think that the player being the hero was was our intent early on but sometimes we would get sidetracked by being interested in the chemical composition of planets or thinking that I'm really a master of all of these ships and I can make them do my will but we always came back to that's not nearly as fun as imposing your will yourself on other aliens and creatures and planets and when you and I think about the science fiction that I most love it has to do with an individual confronting a crazy situation and overcoming it and whether it's Larry Niven in ring world or Jack Vance and the demon princes it's all about this individual that you can relate to and then once you get to something like Ender's Game where yeah it's about a human being commanding this immense Star Force to defeat these aliens it's still about ender and his friends and how they work together to do it and we tried really hard for for the longest time to make the gender of the character ambiguous you could set such that you could be you could be a woman or a girl playing the game and and the character is still you you're not a specific male character which was the dominant thing at the time and one of our key artists George Barr he really took that to heart so if you look at the illustrations that the game begins with the main character is shown typically from the back and his figure is somewhat androgynous so that people could project on this character whatever they wanted to be that got shot out of the water however when accolade did their cover art sort of not caring about what we were saying and it was very masculine and so you see the illustrations at the end of the game do reflect a masculine protagonist though it's still somewhat androgynous how do you make procedural generation have meaning to the player and one of the things we did and we've discussed already was was we went away from completely scientifically accurate planet generation and came up with some templates that we could send data through that would generate variations of planets that were kind of exciting and differentiated but we still needed to tell a story and and that meant that some of the planets had to be special in some ways beyond just procedural generation they had to contain items that you could pick up they had contain plot elements where if you went to say the one of the anderson sold homeworld and and touched one of the ruins on the planet it would give you some information about the ores what we did is we would procedurally generate the entire solar system and the entire galaxy and we would then visit the various stars that were supposed to have interesting non generated stuff on them and we would say okay it looks this looks like a good planet to have this device that the third ash are interested in placed on it and so that then we would override the procedural generation in just that one area to place that device on that planet I think if you think about it as dressing a set say for a play you can dress the periphery of your stage and it can be light or it can be whatever but the items that are around the actors they're essential and so you'll see this density of props and focus and color around where the players are going to be so you can think about procedural generation like that I think the problem with games that focus purely on procedural generation is that it's impressive at first and you're sort of awed by what they've done but then the differentiation and kind of the meaning just declines I mean even if you go out into the wilderness and you start walking around you're interested in landmarks quite often like is there a particularly the awesome rock or a valley that you want to check out River those things exist as destinations within this beautiful world of ours but you want those destinations and so I think ultimately it was using procedural generation to give this sense that if they go off the beaten track there's a world out there and they can just kind of keep going but ultimately they're gonna kind of run out of steam on that they're gonna want to come back and get back on to the path that leads to the next story beep so we had laid out all of our plot in terms of a high-level flow chart you know find the old show fix tea get him to stop attacking you you know get some information from him and eventually restore the show fix tea race but we didn't exactly know where those had to be in space so their placements influenced pacing and oftentimes we would there would be a long gap between events of interest and so we might add for example an optional item like you can go off and pick this thing up you can go off and make a deal with the Drewes and sell some of your crew and it would accelerate your way through this game but there would be some negative consequences later on so there was pacing adjustment and finding where there were blank spots and adding detail and sometimes it was within a conversation oftentimes lols would occur as a consequence of having exhausted the layout of a conversation and then we would go add just some trivia and some fun color in there and the kind of design of the conversations themselves is a fascinating creative problem to solve so we had self-imposed hurdles where we had designed a game that we couldn't finish personally and part of that some of that was a design called for a number of music pieces each alien had its own musical theme there were music pieces when you went into orbit around a planet when you're travelling in hyperspace in quasi space and we were incapable of doing any of that ourselves and then there was the hurdle of we needed almost two dozen alien conversations trees and we were we didn't have enough bandwidth to write them all so when we created this awesome layout for a world and then realized we didn't have time to deal with it we had to call upon friends to help so so I defined all of the conversations in the game and all the plot flow and and sort of what the aliens were like personally and we frequently we had art for them already and so with this mountain out of control charts I would sit down with a friend and Matt ginza or Errol Otis or Robert Leyland or a few other friends of mine and say okay we desperately need your help and we'd work together so we sort of had a shorthand established and like okay here's what the pic hunker like Greg Johnson you know they're these crazy kind of New Age offshoot bird Yachats and they they seem to be super natural maybe it's all a ridiculous but every now and then they pull off something amazing and you know here's here's everything that they have to say everything they have to do functionally and Greg please Oh Greg write as fast as you can and so I would get back in Greg's case handwritten sheets of paper mat guns are on the other hand who had worked with in high school on games he actually wrote in computers like a same person so he was working on I think it was the ill wrath dialog and for a milestone that was coming up maybe alpha we needed to have that dialogue in place in order to get it paid in order to have the publisher continue with us and it was a real serious milestone and we said Matt you've got to get the writing over to us he's like well I'm not gonna get it done till late tonight but I'll come over from Berkley they're like 45 minute drive to where your office is and I'll just shove it under your door so the next morning we get there early because we know we have to get it and integrate it into the game and it's not there so we call Matt name I say where where's your disk Matt it's like well I got nervous about shoving it into the door so I I left it on the window the outside window and I've tilted it up against the window it's in an envelope everything's fine and I'm like looking at the window and there is no envelope there and so we're like oh no what happened and we stuck our heads off the window and looked down and there was the dumpster for the whole building and so we're like racing down the stairs to find it in a dumpster and like flipped it open and the dumpster is just clean empty it's just clearly been emptied and we're like oh god no this is so then we think maybe maybe it's hidden somewhere and so we start looking and sure enough we found this envelope just gloom I like that in the dumpster yeah I did garbage juice had adhered this envelope to the side of the dumpster so we peel it off crawl back out smelling of dumpster juice go back upstairs and with like tissue paper very carefully dry off the disk hoping it will work and thank god it did so that was how we passed that milestone but the key there was recognizing that we do need this much content that yes I can do a lot of it and I can help structure all of it but ultimately reaching out to talented friends and individuals to bring them in to the game and nowadays with teams of a hundred you know this isn't even thought of as an issue but back then where we had made a game just the two of us and in the past some people made games just by themselves we were figuring out how to integrate talent meaningfully into our team back then it was pretty much just us two in the office even though he had all the people listed in the manuals they didn't work in our office our office was only big enough to hold two or three people and so we really had to farm everything out and get it back through whatever means necessary sometimes written papers sometimes going on to the NASA and internet sometimes envelopes in dumpsters at that point I was probably funding because the writing came in very late so we realized we could define this great game but we needed some help from our friends and we were fortunate to have people like our Lotus mat Jen's ur Greg Johnson of course and but we had friends who are artists and there's a famous one in mechag he's he's most famous for designing Darth Maul how that character looks and he's worked on almost all of the post trilogy Star Wars movies however he didn't want to do our gang he wanted to do creative writing so he wrote some of the Bucs dialogue and when I would get it back from in it would be handwritten in this elegant calligraphy I've got some of the sheets that hopefully people can see but what we were willing to embrace people's involvement in our work and we had enough controller to make sure it was what we needed but when people are motivated and just are powerfully creative people you can often get fantastic work from them outside of their normal specialty even though our office only could contain two or three people we had neighboring offices which were were our friends who helped us Robert Leyland and his partner Greg Hammond were in that office and toejam and Earl Mark poor Sanger and Greg Johnson so when it started to get real and fun was when those people were actually testing the full game not just playing super melee with us but and digging it I remember this designer mark Mike Ebert who worked with us on Skylanders and many games he sort of came to me and said hey I figured out something pretty funny I'm selling my crew like crazy to the dream he said they don't no one seems to care and so that was at the point when yeah we probably should put something in there where if you sell too many of your crew to the druze something bad happens and so I think Mike was ultimately not pleased that we changed that but it was his belief that there was actually this interaction with an alien that he was sort of participating in that gave him delight that made us realize we needed to modify the game yeah the ending I'd say the last two months probably leading up to November we were working seven days a week probably 18 hours a day so we weren't having too much fun that we knew we knew that it was working yeah I my mom was a fly tester on the game and she was the person who got me into science fiction originally and I had given her the disc and you know she checked in it was kind of a complicated game I didn't know if she'd like it and then I discovered she was taking days off work and I was like oh oh what have I done so she was one of the first fans she was also one of the first people who ran into the Cora Death March clock issue where the game had a very specific time at which if you hadn't succeeded by this point you were gonna lose and we've gotten a certain amount of grief on that over the years but also I think a lot of people it was a very pungent memory one sign that we were achieving the sense of a world in a sense of a story was we had a friend and a developer named aquila red were AJ red mer and he went silent and played our game for several weeks and then he showed up at our office with a binder every single bit of text he had hand typed back in and he had laid our game back out to us through his experience and he was really into it and we sort of looked at that and looked at him and said wow you know maybe no no no also I got it we were on top of an office supply store which was convenient if he needed office supplies but there was this guy downstairs who at some point we were faxing something because we didn't have a fax he's like are you guys a game company we said yeah we make this we're making the science fiction games like I love games he said well okay you want to test our game so he tested our game and he came back and he said I've tested your game and I really enjoyed it about the re Lu do you believe in aliens coming to Earth and I said well it's complex and because we started figured out he did he said I have personally I've gone there I've gone to Roswell and I have interviewed people myself and I remember just sort of slowly backing up I'm thinking what did we what did we run into here very nice fellow very thankful for his playtesting so these experiences that we were having with friends with family with guys from the office of play store downstairs gave us this sense that it was working that you know what we created was actually reaching out to people and touching them and hopefully they were gonna buy it because back then and maybe maybe other companies did it but focus testing a game is pretty common now especially with the big budgets but back then nobody knew what we were doing accolade didn't really understand what we were doing and we didn't understand what we were doing all the time but we were trying to please ourselves in a large sense I mean we loved science fiction adventure it was a particular kind of it it wasn't hard-bitten it was a little bit more pulpy a little bit more Buck Rogers and it wasn't entirely clear to us as we were making it how large of an audience there was or if that audience would react to it and they really did pretty pretty dang fast after we released it we started looking in the very primitive online forums and finding out that people were having fun and they were starting to imagine beyond what we'd put in there asking questions that we hadn't answered and that's super inspiring although although we intentionally asked questions in the game that we didn't answer which created a sense of what happened this wasn't on the main path but something something happened here and to this day people speculate about what we didn't answer and one of the biggest mistakes we see in when people have tried to make sequels of our work is the sequel is all about answering the questions we set up from the first game and that is not a good idea I mean a little smattering of that is fun but the whole point is to extend that mystery and keep you going keep people hungry for the adventure so if you're ever making a sequel don't answer all the questions one of the questions were asked about is the mill nor may as you're talking with them for some particular reason their color in their bridge shifts to purple and one of the questions that the player you can ask because I think some player asked us well why did that turn purple so we decided to reflect that into the game and now you as the player in the game can ask the melanoma why did your bridge to repurpose and he just says well that's a really good question with a very interesting answer and it will cost you only 32,000 credits now 32,000 credits was more than any player would ever get except or whatever playtesters maybe Mikey Burt did in fact earn that much money and was very disappointed that we hadn't recognized that and he couldn't actually get the answer and while I would like to answer that here and now I feel that that is best answered in our sequel goes to the precursors good pivot Thanks so what's success for you well it wasn't it wasn't a huge money success at least at that immediate moment fairly soon after we shipped our game I think Wing Commander came out which was a pretty seminal game in 3d space combat and captured a lot of short attention span people yeah well I don't I don't mean that as a I just meant that that that story wasn't as deep as our story our our story had legs and especially as we released it to open source it exposed more and more people to the ER Quan masters so what does success mean it's one of the last games it's probably it's the last game Paul and I have done where it was completely our game designed completely by us engineered completely by us yes we had people helping us fill in the skeleton but we the publisher left us alone and pretty much all they did was publish the game we miss that part of our careers I think success for me has to do with two things one do I feel like I had some integrity in what I was doing that I I lived up to what I said at the beginning to myself about what this experience is going to be like and then also frankly do people reflect that back there's them buying it and that's great and if you did play my game and you didn't actually buy it you can always buy us pizza that is that is the deal pizza or beer feel free but really success is about moving people about having what you do affect their lives in a way that's positive at least that's the way I regard it and so when we would get letters back from people talking about how you know for example a hurricane hit their house and they had to go live with their friend and it was miserable but the thing that got them through it was playing star control with their friend that's worth its weight in gold too - how you feel in your life and also seeing it influence other people there's plenty of games that were influenced by star control and you know we were influenced by other games as well but feeling like you've added to the medium a little bit just a little bit and then also feeling like there's a there's a world waiting for you to go back to part of my imagination has never left that world you know I still have little conversations with those guys in my head that creates a compulsion to move forward whether or not you're going to get to it the next year or ten years from now it's sort of like not answering all the questions in the game itself leaving something open for you to do creatively not only helps you eventually get to that sequel but as you move through all your other games you're going to kind of be solving those same problems in different variations the main lesson you learned in making star control 1 & 2 besides not letting me program think about that for a second if you got so will go ahead well for me I would say the biggest lesson is live up to the promise you make to yourself and your partners about what it is you're creating don't let reality intrude any more than it absolutely has to because that I'm not the first person to say this success lasts mistakes you'll also remember you'll never be able to fix them but ultimately you'll have to live with them forever if you have to go through pain if you have to go through some short-term disappointment with folks in order to achieve something great something that matters and that you believe in do that people will forget that pain people were forgive you for not showing up at their parties you will have that for the rest of your life and so will everybody else who's played your games so make those sacrifices yeah I think I think if you work on what you love and we truly do love star control you are you are much happier with your life in general and so we've always tried even as our our decision trees have gotten narrowed by by what the publisher wants over time as as games have become more and more expensive the publisher once more and more direction over what you're doing is to still try to find that path of love through whatever you're making so that it's meaningful to you implemented being able to play mod music back on the PC which was a an amiga format originally and we had maybe three or four mods that we had been able to collect online and we were so excited by how different they sounded from the synthesized music that we had done in stock control 1 but then we realized we actually needed people who knew how to make these things so as far as we knew nobody in the United States was making these mod music files at least in any sort of volume and we needed a lot of them to fill out our game and early on era Lotus who is an artist writer awesome DM he also is a musician and he created the Quan theme which you hear both at the end of star control-1 and whenever you meet the earth wanted star control 2 and he created on an E new systems emulator too which is a you know it's a dedicated piece of hardware but it could download samples and playback those samples so it was very much like the mod format so we had him create this piece of music and then he gave us the samples and sort of by year we recreated a mod using a open source editor and then that's when I realized oh my god we need professionals to do this funny thing was there really weren't professionals this format had evolved as part of the kind of the demo scene over in Europe and so the people who made mods were young people people who were interested in music but necessarily weren't professionals so tracking these people down proved to be a real problem and so what was our technique ok again the internet didn't exist as it does today but there was a text-based kind of user group what's called the wels the well yeah so in order to contact people all over the world we went on to a text-based forum for sending messages and we ended up accidentally breaking protocol because we just sort of advertised there's a music competition Mudd format everybody in the world who's listening and you know first prize is $500 second prize is $50 and you know here are the themes we need and we roughly described you know flying through interstellar space flying through hyperspace in orbit around a planet and then we started getting envelopes in the mail no one sent anything electronically for us at this point so we just started getting envelopes in the mail from finland and england and the middle of the united states it turns out and we collected all of these and we ended up i don't know getting probably to 15 20 entries and of those we had 12 winners and in some cases people had send in multiple enter entries and one guy one second first and several second places because we had a budget in a little over $2,000 and we needed a lot of music so we had a $500 first prize and a bunch of $50 second prizes so then we sent out you know releases or rights to them and got those back and then two of the people that we worked with dan Nicholson and Riku Nevada jarv in Finland were so great that we actually dozen started contracting them for specific pieces of additional music and to this day we have never met them face to face so one great thing about getting things and the pieces of mail is we've get handwritten letters along with them and some of them typically were about like I'm not sure if this is okay I'm not a professional I really hope you like this but some of them were really funny like can you please send back the floppy disk when you're done I don't have many of these and that's when we started realizing I wonder how old some of these people are in the in the entries it was just a different era back then we were dealing with people who were on very tight budgets and in some cases living with mom and dad but the sound that they made was so unique and so memorable that to this day people still talk about the music of star control 2 and there have been remixes in some cases by the actual musicians a decade or two later but it remains this turning point I think in the use of music in some kinds of games to be much richer and much more inspiring in terms of the feeling you're trying to achieve in the moment as compared to just a background that your existing with him and we we also besides the money reward for for winning parts of the contest we promised them all copies of the game and I'll tell you we were no Amazon Prime and in that respect I I think some people may have gotten their games like a year after release but but we eventually got them to everybody control to wealth in star control 1 I've always been near and dear to our hearts it's the first things we worked on first things we poured our passion in together we've have some diehard fans as a result of those 2 games and we wanted to service them and lay the groundwork for for a return and keep the games in the front of their minds as much as possible so that when we were finally able to return to it there would be there we would still have a living audience there was a confluence of events that helped this one was accolades stop selling the game in restocked earning royalties right around the year 2000 and that triggered the termination of their exclusive right to sell our game so we got our game back what we didn't have was the name star control that was a trademark that the publisher owned and we negotiated back and forth with them but ultimately we weren't able to come to terms for the name so we decided well we can't use that name let's give it a new name so we used the er Quan masters and we had our very first summer intern Chris Nelson a guy from Boston University and he was out here and he was a die-hard open source fan and he wanted to port our game to open source and then release it and sort of talked us through the ramifications and the choices we had to make and he and largely Fred then ended up porting the game to a form that people could launch but it was by no means beautiful fast and elegant and then just we released it I'm trying to remember how we got the initial fans involved Chris was responsible for setting up all of those connections and he knew dedicated fans who were interested in working on it and so from 2002 until today we have had like the air con masters site that uqm I think and you know they've been maintaining it and porting it to new machines and revising the audio and really keeping it alive in the doldrums between 2001 and then 2011 when our games went back on sale at GOG so the air con master's project you know the open source release of our the game we created a star control - that really kept our game alive in the doldrums between say 2001 or 2002 and then 2011 when our games began to be sold again through good old games known as GOG which is an electronic distributor of classic games so we just had finished start control - taking two and a half years and not getting paid for the last six months we had a 3-game deal with accolade or at least one where they got to got the right of first refusal for a game proposal and we came to them and said okay we're ready to work on our third game and they said okay how about star control three getting paid exactly what you just got paid for star control 2 which wasn't quite sufficient and on also we had just finished doing two science fiction games for them and we were ready for a cleansing of the palette and I'd been thinking about this game design involving competitive monstrous gardening and that turned into this game in which a sort of whimsical fantasy hero had to defend this kingdom by himself pretty much from a horde of rampaging red monsters the original version of the Horde the use of that word comes from mail-order monsters it was one of the scenarios where a bunch of little red dots come to attack your somewhat larger white dot which is your monster and so that idea of fending off a horde had been sticking with me so we decided to pitch that and we pitched it to Sega and they really loved it and they very much wanted to do it but then the people at Sega left who had been negotiating with and founded Crystal Dynamics so we ended up going to Crystal Dynamics very shortly after they were founded and creating the Horde for them both on the PC and on the 3do under contract and later on we became employees and were with them for seven or eight more years the the 3do version of stark 12 - which is the fairly successful important version was an accident we had a contract to do the Horde on the Sega CD and we actually convinced a couple of people to quit their jobs to work on that and literally the day before they showed up that project was cancelled and so we were in the position where they were going to come in to work the next day having quit their safe jobs and we would have to tell them we didn't have any work for them and so we quickly scrambled and said to Crystal Dynamics how about we do a port of star control to to the 3do and to their credit they said yes the the founders of Crystal Dynamics Madelyn Canepa and Judy Lange were awesome and they had a lot of faith in us but one of the funny things we had to do is we had to go back to accolade and literally license our own game back from them because of the trademark they had the trademark so he ended up paying royalties on our own game to somebody else so I think that may have been the only instance of that in gaming history but what we were able to do that the guys who had hired you know sort of began the process of porting it and we began revising the interface and then we decided you know what there's like a novels worth of text in us why don't we do it all in alien voices like all of our other solutions we called upon our friends some of whom were actors some of whom had nice voices some of whom were just willing to give it a shot and we begin recording the dialogue that was written for star control - what'd you write to be read and what'd you write to be spoken turn out to be entirely different things so I remember watching Alex Bennett who has a DJ a morning DJ on a popular San Francisco radio station we hired him to be the Starbase commander and just I think we've got the route take recordings of him basically saying chin gesture he's like chin Jesse he consumed Asian chin Johnny the same as lunch and it was really awesome stuff but it was very hard to speak but thankfully they did it and I got to do some voices and Greg got to do some voices and so it was a ton of fun and then we went into the studio and overlaid some effects on them and ultimately you know some people had their own vision of what the voices were like other people that never played star control before so these were their first impressions and so they you know that's for them the melon are may sounds like my daughter's first grade teacher because that's who it was and some people say well why didn't you have the credits that on the PC on the 3do and that's because we neglected to voice record them when we were creating the hoard one of the premises was that we had this story to tell about a young boy who had been raised by a herd of wild cows and he had grown up kind of an oddball and this king who had been bran the Barbarian and who had won a kingdom through his wits and his strength and his magic sword grim thwack er he's old and fat now and in fact Chauncey is serving I think turkey legs to this fat old king and the King starts to choke and somehow Chauncey knows the Heimlich maneuver and saves the Kings life so the King you know says you're you're great here's my magic sword I'm gonna let you be the defender of the kingdom and that's where these hoard lling monsters start showing up now that was so much storytelling we couldn't do it in animation but the universe was starting to change with cd-rom data how much data we could store and the fact that Strauss Zelnick who had been the worldwide head of Fox entertainment had become our company president a company of about 40 people so he brought with him Hollywood connections and talent galore and we began trying to cast Chauncey and oh man who did we cast it was well so he gem Kari was the first person we tried Michael Richards was Michael Richards from Seinfeld then and one of his power walks to his Porsche in the parking lot we said how about Martin Short without breaking stride he said box-office poison sorry because Martin Short sorry Strauss but what where we ended up with was he had had a personal relationship with a certain actor not from family ties as it turned out which I did make that mistake but Kirk Cameron had been a very popular actor on a sitcom so he showed up and and showed up at the office and played the game and he thought it was awesome and his wife was really excited about it and at that time we'd never really worked with a popular actor before so we were sort of like oh wow this this is a real actor and this is gonna be great and so we set up down in Hollywood and over the course of two or three days we recorded dialogue some of which I wrote some of which other people wrote and it was a blast and we really didn't know how it was going to now but ultimately I think it fulfilled exactly what we wanted to do is this sort of kind of wry fairly bizarre fantasy story and we got kicked off the set one right because this was all fun and exuberant for us and we were too noisy and they finally made us leave right yeah and I have to have to make an explanation there's a morph there's a point at which Cronus Mahler this evil High Chancellor is revealed to be the secret king of the Horde and he transforms from Cronus Mahler into a horde link we didn't have the budget to do that special effect transition but I really thought we wanted it and I had a technique that I often use with artists which is when they say we don't have the budget to do that we don't have the time I go no problem I'll do it and then they just get this look of horror and I like when he programs right and this works with Fred necess but it didn't work in this case this artist kind of knew what I was up to he's like okay go ahead do that morph so Fred's brother Ken and I were up late one night doing this morph and oh it is so horrible so if you ever look at the video on YouTube there's this like kind of really nice animated hard link Inge and this good well acted and then about two or three seconds of the worst morph in video history ever so apologies for that so that was like it we didn't hear from Kirk Cameron again and part of why we wanted to do this video also was MPEG was becoming a popular format at this time and MPEG cards for PCs were coming out and we struck deals with some of the people bringing out MPEG cards so it all sort of dovetailed now later on Kirk Cameron showed up is in a different form somewhat less tolerant somewhat more specific in what he hated and subsequently we don't agree with an awful lot of what he represents in fact I think we perhaps are diametrically opposed to him in many ways nonetheless what we created on the horde stands on its own and I'm proud of it all right so - the Horde comes pandemonium that was our first 3d game so we'd better do my station game on also yeah just doing a game that's representative in three dimensions and then the holy war and we were technically suzerain on pandemonium - pandemonium - which meant that we were just there to sort of help with problems and then an odd Japanese game little witching mischiefs so real quick we were working with Crystal Dynamics and Rob Dyer the president of the company said look I've got I want to strike a deal with Bondi let's do the game from Bondi as licenses and we said oh my god we love Gundam we want to do like a super deformed Gundam in which you know you've got the turn-taking combat but then when you get together you fight it out in real time in 3d this is gonna be so great he's like that's we're gonna go talk to Bondi and then he came back and he said Bondi has an even better idea they have a much bigger property and were like huh not SD Gundam and he said no no and we said well what is he said well I don't really know but they're really excited about it they're doing this big thing over next year it's gonna be their biggest thing and so we just waited by the fax machine and they started to roll out these images of young magical witches with very tight little dresses and we just kept coming and coming in different variations of them and we just said what is this and it turns out that in Japan there has been this long history from the 60s probably all the way up today of magical witch girl shows in which a girl in our world discovers that she is secretly a princess in another magical realm and that she has powers in our world typically employed through like purses or makeup or jewelry which are conveniently sold at a nearby store for reals so cutie honey which some of you may know as a superhero whose clothes fly off between her transformation from normal human to superhero she was sort of the end of the line of that magical witch girl and they provided us a game design and so we were using our unholy war engine and we just said okay this is the task at hand let's do it and so we created a game little witching mischiefs that's only been released and seen in Japan and is really weird in part because we all of the design Doc's we got were in Japanese and none of us knew Japanese so we did our best to translate them yeah for example we translated something as as Japan's seventy years ago and so we started making a city that was like 1920s Japan which was not an odd thing to find yeah and then we sent back some early concepts and they said what is this this is not what we asked you to do and it turned out they wanted 1970s Japan and then towards the end of game development when you're through all of the logic bugs you start getting into what are called TRC's just that they're the technical requirements that a company like Nintendo or Sony will impose on you so if you eject the disk and you disconnect the controller and something else crazy happens the game crashes and you just have to go through and you fix all of these and they're quirky and difficult and that's how all games wrap up however these came to us in Japanese faxes arriving in the middle of the night and we fixed a lot of them and then the one translator we had on our end and the one person who spoke English on bond dies end both vanished from the scene and so we just turned off the fax machine we were done problemo solved and it did come out and I think it did ok ok so then after that we did a hundred and two Dalmatians yep that was our first kids game and it was a big a lot of fun because what we realized in that is that our job is to entertain people and it doesn't matter to us whether they're adults or kids we don't care as long as we make people happy and kids are awesome people to entertain because they don't hop on the internet and call you horrible names they're just delighted to play your game they're the best fans in the world so we did that we had a connection with Disney and then things changed at Crystal Dynamics and one Christmas party I got a phone call saying hey guys this is Cristal yeah you're all fired now can you please call the rest of your team and tell them that and so I was like ok but this is one of those situations where from the worst days come the best days so we formed a corporation of choice for Bob again we rebuilt twice for Bob now as a corporation and our friends who we had brought into the industry to help us on pandemonium these were level designers who showed up at our door in some cases barely having graduated high school they had formed their own company Shaba a successful game company that was now part of activision so they sort of shepherded us into our first contract with activision doing disney's extreme skate adventure which was using the tony hawk engine and making a skateboard game for kids using three licenses for from Activision Lion King Toy Story and Tarzan so we did that and then after that we did Madagascar one and then our studio was acquired we did Tony Hawk's downhill Jam a fun game that was a multiplayer racing game on skateboards I still give that that games a sleeper then the sequel to Madagascar a gas car too and then Skylanders yeah so when Madagascar two wrapped up actually the licensed market for games was really dying down they just weren't selling as well as they had been so we sort of got this idea from Activision hey why don't you make a game for the week why don't you make a game for kids why don't you make a game that's more successful in a year the kids game of all time because kids game aren't really doing well and hey we've got the spyro license now would you like to use that so we said yes because you know the alternative was sort of going out of business and so he said yes we can do this we love Spyro the Wiis awesome and we can make the greatest thing ever and then we worked like crazy and we had some horrible ideas horrible ideas but the good idea that we had was bringing twice to life and that turned into Skylanders which we couldn't have done without Activision because it required factories and thousands of people and skills and making plastic and the ability to risk tens of millions of dollars on inventory but ultimately it all paid off working with Electronic Arts and they were publishing my software they had these artist symposiums where game developers would come together and talk about their craft and learn about what was going on in the industry these eventually evolved into the game developers conference but at one of these I met this guy Greg Johnson and we were definitely kindred spirits he's wacky he loves to design games and he had been hired to work on star flight and I had worked on a game called murder on his internet that had a communication system where you would solve a mystery by asking people you know investigating a mystery and accusing someone of the murder and he was creating a system to communicate with aliens in space and so I talked him through how we did communications and then spending time with him and hanging out and looking at his game it was like this is really fun I want to work on this now I had been working on mail-order monsters with my partners Evan and Nicky Robinson but I just sort of dropped off the radar because I just started doing whatever I could on star flight and ultimately I got the phone call from the producer leave and go back and work on your own game but Greg and I and stayed friends and then when we got together with Fred then he moved up to an adjacent office of ours and Greg is a really amazing designer and a very unusual figure in gaming he is one of the most courageously creative people you'll meet so he'll work on a science-fiction aliens game and write a delightful story and create a great space adventure then the next minute he'll work on cavemen Olympics which is this funny sort of California games style game except it's with cavemen so you're like fire-starting contests and running away from saber-toothed tiger contests and then he'll do a TV show about kids and hip-hop and trains and then he'll invent a digital phone alternative ringer system which he'll get prototyped and go patent and then discover that there's a duck phone that beat him to it so that one didn't work out but he is always pushing his creative foundation and and he's always friendly and while we were working on star control - he was next door working on toe jam and earl so we would go next door to help him with toe jam and earl or playtests and he would come next door to help us with star control - and play test and when we needed extra art created greg was one of the people we'd go to so Greg and Alvaro Harrison and I did a lot of art for deluxe paint for the Amiga for Electronic Arts and so we had a sort of a small crew of contract artists and we would help each other on our projects and people would come that we'd help them on theirs I did some work in advertising which was a nightmare so ultimately we would get Greg or we would get others to come to the office and help illustrate specific pieces of art so we finished start control one in sort of the summer of 90 and so we ported it would be late 90 or 91 getting both of those ports done probably so we worked in offices adjacent to other developers Greg Johnson mark for Sanger did toejam and Earl and and Robert Leyland who was working on the game G so he had been hired to write software for Game Genie for the Sega Genesis and what the game genie was was a cartridge that you would plug in and then that attached to a system that lets you enter codes which would actually modify how the game ran so after the fact you could reverse engineer just small tweaks to a game to give yourself invulnerability or extra lives when robert wrapped up that project maybe he was even in the middle of it he began helping us port star control to the Sega Genesis one of the things that led us do was create some of the most amazing game genie codes because we knew exactly what the game genie needed toe jamming our elders as well so for example in melee and in the combat mode of the Sega Genesis you can have multiple planets you can do all kinds of modifications and so our codes were some of the best again same with toe general because they were able to come sit with Robert and say what do you need what would be awesome so after we were done with the Amiga version of star control star control one accolade came to us and said hey we want to get into the Sega Genesis market but we don't want to pay all those fees that Sega wants I mean after all when we make a game for the PC or for the Amiga we don't pay any fees so we don't really want to do that per se for the Sega Genesis so we have reverse-engineered it we put some of our best engineers in the room and they reverse engineered the machine and we'll give you the documentation from there reverse engineering and we'll give you a very primitive development system and you can make your game exclusively using these and this was not optimal but we said well okay fine that sounds good we'll give that a shot and so we did is fairly straightforward port just straight port not doing any sort of optimization so the game was didn't run particularly well and was a larger a lot larger than it needed to be but accolade was so hot to get it out maybe because they knew what was coming that they said let's just put it out and let's make this marketing win by saying it's the biggest product ever late released for the Genesis and it was and I can't remember who's 12 or 16 megabits but it was dramatically larger than any cartridge that had come out at that time and it was also big decided to make it physically large to sort of communicate that as well so it was much larger against Genesis cartridges were that big and it was like that big it was really beefy and there's a funny story in this about the cover so they wanted to have a new brand associated with their console games so they created ballistic which was just a separate wing of accolade they said but we want to realist rate all our covers to be slick and smooth and have this unified style so we're gonna redo the cover for start control what would you like done and I really like the cover for start control and I said well how about we just take that and we do you know that's a smoother like more professional rendering of it so they said oh okay we'll do that and then later on they they brought back the image and they open it and it was just exactly what I'd requested this like incredibly well rendered version of it and they said yeah Boris bors Vallejo did this and he you know he said okay he would do it that way and at this point Boris Vallejo is one of the most popular if not the most popular fantasy artists in the world what I didn't know was they had offered me the opportunity to just tell them one of the best fantasy artists in the world what I wanted and he would have painted it but they forgot to mention that it was Boris he was doing it's I just haven't redo that old cover and he happily did it the next step in making the Sega Genesis version of star control was to go through all the documentation and try to figure out how to achieve sounds and graphics ultimately we did go through that process get it done big honkin cartridge and then it went out for sale and again we hadn't done a console game before so liked the idea that they weren't gonna license it was like huh okay we'll see how that goes it did not go well let me just put very clearly there was a very large lawsuit our game was pulled off the shelf very quickly it sold well by the way we are nice royalties off that but ultimately it was like the you know sort of Valhalla fighting Olympus above us thankfully the publishers all managed that that fight and I think ultimately accolade won but they negotiated a license deal ultimately and and I think forever after people did not try to create unlicensed cartridges that kind of reminds me of the 3do story though the hoard the 3do was had memory inside the 3do for your saved games but it wasn't very large and could only store a few saved games and so if you would buy say Madden and play Madden and save your progress and then you would buy another game there would be no room for you to save your games there and when we made the hoard we said well then and there was no there was no mechanism for deleting their games we said well there's no mechanism for deleting your games you're now playing our game we'll just weak we can internally remove whatever games you have sitting in this memory we'll just do that so that you can save versions of the hoard because that's what you want to do right that is we have no yes no statement um yeah this is why TRC's came into existence it might be because of us yeah and yeah I think with the Horde they were like these monsters creatures all emotion all hunger and I think we just sort of internalized that what savegame full no erase it we put our game there yeah that did not go well that was a recall actually our game was recalled we fixed that problem and then it went back and and and then they they started making standards for how do you deal with memory on consoles and stuff I think because of this I think one of wet things you see here is the that paper winds I have a lot of games which are all digital and those files have all evaporated as floppy disks died or the formats that we saved on went away start control 2 was the last game we did where all of the design I did was on paper so it lived and we're gonna talk a little bit about how we organize storytelling so it starts with this diagram here I'll hold this up for you this is the plot structure of the game and it all ends down here with destroy the trophy ship and every single one of these little paragraphs or sentences is an event in the course of the game you don't have to do all of them but you have to do most of them and ultimately to destroy the trophy ship you have to walk through all of these logical chains now each of these little moments is often a conversation so while this is the master the conversations actually have their own flowcharts I'll let Fred unfold a few of these as well so each of these represents a conversation you might have with an alien or a star base commander and they're all hand-drawn flowcharts so there's a madness to this every circle represents a statement that the aliens will make every square represents a statement that the player makes and all of these almost like a maze of conversation you'll walk through these as you talk with the aliens and in some cases when you make a phrase say something it'll change the game state and that's sort of what I've got listed down the size here and so it's been a long time and cramped my hand a lot with a mechanical pencil to get all of these set up but all of these were necessary for us to believe that we could implement the entire complex path and story of star control 2 so this was actually the first step where we laid out the logic of everything and then once that was done and once we had defined all of the different alien race personalities and appearances and sort of hallmark ways of speaking that's when I and some friends wrote dialogue for every single that'll circle or square here in all of these and then that all ends up in here which is again that plus all of this logic turns into the gameplay now I would hand one of these to Fred and then he would execute it in C innocent I think was mostly C and then we would debug them and for a long time the game each of these little circles or squares it's probably too small to see has a little title to it and the titles like friendly alien hello number two or die I hate you forever number five we would enter those in as labels within the code but then as placeholders early on that was the text to be used and so there was a version of this game running with just these cryptic statements like dye number five and at one point actually accolade thought that was the actual game and they didn't say it was awful they were they were ready to actually ship the game at one point with just that sort of weird dialogue in there but and so this was this was the actual critical path of the game this big flowchart had to get done before any of these individual flowcharts could get done way before any of this writing this is just like half of them Fred so yeah there's more this is an example have a starbase commanders conversation and these just took days and days and days to draw by hand and they took quite a bit less time for Fred to implement in code so Fred was always the hungry monster running ahead of me ready for my data but it was good in in some ways because I would encounter problems as he was laborious Lee creating one of these I would be implementing one one of them and we would encounter problems with our assumptions or I would say hey I can do this technique for example in the middle of a cyrene conversation where the screen turns black and something happens in the conversation and so even though he was taking longer to create them I still had plenty of work and exploration to do but they all had to be done in sequence and so we actually then had you know hand handwritten sections that were delivered by some of my friends who were working on the writing so these for example are how I think Leonard delivered all of his phrases in these index cards and so that you would pick a response and then it would have like a chooser and adventure go to card see so he he thought of the conversation and followed this diagram as these various cards so you could sort of interactively play through it so each one of those cards would represent one of these boxes here and then Greg Johnson wrote all of his material by hand so I've got pages pages and pages and pages no Greg's handwriting I like this headline serious spiritual problems I'm not sure probably the Pecan it could have been him could've been Greg I think there's even some stuff written on napkins back in here somewhere my horrendously bad handwriting I think this was for the cyrene and the Starbase commander and then this some of the writers Matt guns are for example actually use a word processor and he has some ill rays phrase ill wrath phrases here so Matt or or Greg would get one of these diagrams an explanation of how the aliens should talk what the whole purpose of this dialogue was and what the events were and then they would write each paragraph one at a time it was what we had at the time you know mother of invention ultimately I think you know if this had been purely digital it probably would have been more efficient but you know the the medium affected the message you know I think the manner in which these are organized literally in some cases how much stuff I could fit on a single piece of paper influence the size of the conversations so sometimes I would have crammed things in the corner and that would just mean to me well that part of the conversation is done and so in that way if it had all been digital who knows how that would have gone and when we think about conversations they're really like mazes where the individual rooms can be thought of topics of conversations so you might be in me I've the first time I've met you room and you might be chatting back and forth with them about subjects then you'll make a statement and that might move you on to hey we're ready to trade with you and there will be a series of back and forth phrases about that but you might insult them and that will take you to the I'm almost ready to kill you part of the conversation so you could organize conversations hierarchically in terms of these big blobs of purpose and the big major flows of events in the conversation and within those you could lay in additional details I don't know how how the effect of having everybody physically separated and not really knowing what anybody else was doing but it it definitely created distinct characters in in the actual writing that was done besides just the different writers the fact that they didn't know what the other person was writing and I thought not only were we trying to entertain this theoretical player but we're actually trying to kind of entertain each other early on I did almost all of my design in these hardbound books and so as you pour through them it looks sort of like the ravings of a madman and they all begin with I tend to lose things if you find this please give it back to me so here you have design for games these were three games we proposed one of which was star control the adventure which regains star control to some thoughts about way to construct ground surfaces and then as we move forward you'll find sometimes it's images or screen diagrams or this is for example a cutaway of the precursor super frame starship a mining mole down here and more screen layouts lists of powers and alien races this was sort of my first sketch for the mill enorme this actually relates to doing the Sega Genesis so it talks about disassembly and pc-relative addressing that was part of getting the reverse-engineered documentation here our story gates from start very early on I thought about story gates so you need to ally with the cyrene you do that by giving them their homeworld story you need to ally with the a hot and back here it was get them an excellent hunting creature which we ended up changing ally with spazzy convinced them that they're safer in concordance with you a lie with the Bucks apologize with conviction so I sort of work in a very freeform right in any direction orientation this has to do with them I believe probably patterns oh this is mod information this is how we were looking at for Channel sound sorry in some cases I barely remember and these are how you could edit sound I have a listing of a safe harbor bulletin board where they had actually a bunch of my games pirated but they also happen to have a lot of mod code related these were ways of looking at for example the Starbase commander he ended up just looking like Fred's standing in front of a window when I had here but we had a lot of other ideas he was sitting at a desk I think that's where we went this was sort of as I was thinking about what the Starbase itself would look like so I just have dozens of these and you know in some cases they make sense in some cases they're just a reflection of my weird mind this is so for every piece of art that we did oftentimes we had to cut cut it into chunks and then reposition it so these are all pixel offsets that I would write by hand and then we would enter in code by hand here's some example of texts where I'm starting to think about how conversations flow and so you'll see this is this here is the baby version of all of those diagrams out there and you can see how I'm thinking about you enter into a conversation there's a stack of phrases in some cases they'll delete themselves and take you back and in some cases a phrase will be replaced by a new phrase and in some cases you'll move to a whole new area of the conversation I'm not sure that actually makes any sense at this point but so as we've said the logic in the game was defined by a flowchart and then each point in that logic is represented by a conversation so in the conversation this is a diagram of how a conversation works that's not a more complicated one some of them are simpler because they have less to tell you right this represents one of them as complicated which is the conversation with the Starbase commander and so the form we chose was a little square is a thing that you're saying so like channel about the re Lu and then there would be a response from the Starbase commander which is a circle and you would ask a question they would make a response and then this code here which is sort of Ramu RS which stands for removed from a stack so this is a stack of phrases so you ask this question he says this this is removed and then it's replaced with this and eventually you'll exhaust these stacks and ultimately you'll get to a point where you move to a new collection of phrases and that's a new topic of conversation and then down the side here you'll see these are game states that are being changed or looked at as you talk so for example one of these game states is you have sold to many humans to the druze so the conversation changes at a certain point when you start to sell people to the druze the Starbase Commander gets mad and in fact you set a value here that over in a different part of the game where you buy crew raises the price of the crew because you've informed the Starbase commander that you were selling too many crew so we laid this out and we would Fred with encode thus based upon this illustration and then afterwards we would either I wrote a little over half the dialogue in the game and then the other half was done by friends and so I would sit down with them and I'd say the Starbase Commander is this guy he talks like this this is what you need to get across and then they would go through each one of these read what I was asking them and then they would answer this sort of in the words of the Starbase Commander as I communicated it and then we would get something back like this now in this case I I wrote this but so we would just get these are the statements that Starbase that you're asking of the Starbase Commander and then here are his responses and the manner in which the text is written and broken down affects how it appears on the screen and okay I'm a real font nerd always have been and back when it was all lettre set in books if that means anything to people but so we decided that a part of what would sell the personality of the person you're talking with is if they had a different font but fonts were not standardized in that time the way they are now in Windows so we wrote a font editor and then I got sort of obsessed in kerning and turning which you may or may not know is the spacing between letters which is highly affected by the specific letters you're using like you have a capital T in a lowercase a you got to tuck that lowercase a up against that T so we created a system for doing that and ultimately I think we ended up with really beautiful text that in some cases very much helped the character sell themselves so like the the evil ill wrath had this kind of Gothic font and the heavy milnor may had kind of a chubby font and like I'm totally obsessed on this once on another game we didn't have an automatic kerning system and they made the designers hand turn all the text in the game for days and they still haven't forgiven me for it did we mention he's totally obsessed totally obsessed with us that's I'm really looking forward to that part in future games so this then becomes the original text that we would get and then of course as we were playing the game things would have to change or we would find errors in the text and then there's translation which is a whole nother deal but all of this material migrated into the open source version except they never saw any of these charts these charts ended up in code and then the code is sort of what marched forward and to become the open source and nowadays you know I for example have been working on tools that let you generate these conversations dynamically and I'm gonna miss writing it on paper kind of because I got really strong hands at that time but I think I will no longer be limited to a single people piece of papers worth of conversation not so much in conversations but fred delights in my pain I would just say that and I was once saving out all of the separate rotations of ass planet around a star and so as we would place these different planets around stars the highlight of where the Sun was shining on it would change and there was like seven different sizes and ten different colors and it ultimately it meant that there were I don't know one or two thousand separate little pieces of art that had to be saved off separately and I spent a couple of days doing this and then I was all done and then Fred said oh you saved them off in the wrong I think you might need to save them all off again and then I did and then a little bit later he said oh that's okay I changed the code so that other format would work very very evil God joke boom God joke yes but so this represents ultimately the brain behind the story written down on paper and I think this is the only explanation that's ever been given for this so in the future history if anyone ever asks you what these mean this can be used well I love real science I'm not a scientist a lot of family members are but um I love kind of swimming in it and back before the Internet the concise encyclopedia of science and technology was a form of entertainment and I still read through this just for fun sometimes so sometimes I would have a specific topic that I would search and then sometimes I would just pause it until I found something intriguing and sometimes it would be an article on parasites and sometimes it would be the word light or Gondwanaland or how you know gaps and transistors work and there's a lot of parasites in the world that's an important lesson to be learned but for me either it would be a concept that was intriguing or it would be a name that was intriguing or a process but the mistake that I made was thinking that it was the literal version of that that would entertain people it's an interpreted version or a version that simply inspires a thought which you then deliver a entertainment within so you know if I actually were to describe to you the you know the genome of cassowaries that would not be very interesting but if I told you that cassowaries are the most dangerous birds on earth and they periodically kill people and they are actually little dinosaurs and you should learn about cassowaries and avoid them highly dangerous creatures but to me what's funny about that is my paranoia about giant birds how colorful they are how fast they move how tricky they are but not the technical details that exist in here however this is inspiration at least for me and all of that gameplay figuring out the gameplay happened before this it wasn't until we had the entire gameplay working when I said Paul I'm running out of things to do you need to you need to set this down so that's yeah I can only live in your imagination so long it's rather hard to do a direct brain to game transfer you have to go through some intermediate medium start control began with this goofy little drawing and most of my designs begin this way with the goofy little drawing I'm I'm not embarrassed at all to do horrible drawings but this pretty much says the whole concept which is science fiction archon in this case over the phone because I was interested in making this a modem game I ended up abandoning all of that but the fundamental idea of fighting ships and then having a strategy game carried through and down here I start putting out words that I think are interesting cruisers scout destroyer and start sketching shapes now this was a ninja Ridge '''l II intended for the Commodore 64 so you get very very simple shapes so I was trying to build that little language now next I wanted Electronic Arts to publish this and to give me a bunch of money to make the game so I decided I would sell this game to them through an advertisement they had very unique in particular ads so this is a sketch of how I thought I could lay it out and then ultimately I went into oh sure so this is a sketch I just drew in a journal of how I would lay it out how to try to capture Electronic Arts format for advertisements and then they went in and wrote the captions and did the art and then this is sort of this is a copy of the copy but this is ultimately what I went to them with and they passed but very importantly there was a producer at Electronic Arts who thought it was cool and she ended up going to a clue and saying look I can get you a much better deal at accolade for a 3-game project and that our con was our start control was the key to all of that so then you in here this is just more original ideas this range from a few words I was writing about star control one to a very simple couple of pages on star control to and you know there's always a germ of an idea and it very rarely looks like what you end up with but it's important I think to understand how we got to where we went to see how it started and start control to the air Kwan masters as you can see was proposal number four there were three other proposals that we offered at the same time as star control to that we'll never see the light of day one of its involved time-traveling and saving the dinosaurs so I studied field geology in college I really loved that class right up until the point I caught a sub lethal dose of poison oak but it I've always left maps whether it's in Dungeons & Dragons or field geology so when we were laying out the star map before I spent my way too much time building the star map editor I laid this out on paper and I thought about constellation shapes and constellation names and how to distribute the various characters that were established in star control one and then how to add new characters to start control - this is actually upside down I'll flip that around I do believe yes that makes more sense so for example this hexagon of stars here is the PACU a star system which is I believe Latin for wolf and this is where the anderson vanished and the ores appeared which is a major plot element and then out here I think there were times I might not even have known what the new aliens were going to be out here but I would just sort of mark off an area of space for them and I don't even think I've indicated that this central area is where the doctrinal conflict is occurring and that's the battle between the two different subspecies of the orc Juan so later on I think this map this is probably oh gosh I think I was starting to work on the clue book heads and so these ancient maps were all over the walls and were frequently falling apart that's an earlier version of that and I think this was maybe the very earliest plane you can tell cuz it's super ugly but this pretty much just says totally dangerous region crawling with spin word or Kwan fighting anti-spin order Quan and then the spatha are here and the ORS are here in the Bucks are here and I think some of these ended up getting moved around but I think I've got the galactic core is that way and the spin word an anti spinner door this way so this was how we sort of laid it out and to me this is pure Dungeons & Dragons at this point you know using paper role-playing game to sort of lay out a map and think about an adventure and then we subsequently translate it further and further into a digital form I think this may have been in little this is probably a 10-second sketch that turned into that so you're sort of going backwards through time here seeing it in a more and more primitive sense this is art this is something that did not happen this was I think a previous drawing that was laying out a hotdog versus some sort of pool shape I'm not that one I didn't like so when I say that for every good idea it's important to do 10 bad ones it may be a hundred bad ones but if you don't do them you won't figure out which is the good one and which is the bad news so this is where I think we started to lay out East our systems and maybe the quasi space portal system so and then as with everything else this migrated from a paper form into a digital form and then we would revise it in digital form so it's highly likely that none of these paper versions are accurate to what ended up in the game
