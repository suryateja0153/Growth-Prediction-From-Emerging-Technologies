 welcome to this session uh where we're showcasing some of our top student researchers um every summer we invite stanford students to participate in the student energy lecture series series in which they speak about their innovative energy research and they received live feedback during that time from a stanford communications tutor this year was our 10th year of this series and this summer it featured 14 of our top students who were nominated by their professors it was also of course the only time that we've conducted this series uh virtually um the student speakers were judged a panel that considered the the content the relevance and the materials of each talk and i'd like to thank um jenny mill ryan bartholomews and steve eglash who joined me on that uh judging panel by the way

maha youssef and then we'll move on from there so i'll pass it on to you hello everyone my name is maha yusuf i'm very honored to be here today to talk about enabling extreme fast charging of lithium-ion batteries as part of the stanford energy distinguished student lecture i want to start with a bigger picture overview of a word we want to live in a word that is worth investing in a word with reduced co2 emissions with reduced global warming a world that is sustainable and has global energy security and one way to do that is to enable electric transportation now that's a word i want to live in electric vehicles or evs reduce global emissions if you look at the data here which compares life cycle global warming emissions of a mid-sized gasoline car with that of a mid-sized battery electric vehicle you can clearly see that there is around a 50 reduction in global warming emissions with most of this reduction coming from the operation of the ev itself thus evs reduce global emissions however if you own an ev today you also know that there are many problems associated with it for example if you're driving from stanford to la you need to think about the charging stations to stop at and you also need to factor in the charging time required thus a potential solution is extreme fast charging or xfc of ev batteries with this we are literally looking at around 10 to 15 minutes of charging now this is a goal set by u.s advanced battery consortium for 2023 before we delve into the challenges of xfc let's look into how a lithium-ion battery works in this schematic i'm showing a positive electrode known as cathode a negative electrode known as anode now when you are charging your electric car you are moving lithium ions from the positive electrode through the electrolyte to the negative electrode where they get stored between these layers of graphite as electrochemical energy now when you drive your car you're discharging it right so you're moving these lithium ions back from the negative electrode to the positive electrode now what happens when you try to charge your car really really fast what you're doing is you're moving these lithium ions very fast from the positive to the negative electrode and during that process lithium or li plating develops in this schematic here as an example i'm showing two custom-made battery power cells that were charged between 10 and 15 minutes and you can see both of them experience the deposition of this whitish material which is lithium metal and this process is known as lithium plating this process becomes favorable over lithium intercalation in certain regions of this graphite anode due to the buildup of lithium-ion concentration near the anode at high charging rates lithium plating has been identified as one of the key battery degradation mechanisms during xfc and it needs to be understood well at a fundamental level so that we can develop fast charge batteries therefore in my research i investigate where when and why does lithium plating deposit on the battery anode during xfc in my proposed approach i'm working with simultaneous neutron and x-ray imaging it is a non-destructive imaging modality that provides 3d visualization of ally plating because x-rays are sensitive to the electron density and neutrons to the nuclear density this dual mode imaging provides us complementary data i did these experiments at a bd2 imaging beamline at nist a schematic of which is shown here you can see that this red corresponds to neutron beam produced in a nuclear reactor blue corresponds to an x-ray beam produced by an extra tube both of these beams hit the sample here right in the middle at the same time during the imaging experiment we have a neutron and an x-ray detector that detects the neutrons and x-rays after they have interacted with the sample providing us a respective neutron and an x-ray image my spatial resolution was 10 to 15 microns which is great to look at lithium metal deposits in my experimental design i firstly imaged an uncycled graphite anode and secondly a cycle graphite anode to compare changes between them before and after cycling this is an optical image of a cyclographic graphite anode i cut a strip around this red dotted line here and put it in a glass capillary for imaging for my data analysis i am using information from my extra histogram and my neutron histogram and i use them to create a 2d histogram where i have neutron pixel intensity on the x-axis and x-ray pixel intensity on the y-axis now because i'm interested in locating lithium and lithium is a losing material it would probably lie in this green region here with high neutrons and low x-ray intensity here we are looking at 2d grayscale images of recycled anode on the left hand side we are looking at a neutron image where we can identify copper strip and the anode pretty clearly in the x-ray image we can only identify copper clearly and the anode not so clearly one thing i want to point out here is that as you can see in this images copper delaminated from the anode because of the xc2 destructive nature of the sample itself i took these 2d images and created a 2d histogram to convert them into my segmented colorize image as shown here here green outer circle corresponds to glass capillary yellow corresponds to copper and pink corresponds to the battery anode this is an optical image of the graphite strip that i used for imaging where lithium deposition is pretty evident inside this red highlighted box here because i collected this data at many different angles i can correlate these 2d slices or images to the spatial location on the graphite strip for example first and second slice corresponds to the thick yellow line labeled one and two here and we can see growth of lithium plating clearly on the graphite anode in the third and fourth slice now these are 2d slices of a 3d volume so i took them and stitched them together to create 3d visualization that shows me the thickness of lithium plating in these images yellow corresponds to 10 microns of copper and purple corresponds to 80 microns of graphite on the left hand side we are looking at a 3d visualization of an uncycled or pristine anode where you can see these two strips on top of each other with no sign of lithium plating however on the right hand side where we are looking at the visualization of a cycled anode you can see deposits of lithium plating on the graphite anode inside these black circles very clearly this data has been collected on an anode which was harvested from a battery however a better way to image lithium plating would be to do so non-destructively which means without opening the battery okay so in my next sample i took a full battery pouch cell assembled at argon national lab rolled it up as shown here to fit in the field of view for my imaging data this is a neutron and an x-ray image of the battery power cell you can see in my segmented image i was able to identify battery anode and cathode pretty well which we can see in 3d visualization as well now this is important for my future work because i'm interested in locating lithium plating in three dimensions in these very power cells non-destructively to conclude i use simultaneous neutron and x-ray imaging that provides 3d visualization of lithium plating on graphite anodes this dual mode imaging is advantageous in its ability to separate different battery components from each other very easily in this data set i was able to answer where does lithium plating deposit on the battery anode during xfc in lithium ion batteries in my future work i'm currently working on quantifying this amount of plated lithium in three dimensions but mostly focusing on my non-destructive in c2 imaging work of full battery pout cells at different states of charge to really answer the question when and why does lithium plating deposit on battery anode we believe that addressing these fundamental questions about lithium plating will lead to rational battery designs that will prevent lithium plating from happening in the first place with this i want to acknowledge my three advisors at stanford slack and university of colorado boulder and my funding agencies for funding my phd to a sustainable future of electric mobility i thank you all oh hi so i guess it's my turn for my presentation now so hello everybody uh my name is angel and i'm a phd student in kanye law group so today i'm happy to share my research with all of you which is to identify the active site for proping combustion using nanocrystal catalyst so firstly i hope to walk you through this title to let you understand this for those of people who are not familiar with chemistry so basically uh we hope to identify this active site uh where the site is always categorized into the following three categories uh in terms of geometry tyrus king and step so uh we hope to find the site that is able to uh lower uh the activation barrier for a specific reaction uh because uh with this lower activation barrier we are able to facilitate this reaction and have a higher rate for this specific reaction uh so next we hope to also uh target on the propine combustion because basically for every gasoline-powered car there exists this catalytic converter which contains this diesel oxidation catalyst to transfer this harmful molecules into less harmful products and we choose propane to be our mother compound because proping is one of the most common uh harmful molecules in car and we let it mix with oxygen to produce sealed water which are less harmful to the environment and next we hope to use this nano crystal catalyst to find the active site it is because in the past people always use a conventional way to synthesize uh the catalyst which always results in poor defined size shape and face so uh with this will control uh nano crystal catalyst we're able to really create a uniform system that is uh systematically change the surface uh to help us find uh the active change uh with the change in the surface site so from now on i'll be walking you through how i use this well-defined nanocrystal to find the active site uh so firstly uh we choose platinum and platinum for propine combustion it because these two elements are known to be the best elements for propane combustion and uh with this synthesis we have synthesized a set of materials ranging from two nanometer to 10 nanometers of the platinum platinum uh here shows uh the microscope images of this five different sized nanocrystals and later we deposit them onto alumina support uh because we hope to expose this metal surface to the reaction and then uh finally we use this particle size we have you we have also conducted the particle size distribution analysis to see that the particle size is maintained before an after deposition and you can see the shape of of all the materials here are mostly spherical and the very first thing we hope to ask is that whether we do alloy these two elements so we have used several techniques to examine that so from icp we see that the palladium platinum ratio is very close to one which is our target ratio and then from seal chemistry we see that the dispersion is decreasing with increasing particle size which is also in line with our expectation and then from the edes mapping we see that the signal of platinum and platinum are lining in line on top with each other so from this several techniques uh we see that it's possible that we do alloy these two elements and we have also have a collaborator in slack uh we where we are able to see uh the x-ray uh x-ray absorption spectroscopy result and from here we can see that uh the coordination number of palladium uh is almost the same across different particle sizes and from the coordination embryo we can see that uh for palladium it's a fcc matter so it's basically surrounded by two of other neighborhood agents and from the coordination number we see that best half of the neighbor atoms that's successfully replaced by platinum so from this several results we can tell that we indeed synthesized a random alloy of platinum and platinum and now we can use this set of beautiful materials for the catalysis so we put where i put this materials into our reaction mixture which is composed of propane oxygen and water uh try to stimulate the environment of engine and before i start i would hope we used uh this terminal frequency uh to uh measure the activity of our materials which is basically a number to tell how many of the reactants are successfully transferred into uh the products so from the term frequency we can see that uh with a larger particle uh the total frequency also becomes higher so this tells that the propane combustion is a structural sensitive reaction and now with this we're able to see now the question becomes uh how are we going to use this data to find the active site so the very first thing is that what is the site that is on the larger particle so we hope to tell that by firstly examine how the particle interacts with the reactants by using radoder so rate odor is basically a quality that is uh that tells us how sensitive uh particle particle is to the change in the reactants so we have uh three reactants in this reaction propane oxygen and water uh so firstly we have changed the propane partial pressure and see the change in the activity to tail the oxygen uh the propane rate odor so as you can see as the particle size increases the propane rate order becomes more negative and then as the oxygen partial pressure increases the oxygen rate order becomes more positive this tells us that it's possible the larger particle contains a higher fraction of the site that is more sensitive to the change of the reactants and then finally from water rate odor we see almost zero rate order for water which is very uncommon for such reaction because water is always known to poison the nanoparticle so uh this water effect is interesting so we hope to see whether water is playing any interesting role uh for this uh particle so we have found another collaborator in suncatch which is able to simulate the particle shape on the different environments so firstly uh they have synthesized or they have simulated this palladium platinum particle on the vacuum and you can see that the surface is highly faceted and then we have exposed this particle in water environment which is uh which is done by put this hydroxyl oxobate onto the surface and after that you can see the particle shape now becomes more spherical which is very close to our uh microscope observation for the largest inner particle and then this tells us that with the presence of water this uh step site is now exposed on the larger nanoparticle and using a more quantitative more competitive way it means that the surface energy of the step of the step site is now stabilized in the presence of water and then with the dft calculation we can also see that several different representative reactions are also having lower activation barrier on the step side so this tells us that it's possible the step side is uh the one that has a lower activation barrier and the larger particle has a higher fraction of the step side which is stabilized by the presence of water and now we really want to answer how this steps uh what the step side looks like for the larger nanoparticle so we have constructed a model which is able to help us count the percentage of difference and symbol of the sides um the particle so we see that basically this is the change of this n symbols with the change in particle size and then to compare that change with alternative frequency which is the experimental data we see that this is this s this edge and sample seven seven uh is in line with the slope of the terminal frequency so this tells us that uh the 77n sample side is the active site of for this reaction and uh in the future we should find a way to engineer this site in order to uh maximize the rate for this reaction so the takeaway of this is that uh firstly we have used this new well-defined materials to identify the structure sensitivity and then next we see that the water is able to drive this reconstruction of the surface and help expose the more active step site and then the active site 77 is active for this reaction so with that i would like to thank our collaborators and kanyello group members and i'm happy to take any question thank you hi everyone my name is kelly and thank you for joining me today it's a pleasure to be here to be able to share my research with you on photoconductivity in diamond done in the wide bandgap lab advised by professors for monty chowdhury so in this presentation i will first talk about how why bandgap materials are suitable for use in power electronics and specifically diamond as such a semiconductor material afterwards i will introduce photoconductive switches and talk about the characterization setup for our doped diamond devices and finally i will present some preliminary results we have measured recently from our fabricated samples so power electronics is the process of using semiconductor switching devices to control and convert electrical power flow from one form to another to meet some specific need these kinds of systems have applications in energy conversion in power grids electric drives in industrial motors power supplies for data centers and electrical vehicles among many other applications and what leads to our interests for wide bandgap materials in this space are their intrinsic properties that allow for reduced energy losses high voltage operation high temperature operation and high frequency operation the potential energy saved annually by the us by switching from silicon which we know to be the most traditional semiconductor to wide van gaap materials and power systems is summarized in this table from a study done by the oak ridge national laboratory done in 2017 and perhaps to put into perspective the importance of engineering efficient devices we know that around 10 percent of energy is lost in inefficient power conversion so while we can thank silicon for the electronics we know today it has reached its operational limits and we must now look towards new materials such as diamond for the next generation of high power electronics we are choosing to look into diamonds since it appears to be the ideal wide bandgap semiconductor at least on paper you may have heard of gallium nitride and silicon carbide which are more well known wide band gap materials that are commercially available and diamond on the other hand is still in its earlier stages of development in comparison to silicon which has a band gap of 1.12 electron volts diamond has a much larger band gap of 5.47 electron volts and the wide bandgap of these kinds of materials gives them a high breakdown voltage this allows devices to handle much higher voltages with a fraction of the size as pictured here and more uniquely diamond also has high thermal conductivity which helps prevent heating effects and potentially eliminate the need for cooling systems so all these material properties together allow for lighter simpler and more efficient systems using these new wideband gap materials um so since diamonds and newer material um i just want to give a brief introduction on how they're grown and their dopants so diamond single crystalline substrates are grown by high pressure high temperature methods and by chemical vapor deposition and then to control the conductivity of a semiconductor we can dope the material by adding impurities which can source free electrons or holes that can change the conductivity of the material so in diamonds boron nitrogen and phosphorus have been used as dopants and they each have their respective activation energies which define the energy required to release their carrier for conduction and as doping technology in diamond has improved the research in recent years we are now able to fabricate devices such as diodes and transistors based in diamond technology for example previous work done in our group has shown a pin diode blocking over one kilovolts across 8.5 micron thickness before breaking down which corresponds to where this current spikes here and in other places around the world such as japan and europe diodes have also reached hold up holdoff voltages of up to two kilovolts so with many communities actively invested in diamond its high voltage capabilities have been demonstrated so now in my research we are studying diamond's photoconductive properties the basic operation of a photoconductive switch is pretty simple the conductance between two terminals on a semiconductor is modulated by the absorption of the optical radiation this photon energy then creates free carriers in this material to generate current under the influence of a bias voltage applied to the contacts so more simply put when the laser is off the switch ideally is considered open in a circuit and when we shoot a laser at the device it would ideally act as a closed switch allowing current flow for the approx for approximately the duration of the laser pulse and our motivation for developing photo conductive switches is for high power applications these switches have been shown to be high speed compact with very low jitter and they most immediately have applications and pulsed power however as we are moving towards electrification of our energy we will rely more and more on safe mechanisms for making and breaking circuits that carry large amounts of power which photoconductive switches can play a role in when we create switches that are triggered by light it isolates the control from the output eliminating the potential for inadvertent switch triggering and also simplifies the control circuit so now i would like to go into a bit more detail on the principles of photo excitation as i mentioned earlier in photoconductive switching the incident light is absorbed in the semiconductor exciting carriers into their conduction or valence band in intrinsic photoconductive switches which in which the material is not doped it depends on the absorption of a photon with energy greater than or equal to the band gap energy however in extrinsic photoconductive switching which is our focus impurities in the samples allow carriers to be excited by subband gap photon energies based on their activation energies so to excite carriers across the band gap a uv light source is needed while to excite carriers of dopants less energy is needed which would allow for greater flexibility in choosing our excitation source which is helpful for engineering applications and so throughout these past months i fabricated samples which consists of a couple of photo conductive switches on a 3 by 3 millimeter diamond substrate the basic optical setup we have for a photo excitation uses a 1064 nanometer nd yag laser the second harmonic is generated to produce 532 nanometer light and then the beam is directed to the sample being probed under the scope so the fabricated sample is connected to a test circuit that is pictured over here and this results in a pulsed photo response that is measured across the load resistor corresponding to the laser interaction with the photoconductive switch that is in series with the load and so some preliminary testing was done using past doped diamond samples in the group before starting my own fabrication and so the data is shown on the left you can immediately see that there is a pulse in the photo response that corresponds to the laser pulse the rise time is quite sharp while the fall time is slightly slower and this might be due to heating effects from the laser causing the resistivity to remain lower as it is cooling down we have since done further testing on fabricated photoconductive devices which produced a much sharper response an order of magnitude higher in voltage and the current on over off ratios was calculated to be on the order of 10 to the seven and greater so more comprehensive studies are to come that will allow us to identify how different doping species and concentrations affect the photoresponsivity among other factors and this will then allow us to engineer a more optimized photo conductive switch and based on our preliminary results i think it's very promising and it's encouraging us to keep exploring diamond as a substrate for light triggered switching so this concludes my presentation for today but i would like to acknowledge the stanford pre-court institute for energy for funding this research and i would also like to thank my advisor cerbanti chaudhry my research partner on this project muhammad ali malakutian and the members of the wide bandgap lab thank you hello everyone my name is william i'm a fifth year phd here at stanford in the lab of professor eatsway in the material science department and i'm going to tell you guys a bit about some of my recent work using electron microscopy to characterize the the structures within battery materials so as maha mentioned batteries are extremely important for uh for clean energy um but the main uh one one main impediment to the adoption of electric vehicles in the transportation sector is their driving range so one solution to increase the uh the adoption is to enable faster charging but the other direction for that to address the the driving range is just increase the energy density within the battery and one way to do this is by moving beyond lithium-ion chemistries so in lithium-ion chemistries there is no elemental lithium within the battery you're just shuttling lithium ions between a cathode and a graphite anode but by instead taking advantage of different chemistries for example lithium plating chemistry which is uh undesired in lithium ion chemistries by taking advantage of lithium metal plating and using that as your anode chemistry can actually increase the energy density of your battery but of course this hasn't been done because this chemistry is very difficult to actually use in the battery and the reason why that is is because lithium metal is very inefficient your lithium ion battery is actually very good at cycling but lithium metal batteries are very bad at cycling and will quickly die after only a few cycles and the reason why that is is due to instability of what's called the solid electrolyte interface or sei within the battery and this sei is basically a surface layer that exists on the battery anode whether it's lithium metal or graphite coming from the decomposition of the electrolyte at the very reducing potentials of the battery anode in the lithium-based battery and what this sci does is it stops the further decomposition of the electrolyte so it passivates the uh the electrode electrolyte interface but it also uh dictates performance because it um it controls the ion transfer from the electrolyte onto the electrode so it's an extremely important structure in the battery and if we were to build better batteries for example lithium metal batteries we need to understand the sci as physicochemical properties so people have done this for many years uh just using the characterization tools we have available to to understand the chemistry uh and probe the structure of the sci it's commonly used in the field is a technique called x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy which is a surface analytical technique it gives very good spectral resolution but gives very poor spatial resolution but using these kinds of advanced characterization tools people have built models of the sci trying to understand its structure and the different chemistry of the components within this has led to this conventional model of the sci where you have this inorganic inner sei layer consisting of lithium fluorides and oxides and carbonates interfaced with the anode uh and a more uh porous organic outer sci layer uh interfaced with the electrolyte this is widely accepted within the field uh however these the length scale that these different components exist at are not really understood whether these uh these components are segregated over the nanometer scale or the micron scale and these these are not really accessible through surface probes like xps ideally you would use what's called the transmission electron microscope so electron microscopy is highly useful in material science because it offers resolutions down to the sub nanometers or atomic resolution but the problem is that these electron microscopes use very high energy electron beams you have electron beams coming in on the order of about 300 kev kinetic energy which is highly damaging to the sample and that's why tem or transmission electron microscopy has not been widely used in the battery community so this has recently been addressed through advanced advances in what's called cryogenic tem where by cooling the sample to liquid nitrogen temperature we can actually stabilize battery materials within the tem for atomic resolution imaging and this is first demonstrated by our group here at stanford and we published this image in the journal science uh where you can actually see the atomic resolution uh lithium metal lattice here interfaced with an organic uh layer of sei embedded with inorganic materials such as lithium oxide and lithium carbonate and this looks pretty similar to the sci models i've been proposed previously so it's not too surprising but if you look closely between the experimental image of the sci developed by or shown through cryotem with the uh the conventional model of the sei you'll actually notice some different differences and one difference is a certain component in the um conventional model not observed through tem and this is it's this component of lithium fluoride so that's only one component among others the rest are mostly observed within the tem so maybe you're wondering why this is so important but the reason why is because lithium fluoride is considered the most important sti component out of this whole mosaic of different sci building blocks lithium fluoride is known to be widely critical uh to to the battery performance and just by adding more fluorine into the electrolytes so many uh lithium-ion batteries are heavily fluorinated in the electrolyte uh you can further stabilize the lithium metal cycling so the question here uh being asked across the entire lithium metal battery community is where is lithium fluoride uh because we know it's to be it's so important in the electrolyte why is it not seen in the sci so the goal of my research here is to uncover what's happening with lithium fluoride and where it's distributed within the sei so to do this we can build some experiments that make good use of fluorinated electrolytes because the sci chemistry closely matches the electrolyte chemistry so here we're using a standard battery electrolyte um an ethylene carbonate based electrolyte this is let's use new lithium-ion battery with uh 10 volume percent so a good amount of fluorination through the use through the addition of a fluoroethylene carbonate battery solvent and this is used in silicon containing batteries along with lithium metal containing batteries uh this is a cycling efficiency plot and basically by adding 10 volume percent of fec your cycling stability goes up significantly and this is widely known uh to be the effect of fec if you then take this battery apart and start to do x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the lithium metal anode we can see this commonly accepted structure of the sci where the outer surface is more organic containing more uh organic carbons and fluorocarbons and then as you sputter deeper within the sample so approaching the lithium metal surface uh getting deeper in the sci there's more inorganic sci components such as lithium fluoride and lithium oxide if you take this structure to be your sci structure you'll build this kind of uh conventional sdi model where you have the inorganic inner sdi and a more organic outer sei now if we then take that same sample and put it inside the tem this time we're using the tem the transmission electron microscope in scanning mode coupled with uh the electron spectroscopy capabilities we can actually map out the chemical distributions at the nanoscale on individual lithium deposits so lithium deposits in this kind of filamentary structure which is problematic for different reasons but basically we can see that mapping out the structure and chemistry of individual lithium deposits with nanometer precision we'll find that even across microns of lithium we're not really seeing any fluorine within the sci we can see oxygen we can see lithium but no fluorine so basically within this sci which is this outer oxygenated layer on the lithium surface where there is not this inner sci rich in lithium fluoride that xps would suggest so what's going on here and this is the major discrepancy uh shown in the tem and xps and the whole field really so in principle uh this led me to think about the different length scales being probed in xps a surface analysis technique and that in microscopy and basically uh it's in principle possible that this lithium fluoride component could be depositing outside of the sci so to probe this outside of the the compact sci layer on lithium metal so to probe this we build a model system where we can have a very well defined electrochemically active surface so here we're using a carbon membrane just evaporated onto a tem grid and we can use that as a working electrode in a battery and build a uh intentionally built an sdi on this very flat substrate and basically what we find is if we take this substrate build that sei within this highly fluorinated electrolyte we can see now that there's a whole new regime of sci that's not being probed on the lithium metal surface through microscopy but it's being probed through xps basically what we see is that all these particles are depositing within the sci at the micron scale no longer the nanometer scale and these particles are basically where the lithium fluoride is all going and if we look closely at the nanostructure of these different lithium fluoride particles we find that there is a interesting bilayer structure where the uh these particles have this dual inner inorganic layer rich in lithium fluorides and a more organic outer layer a more oxygenated outer layer which matches the structure observed in xps but not actually observed directly through microscopy and this is basically what appears to be the origin of that discrepancy between microscopy and xps and through traditional surface analysis techniques it becomes uh it's impossible to actually probe the true structure of the sei um very quickly just by by uh by observing the different lithium metal structures a very high surface area deposit it becomes very obvious that these lithium fluoride crystals which are depositing at the micro scale are in fact very dilute on the lithium surface and this is the origin of why it cannot be seen within the sci layers because these lithium fluoride crystals do not exist within uh the compact thin film of sci material but instead are depositing very sparsely and because these lithium fluoride crystals are depositing so sparsely uh it becomes more in question uh how much these lithium fluoride uh deposits can actually affect the bad recyclability but basically through uh through high-resolution probes such as cryo-electron microscopy it becomes possible to actually uh resolve the structure and chemistry of the sci with nanometer precision and you can only then start to see how uh traditional surface analysis techniques cannot truly resolve the actual structure of the solid electrolyte interface and lastly i just want to thank my my advisor and collaborators for this work along with the organizers of this symposium for the invitation to share my research thank you thank you all those were four tremendous uh presentations uh you should all be uh proud of your work i think i saw most of these this summer and they're even better this time so we did as almost exactly as planned by richard we have about five or six minutes for questions so i'm going to try to be brief and maybe just ask one key question to each person combining concepts as we go along so in maha's talk there were a group of questions and they were basically related to this maybe on your research radar agenda now um are are you able to uh to what extent can you ascertain the just where the plating occurs and what the distribution is with an eye towards uh remedies and ultimately uh being able to improve both performance and economic competitiveness i know that's a broad question but i'm sure you've thought about at least one of those questions i did see the questions in the q a and their questions oh great great that makes my job easier sorry i answered like a couple of them i i hope people can see that anyways um coming back to your question right now um the data i have collected has been on destructive samples so coming back to that question of like exactly where is lithium plating and why it's splitting there for that i'm focusing on my in-situ imaging work which will be done in a full battery um non-destructively and will enable me to answer why is it completing in certain location as compared to the other but i know there are research groups who are working on like other techniques to um look at it look at the same problem with an even higher resolution great well thank you so much for angel um an intriguing question to me maybe because it's not my field that it did sound interesting does the propane react reaction change the geometry of the nano crystals particularly in the corners and edges yeah so we have look at the before and after tn images for the nanoparticle and see no change in the corner and kink site so basically these geometry are really similar before and after so um yeah i believe there's no uh significant change on that great thank you um and for kelly a lot of interest in what the negatives are for these diamond-wide bandgap devices leading towards improvement of the economics why aren't they more widely adopted now and where do you see the um most promising applications yes so that is definitely a fair question and i think just like any research topic it takes time to develop the technology to a point where um perhaps the costs of getting new infrastructure to support these new materials becomes worth it in terms of um better performance efficiency so it is not widely used basically um i guess we're here doing research to hopefully show that the benefits um are worth like the commercial interests of perhaps investing in these new technologies and so i think um the applications would be similar to what um gallium nitride and silicon carbide are currently taking over some like charging applications applications in electric vehicles general high power switching i think by using these new materials we would have a lot smaller devices that are more efficient so to me it would probably be for diamond which is the most immature of these materials probably still like a decade looking forward but um pretty much looking at the i would say the costs and the benefits that people would have to see whether this is this panned down in the future which i believe it will be worth it yeah so i guess you're saying that you as a researcher a basic res researcher you're trying to create options that could lead to marketable technologies and of course whether or not it's marketable depends on what what the markets are doing uh so actually a similar question was asked for william uh how do you see uh this space uh obviously a lot of our uh audience is kind of uh market uh business related i have noticed uh hanging out with richard and uh brian bartholomew is that a lot of you who are in the lab now 10 years from now will be ceos and ctos are very successful uh companies so william uh do you have inclinations in that direction or what what advice would you give uh colleagues who might be so inclined yeah um thank you for this question uh we'll see about uh ceo or cto uh but for for the um uh for the battery field there's a lot of very interesting technology startups out there um along with larger companies such as uh tesla so tesla is uh probably going to be the largest producer of lithium ion batteries soon but for kind of next generation lithium metal type lithium metal batteries for example or sodium ion sodium metal batteries uh there are a lot of really interesting startups out there doing a lot of work uh trying to commercialize these technologies um the hardest part about in my opinion the hardest part about making these next generation batteries is not getting a great chemistry or getting a great material the hardest part that's actually like that's sort of step zero in a sense of actually commercializing your technology um and the hardest part really is manufacturing these these materials at uh say like the gigawatt hour or terawatt hour scale this is a problem that tesla among their suppliers panasonic lg chem they've all recognized that this is an extremely difficult task taking basically something from the lab to the factory um but still i i am optimistic for these these uh uh next gen chemistries lithium metal especially along with silicon anodes which are kind of the next generation of lithium ion battery anodes uh but recently if you follow lithium-based startups uh this can be called quantum scape which is actually found us started here at stanford um trying to commercialize solid-state metal batteries and they recently announced that they'll be having a public offering yeah they think um to well um in tesla's recent um public um announcement they announced that they're replacing graphite with silicon and they'll be using that for their lithium-ion batteries the silicon anodes it was just announced like i think few a month ago yeah uh just uh playing along this straight line uh i actually knew tim holm from konmanscape when he was a grad student and he was in the lab at that point and now as you saw in the an energy seminar a little over a year ago he's uh riding high so i look forward to seeing uh all of you uh doing so i i do think as i look at your advisors um often they do do the breakthroughs usually working with you in the lab but they seem to be some of the best people to ask about the manufacturing and scarab skillup problems because they're able to take the science that they've developed and say well there's a trade-off here so if you could save a lot of money we'll give you back a little bit of performance and so on that seems to be the ticket so i do look for big things from all of you in the future and i'd like to one last time thank maha angel kelly and william and especially richard for putting this session together thank you so much and thank you to the uh participants for going through the very um intense competition during the summer program and being victorious and sharing uh the results of your research with us here today thanks again one last time you
