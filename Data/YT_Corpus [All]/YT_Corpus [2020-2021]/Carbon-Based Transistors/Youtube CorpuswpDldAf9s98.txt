each page when you hear the following sound enjoy the show so this is 6:06 solid-state devices if this is the course for which you are in then you are in the right room now I'm Mohammad ashrafilal 'im and I'm a professor of Electrical Engineering and I have been teaching this course for several years now I have come after a long industrial experience at Bell Laboratories for about 10 years and so I have a broad industrial background and I've been teaching it for a few years now three four years now and so this is one of the courses that defines sort of the language by which people in our area micro electronics nanotechnology area they communicate with each other because many of you come from different backgrounds some from Electrical Engineering some from physics some from different countries and you will meet here this course will define the language and then of course in your PhD or master's thesis you will be doing different things and this sort of will define the broad framework of how you will discuss these topics among yourselves later on and most important there are two additional reasons why you take this course one is this qualifying exam people say that this is something this qualifying exam is based on or you have to take this course and the other is when you have job interviews almost invariably they will not ask you for any advanced courses only thing they will ask you is what you learn in this course alone so therefore this is a very important course both from intellectual perspective and all from practical carrier perspective okay so let me begin by giving you some broad course information and then we will go through the other topics of the day the books the two books we'll be using these are advanced semiconductor fundamentals this will be for first five weeks and the second book is semiconductor device fundamentals this will be for the next ten weeks so the first five weeks we'll talk about the basics the fundamentals quantum mechanics statistical mechanics transport theory these are general things now in the next five weeks or next ten weeks we'll apply this whatever we have learned the basic equations we have learned and we'll be applying them to understand how semiconductor devices work like diode bipolar transistor MOSFET how they work now these two things what we will do in the first five weeks you will see we will go through a lot of things but at the end will encapsulate it only a very few concept three or four concepts and that encapsulation would allow us to then explore such complicated devices these are very complicated things diode bipolar and MOSFET but in a very simple way and that is the essence of this these two books now the course website will be at this cobweb ec n dot Purdue at E is 6:06 notice the tilde and the office hours as I said I'll be available after the class which is supposed to end at 8:20 till 9:15 either here will stay here as long as possible and then I'll be available in my office office is that EE 320 upstairs now in terms of the bad things which is the homeworks and exams there'll be nine home roasted four will be graded and this four will be randomly chosen and and there will be three exams as we you know this first part of the basic transport theory will after we finish that we'll have one exam and the second will be after we finish the bipolar transistors and the third is the final when we do when we have discussed MOSFET now let's get a bird's-eye view of what this course is about and this course essentially has let me first explain to you that if you wanted to understand a modern electronic device like that computer you have on the left hand side then you understand it's a very complex thing it has lots of isyes it has a lot of the display itself has millions of transistors ten film transistors in the display the microprocessor sits underneath the keyboard the hard disk drive this ICS for those analog digital all sorts of complicated things but regardless of what the final product is it always starts in the foundation of physics and that foundation of physics is in quantum mechanics as in statistical mechanics and when you combine these two and I'll explain what they mean what we mean by this as you as we go on now these two when you combine them we will get something called a transport theory that when you apply an electric field then how the electrons move in a semi conductor if you put excess electron hole pair in some place how the diffuse away from that point so this is the basic that creates the foundation and that's the first five weeks right the first book first five weeks now once you know how electrons respond in as a function of the density gradient more density one place less dense in another place how they diffuse away or how they respond in presence of electric field then you are ready to talk about how different devices work for example how registers work how semiconductor diode work these terms you may have heard from your undergraduate years bipolar and how metal MOSFET works so that's will be this would be the foundation on the right hand side and the middle column this would be the devices that we'll think about once you know how this individual components work that's not the end of course then you will have one transistor one diode that's good for nothing these days in a microprocessor you have at least a billion transistors so there are of course additional issues and the additional issues are of course how to connect them together how to make them work as an aggregate and this would be thin film transistor for the display as I mentioned the display on your computer and the backplane millions millions of transistors almost as large as a microprocessor then of course you have the micro processors you have disk drives that riffs of your data and then there are MEMS for the read heads so all sorts of other things that you can get by combining the basic devices right and finally of course you have the when you put them together you have a system so what is six or six six or six is this rightmost two columns this is 6:06 and as you go through your graduate education you will do the third and the fourth column by other courses so that's what we are after so what are the courses well this is how in Purdue things are arranged in Purdue we have the six so six and six so forth these are in our area which is micro electronics a nanotechnology area are two basic courses you know no matter where you come from whatever your background is you start with sort of these two courses provides you a foundation but of course this is a found a which is which is not deep enough for graduate school this is good deep enough for probably undergraduate students now for the first five weeks remember we said quantum mechanics statistical mechanics the transport theory right we said that's that's the first five weeks if you wanted to know more especially people doing work on the theory and modeling area then in that case you will have to do take a whole set of other set of courses like 656 this is a transport Theory semi-classical transport Theory 6:59 quantum transport theory these are transport theory expanded version of the first five weeks now you can take all these courses for the foundation but those would be doing let's say more experiment or systems then they would go to the other side which is the next ten weeks right and then they will go to the system side and then Purdue at Purdue you have excellent set of other courses for example of the 6:54 this is this should be a 654 is solid-state 2 or this may have a slightly different name here so let's say 2 is a more advanced version where you know whatever you have learned the basics of bipolar you will learn about lasers you'll learn about microwave transistors more advanced devices but if you know 6 or 6 well this course well you see that shouldn't be a problem you should very easily be able to learn the other material 6 12 remember the last three or four weeks we'll be talking about MOSFET 612 is essentially all about MOSFET and also bipolar transistor but that you can take in a more advanced and expanded form in 612 well then there are courses on system design and other issues that you will be able to able to take and you should take depending on your interest but then that gives you the context that if you understand 606 well then you can see that we create a foundation for all the other courses that you will be taking subsequently this is very important now that's all about courses but let me explain to you first that why this course apart from the requirement even 606 is a required course but why electronics now is a very exciting place to be or a topic to learn you know last century people say that this was a century of electronics and started from this radio transmission across Atlantic great achievement you know people is even though it takes weeks to go across the Atlantic in ships but you could cross the Atlantic in seconds why if even less by radio waves and you know how where electronics have come today but you have might not have realized that this hundred years is actually there was a series of revolutions that happened and these revolutions are based on electronic devices and these were very fundamental it may or may not have happened and if it didn't happen then we wouldn't be where we are today in terms of electronics industry now this one on the left side from 1906 to 1950s is vacuum tube diode even these days you have vacuum tube diodes in very high powered electronics okay then 1947 onward you can see that transistor and by the end of the course you will know exactly why that transistor has this waste shaped form and how it functions and that was the next 30 years and then there is this MOSFET from 1960s onward and that is what we still have in our micro processors today right now now each one of them each of the transitions of course where noted are distinguished by several Nobel Prizes so these were big things this is a lot of interesting things and what I'd like to convince you today that there are several Nobel prizes waiting to happen so maybe one of you so as this one also comes to an end the MOSFET the physics of the time of MOSFET is also coming to some sort of saturation and we have a great opportunity for the future so why did this transition occur that you need to understand the transition occurred because initially you have one vacuum tube well you have some power dissipation you as you hook up with the battery but very soon by the end of Second World War when you put the vacuum tubes together in the system it looked like that a huge amount of them were failing because it is to be so hot that day is to say that one third of the American Navy during Second World Second World War was was in for repair because of some form of failure and electronic failure is often a big deal because when you have a relaxed full of diodes so hot that any of them it's like light bolts any of them can fail at any time and when one fails you have to take it out replace it a big problem so the power dissipation when it became so high the temperature became so high you couldn't have vacuum tube electronics go any further so then came the bipolar transistor and it immediately brought down the temperature because it's works at lower voltage you can put them more together close that together take away the power power came down but then of course what happened is you know you cram more and more and more and by 1980s the supercomputers had to put in water in order to take away the heat you could see literally see and this I have seen in grade two these were the computer super computed that bubbles are essentially coming out it's so hot and of course therefore the days of bipolar transistor was gone and then you had to do it MOSFET and I don't have to tell you that MOSFET is also getting hotter laptops they sell in Walmart special special holders so that it can take your heat out so laptop is also getting too hot and think about all the data centers that Google and other people have huge power dissipation and this cannot continue and so the question is that what is next so what this course does actually is try to understand this history of hundred years the essence of this hundred years in essentially 14 weeks and then try to set you up to see for the next generation and that's what you are for here for it you want to do research you want to work on different topics and there are many new things people are talking about spintronics biosensing displays wall mounted displays that's like a paper thin sheet of paper all sorts of things but if you understand how the previous generation wall what their problems were then you are ready to take the next step so that's what six oh six is a physics of the last three generations okay now let's start by thinking about the current flow in semiconductors I have a green region here which is the semiconducting region or some conductor it could be metallic also two contacts and I have applied a voltage and you know what will happen their current will flow now current flows let's say the electrons shown here in red flows in one direction and corresponding current goes in the other direction why because electron has negative charge so whichever direction it goes the current goes the other way now of course this depends on how much current will will go depends on the resistivity of the material now different materials have different resistivity so that of course depend on the chemical composition crystal structure temperature and doping all sorts of things and we will discuss that in a little bit now one thing is we could make a huge humongous table measure the resistivity of every material and that is in fact up till 1900s that's what people used to do Ohm's law they used to make a resistance table of a huge amount of material just go in the lab make measurements and then you are done but the thing is that that only works for known material if you wanted to try out something is slightly different then of course it's better to have a theory for it that why resistance changes as a function of composition or materials in a particular way so that would be better rather than making a big table then we won't have to carry a big table with us now as you know that the current through Ohm's law current is proportional to the voltage but the other way you could express current you could say the current involves a certain amount of charge Q n is the carrier density how the number carriers you have multiplied by the velocity the rate at which they are moving from one point another and a is the cross-sectional area now what we will do in this course in first five weeks is that first for essentially two or three weeks we'll talk about the physics of carrier density how do i compute as a function of materials and material structure how do i calculate the number of electrons i have available for conduction and that will involve quantum mechanics and equilibrium statistical mechanics and that's chapter one through four that's the one through four of the first book we are talking about first book has probably six chapters and the next two chapters the remaining two chapters will talk about how when you apply an electric field or if you have density gradient high density here low density on the other side what rate or how fast do the electrons move that will be the next two chapters which is chapter five and six and that's the transport theory we'll think about scattering as the electrons go along how this scattered with the lattice how this scattered with other impurities around that we will talk about in and our ultimate goal will be a drift diffusion theory which I'll explain and that will the whole thing we'll use to understand diodes bipolar transistor MOSFET so that's it right first four chapters calculating carrier density n and last two chapters calculating velocity you're done now the main thing is that you know quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics seems like a very complicated thing but what will be amazing that you will see just two concepts one is this effective mass and another is something called a Pharma factor these two will be sufficient after reading all this that is the two things will carry over and similarly for transport all will carry over is a notion of a mobility and a diffusion coefficient so we'll do all this but at the end carry over only a very few things for our next stage and we'll explain why such a few things describe such a complicated problem so well okay so let's talk about the three things that determine the carrier density one is this atomic composition arrangement of the atoms and for periodic arrays like crystals the concepts of unit cells and how they are classified so different types of material system so of course we understand that carrier density could be different depending on number of electrons you have in a material like silicon have a certain number of electrons and then let us say copper has a different number of electrons so the electrons could be different depending on the number of meeting the material original material you have and so let's start there so this is a truncated periodic table for electrical engineers for us our periodic table used to be historically just silicon nothing else but it's a little bit expanded version of the periodic table and you can see the materials of interest what are the materials of interest like from blue for you see in the in the middle from the group for materials like silicon is of course very important and carbon carbon in the form of graphene you may have hard silicon carbon nanotube this type of materials are of great interest for an electronics industry right so the group for and the first transistor was made of germanium and at the end of the lecture end of the semester make sure you know why it was germanium not silicon and we should be able to answer that question then there are also combinations of group for materials that are as huge in insignificant use for example all your microprocessors that I see in your microprocessors in Pentium these days have silicon germanium and you can find them 14 and 32 in the middle column both of them and also for high-temperature electronics you know many times for space shuttles and other things silicon carbide is a material of great interest now there are also materials this you might know from 3 & 5 from column 3 and column 5 like indium phosphide gallium arsenide and so on so forth every time you talk in your in your phone then the optical fiber carry the signal and the laser that sends the light through that optical fiber are made of indium phosphide it used to be red red red laser is gallium arsenide-based but the indium phosphide all telecommunication lasers or indium phosphide based you can also have a more exotic combination like indium gallium arsenic phosphide and again from 3 and 5 from group 3 and grow far and this of course have each one of them have different properties we'll get to that a little later now from 2/6 you have cadmium telluride from 2 & 6 you have cadmium telluride do you see cadmium that's 48 on the left side and 52 on the rightmost column you can see and the lead sulfide well this was the first when the transmission transatlantic transmission of radio signals the first dyers they used to have these are all based on layers sulfide this is a yellow paste that used to have this rectifying properties so the first transistors are all based on their sulfide so very soft material now of course all combinations are not possible if you like to put anything in any combination it is not possible because of lattice mismatch that all materials do not have the same spacing among the lattice so you cannot just put them anything with anything else and you have to think about people spend their lifetime in terms of developing this material you know that's what material science department is for now that's material but more important or equally important to material is the arrangement of atoms and the arrangement of the atoms are in solid crystals the atoms are in specific positions and with specific orientation now it is possible to have specific positions but random orientation that's like in plastic crystal doesn't conduct as well any will be seeing any significantly lower compared to solid crystals then there are these liquid crystals as I mentioned the displays where you have the orientational order but no positional order you see this these are in random places and for liquid you have neither positional order nor orientational order and this fourth one will doesn't carry too much current so available number of electrons you will see is very few on the other hand for solid solid crystals this significantly more so is very important both orientational and positional order now in addition in addition of this type of division there are this type of divisions here this is a cross section of a MOSFET and we will talk about MOSFET much later but I just wanted to illustrate a point look at the bottom side on the silicon substrate these are individual atoms of silicon look at them just everybody in their place this is how perfect modern processing is you have billions of these transistors and almost this perfect throughout your entire I see now that's crystalline we use a lot and I will explain why the poly silicon gate and the poly silicon is poly crystalline silicon while you have crystalline or domains of different order that's one type of material that we should be talking about the other material which is like a liquid in terms of random orientation is this amorphous oxide and without this the modern electronics would be impossible and third one is of course the crystalline semiconductor order nice arrays now how do we think about let's start with crystalline semiconductors you know well ordered and try to define them but what I want to point out we do it because it is easy but at the end it is not the whole story of course but many of the conclusion will be reaching based on understanding the crystalline semiconductor they will apply to amorphous silicon they will apply to polish crystalline silicon and I will explain why but the point is we are sort of solving this because it is easy to solve not because this is the main story you see so let us talk about crystalline semiconductor and classification of of crystals so this is a periodic array of points it could be ions it could be atomic ions for example or for this matter here for this case just assume that these are geometrical points a series of array of geometrical point shown here in 2d it could also be in three dimension in periodic adding now how will you build it up it's the infinite array so one way to bring it up is to have a unit motif of of a rectangle shown here in yellow and you can see 1/4 of the corners is included of each point is included in the yellow and this you can see that you can repeat and build up the whole crystal possible right you can just repeat them but you can also see that this is not unique you could start something like this which has the same volume or the same area do you see that because say trapezoid height multiplied by the base and it's the same as before so this is an equivalent description and you could also use this one to build up the whole crystal that's possible you could even do this you could take one in the center put a rectangle around repeat this then you can build up the whole system right so this motif if you study the property of any one of them we will see that is sufficient to understand the property of the whole crystal that's why I will be talking so much about the crystalline order or unit cells that's the amazing thing think about a semiconductor that may have let's say 10 to the power 23 atoms impossible to solve a quantum mechanical problem with 10 to the power 23 atoms right we shouldn't even try no computer in the whole world can solve that many atoms problems with that many atoms but what is amazing is that if we can just solve one and pack it up in the right way we will see we can have the solution for the whole thing and that's the power of the unit cell and that's why we'll be spending a few moments on thinking about the unit cell you see now of course unit cell need not be primitive meaning the smallest volume it could be something big and you could also repeat that the blue square and if you had used that same motif you could figure out the rest of the things so I think I have just discussed that the unit cells are not unique you know you can have various variation of it it's primitive and non primitive primitive means the smallest one but even for the primitive one you can see the yellow one the trapezoidal one or one that has the atom in the center all three are primitive cells but they are of different types so even the primitive cells need not be unique and the property of one as I mentioned defines the property of the whole and that's why we want to understand them with some width in some detail now one very good way so because it can be done the primitive cells can be done in various ways one prescription that you can follow over and over again is something called a Wigner Seitz cell so this is a way of defining the primitive cell one of them but you know you are fine if you define one that's the that's fine and this is how it works they choose a reference atom so these are set of atoms shown here in blue circles choose the reference atom that's the red one in the center then the second step is connect to all these neighbors so by straight line so you see here the blue the red has been connected to the blue and do that for all of them everybody however want you want in the neighbor first neighbor second neighbor whatever you want connect them all with straight lines but of course you have to take care of all the nearest neighbors then in the next step you see you should draw lines which is a perpendicular bisector of the connected lines so here the rate and a blue on the left side you see I have drawn a vertical line which is the perpendicular bisector for right and then you should do it for all the connected lines all of them now you can see the atoms that are farther away their intersected points the bisector happens at a point which is farther down and primitive cell well primitive cell is the smallest volume enclosed in this area so you see the one that happens in the farther out which is the sort of the right top blue blue point the perpendicular bisector is farther out so when you take second or third or fourth nearest neighbor connecting them doesn't really affect you're a primitive cell so you can take them but it doesn't really matter but this would be the primitive cell so you can really do you realize that in the previous slide when you had the atom in their centre and the square around it that was the witness I promoted cell now there are the there are now now we know about unit cells the basic definition let's say how we can construct different different lattices so one particular structure I have shown here it has a lattice constant of a and B a lattice separation in the vertical direction a and the other is B and we'll see how many different ways we can arrange this a and B in order to make crystals and the angle in between so that is the definition of a breve lattice so for example the first definition let me step back the first definition is the rough River lattice is that if you stand in on any of the atoms in the lattice your environment around it should look exactly the same so for example if you take if you sit on the one that has the crosses in it all the neighbors around it should look exactly the same and I will give you examples in a little bit later so that's one definition of breve lattice the other definition is that you should be able to go from any other right any point to any other point by this multiplying this unit vectors which is a and B you know the sides the two sides multiplying it with factors H and K which are integers so for example the one vector that I show what is the value of H I have one two three four so H is 4 and K is 2 because it goes vertically yeah you cannot have four point three two or you cannot have K equals like two point five you cannot have that it has to be integer values and by providing the integer values you should be able to go to any points in the lattice now what about this is it a bravura lattice according to this definition well it is not for the for this very simple reason is because you see if you sit on the yellow yellow atoms then if you take to the right you have the green atoms very close by but on the left but for the green atoms you see there is nothing not a yellow atom on the right that is looks exactly the same there's a yellow atom on the left of course that's exactly the same so this is not a bra violet is because umbrella lattice remember what is the definition every position that you won't be you that the environment should look exactly the same it doesn't look so but you can convert it to breve lattice by combining the yellow and green into one point and then you can see if you sit on the blue points then they entire environment is the same but within each blue point there is this blue and there's green and yellow sub atomic structure that is the basis so then you multiply the lattice with the basis you get actual actual lattice structure so in 1d one dimension you can see from the top you have atoms periodic series of atoms that's the weakness side cell right and how many you have in 1d you have this one type because you have a line you just cut it in the middle you will just have one one yet many systems are actually one-dimensional and these are of course in recent days problems of great interest many chemical molecules polymers are actually one dimensional chain and in that case like the DNA DNA would be an one dimensional chain in some effective way and you can assign a basis and you can then expand it out so my main point I want to make that in 1d there is only one type of breve lattice right what about 2d will be more right because 2d has two sides a and B and the angle in between so there'll be more and it turns out there are exactly five includi there are exactly five and these are the five if the two sides are the same and the angle between is ninety degrees then that's one type and two sides the same angle not equal to ninety degree you have a second type two sides unequal angle 90 degrees two sides unequal and you'll not equal to ninety degree and the general form and you can see the square in the blue what is that that's the Wigner Seitz cell for 2d and you should convince yourself that this indeed is the Wigner Seitz cell you say we take the neighbors bisect the connecting lines and that would be my weakness I sell but main point is five stripes no more than five types and these would be basis of many many work now this is an example this is again not a bra violet it's very important material this is silicon al graphene a material of great research and a lot of interesting work these days maybe some of you already work on this topic this is again not a brave a lattice because if you sit on the yellow then the blue is on the right but if you sit on the blue there is no way corresponding L on the right there's a yellow on the left so this is not a prevail at is because not equivalent all points are not equivalent but you could make it Ikuo well by doing this by combining a and B into basis replacing them with one point and if you combine all the yellow and the blue in one point you can see that this will become a rhombus like structure if you connect them and that will again become one of the five breve lattices right so that's something you should convince yourself that this indeed is the case now many of these things that you see in classical tiling these are all can be easily converted into breviary lattices you can see for the Kepler tiling if you put the green one and then bisect all the neighbors with squares then you can have a square region which would be a unit cell of approve a lattice and that you could repeat so obviously this would be a bravura lattice with a basis based on that whatever is inside the green region but there are many modern materials I mean many people make the mistake in assuming that all modern materials must be described by these five types it's not really it's only when you have one type of motive periodically repeated then of course there are five types but if somebody allows you to types or three then there are many more materials that can happen so for example these are called Penrose Rice's and you can see that the green one is a little rhombus and the blue ones are a slightly different rhombus almost like a square by putting this together you can cover the whole surface it's not periodic but essentially it's almost periodic and because now you have two types of unit cells if you allow two on the right hand side if you allow three or four then you can have many more many more times and so the point I wanted to make yes not if you see a lattice which is not a bravura lattice you shouldn't automatically think that if I just combined some atoms in some random I'll always get back to Breville Attis breve lattice is very important it just drives a huge number of materials but that's not the whole universe there are a lot of other materials also that do not follow in breve lattice and cannot be reduced to one you see and there are important materials in fact people didn't know its existence until 1986 and then all in a sudden a research through first publishes the result that of material of that type of structure nobody believes them in the beginning and then others start finding it so it's almost less than twenty or twenty twenty-five years old these many of the existence of many of this material what about 3d where life is getting more complicated 1 D 1 to D 5 well in 3d I have 14 so 14 let's start with the top row 14 you can understand because there are three lattice vectors right height width and the length and the angle pair of angles in between of course there'll be more so you can see starting from the top the triclinic has this alpha beta and gamma these are the three pairs of and three angles among a pair of lattice vectors none of them are equal to 90 degrees so that's the most general form then you can have cubic all three sides the same angles 90 degree no problem tetragonal and you can see that two sides are the same the base is the same height isn't the height is a little longer and then then onward you have now why this 7 this 7 is associated with the rotation angle or various symmetry operation you can see you can take a cube rotate it 90 degree it will exactly remain akyuu right rotate another 90 degree so you can exactly have a cube but you can see and you can do this vertically also if you rotate on the vertically then again you have a symmetry operation but you can see in a tetragonal one yes rotating is sidewise is fine along a vertical axis is fine but if you try to rotate it on the horizontal axis around horizontal axis when you rotate 90 degrees it's no longer the same right and so it look different so therefore these whole classification the seven people spend their life on in fact of how to define these things then there are seven but in addition if you go vertically along the line let's go on the cubic the second column you will see that there are possibilities where electrons are or the atoms are only in the corner that's a normal cubic then in the second one marked as I there's one atom in the middle of the body that's body centered cubic makes sense right one atom in the body and the third one is face centered cubic because there are six faces and you have one atom in all the six faces so that's the face centered cubic now if you think about it this is for kinda in the vertical column and seven in the horizontal column how many there should have been twenty eight right but you can see that there is fourteen and there are also lots of blank white spaces why why did that happen why are these blank spaces so for example let's focus on this tetra donal one the third element there is no face centered cubic on the tetrahedral one but there is a cubic face-centered that's that element is there why not because it turns out that the the second and the third element their body centered and face centered are exactly the same so you you're double counting and let me explain why in the next slide but in order to avoid that double counting we don't put it there anymore do you see that this is a tetragonal and this is a face centered tetragonal because on the six faces i have the six atoms and you can see that i have marked the two atoms a and c and see what the at two atoms do as I move this around so what I have done here that was one unit I just copied another one you can see it just copied another one to their extended to the left and also on the top and on bottom right that's exactly what I have done you can see where the C is C was in the face so the face is being shared by two neighbors and so this is being common on both the neighbors now and look at the a now you see do you see so the C now you see is still it was in the face but if I just look it slightly in the corner the same crystal instead of looking face on if I look at diagonal on then that becomes a body centered cubic and as a result then you can see that therefore this is not a new lattice because so old that is viewed in a different way so you shouldn't put it in one of the amazing things and that's where I'll end is that this counting was done before people knew about atoms simply based on the fact that you know all these crystals the jewelry people and others they had been studying this for a long time you know you want to give a king a nice diamond so that he gives you a lot of money back so people knew about crystal planes a lot and by 1840s people have already figured out all these answers fourteen tripod bravia lattices but actually they counted 15 the first person is not reveille the first person is Franken hang in 1842 he counted 15 just one more and a few years later breve is of course the very famous scientist he did lots of other things but and Brevik pointed out the two of the lattices that Frank and Frank in him said they are exactly the same and therefore revised name remains and Frankenheimer is forgotten you see just one state and 150 years later here we are talking about reveille Franken him gives our sympathy but doesn't get any prizes okay and let me conclude with this the Wigner Seitz cell for BCC and cubic lattices one thing I want to point out this 14 cells that you saw these were not necessarily primitive cells these were the cells that were easiest to deal with but if you want it to do primitive cell then you should do what what this how this has been done for example you have a center atom you can look at the right right one first the cubic one so in the green center atom and you can see the neighboring atoms have been connected and bisected by a plane now instead of a line it has been bisected by a plane that's the blue transparent the cube that has been generated that's the that's the bra violet that's the primitive cell for this structure in many cases for the cubic is exactly the same but for many other systems you will see specially for face centered cubic is not the same for example in the face centered cubic use I will show you that Bev a lattice have a volume of factor of 2 of compare factor of 4 of compare to a primitive cell you do it in your homework you'll figure it out ok so let me conclude so I try to explain to you that first five weeks we'll be talking about two basic concepts number of electrons and then then we'll be talking about the velocity of the electrons in order to calculate current we are talking about number of electrons and we've spent some time in talking about different types of materials available which is fine you know we expect gallium arsenide to be different from silicon we understand that but we are now also talking about the Neo DCT and structures and the periodicity and structures are very important because if there were no periodicity there is no hope no matter what computer of solving the quantum mechanical problem that will give us the number of electrons so we do it because of convenience but later on we will see even when things are not periodic many of the conclusion that we reach here will remain essentially the same that's why we spend so much time on the periodic structure ok that's the
