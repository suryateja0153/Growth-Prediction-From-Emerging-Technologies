 good morning my name is vlogger beloved some the director of Marathi then I have a pleasure of hosting another nano Exploration seminar this one is going to be delivered by volodymyr common from Professor strandos group in chemical engineering and the topic of it will be electronic cells of autonomous micro machines from 2d materials as in the previous nano explorations please hold your questions to the very end at that point you can send them to me or everyone else via chat or by raising your hand you can ask a question but without further ado I'm gonna ask for the mayor to take over all right Thank You professor borage for having me here and I'm excited to deliver this talk electronic cells this is a recent work that we were doing an astronomer a group and chemical engineering so just to start with a little bit of motivation let's have a look at the complexity of nature and here I will show three pretty simple examples of functions of cells that they are working on so on the Left we have a white blood cells in the midst of red blood cells and they are actually hunting bacteria I don't know whether the video you guys can see the video and then on the in the middle you have some red blood cells travelling into our best culture so some of them actually patching this wood while others are travelling and transporting oxygen through the bloodstream finally on the on the right you have some network of neurons that have their signal propagation through them and they are also doing some computation in their bodies so all of them represent very very fascinating functions and I must say they notice that they are autonomous so for engineer it's very very challenging to think how we can build something like tools that we have in our hand so the purpose of our talk could be actually to how we make how we can make these micro machines which we call electronic cells it will autonomous functions on board something similar that we see on on on these examples of what nature is delivering to us just to put things into perspective and in terms of the scale and to answer question why why well why should you care and where it's all fits with your research I just want to show you them then the scale so for example the human body you have a human digestive system which is in centimeters here we have blood vasculature and individual cells that are in micro skills but really to to make something functional there are two schools of thoughts a currently present in the literature so this can be roughly divided in two material systems and electronic systems so let's place let's have a look at that specific is a clam sauce so for example electronic samples systems are corresponding state-of-the-art small normal products so these are some major scale robots that you have thousands of them and researchers are exploring what will be the emerging behaviors in such kind of systems then you have micro robotics so here you you see an example of the mini drone capable of flying at the tip of the finger then you have ingestible sensors to explore and sense our digestive systems and finally we have some concepts of the smart dust so this is this is the electronics in the millimeter scale all of this on top of this part of the smart dust are really centimeter scale that's why these systems are actually here to the right on the left when we call a material approach you can we can see that there is molecular machines so this is just a bunch of items assembles in the form of the sports car and you can excite it with the STM tip and they will move through the atoms then you have something that researchers call nano robots so these are stimuli responsive materials usually for locomotion you have bio robots so this is an assembly of and you have something where this drug release particles core-shell particles and so on so these are usually a stimuli responsive materials targeted for the release cargo delivery and so on so these are not an exhaustive list but you cannot these things are usually either in nano scale micro scale and compare and contrast in these two you can immediately notice some differences and some some things in common and some specific things that hold true for these material systems electronic system so let's have a look on them so first of all for material systems there the fabrication is scalable in terms of all the volumes fabrication is also pretty simple very often in contrast electronic systems are characterized by precise processes and also they are very often related to the foundry lab or cleanroom fabrication the next step is I would argue that material systems are very often can be viewed as energy efficient as compared to the electronic systems and in contrast material systems are not modular versus electronic sisters are modular and finally materials have very often limited functions while electronic systems can be reconfigured on though if you think about the hundreds of transistors and their computational power just just to give you an example to really highlight these the lightest three comparisons let's have a look at study of temperatures although microparticles so these some microscale horrible gel and they change their size with temperatures so they they as you hit them they shrink and them has to be cooling down they expect so if you just draw a circuit director and circuit diagram for these particles it will look there in the following way it turns out that the particle is pretty complex it has the built in the temperature sensor and the comparator circuit and if the temperature exceeds this threshold temperature right if particle starts to harvest energy from the ambient energy path and actuate the actuator either to shrink or to expand so if if if an engineer would actually ask to build this kind of system right at this micro scale it would be rather complex because you need to you need to integrate all of these components on the other hand for material sciences it's pretty simple to do to make this country however in contrast this hydrogen is not modular in a sense if I ask material scientists to change now temperature sensor to pH sensor he will say oh I need to redesign this company this material completely because we need to take the material completely different material so in that sense these systems material systems unknown modular as compared to the electronic systems however they are more energy efficient because everything is tightly integrated together so in a sense electronic systems if we want to scale down below the new meter scale and actually push the boundary into the smaller range of the cells of the biological cells they would lack autonomy so here I'm showing the example of the Chi right electronic components can be even at the nanoscale however you see that to actually drive these components you have to have an X our delivery because these things are simply energy inefficient so this kind of chip would actually lack autonomy to operate on their own and so hence it cannot rival their biological counterparts in contrast micro particles and nano particles they they can be integrated and they can be functioning at these complex machines however they they will have very limited processing capabilities as we want to scale them down if you think and compare them to for example hundreds of transistors right in terms of their processing capabilities so here we have these two different boundaries and and they actually complement each other and that's why electronics cells we envision to operate in this space in between in terms of exercise but also in terms of their function so we innovation electronic cells to combine best of these two rolls of material and electronic advances and the idea is to have their autonomous micro machines that complete a specific task and so the idea to have autonomous is crucial is because well to make sure that the diamond shape with bunch of electronics but not enough power will not come to this pursuit and also to achieve a specific task because we want to determine a task and then setting the task will actually give you a figure of Merit to whether you're how successful you are in achieving this task so how do we actually do these electronic cells so our vision is to combine the polymer core so there is a click or shallow mount microscale particle with the 2d electronics that can be fashioned into the electronic skins circuits on top of these particles so in this sense we can combine both their non electronics plus some efficiency and some additional functions from our preliminary core and so we are excited about the two key materials because you have a whole arsenal of 2d materials starting from the conductor's to semiconductors and insulators and they are also great because you can have tunable electronic properties you can stack them together and they are also mechanically flexible it is very very important as you will see later on and just to give you get us motivated further we ask the question why we would need these kind of machines electronic cells and it turns out that accessing the in closed environments is proving to be very very difficult to achieve with that with them solutions that are available on the market nowadays so these kind of micro scale machines would be really an ideal fit for these things and once you are in the enclosed environment right once you have very small particles what do you want to do there well we already have a lot of like I mentioned briefly about the drug release particles right they are capable of performing very simple functions of let's say delivering drug but what we want to achieve is something that is currently very difficult to achieve them and this is to have this sensing and recording capability we realize that recording capabilities is very difficult to achieve with with material science approach versus it's very easy to achieve with with the electronic approach right we all have our cell phones or computers that have tons of memory nowadays so to put this into perspective all the actual application well first of all it's a biomedical humanity have a long-standing dream of having these micro and nano robots operating in our bodies to perform sensing and micro and nano surgeries so this would be an exciting direction to go but also much more accessible places we identify is for example monitoring they extended pipelines so if you have a if you want to determine whether your pipe is leaking and you have the pipeline running for a thousand more thousands of miles or if somebody is smuggling oil or smuggling and guess who the pipeline usually it's done through the manual inspection on eBay or in base case scenario through drone inspection so it's very labor intensive and very costly so imagine if you would have these particles that are so small where they are console' sheet that you can just inject them at one hand and retrieve it at the other end and they would have recorded all the information that is happening inside your pipeline and you can do it continuously right running them through the pipeline because they are so cheap and finally if you have more extended pipelines in terms of the bio and pharma and chemical plants where you have complex flow pattern occurring and you don't have any kind of way to check what is the pattern occurring there without disturbing this pattern so current solutions here are injecting in place in the inside the bulky mechanical probes and electrical probes that necessarily disturbed assistance equilibrium imbalance imagine if you will have a ability to actually inject small cells inside sense and record the environment inside this enclosed environments so with this how do we actually make electronic cells and instrument loop we recently developed two different ways so one is a top-down approach based on their cleanroom approaches and the other one is a bottom-up get relies on the self-assembly and the material approach today I will be talking about their the first top-down approach that I've recently developed so it all starts in the cleanroom and it all starts with the polymer particles so in this case we are using a serrated base so we can using the photolithography we can fashion it in different size shapes and sizes and once it's cross-linked is mechanically and chemically stable so you can then transfer your electronics on top so here we are using 2d materials anyways - in WEC - so for our electronics and some contact metallic layers so all this is deposited by transfer and then defined by photolithography and then we do some more additional steps of photolithography to head additional components and the later on we just edged out our wafer and we can release this particle into the environment and we have this first solution so this is just a talk you rather complex particle but I will walk you through this this is just a short video of how you have these particles on the wafer and then they are being released into the environment unfortunately yet you zoom I don't see the animation or plane on my screen so apologies for this but basically the particle has three components one is the photodiode so this is the hetero Junction of hemorrhoids - nwc - pn 2d materials then we have a camera resistor so this is a material of emulous - and then we have a memory stir so this is a hem of two flakes sandwich together and we chose these components not arbitrarily but they actually form what we call a state machine so this is the same very simple a state machine when you have a memory state which is an off state but if you have a presence of panel light and you have a presence of light the memory world health will switch to their own state so this particle has the ability to remember events with certain logic capabilities so there is a logical and here when you have both of these stimuli the particle will go remember this so in a sense we are sensing and recording so how does it work so first of all when you reassigning light on our photo diet its generate certain photo card right so as you can see here from them this current to voltage diagram as this photo current goes and powers that our kami resistor and account our camera sister reacts with our suit we will be talking how why we are interested in detection the suit but basically changes the conductivity of our kami resistor and this allows to have the memristor actually increased the voltage drop across the memories and so the memories there is the electrical element that has the following characteristics it has two conductivity states and as you increase their voltage over the threshold voltage here which is around 0.15 0.2 volts your memories that will change its conductivity States and that's how we can actually differentiate whether our body 2 was written or not written we start from the off state here and then we end up at the on state here if it's written so putting always together we are introducing what we call personalizable electronics so we are interesting in this person these particles in the enclosed environments and understanding how they behave in this and closed environments and for this we developed this this kind of enclosed pipeline wherein we are introducing our electronic cells and then we are spraying them using this nebulizer across this chamber and we are basically capturing them on the other side of the chamber on this target in the typical experiment we usually have hundreds of them showing as a tropical pattern on them so showing that we observe a neutral buoyancy of these electronic cells so I would like just to draw your attention that that this this this this environment is pretty hard right because these particles are undergoing this terrible under torsion during propulsion interesting weather actually electronics onboard electronics survives this and so we tested these electronic cells in three conditions on the substrate as fabricated after liftoff in the solution and after spray and this is just a performance for there can be resistor where you see the initial vs final conductance and you can see that we are forming in the same line it means that actually 2d materials survive this harsh process of our civilization so this is great but now let's come back to our state machine operations right and whether area can actually achieve these operations in this in this platform so to check this week while we were playing our electronic cells we are also spread soot and so allowed the cells to react with with the suit environment and so this is very important in because it's very is it's very important in terms of the climate change right and in terms of the carbon emission however soot Kennedy detection of is very very challenging as it can travel thousands and thousands of months and so the cost of deployment of sensing Network is very very large to actually TechSoup so if you would have something very small and something very cheap that can actually detect soon this would be very much so coming back to our performance here's here's the results so we start with ourselves on this a memory store conducting state which is a non written so it starts over here and once we have the reaction in this suit cover can be resistor changes its conductance and we go to this quadrant and then government restore actually retains this information on board which corresponds to this quadrant so you can see actually that our machines respond to spec and they are able not only to sense the environment but also to record and later we can read out what is there recording in in in very other application but they are still very interesting is is there years actually to disperse these electronic cells over extended surfaces and then to later on this check whether they respond to suit and so what we did here we have this extended surface where we locally sprayed some Perkins patterns of soot and this is again the result of the comparison pin between the the initial state of our electronic cells and then the exposed state of our economic cells so our chemical resistant conductance is just our check just to make sure that it the the sensor reacts and works but what we are finally reading out is only the memory store conductance so you can see how this state goes from here to here and to show you the special correspondents you can see that these clusters of electronic cells that actually reacted they are clustered around the places where we actually sprayed our suit so this is a great result demonstrating with me I can actually record this information on board and use the sensing and also recording to retrieve the information but later on once you spray these particles into extended pipeline extended system or over your surface you actually are interested in recovery so sorry I have okay you have one question on chat that we will get to this later so to actually get the recovery we developed this optoelectronics system good we're aware we have a laser that is raster scanning through our surface and we equipped our electronic sensors with this checkered devices where you have this polymer shape in this checker form and coated with the reflective silver away and this follows the retro rule affects a principle and is able to reflect incident light at the same angle as the incoming life and it falls this retroreflector that you have been in your bikes so if we measure the reflecting at non incident angles you can see that these particles are really reflecting at various angles of inclination and this is in comparison to this diffuser flag that limit so if if you would have just a particle that doesn't have this reflectance had known in swing angles you would be somewhere here but we have pretty high with lithographic feelings so this allows us to find these particles even add non planar surfaces so for example in this video I am applying the particles on the layer of leaf and then I'm just showing that raster scanning with my laser and as a result we are getting this kind of image where these brides for us correspond to the electronics hours so once you detect them you can do later on fizzling out and three so in this in this first approach what we are doing is the readout is is actually physical versus dead once we identify the cells you know we we actually go with our probes and read out what is the state of our memory but we are also working on the approaches where we can the particle can later on sending from the HT to us and so as a result we are emerging these materials and electronic approaches and using the advances of both worlds today I just showed you how we develop this autonomous micro machine it has some autonomous functions on board and I would like to thank all of all of the group thank you for your attention thank you especially for our subgroup that is working on this Albert King gray gene fan gate Sanyang Allen we are part of your effort MIT that are working on this electronic cells but I just want to notice we have an amazing team I also would like to thank to our collaborators but also you if you are working I would like just to tap into MIT telling which we are having here on board if you are working on the material systems but also on electronic circuitry we would be very interested in connecting with you and thinking how we can actually bring these things together into the next generation of electronic cells and to make more and more complex circuits thank you thank you very much well below the meter that was a really exciting talk if you have questions based on what you've just seen yes of course there's one more thing we should all do if you have a reaction of course you should provide it but if you have questions about the talk please go ahead and send them I will just start with a simple question so the Khemu sensitive element of course is able to detect shirts now suit itself you're generating in a specific way and I'm just wondering what is that how are you making certain and secondly what is the human sensitivity how selective is it for your particular chemical versus other chemicals you might encounter yeah so so in this case we are we were interested in just proof of demonstration so we used actually graded suit and then we we also just make it this major dispersion out of it so to make a very small dispersion out of that we had to stabilize it with certain segments and then we spread them around into the environment and just to answer your second question yeah this particular sensory is not very very selective it just based on the change in the conductivity and we were very interested in them demonstrating proof of concept yeah and so we are very much interesting much more selective sensors and I would say the strengths of this approach is release that you can have reversible sense right you can have a reversible sensor that can then store can be stored into the memory versus if you would just have irreversible well you can of course have irreversible sensor the particle that has irreversible sensor but if you have a reversible sensor and then we are working out on the array of the memory elements right the dream is to have one reversible sensor that can create multiple times and record multiple things so yeah selectivity of the sensor we are working towards this but I also like just scaling the system towards this is and then it will be much clearer that the strengths of this why want to have a memory element because now now it's it's it's really much important I yeah okay again if you have a question please feel free to submit it via chat or you can raise your hand and hopefully I'll notice and call upon you let me then ask another question regarding the memristor itself it's not a usual electronic element you know I certainly people have talked about memory stirs you kind of casually mention it in your talk can you tell us more about the memories through itself how do you make it yeah so yeah so this is on the field I think the resource I would say there are slowly coming in and thanks for putting this thought because I think it's very exciting technology that is coming out on board so in this particular work here and memory store is made out of ten mohs two flakes and if you just take in most of flakes and then treated treat them with oxygen what you will have you will have a self limiting a nanometer scale oxygen layer that excuse me forms acts as a dielectric layer in this case and when you sandwich this in between the two metals of different different work functions so basically this this dielectric layer is basically can later on has certain vacancies that can capture capture your electrons and changes conductivity so what once once the threshold voltage is exit exceeds exceeds in this device right this all the vacancies are populated and then your device turns on into the low conductivity stage so it's it's very very nice system we all really really like it let me ask you one question from the chat regarding the what how would you actually communicate with the electronic cell of remotely you have shown us that you can remotely read them out using a laser but are there additional elements you can imagine doing sending signals informing it and then waiting for its response back yeah definitely so we have a couple of ideas there right so for it for example even this retro reflector that I talked about this is in a sense having a light beam and light out but you can what you can have something that will modulate their activity with their device and this is this is we think it's a cheap way of doing it we definitely looked and you can continuously into their LEDs and in the LEDs I will say is great however right now we see that the energy balance is not working out because to get the light came is one efficiency but to get the light out is much more more expensive so we would really appreciate the help of engineers there if there are LEDs that have very very low efficiency hello excuse me low low power this would be very great to calculate to the device but I would say this is this is very important and ongoing subject another question from the chat is the memory stirs State reversible or does it have to be replaced once turned on yeah so it's reversible so you can by reversing the voltage later on you can just erase it and reuse the particles but once by basically for recording I also have this question very often is the recording is pretty stable so basically once you turn on their memory sir the retention time is pretty pretty everyone we like we tested for a couple of hours and certainly can go on so it's very very neat Volodymyr I well I guess just one more question came in let's see I did not see a moving element in a colloidal state machine could you elaborate on how the retroreflector is realized yes questions well I it appears yes yes actually I do you want are you gonna just ask the question directly because I yes please go ahead I think you think you only think it for this inspiring presentation so actually I'm wondering in the previous when you mentioned the photodiode camera system memory system I didn't really see a moving element that could possibly be this mirror that is doing detection this is a different like in the generation of the system or am I missing something yes so basically yes I haven't shown it like integrated but basically retroreflectors can be basically integrated on the same PI base on this side of this system so you can imagine these three elements on this side you will have retroreflectors or it can be on on the other side of the particle as well and the idea how it's being realized is basically we make this her devices using the sq8 polymer using the photolithography you can have these side walls and some 10 micrometer height 10 micrometer wide and later on you just coat it using the reflect same letter a reflective layer of silver yeah but a good point I haven't showed it like integrated it all together I see it thank you it's really awesome yeah thank you well indeed what Bloody Mary this was a truly awesome talk thank you so much for indeed giving it to us I at this point will conclude this nano explorations talk and I will invite you to join us next week Tuesday and Thursday eleven o'clock there'll be more great science and technology presented to you alright thank you very much for being here today thank you
