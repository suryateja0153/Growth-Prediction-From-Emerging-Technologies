 to introduce tonight's speaker before I do that I just want to acknowledge one really significant detail of of the arrangement here tonight in since 2003 we've been able to bring to the college a barber McMurray professor and this is a result of generous endowment provided by the local firm barber McMurray architects so blanche barber and current personnel at barber McMurray have combined to endow a 1 million dollar gift to the College of Architecture and Design which has allowed us to bring a significant internationally recognized architect to teach here in the college essentially every other year so in 2013 the very first Barber McMurray professor was Larry Scarpa of Scarpa Brooks and Brooks Scarpa in Los Angeles and then in 2013 we had Wendell Burnett the Phoenix architect here and so just to say to the folks from Barber MacMurray who were here thank you very much formally and publicly for this amazing support it's part of what helps differentiate what we do here at the University of Tennessee and brings great value to the student experience so thank you so the 2018 Barber McMurray Barber McMurray professor is Billy Faircloth partner and director of research at Karen Timberlake the practice based in Philadelphia so founded in 1984 Karen Timberlake has approximately 120 professionals diverse backgrounds and abilities in a practice that's been recognized worldwide Karen Timberlake has been awarded hundreds of dot design citations in its history including the firm award from the AIA in 2008 and the cooper-hewitt National Design Award for Architecture from the Smithsonian Institute in 2010 looking at their website it includes this incredible soundbite that I wanted to share with you guys it reads like this the alchemy of art science analysis and intuition with regard to the built environment is our core mission I think that's a pretty cool mission statement so some of the provocations that the firm has pursued over the years include Rhian visioning the traditional building envelope developing new techniques for off-site fabricated architecture and building new tools for sustainable design in the spirit of making change through meaningful collaboration the firm also participates in lectures conferences symposia and extend exhibitions around the world that augment their commitment to professional practice and of course Billy being here is an extension of that Karen Timberlake has been successful in maintain a culture of continuous asking even as the firm has ascended and grown which from my point of view is no small feat because I think that's exactly the pressure that's on firms as they grow and ascend nationally and internationally they tend to they tend to lose the kind of core spirit that they have starting out unless of course everyone commits to that so I think that's a strong aspect of their firm that that shows in the work so likewise the firm's commitment to research has provided a way for deep investigation to be conducted during the design process and for the results of their work to stimulate and augment the process of designing and building Sploritory empirical and applied research bringing added value to commissioned architectural project projects and allows the practice to develop new custom products and tools for the architectural industry so in her capacity at Karen Timberlake Billie leads a transdisciplinary group of professionals leveraging research design and problem solving processes from fields as diverse as Environmental Management chemical physics material science and architecture she fosters collaboration between disciplines trades academies and industries in order to define a relevant problem solving boundary for the built environment her work centers around three main themes that I think we'll see tonight justification and research methods for transdisciplinary and transscalar design practice the design of novel methods tools and workflows that reveal new information about materials climate and thermodynamic phenomena and how the history of plastics and architecture demonstrates architectures changing posture towards transdisciplinary practices and new knowledge interest in these topics was formed during her time at the University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture where she taught between 2002 and 2008 but in 2008 she took an abrupt turn and as she was offered the research directorship at Karen Timberlake so I think I'm advancing your slides I could probably do the lecture I know this so well so since joining the firm Billie has worked to prove that architecture should be should produce knowledge rather than merely consume it and I think this is a fascinating approach that she brings to this so her approaches resulted in peer commendation for a number of research for Karen Timberlake Research Group projects including pointillist a wireless sensor network and Tali a Revit based a Revit based a Revit compatible custom lifecycle assessment tool so and of course both of these projects received national recognition and international recognition she's taught in addition to her work there and since joining the firm she's taught courses and themed workshops on materials climate thermodynamics at various institutions at Penn that Harvard GSD at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at the simcard University in Israel the University of Minnesota Georgia Tech and now the University of Tennessee she's widely published on these topics including in the energy form in the Journal of architectural education in the plea conference proceedings and Princeton Architectural press so please join me in welcoming Billie Faircloth this thing on everyone can hear me in the back and get a thumbs up all right great first I want to thank the University of Tennessee for inviting me and inviting Karen Timberlake into the school then into the college this has been an amazing experience it's been incredible to work with all of the students in the studio Scott thank you it's been incredible to work with you it's been amazing I also want to thank you warned me this what happens I do when I want to make sure that we again thank Barber McMurray and think thank you for this endowment and for funding this possibility that firms can come in that we can create this course and that we can create create a meaningful relationship between what the resources of the Academy and the resources of practice this has been a really incredible and rich and enriching semester I hope for the students but also for for me personally and for our firm tonight I want to talk about our practice I'm actually going to touch on about 22 projects and that's because what I'm going to show you is the way that we use questioning searching and searching again as a mode that operates throughout design it's a mode that actually increases the agency or power of the architect and I want to use that word agency specifically and literally and I want to begin by just asking us to consider what that means so I'm going to turn on my teaching mode for a second get out of my lecture hat and just say you know what what is agency what's design agency have you heard the phrase have you discussed the phrase is there a robust discussion about agency here at the school what's agency political agency moral agency there's all different kinds of agency what's design agency does anyone want to take a pass students from six pack six scales please students from my studio please no that's right Pruett yeah yeah the power that we have to cause a change the design agency let's think about that for a second what is design agency we have this amazing power to use the process design to create change in the world and often what I found in my own career is that we're constantly questioning the extent of the power or the range of that power and what we found that our practice is that you know that power can extend quite a bit if you were to come through our office and spend some time with us you will see that every day we're asking how far we can extend the boundary around what we include and what we exclude when we design you might come to our office and see us out on the sidewalk doing things like this just on the day-by-day basis now we have projects we have clients they have schedules but on a day-by-day basis it's what you choose to do and how you choose to design and the things that you engage on a day-by-day basis that actually can matter and when you allow an entire group or an organization or in community to embrace questioning as part of the core infrastructure for the design process wonderful things happen you begin to ask some really primary questions so this group of people is mired in a debate about this thing and bang we affectionately refer to as the apparatus is holding a bunch of glass samples and the debate is which color is the glass which color is the glass when I turn it a certain angle and how does the color of the glass then relate to what my intention is is as a designer it turns out that everyone sees the color of the glass slightly differently right that's an interesting thing you might also find us on out front just out front on our sidewalk doing experiments like this especially you know in the summer we're doing a very very quick mock-up because we're trying to understand something about water flow water flow across a very specific surface and running a really quick rough experiment it's a low fight what I would call a low fidelity prototype just to begin to ascertain the slope of a surface and the speed at which water flows across the surface more recently just two weeks ago we were working on some masonry mock-ups in our shop we were working with members from the International masonry Institute masons who came in we were asking a really basic question I would almost call these sketches like bricks and mortar we were asking a basic question about the head joint on a curve and while we had an incredibly high fidelity Revit model and we were running scripts that would allow us to adjust these head joints we also wanted to in turn create a prototype and go through the entire process of working with those joints as well and so we were just simply using our shop as a space where we can build and work through these types of details I don't know would you call this research does that word unsettle you a bit does it confuse you if I say searching and searching again does that feel more comfortable to you the truth is I believe I deeply believe there's never been a more pressing moment than now to test the boundaries of our design agency and there's a reason for that when we design our power lies in the ability to inscribe a boundary around what we are going to include and what we're not going to include so if I have students in here from six facts six sales yeah do I have any students in the air a couple from the seminar course we're working on one of the things we're working on it's really trying to understand that boundary and one of the things that we work on at Karen Timberlake on a day-by-day basis again is trying to understand the boundary that we're drawing around what we include and what we exclude and how deeply we can understand design as multi-variant endeavor so when we go to work on a building like this which is the u.s. embassy in London the day-to-day working out of the U.S. embassy in London over a three and a half four year period required yes a lot of design as you can imagine it but also a lot of slowing down vetting questions extending our knowledge bowing into areas that may feel a little uncomfortable bringing people into the conversation that would allow us acts targeted questions and conduct targeted types of analysis through prototypes computation simulation measurement that would give us actual level information so that we could continue the process so that we could engage design so that we could in fact increase the goals for that building we search in search again because we believe that it searching and searching again increases our agency our power to cause a change and it also increases the value of architecture we also have a tendency to because of our design philosophy put are searching in searching again into these four buckets we recognize and actually I think this is one of the more citing things as as research processes the searching and searching again processes become more rigorous and robust in architectural practice as they begin to be paired with design what I see emerging is a profession in a practice where different design philosophies are allowing these buckets to to be named differently I think that's an amazing landscape for our profession to allow different research topics to emerge but if you're in temper like we have a tendency to focus on environment material systems of processes and quite often it's the interface between these things the interface between environment materials looking at phenomena in material simultaneously the interface between systems and materials or processes and materials and it is true as stated in the introduction we have worked towards a transdisciplinary practice we are transdisciplinary what we mean by that is we realized many years ago that in order to get at the kind of design practice that we knew as possible we had to extend the design process from the allied disciplines so yes we work with structural engineer civil engineers electrical engineers etc but we wanted to extend the design practices and processes to those disciplines that had knowledge seem to overlap with the way we understood how architecture worked in the environment but that we're nonetheless not represented in the design process and this includes people with knowledge and materials engineering our knowledge as environmental management or knowledge in computer science or chemical physics a 2008 we began to expand upon an already 20-year endeavor to integrate research and design we begin to expand and upon that endeavor and formalize it into a transdisciplinary group we are transdisciplinary we do projects projects period we do architecture we do software we work on concepts we establish research as a project well the teams it's not done at night it's not done under the cover of darkness that done on the weekends it is in fact part of our process again this mode that extends our agency and we identify questions that are expression of our design philosophy question market central infrastructure in our practice we mature techniques we capture and share our results this is how we're organized it's a brief sketch of our practice but it's true and it's accurate so many of you have already visited Karen Timberlake which is great some of you have seen this face in our office but this really is the platform upon which all of this questioning and our projects play out on a day-by-day basis we have an organization that allows people to move freely across the office we are organized in into teams but we also have an organization that allows those people who are part of the research group and the others about 13 research group members there's also communication groups that has about 8 members and then there's a whole other group of architectural design staff that's right around 60 or so people we have a total of about a 100 individuals but whether they really like about the shot of the pulse of our offices you can't tell who's having a conversation with whom you can't tell exactly what's happening that's because we have an integrated process when we do projects all of those folks are at the table all at once right everyone's there all at once and so our projects have a tendency yes again to look like buildings but also to look like software to look like scripts I think the more important thing is that our projects have a tendency to range scales to range concerns we focus on certain parts of building delivery methods we can focus on whole entire buildings as I mentioned the question mark is essential piece of infrastructure this slide actually captures a whole range of questions we've asked I keep track of the questions that we ask on a weekly basis they're categorized into a database people answer those questions through a rigorous process but what's really important about all of these questions is that everybody on this floor has the ability as a designer no matter which group they originate from to ask those questions again to extend their design agency into areas and subject matter for which they may not be an expert but they may have curiosity about or they may be interested in discovering more about the other thing that you could probably note if you just look really deeply at these like what's going on up there funny question not too specific I wouldn't advise answering it just as its stated we don't know where up there is but I'll show you which factors best characterize the site can we locate and measure a multitude of spatio-temporal urban micro climates the other thing other observation you can make us Wow you know all these questions do require a whole range of different methods to solve them which means that again in order to extend our agency we've had to develop those methods so we have matured a platform of methods and techniques ours is a multi method approach so we regularly engage tool development we regularly engage sensor deployment we like to measure stuff when it makes sense we also engage a spoke computation and simulation because we're asking these targeted questions and Wow you know computation is a really nimble tool that allows us to get at targeted questions we also engage prototyping methods can be incredibly powerful tooling up methods can be incredibly powerful when you know the answer the question that you're asking so as part of our firm our questioning is extended through the entirety of the process and often I get asked you know okay you can ask questions we can all be curious but just how rigorous is this it's one thing to ask questions and to bring technical information to answer a question that's another thing to realize that questioning is both a technical endeavor but let's face it more often than not we're interested in the social component of answering a question we're interested in capturing that knowledge and understanding that once we've captured that knowledge we need to share it so we've also developed ways of sharing the knowledge that we capture both internally and externally we have an entire process for doing that through something called a read report through something that's called a research query every individual in our office can capture the question that they're asking as I mentioned before write out a method write out a value statement for why they're asking it put to that that question think through design a method to answer that question we communicate the results weekly and we have them all situate all these results in a way like just results are a funny funny word it sounds like so quantitative but really these are write-ups about designers trying to engage something right they take on various forms but it's an important practice in our office just like drawing an idea writing up findings is absolutely a practice that people are are embracing in our firm we can find all of these findings in a database but we also have ways of communicating our work obviously through our books is important part of our our work is to build up discourse especially three books like you're fabricating architecture we also seek review we seek to expand the work that we do out into a community of archetype if that's important to share your work we see commendation for our work and increasingly we seek to extend the questions that we've asked into the creation of tools our sorry the questions that we've answered into the creation of tools that can be distributed into the profession so a really simple question that we began to answer in 2013 how do we calculate the embodied environmental impacts of our choices when I select this carpet when I select this wood base when I'm working on a design can I also bring this other layer of a decision-making into the design process to really understand what it means to pick that wood and pick this carpet from the point of view and the embodied environmental impact that means emissions to land air and sea can I understand that and once we begin to realize yes actually we can create an environment for designers to access that data as they're designing then create a design an integrated process we also begin to understand that we have a responsibility to take that process that we came up with this novel process and make it such that everyone on our profession can engage it increasingly many of the questions we ask you realize are ones that other designers want to answer as well and so we can distribute this our milestones and the reason why I put this slide in here is because I want to impress upon the students in the room that the that our practice what we have worked towards and what I also personally have worked towards in my in my career is designing a practice so our milestones are intentional we pursued a transdisciplinary practice we pursued a practice where research would be a process and it would be ISO certified which means that we can go back and we can write down what we say we're going to do we can look ahead and we can we can say that we can do what we say we're going to do we can look backwards to see if we did it right and it's just a plan do monitor learn process it was intentional to create a transdisciplinary group to hypothesize that that was necessary and needed in the profession and to go after the creation of that group it was very intentional for us more recently to formalize a collective intelligence based staffing model so that when you looked at a project team no longer would it look like here's the architectural project team but it would look like a diverse group of individuals with different types of knowledge that could really begin to represent these core strengths appearance whom really this is intentional and we were able to achieve these milestones because we intended to design a practice this way so if you're able to build up research as a mode and you have the capacity to use research to extend your agency then you have a way of working across the days months years using this mode I've had 10 years of working through this mode of seeing how it plays out and I now am in a position of reflecting upon how it has worked and what it has allowed us to do when we research it's when do you research Billie this is the question I get asked a lot what does it look like how does it play out you say it extends the agency of the designer but really on a day-by-day basis what does it look like so this is this lecture is my effort to explain to you a little bit of what it looks like ok that's really what we're gonna do here and that's why we're going to touch on 22 different things so one of the more powerful things that we've done in our office is to ensure again as I've given you a snapshot that we have infrastructure in office to allow anyone at any moment in time to say hey I've got a question I want to answer it I think this is a legitimate question can we come up with a method to answer this question that's the day by day pass of Karen Timberlake so I'm gonna frame that day by day past by showing you this question what are the possible patterns resulting from variations in woods figuration width thickness and length now that question might look familiar to some does that look familiar does have feel kind of familiar to anyone it represents a lot of what we do as designers we're trying to look at imbalance all these multiple variables we're working through parameter driven design questions we're actually trying to look at the relationship between these things right variation of woods figuration so that's grain we were looking at the width this question was asked in the context of forming a wall forming a wall out of concrete was asked in the context of Ford form concrete for a very very specific project you know it was documented like this that's a research query but it was really started because of this project Mosley pendleton quest it's an addition right there in the center on this side of the screen is a 1934 building designed by Charles Cotter its pendleton hall and over there on your left is Paul Rudolph's Judith Jewett heart center when we're linking the two and if you know Wells these campus in Massachusetts you know that it's characterized by its amazing vegetated landscape that connects no laughter no laughter no for a building quad after building quad together and this tiny addition was asked to do a lot it was asked to actually become a new threshold or a new front door to get into what is referred to as the arts quad but we were interested in answering this question because part of the team and you talked about alchemy Jason you pulled that quote out earlier part of the intuition that we were using and one of the reasons we were interested in the concrete is because we were interested in creating a bark like texture the concrete now the literal impression of the bark but a bark like texture on the concrete the impression of wood on the exterior and the true expression in performance of wood on the interior in this volume where we have musicians and vocalists who are practicing on a daily basis so we started like this we started the design iteration like this and round design development yet you know you can step back and look at these and say these are pretty clunky Billie what's going on right what's going on here is that what we're doing is we're developing our tacit knowledge we were working with concrete mix design we were simply setting up a series of samples that would allow us to understand those variables so each of these samples have boards that are a different depths related to each other the surface finish is slightly different some are sanded more some we're sanded less which allows the summer wood configuration to press through on the concrete a little bit more we have some board spacing going on thick and thin but these were our first samples which turned into some tests that were done initially done on-site over here on the left by the contractor who looked at our samples we had a discussion with the subcontractor and there was a an attempt to recreate those samples but once we saw them on the site we realized no this this really isn't it this isn't it so this is the finished one on the on this side this is what we were really what we were after and so what this turned into was realizing that we needed to do a study in randomness we needed to look at center boards thicker boards we really need to begin to understand how to leverage this pattern this is when we introduced a script after we had understood the variables that we were working with and what mattered to the expression of the concrete we were then able to better target a script that allowed us to begin to search for a series of random patterns and then we're able to export those surface patterns and also test them visualize them in order to look at and study this shade shadow conditions what was really great about this process is that once we begin to produce these we're almost like paint by number of drawings they became the means by which we could communicate with the contractor so then the contractor started really getting involved in helping us create new notations and to refine the script that we were working on and it resulted in a series of shop like drawings is that where the means of communication but all of this resulting from through these early explorations with these prototypes often on a day-by-day basis we are asking questions that require modeling simulation prototyping but a rigorous way of answering those questions how do changes in opening size and soften angle affect daylight quality and experience of glare asked on the same project you can see the practice space right there at the center we're simply working in a completely different way non digital recognizing that sometimes they're a phenomena that are better experiences studied with the eye here in this case we simply had a model that was mounted on a tripod it was a flexible model we could cut openings we could block openings we could put in a camera and strategically photograph the interior and began to search through size and scale and form of opening that would allow us to eliminate direct light but also create a type of glow on the interior of that space so you're probably getting I hope you're getting the picture right that as we go through design on a day-by-day basis in our office along the way we can mark the design process through a series of enquiries that are often extending the realm of our knowledge these types of assessments that were done for one project in office for a project called one eight one Mercer at NYU or New York University this is a trail of these types of research prairies on a day-by-day basis and all of these point to asking questions that asking types of questions where the answer is not so direct I can't look it up in a book I can't I can't see it for instance we were interested in really understanding the variation of temperature humidity across the site it required the distribution of sensors we were interested in the variability of wind speed and direction because we had five surrounding regional airports all with different wind speed conditions often the data for designing the building is coming from those airports and from Central Park but in this instance we knew that the site was very very different so these this type of nimbleness to ask a cross subject matters and to ask periodically is part of our design process on a daily basis which means we can inquire about as i just revealed actual site conditions versus the site conditions at a airport so this project in the pacific northwest we simply distributed very regularly distributed a series of sensors that allowed us to understand the microclimate on the site versus the data that we were getting from the airport in this instance we're able to inquire about the performance of a building envelope and understand the thermodynamic phenomena in this existing building propane tanks were put in by the client the building was heated up to cool it down and as it was as it was cooling down we were able by embedding some of our sensors about sixty sensors in the building envelope we were able to really begin to understand the performance of that exterior wall much of our inquiry deals with direct building elements and the interface between design process and designers who are in distance in trying to work on the screen element and fabrication processes okay sometimes our inquiry our daily and inquiry matches matches up like a couple of different things that we're interested in so in this instance we have a client who is working on a gallery and in that gallery there are some very specific requirements for how people Traverse and how people interact with certain elements and we were interested in analyzing how pedestrians would flow through that gallery but simultaneously interested in having a very broad conversation with the decision-makers on that project that represented the client about over a gallery size model right so that models of course go models very big and we wanted to represent these different options and the way people might interact with these different options by using something called projection mapping on that model quiet quite often our inquiry extends into just straightforward comparative analysis here we're looking at invited environmental impacts of these components at Brown University sometimes we're looking at phenomena like white and frit in the experience in this instance of this entire building element or building component Centrum's were working on just the frit alone and the the surface the surface texture of that frit asked a question about the potential random patterns of alphanumeric characters on the facade so the day by day questioning then is one that allows designers to interact interact with the does interact with this design process in a or this research process in a really meaningful way it does extend extend our agency especially when we have folks in our office who have various backgrounds and various methods I think what one thing to note is that again it's hard to figure out how this happened so we just put together this little video you can get a little bit of a sense of the last one from the point of view of some of the folks that worked on it so we have this east facing facade and we like to give it some character but we also would like to preserve the view so fritting is a great option because of the translucency that you get but we also wanted this pattern to breed at two different scales we'd like for it to read at a civic scale from all the way down to the street but we'd also like for it to read at a small scale for the users inside the building for reasons relating to the history of the building we looked at a pattern comprised of letters and to give the letters the civic scale reading we looked at different ways to create gradients in patches that are 33 wide and 16 feet tall and at the densest this gradients would shield from heat gain at the lightest it would mitigate for the strike potential in the area this project really explores what it means to be random we can quickly generate the script in terms of randomness but we worked with a variety of graphic designers architects building foreign specialists to make this powder and read in a way that is big girl that is gestural that has kind of character we really had to develop a language to talk about this design together I think that's where compensation was really interesting because we we started off designing this by hand on swatches to kind of get that proper gesture and so as a graphic designer started to create this pattern in order to make this BFI to look such a large surface we had to unpack each kind of step and really understand the design decisions that were being done manually so that we could apply them on a larger scale computationally so for a project like the US Embassy in London if we if we just look at images of it I hope what you've begun to understand that you know the backstory of a building like this for us is structured inquiry that actually gives us again the ability to create the effects that we want to create and the ability to increase the goals of the buildings that we create for our clients the US Embassy in London and one of the elements on this building that that received a lot of prototyping attention and analysis attention is the ETF fee scrim or exterior envelope right over the glass on the building here it is from the interior and from one of the interior gardens but the analysis for this particular element I took all sorts of forms we wanted to understand it phenomenally but we also needed to understand it structurally as a single layer tension membrane that had to take on a very specific shape we also wanted to understand how to integrate photovoltaics into the surface and tried to achieve something that had yet to be achieved a single layer tension membranes at the time which means that we had to look at how the single layer tension membrane was stressed through different form finding exercises we had to look at how those forms then related to the output of light or sorry the output of energy and look at their preform in relationship to PD potential rather look at the form in relationship to all the different ways of adding the other elements that stabilize the the actual curve of the single layer tension membrane this raised this required a whole series of prototypes both partial scope prototypes and full-scale prototypes with our partners but we look at the balance of system components required for the PV integration it also required us to step back and say that there were some things that we actually couldn't test but we couldn't to it we knew that the etf fee would reflect and diffuse and reflect refract light in certain ways we actually had research queries that suggested that there have to be ways for us to visualize this we tried and tried but it was actually hard to do and so once the building was actually built we were able to begin to capture some of the quality from this material that we were we were after and began to understand really begin to understand at scale some of the phenomenal effects may be that there's some questions you ask that you can't really answer but what's really important about just looking at the images of this project is that when you see images of this project cellophane house cellophane house is again made of again this in this instance pt/ptt membrane stressed in a frame integrated with thin foam photovoltaics it's a five story or four story prototypical dwelling installed as part of MoMA's home delivery show in 2008 this is an important moment for us so the New London embassy just completed in 2017 I just went back in time to 2008 and showed you something where there's some material similarities here I can go back in time even further to 2003 and show you smart wrap spar trap which is a prototypical facade this is the working portion of it down here that integrates power light integrates thin film transistors basically is trying to integrate systems of a building by using a family of what are called organic printable materials on a PT substrate often when it comes to extending your agency through questions and then backing up those questions with action what you're doing is you're seeding your future work you're recognizing that and we recognize this in our work is that the questions that we ask today some of them we can't answer but we can basically begin to build up a body of work that allows us to continue to carry that work in the future which means that the embassy benefits from the investment that we made early on in trying to pursue a novel material like smart wrap the ABC envelope doesn't exist without the cellophane house which doesn't exist without smart wrap which really doesn't exist without our investment and trying to pursue these types of novel technologies one of the other aspects of searching not only does it integrate into the design process but allows you to step back it allows you to look at the things you've created I'm sorry I'm sure you've all had this thought that when you look at the built environment you probably are asking you know this is one big testbed why can't we really understand buildings why haven't we measured why haven't we really understood what we've created right when you take up the agency to research you're also taking up another type of agency which is one of my favorite types of agency you're taking up the agency to characterize describe the nature of something so much so that can you can use the nature that you've described as inputs for design so what are the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban open space urban open space we all enjoy urban open space when we go to design urban open space we wonder how does this work how does it perform what are the factors that contribute to a thriving and robust urban open space well if we could study those types of spaces in our cities what if we could understand the that actually contribute to good design of urban open space this is taking up the agency of describing the nature or character of something and seeding future design work so that we can use our findings to inform our design we did this at love park in Philadelphia we made a proposition to the city or actually to the Fairmount Park Conservancy at the time into the city to simply go into both Park and how many of you've been to love park old the park newless park some of you might know that love park like this it has been completely redesigned right but the love park was it is a thriving open space and until Adelphia a really important space in the center of the city had very mature trees a very mature series of vegetative areas around the exterior and it's always a thriving place to be in the city this simple create a survey methodology that allows us to understand the relationship of people in space mark those people in space censor the space understand the relationship of trees to material to materials to people to their activities and just simply look back out look at the data and see if we can come up with some conclusions about the relationship between all of those multiple variables in open space that project translated directly a year later into similar set of questions about the factors that contribute to interactions on any urban emergency room in Philadelphia we worked with Jeff design one of the I think the only design thinking program for future medical doctors in the u.s. founded by dr. banku and he saw our love park study and said I want you to do this in my space I want to understand how health care providers and patients interact because I'm all trying to modify my rooms and always moving things around things aren't in this space they should be I have patients in the hall has no problems can we just describe what's going on here the power to describe it's one that we should take up again and again and again in order to know what we've done and what we've created this also applies simply to vegetation we have a long-running series of increase that are just simply trying to characterize trees trees on sites especially in this site and again in Philadelphia mature tree canopy how do we understand the contribution of leaf on leaf off to a future building that's going to sit right there in that parking lot and can we begin to understand those trees and adequately model those trees again we can extend this power to characterize to some really in-depth studies like this study on our green roofs our green roof vegetation study allowed us to go back to a whole range of roofs about eight total roofs that we had designed this is the study that originates from the question what's going on over there and really what we're simply trying to understand is the relationship between all of the engineering layers under this thin layer that we like to describe it's just a green line right all the vegetation we're trying to understand what's going on under there versus what's going on on top because we what we've realized is that in spite a roof that we had designed seven years prior to across the way and it was out of control in terms of growth and we begin to realize wait a minute we planted six species but that looks more like 65 right what happened what's going on recognizing that when you have such an amazing amount of biomass all of a sudden the way you think about the thermodynamics of that roof changes all the Sun the way you think about water begins to change and so going back to roofs like this and being able to create data like this two thousand six six species well 13 right it just begins to give us a snapshot a way of thinking and characterizing what we've done the relationship to solar regimes and a relationship to drainage regimes realizing that there's a relationship between the form and slope of that roof to the vegetative cover and species richness and biodiversity of the roofs often we're trying to describe the nature of something that that is true for this project as well this project that we did at the Royal Danish Academy or with the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts Centre for information technology we were working with a group within a very broad transdisciplinary group and we were working specifically with phase change materials it was a it was a simple and complex and complicated project because we were trying to couple fully couple a prototype that's embedded with about sixty sensors to a simulation of this material turning solid and turning liquid which means we had to know the physics associated with the flow of that liquid once it was liquid we had to know all of the material properties we had to know something about heat flow we're working closely with someone who understands the first principles of thermodynamics and we were simply trying to couple a physical prototype with a digital model for a very very specific reason but this is simply simply what's there you know it's it's really straightforward it's a series of vacuum formed shells the shells are then filled with phase change materials in liquid form they change materials are programmed to go from solid to liquid at a very very specific temperature and they hold that temperature for a very specific reason which is pretty interesting we were working with prototypes in two locations because part of our of our partners in Copenhagen some of them are in Philadelphia you can see all the sensors in that surface and then those sensors are geo-located or the the prototype co-located the sensors are geo-located they're represented fully represented in a digital model we're getting readings off the sensors the five minute we're adjusting the test bed and what we're simply trying to do is to figure out what's going on over there at really specific times time steps because what we've done is we've also created a virtual version of what's going on over there and if we have two both of them side by side we can actually get this digital version to be really accurate and all of a sudden represent a really complex phenomena a phase change and if we can do that if we can create a digital version of this what that means is that we can give a simulation platform to anyone in this room and you can work with complex phase changing phenomena and ultimately you begin create surfaces and surface effects that are quite intentional ones where you're able to basically say that I want to create a surface that goes from a complete hatch that's the white to a series of dashes to a series of dots can we control the geometry now that we understand have a calibrated simulation platform can I control the geometry so much so and begin to run through a series of simulations and search for forms of those shells that would result in a hatch dot dash pattern and can we begin to look and understand how that hatch - pattern happens over time coupling robot phenomena with simulation again extend your agency it's a way of understanding how precise you can be how much play there isn't a system right same is true we're doing something very similar with the loblolly house this is a la vallee house last year now this is what it looks like when it was built you noticed a difference I'll go back you notice a difference yes okay it's what the wood is weathered what do you think you should we even go here what if we control could control or understand how a wood weathers what if we could simulate how wood weathers we actually ask that could we simulate and then begin to control it well all we're looking at is color change we're just looking at simply looking at color change or wear coloration occurs and why and it turns out it's driven by wind it's driven by UV exposure and it's driven by water these are phenomena that we're familiar with so when we begin to look at the LA Valley house there's a whole range of experiments embedded in this house an experiment of reorganizing the supply chain of building it out of one tool of working with chunks and panels of actually saying well at the end of its useful life we want to be able to return it back to the forest but this experiment begins to suggest that we can go back to the loblolly house survey really survey and create useful maps of coloration and begin to take a very rough sketch of a simulation platform that predicts wood weathering for another building and turn it into a more precise simulation platform that would look at this phenomena board by board and that would allow and ultimately allow designers to interact with weathering as part of the design process and that's really where we've extended taking questions like that it extended those questions into platforms for designers in our office to use and for designers in the profession to you so as I mentioned earlier when it comes to a software like tally simple question whether the embodied environmental impacts can we measure them as we're designing then we said yes we were able to answer yes they were that able to answer yes to that question and then develop a robust method based on lifecycle assessment to do that often these types of platforms start out at these types of projects we actually just completed this this really quick sketch just last weekend and called it holy frit which suppose I guess a lift for the left but you know you probably noticed like wow you guys do a lot of research on frit like what's going on what's that discussion like well it's you know again people like to keep having this discussion what if we can use augmented reality do a really quick proof of concept of a tool that would leverage AR through a web-based platform allow designers to look really quickly at a series of patterns either image base or geometry base and just simply begin to iterate through using a AR more of a AR platform on glass to understand I understand those potential patterns this is a proof of concept tool purchase concepts often look like this this image right here you can see iteration after iteration after iteration of iteration a long project 2013 to present of trying to provide a platform for us to collect information collect measurements in space high density low cost sensor network that provides real-time information on phenomena that's occurring in spaces we've tested this with about 25 different architects more recently we're we're just launching this tool that's going to allow our profession to organize post occupancy evaluations and more specifically thermal comfort surveys where people are asking a pastor range of questions and their questions are actually mapped to the exact location their answers are mapped to the exact location that they're in in their space so not only do we get data about how they feel how hot they are how cold they are if they like the brightness of something if they don't right but we also begin to get a map of a space that you need to begin to define microclimate in this space and you can begin to look like wow people over here a little more cold than the people over here they're kind of hot what are the factors that are contributing to that these are platforms you're another and this is the final platform I'll show you final project versus another another platform is you know a construction logic platform that we're developing for India is equally a platform the one that it's a construction system that's priced about five different components it's trying to take a Norm that what is a more normative cast-in-place frame logic or a frame and fill logic where you have Catherine place frame with masonry trying to address a whole range of goals related to climate resource conservation cost targets within logistics and material handling and compress all those goals into five really smart components the smartest of which is a column component whose depth and width allow it to be a column wall and allow it to it permits a certain amount of self-shading all of this is required a whole range in a range of research in terms of construction logistics in India material availability but the system is nonetheless vertically expandable and horizontally expandable the range of queries that we've done here include mix design for concrete around all the different aggregates that are available in India especially since we were trying to eliminate initially material handling for this where we're working with a whole bunch of lightweight materials and dipping a series of mixed designs on lightweight aggregate it also required us to invest in pattern-seeking that would eliminate or let's just say increase the amount of self sheeting on very specific surfaces surfaces that were going to likely receive a lot of Sun required a lot of prototyping back and forth between our partners in India and our apartment and our shop in Philadelphia component by component we built up a prototyping protocol until we were able to realize our first prototype in Ahmedabad I in 2013 and then this part of type every column you see there is a different mixed design we're testing five or ten different things at one time when we're but when we were building this initial prototype and then more recently and the image that you saw at the outset we were able to test the horizontal and vertical expansion of the prototype so why do we research as I mentioned at the opening there's never been a more pressing moment than now to test the boundaries of our design agency and then I really do believe that we research because agency expand a research increases the agency of the architect which gets me to my my final final couple of slides I just want to mention briefly why we're doing what we're doing or give you a sense of what we're doing in our studio so our studio it's really really trying to take up this question of expanding design agency and testing the boundaries of our design agency in our studio we've recognized that we are awash in a changing climate we're overwhelmed by a material glut and we wonder what if anything are for making powers amount to when they are meted out one building at a time so you have to ask this question when you look at the range of things that you can do but the smallness of architecture can something small like architecture make a substitute impact correct our course well something large like a global industrial building materials complex which includes extractors and processors and manufacturers reset pace and purpose but I wrote this because one day on my desk I got a article that it has showed up and it was published by building green and it was titled the urgency of embodied carbon and what you can do about it and I was just in the midst of teaching this studio and working on this subject with several students in the audience now this is an interesting title because the urgency is in this instance the materials building materials manufacturing process or the manufacturing problem they were addressing emissions not only carbon to land air and sea but the what you could do caught my eye what they were appealing to was our power and yes again our agency they were trying to basically say hey you don't focus on building operations you got to focus on building materials if you want to solve the carbon problem they were actually trying to say that you can take up new concepts and new tools you could reshape your design habits but I think more often than not we have to be suspicious of those types that type of advice this was evidence that answers to these big questions are forming but I guess the bigger question we're asking in the studio is is it possible to tackle the some of the complex rather than resort to incremental tooling up can we rethink the whole shebang and I hear I mean the relationship between architecture ecology materials energy governance building culture and beauty so really the purpose of our design studio it's a test it designs to the the purpose of the design studio is that it is one place where we can test the boundaries area imagine design agency we can establish a serious pedagogy we can exam and brought unwieldy questions we can experiment with possible positions this is why studio is so awesome and so we began our studio with an experiment that I'm going to leave you with okay here's the experiment I'm going to read it twice in the woods there are three sites the first site the land is set aside for materials extraction the second site the factory is a place for materials processing and manufacture the third third site the trailhead is home to the center of land use history in ecological interpretation at the trailhead the center the Center for land use history ecological interpretation it's constructed with raw materials extracted from the land and these materials are processed at the factory both the trail head in the land have to resonate as culturally significant places and experiences that premise is deceptively simple you might say we do that day in and day out we have the power to - through those relationships the designers who have the power to extract materials process them assemble them into construction systems can actually challenge the very system boundary of architectural form making they are poised to design through a socio ecological framework they're poised to draw a boundary around useable and less usable resources and conspire to create materials construction logics and new building forms so the immediate reaction to a premise that simple there are three sites one site gives us materials one site takes away materials and one site is where we do something to those materials the immediate reaction usually goes in a thousand different directions some construe this premise as a bid for hyperlocal ISM some for Hyper do-it-yourself ISM both those positions are wrong some decry it as a flavor of survivalism and may be given the issues that I've outlined as I began this may be that does stick some retort you can't be serious we're very serious others turn the premise over and over and ask is the land a real place yes the land is a real place others jump immediately to architectural tropes with retort but what about transparency meaning that all the materials found on the land none of them are transparent what do I do about transparency what about the cantilever there's no iron ore there what do we do about structural tactics so what I've noticed is that every time I present the studio I usually filled those questions for about five minutes and at the end you like Bob of ah you know this is the grounds for a new way to be and I always say yes yes it is all right so thank you thank you for your patience so I'm really happy to answer questions about Karen Timberlake but since we have a group full of students I wanted to do something a little different and I just wanted to let you know that I'm very happy to answer questions about my own personal trajectory because often students want to ask questions about that or questions about what it's like to work at Karen Timberlake on that I'm happy to answer a whole range of different types of questions if you want to if we can take the couple we're gonna try okay you can ask me anything like you know research was researching don't be intimidated hi my name's Akshata thank you for the lecture it was like pretty inspiring and very like relevant to like what I want to do yeah I really appreciate how your studio is so collaborative with like other fields and also appreciate how how like unapologetically explorative you guys are and my question is um well I've always felt like our college was like in a bubble kind of and I've always like wondered what it would be like to work with people and like engineering field and the AG field and etc etc so my question is like actually about our school how do you think we can like start breaking out of this bubble and like start to work with other people in different fields you know one thing I've learned about trying that is that it doesn't happen by you waiting for permission you know in all of the work that we do if I if I waited for a grant to come in if I waited for actual funding if I waited for permission to assemble a team half of those projects actually almost 90 percent of those projects that you just saw wouldn't have happened in other words what we found is that in order to test these types of relationships we just had to identify a question that we could all get around ask an answer and we had to find people and you can imagine this we have folks that have training in all of these other fields who actually have said you know I'm not going to take up my primary field I'm going to come work in this other field and actually to be honest many of the folks that are working with us have multiple degrees they have folks in our office who have degrees in anthropology environmental engineering and architecture that's one person physics environmental management and architecture chemical physics and architecture it's that's part of it too but you have to find the project that you want to do and bring people together to do it don't wait for permission permission prove concepts then use your proof of concepts as a basis for then aspiring to a much more robust project I've learned that I can intestine eight other questions for me they've been confusing yep hello I at the National Conference for early enscape architecture this year in Philly I'm Stephanie Carlisle from Carrington Gaelic was on a research base she was did you see her in there I did yeah and she's been here at this school yes yeah among the other panelists who were talking about the importance of research in their various firms they talked about the important of importance of open source data yeah and how much does Karen Tim really kind of turn back into that system and how much is used as a jumping-off point from there yeah one of the reasons why we did the love park project is because we were trying to evidence to the city how important was it was to build up datasets that designers could use about the spaces that we inhabit in in other words there is open source data but then there's also lack of data there's the building up of open source datasets and then there's the building up of quality open source datasets right but that's absolutely something that we support that we participate in and that we're generally interested in not just open source data but being able to contribute to open source a peer review or open source publishing open source tools etc yeah other questions for me other questions for me yeah Rachel so um in six pack six scales like I don't know how many weigh weeks ago we talked about like defining your agency and at that moment you didn't quite tell us like maybe how you defined your agency so I guess my question is like how did you come upon I think your agency is researching yep or asking questions but how did you come upon that and then how have others found other types of agency you have what are those yeah no that's a that's um so from my own personal trajectory I guess I mean I think I have a feeling that some of some folks in this audience or probably like me I'm just sort of really I'm kind of a natural-born sleuth I love figuring out why things are the way that they are so a bit of an epistemological bent how much can you know something so that's you know part of me and then simultaneously I grew up with a father who was a builder I grew up in the profession of construction and all of our dinnertime conversation was around all the things that went wrong on his construction sites so when you match I think you match like a constant stream of information I guess or did my career in Reverse if you like constant room of information about what's wrong with construction with this with someone who has a tendency to sleuth I think there's a pairing there there was a pairing there for me that I realized I think there's a whole realm of things to ask about how we built why we build the way that we do and then how deeply I could take that question into understanding environmental phenomena understanding material characteristics and phenomena just simply constantly asking that question I've only found out recently that and I didn't realize I didn't have a consciousness of this but I just found out recently having talked to my first design professors in architecture that I drove them crazy and my first studio because I kept asking them questions and it was Ellen Weinstein at North Carolina State University who pointed out to me that I actually amazingly found a job that was perfectly suited to me I was like oh my gosh you know I'm in my 40s and you're absolutely right I did I did find a job that was perfectly suited yeah yeah there are other types of agency though other descriptions for agency I have a feeling that you all have things you're passionate about that's simply what I did it's I've been pursuing something that I'm passionate about I love working across disciplines I think there's something to it hate silence simple love design all the questions for me so first of all thank you very much that was that was fascinating and really beautifully delivered I was struck during your talk about at times how easy it looked yeah right how easy the reason how easy it was to think oh that's what research is yeah and then at other times about how difficult or maybe involved or yeah you know kind of drawn out it seemed or or incredibly scientific or technologically complicated and so on so can you talk a little bit about you know making it easy versus making it hard yeah you know the research what we found what we found is that given the methods that are represented in our firm you know the people with very specific kinds of silicates what we found is that we can ask questions that are very much on the limits of our knowledge base and that does make it easy and make it make it hard it's easy to identify what we're curious about it's easy sometimes to create a value argument for why we need to go after that information it's sometimes even easy to prove that that information is valuable but what gets really hard is that often you want to increase your certainty over what you're investigating often you want to make sure that what you found stands up to what's happening let's just say at a pure level in that field of knowledge so the deeper we go into a subject matter like thermodynamics the more we have to depend on that pure field and really get into the mechanics of phase change and very very very very very small scales right and that gets us into fields where we're just like wow right but I found that it's about increasing what let me increase resolution of information we often find out just how much we don't know and how much further we have to go and we have to make this decision about if we want to know that we're going to go that far does that make sense yeah is there is there tension in the office between the perspective you gave us on the office through focusing on research and agency and people who just want to crank out amazing things or yeah bust-a-move as we say yeah you know and not be kind of dragged down by you know the bigger but you mean like you know doing quantitative stuff is a drain no I mean is that I'm interested in the tension between yeah I mean sort of but just the tension between designers who want to you know come use their intuition yeah exactly yeah you know I mean I think that's what it is their attention I think that that what you would hear us all say is that when the tension is non-productive it's not interesting but we have some really productive tensions that get us to better places so yeah of course like that you know I don't know what the research methods research methods training looks like at this college but we all know like I certainly wasn't trained in research methods right I'm just a sleuth like I like certain things so when you put a bunch of designers in a room how do we define research often it's not the same way as science fields to find research when you put a bunch of folks that were trained in science fields in a room with designers you have to work through and develop new vocabulary new shorthand in order to allow both to thrive simultaneously and that's where the tension comes in absolutely other questions for me now Kyra come on I see you the question you want to ask that you're afraid to ask so I'm just asking the question for you do you have a big question which you haven't answered yet and you know you haven't just haven't gotten a chance to what's the biggest question since I was a kid is why did we build the way that we do no but I mean I think that's when you've been working on right in pieces right is there is there some chunk of that or some some big thing that you'd love to have the million dollar grant come in for that you haven't done yet it's on the list I would love to have a tackle more specifically in our profession evidence that suggests that designing in the design process is something that should be open and accessible to all that it's equal on and on par with math and reading and I don't know how to do that but I'd love I'd love to see access to those processes be something that we take up or that way of thinking be something we take out very seriously we know there's people that are working on that I just wonder I mean I wonder how much more we can do as a profession together you're probably not regular expecting to take that answer no where other questions okay are there questions that you know the answer to that you like to ask why we throw the way that we did no I'm joking I don't have answers are there questions that I know the answer to that I won't share that I like to ask my students now I like to have conversations about questions I certainly had stored up a lot of knowledge but I'm always questioning my knowledge so the limits yeah okay one more question yeah yeah yeah it's just a materials question one of the projects that you had had clear walls it looked like something that was stretched a some sort of polymer yeah and you describe that as what was that peak was that cellophane house yes yeah that was PT uh-huh so my question is why didn't you use like poly methyl methacrylate without something that present yeah that doesn't degenerate in the Sun well it actually in that instance we have a UV we have one of the layers of paint II has a UV layer on it okay good yeah so we were yeah I just wondered that yeah and we were also interested in something that was already fully substantiated into a recycling stream that makes sense yeah yeah yeah we were interested in the coke bottle relationship to I think it's a little accessible okay okay thank you Thank You Billie thank you
