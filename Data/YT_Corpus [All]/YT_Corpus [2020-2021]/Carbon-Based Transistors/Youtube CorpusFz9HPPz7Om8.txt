 You've made your way to our materials sciences and  engineering presentation so on our call today so   Dr. Tongay as well as one of our academic advisors  Shabnam within our SEMTE school and then I am a   recruitment coordinator with Fulton so I will be  in the background helping moderate our q&a and   our chat this evening but with that I will turn it  over to Dr. Tongay for all of the fun interesting   information about material sciences thank you for  the introduction Nina can you guys hear me okay   everything is good perfect so I mean  Nina you have done the introduction   my name is Set the first three letters  that's what people call me all the time   my name is long double a's double t's people  butcher it all the time so I decided you know   what three first letters you can't you can't  really butcher no more so no more excuses   so it is Sef, Sef Tonga here I'm the chair  of the undergraduate program of material   science and engineering so my goal today is  to tell you what this program is all about   I just want to tell you what I do as in like  what we do as material science scientists and   engineers what kind of fields we go into  do we like doing this field yes we do   it is a lot of fun so I want to just go over these  very quickly I highly encourage you guys to come   out of your shell I totally get it because I'm  introverted myself I know it is hard to believe   it is it takes a lot of effort to ask the question  but just ask away okay just whatever question   there is no stupid question there is no nothing  just ask it don't hesitate with that I'm going   to start the presentation that I put together  that's pretty much goes through from a to z of the   material science I promise you not to bore you I'm  not gonna go into the extreme technical details   but if you guys have any technical questions  I would be more than happy to answer those   so I'm going to go ahead and share my screen  let's see if it works yes it does perfect so   this is the material science and engineering  department so the name is a little bit unfortunate   it says materials when we talk about materials we  do not talk about materials like pen and pencil   and rubber and those kind of things it is a little  bit more advanced more than that so what do we do   what do these materials engineers scientists  do so we design and develop and manufacture and   test and redesign and redevelop and optimize  materials for applications daily applications   some of the examples can be for example you want  switchable glasses at your home you have a glass   that is silicon oxide that is amorphous  we put very thin coating of carbon on it   and by passing a little bit electric current by  0.1 volt immediately we can switch it this is an   established technology actually it is expensive  but we designed these we come up with the idea   this would be material science and engineering  you have your adidas sneakers and then you're   just jumping around it is beautiful it is  good on your ankles it is good on your knees   somebody had to design it I'm not talking  about how cool it looks what the colors   are but I'm talking about the polymer base the  base that is right at the bottom of your shoe who   designed it material scientists and engineers we  had to design the porosity of this polymer we had   to innovate the polymer it is a polymer science  it is polymer material science and engineering   you have your loved ones if they broke their bones  and if it is beyond repair like elderly people do   the worst idea you can have is to just put a cast  on and just wait for many many months to heal it's   not gonna happen you need to have an implant this  implant must be biocompatible it needs to last   for many many years so that you don't undergo  many surgeries the design of this metal has to   come from somewhere this is material science and  engineering that's what we do it is not as simple   as take any metal piece and just stick it through  the bone it is not going to work it needs to flex   the same way our bones do flex actually if they  are not compatible with each other you're gonna   keep cracking your bone this is another example  we love making materials for energy conversion   solar panels that you see they are all  innovations of material science and engineering   sometimes we cannot design it sometimes we are  not as innovative as nature would be then we get   some clues from the nature we look at insects  we look at leaves we look at plants and then   we innovate from those because those designs took  many many years to come to where they are at now   so this would be called mimicry some people call  it materials mimicry biomimicry and whatnot this   is one of the areas that we do work on another  one is I have to move this around a little bit   another one is actually materials for future  sometimes I cannot just simply say what do you   guys need you guys cannot say this is what I need  because you don't know what might be available   sometimes we design materials for future what  that means is some of the applications that   doesn't exist right now on Earth we plan for those  materials now so that we can make for example   super computers when we're dealing with these  super computers this is from IBM actually this   is from 2019 IBM super computer that is million  times faster than any of your computers these   computers do not take silicon they take completely  different materials and somebody has to design it   this is material science and engineering so  moving forward I wanted to pick one example   if a slide allows me if you go to San Diego  to the beach you will have beautiful sand   that would be mostly silicon dioxide you take  that silicon dioxide you process it which is   material science that would be silicon wafer we  built devices on top of these silicone wafers   except this silicon wafer when it is high purity  means nothing you need to do something with it   what we do as material scientists we put  foreign atoms in it instead of just having   hundred percent silicon we put phosphorus in it  we sometimes put arsenic in it we put different   elements only when we do put these elements  in then you can get electronic applications   without this step that I have described right here  there is no absolutely no electrical applications   no electronics you cannot use silicon a material  scientist and engineer must design these otherwise   it is not possible so in a sense Intel cannot  operate without material science in engineering   Intel is one of the heavy hires of material  scientists and in material science we have a   famous saying that is materials are like  people it is the defects in them that   tend to make them interesting that is true unless  you incorporate these defects these elements these   atoms that doesn't belong to silicon they don't  become interesting you cannot make applications   in the big picture what we try to do is we look  at the structure of the material I'm talking about   atomic structure we look at processing can we make  this because if we cannot make this we shouldn't   waste our time and it needs to be cheap we look  at the performance are they gonna do a good job   are they gonna defeat everything else available  in the universe we look at properties do we want   them to conduct electricity or insulate them do  we want heat to dissipate or do we want heat to   retain what do we want to do with it this would  fall all within the material science and within   material science and engineering what we do is we  look at many different scales it starts from here   micron all the way to nanometers and even lower  but in reality what I didn't put out in this slide   is actually we deal with much larger sizes as well  like the porosity in adidas sneakers and here's   one video that I wanted to show you very quickly  and this gives you an idea this is a simple pen   it is pen because it is material science we do  not do pen we do not do you know rubber erasers   or whatnot but this particular video will show you  across the landscape how things actually change   and please pay attention to scale here I want  to stop right here this part is really cool   this is silicon silicon dioxide it's a micro ball  that it is micro ball or millimeter size ball   ball pen and right behind this ball pen you have  a ink compartment right here each time you try to   write it this thing rolls and you spill the ink  the part that you're looking at here is aluminum   it is aluminum alloy it has a bunch of scratches  because possibly this pen went through a lot   but this aluminum is designed  specifically designed otherwise   pens would last couple days somebody had to  engineer this let's look at it a little bit more we are zooming in this is called microstructure  this is inside your metal   without this microstructure you cannot quite work  with the metals the way you like to work with them it's kind of porosity you can imagine and right here slowly you're starting  to see these beautiful ordered atoms located length scales this would be atomic structure of  aluminum and if you zoom in more you can slowly get to the atoms you can slowly  start seeing individual atoms and in material   science quite literally we deal with all these  different length scales and we play with it   and we love it each length scale has a purpose  the large length scales millimeter sizes   has a purpose when you design that metal you  can use it for automative industry if you are   all the way to the nanometer scales when you're  dealing with atoms you're dealing with for example   quantum computation that's also materials I  want to go back to the slide one more time so some more examples right here you're  looking at military grade water filters   it is micro porous ceramic that is created  by material scientists and engineers with   that kind of filter you can create you can  make clean water from very very dirty water   this is one particular application area any kind  of quantum information technologies quantum optics   any kind of electronics that you use right here  would be materials at ASU for example we have   designed some of these solar panels that went  on to Mars rover that was also materials program we can make mirrors that are good for  telescopes for astrophysics applications oftentimes we work in this funny suits it would  make beautiful halloween costume I believe   and we work in fancy laboratories to make  fabrication so that we can innovate materials   we care about the nature we make materials  that are biodegradable if you want if you have   a humorous side like myself you can make tonka  trucks you have to design polymers and plastics   that doesn't that is not hurting our  children it is not cancer cancerogenic   and as I was describing in the previous slide by  playing with the porosity of the materials you can   design metals and metals alloys and car automatic  industry has went through a lot of changes in the   last two decades all because of the material  science and engineering it is much lighter now   during the accident it's much more safer because  the way we designed metals allow it to be that way   so here at ASU we have many faculty  members within the materials program   and these faculty members have excellent track  records they are national award winners from the   President Trump to white house to national academy  of sciences to you imagine so basically imagine   Oscars Emmys we have it within the material  science and engineering the best part of the   material science and engineering program is the in  undergraduate the faculty ratio is very very good   that means you get one-on-one attention  quite often it is very boutique program   you get Ivy League quality Stanford Penn  or other places like quality education   these are some of the other examples we are  looking at national academy of inventors two of   these we are looking at myself here from the white  house award from the President Trump for example   not only faculty but also student chapters help  you and we have one specific chapter within the   materials program called materials  advantage for example in two weeks   materials advantage will be meeting outside they  will have a picnic event within safety guidelines   and these students meet on a weekly basis  currently because of Covid 19 it is every Friday   via zoom for the first time in two weeks  they are going to be meeting in person   when we were meeting in person many faculty  members would join we would give special   presentations our students would follow and  students would have many projects they would   present their projects in front of a large  audience we are integrated with the University   of Arizona we have a sweet competition with  them each year we give our best projects from   each institution and we look at which one is  the best selected by all the faculty members so where do our graduates go these are some of  the examples that I picked these are not the best   examples or versed examples these are standard  examples one student that used to be undergraduate   student here undergraduate class of 2019 he  is currently at MIT he's a phd student at MIT   one of our undergraduate students she graduated  in 2018 she did one extra year to do master's work   and currently she's working at applied  materials here in Phoenix and this is   her current salary here's another here's another  example right here we have two phds for example   they have taken their phds from Arizona  State University at materials one of them is   working at Intel the other one is currently  professor at the University of California   by new graduate typical salary is around $65,000   with five years you reached 81 this is national  average so we are a little bit much higher than   this a little bit more higher than this within  Phoenix area again this is a national average   the reason why I picked material science in  the big picture was I just wanted to make a   difference in the world I just didn't want to deal  with is it 5.51 or is it five point five two or   that's not what I wanted to deal with what I  wanted to deal with it was is it one is it ten   is it million big questions I wanted to solve many  problems from ground up I just wanted to be able   to use the innovation to its maximum I wanted  to influence I just wanted to be relevant this   is why I picked material science I thought I would  share my personal experience with you very briefly   so that you guys can understand what prompted me  to go to material science because I didn't wake up   one day and I didn't say you know what I want to  be material scientists that didn't work like that so if you guys have any questions I will be here so I don't have any questions in the q&a just  yet but this is a really wonderful opportunity   for any students that are interested in Fulton  or specifically your materials program to ask   questions we also have our academic advisor  on the call too so talking about some of the   coursework or course requirements we're open for  those questions as well so we'll stick around if   you've got what you need from our session you're  more than welcome to head on with your evening   but you're also welcome to stick around for some  q&a if you have questions as well okay so we do   have a question I would say probably a little  bit for both Shabnam and Dr. Tongay so what   kind of student succeeds the most so I guess we'll  rephrase this as what makes a student successful   in this program? well it depends on how we  measure success so if you're measuring success by   making a lot of money let's say in that  case which is fine in that case I would say   good gpa and very very disciplined work would help  that is important and I would also say selecting   which field you want to work in is also equally  important but if you're measuring success as in   like personal success you are happy with your  work it is not a work that you say oh my god it   is Monday again I never said that honestly  I love this job if that is how you measure   you're making living you're making good money and  you're happy with your work and you feel like you   are relevant in the world you have a place then I  would say to be successful you need to be engaged   engaged in research you need to starting  from the second year and that's why we try to   encourage our students to be integrated in active  research most of our students 80 percent of our   students I'm talking about undergraduate students  they are involved in active research by the end of   their second year so that gives them the all the  summer together with two more extra years to get   hands-on experience and when I say hands-on  experience I don't mean like oh I did a little   bit touching here and I touched this this that  and then I take a picture I put it on instagram   and I had I don't know five second TikTok video  that got 20,000 views I'm not talking about   that I'm talking about being really engaged and  doing something and you go back home and you say   you know what mom I did this how about that you  know that's education for you right there so what   I'm trying to say is answer is be engaged engage  with other students be engaged with us faculty   members be engaged in active research just come  out of your shell because we are happy to help you I hope this answers the question I'm not  sure no I think that's perfect Shabnam   do you have any advice for student  success yes so I mean Dr. Tongay get   kind of put it in a gist be engaged make  sure you ask for help when you need help   you know when you come to ASU it's your education  so make sure you reach out because yes we will   try to reach out to you however we cannot get to  every student all the time so please be sure to   again talk to your professor they may be  intimidating they're not they're people they   will understand you come to us advisors are here  your first point of contact so when you get to ASU   we are your first point of contact so anytime  you feel like you're lost stop by I mean as   of right now you can't really stop by but you can  email us you can schedule appointment with us and   we're more than happy to help just be engaged  and everything you do college work is just not   about going to class it's more than that it's  Dr. Tongay said doing research doing internship   just socializing also very very important  especially nowadays it's very important that you   socialize that will keep you you know sane and  motivated to continue you know doing your best   I want to give one more example actually  very quickly it happened last week actually   one of our first year students reach out to me  she is online she's not online student she is   joining currently because of Covid 19 she is  online student her family is from Philadelphia   she lives in Philadelphia currently she sent me  an email and she to ask me how I feel about her   coming to Tempe for the Spring semester and her  family wanted to look for houses here for renting   and I was like well if you like to come and if  you like to experience and get to know around   and this this that where I'm trying to get  this this student reached out and let me tell   you what happened the discussion evolved very  quickly two days later this student her mom   and her father jumped on the plane came directly  to Tempe met with me in person I have given them   a lab tour which they loved I have introduced  one or two realtors so what I'm trying to say   is we are engaged we are relatively small program  we are boutique program we do care about each one   of our students very very much so as long as you  tell us what is going on as long as you tell us   how what kind of help you need Shabnam is great  Jeffrey is great Nina is great we all are gonna   help you so we have a couple other questions that  have been coming in so I'm kind of speaking to the   the boutiqueness of the program about how many  students would you say are in material sciences?   so within our program I would say 50 students  would be reasonable per year so that would adapt   to roughly 200 students in the entire program  and we have 20 faculty members so that is one   to ten give or take if we don't account for  adjunct faculty when we put the adjunct faculty   as I described it is one to eight ratio and it  is very select and it is very unique and for   that reason finding job is fairly easy because  across the nation material science programs are   always selective they always keep their student  body for example MIT accepts 10 or 15 students   Stanford accepts 20 students or so that's  the range the largest program that I've   seen was University of Florida that was 75  students but if you look at the job posts   it always says material science and engineers and  mechanical engineers they always go hand to hand   so for that reason our graduates graduate and they  just get their offer letters before they graduate all right so we have a couple other questions  so speaking about being engaged can you speak   a little bit about the research opportunities  that undergraduates have within materials science   absolutely so the research areas are very broad   first I want to tell you a couple research  areas so you guys have an idea about what kind   of things we do here at ASU materials program  batteries advanced batteries flexible batteries   water splitting to generate hydrogen for energy  conversion solar cell research that's what we   do carbon capture carbon emission studies we  do that we do quantum materials which means   complete the new quantum applications  super computers and whatnot we do that   I'm thinking about metal alloying meaning  new metal alloy design so that we can create   much better newer construction materials for  cars for construction sites or whatnot we do that   what else I'm thinking about it we do fundamental  research such as materials chemistry and materials   physics we try to understand material properties  in full depth we do high electron mobility   transistors new generation of field effect  transistors it would be materials electronics   we do that I'm thinking like a lot yes we look at  for example one of our faculty member Cody Friesen   works on taking creating water out of nothing  he uses solar cells solar panels to create   electricity passes that electricity from the  materials that he created that's the innovation   when you pass that current from that material in  that material that material cools off quite a bit   and what happens is it captures the humidity  in air and it makes water out of it so he goes   in the middle of the desert he creates water  out of nothing and when I talk about water I'm   talking about like drinkable water it's not like  junk so within those research areas typically   as I mentioned by the end of your second  year you're gonna be finding one of these   research groups but to answer your question  directly one program that we have is FURI   which is Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative  within that program this program gives you some   stipend and some budget for you to carry out  your research direction that you want to take   either you come up with your own research or you  discuss your research with other faculty members   and you design it you apply for it our materials  students always get it to be perfectly honest   and we are good and then within that program you  start your research that's one of them the second   one is you email oftentimes this is what happens  at least with my group they email they say hey Sef   I think you're awesome we took your class it  was super cool we want to come and work with you   and typically they start working and oftentimes  some of them may say I'm not interested anymore   they can find completely different research  group that'd be the second one also we have   REU experiences which is a summer research series  that is done through NSF within that NSF program   you go to different places or you stay here we  have government funds these government funds give   you stipend or per hour based opportunities while  you do your research you get paid for example we   send our students to Germany to Ireland to  other countries Singapore is one of them   many of them stayed here to do  research so we have a lot going on coordinated efforts it's not careless all right looks like we have one question that's  a little more on the personal side of things   so what kind of student were you like what would  you have done differently in school? when I was   a student I will be very honest my parents how  should I say I don't want to use strong words but   I pretty much hated my parents because they moved  a little too much I never could stay at any given   place to make good friends like you know good  friends and the worst of it was the following they   kept moving from one country to another country to  another country that spoke all different languages   as such I had very little to talk with people  I told you guys when I'm introverted I mean   that so I didn't have the common language the  only thing that I was good at was mathematics   which is the common language we all speak so  mathematics I was very good at it the rest   I was horrible if you go to my primary  school friends secondary school friends   high school friends they would say I was at the  bottom like just nothing but in my free time I   was always curious I always was interested  in science and engineering I would design   houses I would make little cars and when I say  little cars it's not stupid cars I would just   really go into the details of it I would make  I will play with baking soda and this is that   I knew chemistry and materials was my passion  and I went from that so to answer your question   with all honesty mathematics I was good with chess  people thought that I would be a chess player not   international chess player but I  ended up being material scientists I think I'd call that a win  I'm sure do you play chess?   I still do I still do play chess but I don't  do for money or for career that I don't   I enjoy watching more than playing okay so  this I would say would go to both Dr. Tongay   and Shabnam so do you need a lot of chemistry and  mathematics for materials science and engineering   so can we speak a little bit about the specific  course load as far as chemistry and math goes?   I will let Shabnam handle this but I'm just  gonna say something very quickly answers   yes you will need a little bit mathematics a  little bit chemistry and we will teach you yeah   so as you guys can see here this is our full  charter major map it just outlines courses   that you have to take within the four years to  graduate with the material science and engineering   bachelor's degree so yes you will have to do some  science and some math and of course the science   and math will be implemented in your material  science classes the math sequence you follow   would be calculus one two and three this is a  very common for all engineering majors at ASU   we have calc one through three required for all  majors you do have physics one and physics two   and then also some of course some chemistry  there but yeah generally you will do some   of those introduction you know introductory  science classes math classes it dives then into   like linear algebra and differential equations you  may not be familiar with those just yet if you're   in like 10th grade or 11th grade but yeah so the  curriculum is here the first year is pretty much   very general studies classes such as you know  calculus one and two physics one chemistry one   english composition in the second semester you  do take your first material science class so   hopefully by then you'll have a good idea what  material science is and whether that would be the   you know right major for you but yes so some  of these classes can be taken in high school   while you're you know doing dual enrollment or  even AP so if you're taking AP calculus AB and   you get a score of four or three or four that  gives you credits for our calculus one class   if you get if you have you're taking AP  calculus BC that can give you credits   for these two classes so calculus one and two  of course if you have the appropriate score   AP physics unfortunately doesn't count for  anything so if you're taking AP physics very good   for your you know knowledge for your background  you're gonna do great in our physics classes   however those do not give you credits towards our  physics because our physics is university physics   and it's calculus based where the physics you may  be taken through AP is not calculus based and of   course the same applies to chemistry if you're  taking chemistry and you have appropriate score   that may give you credit for this chemistry  right here so just based you know on what you   complete in high school through dual enrollment  and AP you might be advanced in the major   but also just want to mention for material  science we do have the four plus one program   basically plus one program is that you finish  your bachelor's degree in four years and then   the plus one portion is your graduate degree your  master's degree and you finish basically your   master's degree within one year because some of  the classes that you're going to be taking towards   master's degree you're going to be completing  them while you are an undergraduate student   so that saves you a whole semester and a whole  semester to pay for so that one of the pros of   four plus one is it's easier to get in than  our you know traditional master's degree   because it's not selective as long as you meet  the requirements the requirements at 3.5 gpa   in all courses first year through third year  so your freshman sophomore and junior year and   then you have three professors who would recommend  you so if you're in the material science program   as Dr. Tongay said everybody knows each  other so you're probably going to have   a lot of professors who would be more  willing to recommend you for the program   yes so and yeah so it depends we also have a three  plus one program if you completed the first year   in high school like doing dual enrollment  credits or AP credits you can be in our three   plus one program which means you graduate with  your bachelor's degree in three years and then   the one year is going to be your master's degree  so getting two degrees within four years is great   anything that you want to add to Dr. Tongay no I  wanna just mention this four plus one program is   a smoking deal what it means is basically  all of a sudden you're not bachelors of   materials but you're masters of materials you  may say well master versus bachelor what does   what difference does it make if you go back to  my presentation you will see the difference when   you have a master's degree you'll immediately  jump your salary to easy a hundred thousand   so that has six digits for you so that you're not  going to be able to get to that digits straight   out of your bachelor's you will of course but  just it's going to take a little bit longer   so I highly recommend to our students that they do  four plus one degree which is fun honestly it is   they all love it research plus classes it is  amazing here honestly that plus one is amazing the rest I will agree and I wanna mention year one  it is this is standard isn't it Shabnam meaning   across the engineering it is not specific to us  and this is something that we have to do to be   to recognize this materials program degree across  the nation you have to take these electives and   fundamentals absolutely yes if you look at any  degree through Fulton schools of engineering or   any other programs at other universities they do  have these classes yes exactly any other questions so in case any of you are hesitating we  got Casey Chloe Jaden Jennifer and Nathan   I wish I could see you I can't but I hope  you can see me fine if you have questions   please do ask away don't hesitate and again  I genuinely love this love this particular   program I was a chemist I was a physicist I did  a lot of electronics and here I am I love it if   you have questions just feel free to ask me  those questions Nina is here Shabnam is here   Nina do they have our contact information email  information I can certainly put it in the chat   I don't think we shared it just yet but I'll  put my direct email in and then Shabnam if you   want to do yours as well yes please and I hope  that we meet I hope that we will get to meet   each other and I hope that you guys will join us  and I will be happy and I want to imagine I know   all of our students by their name I do not forget  them they are my friends on Instagram Facebook all   of those we always talk to each other it's really  close community it's just beautiful I love it well thank you so much for taking the time  out of your evening everyone to join us   so we'll stick around for a few more questions  or a few more minutes if there are any questions   but if you are on your way out for the  evening thank you for taking the time to   learn a little bit more about Fulton  and our materials science program thank you thank you everyone for joining I'm waiting for that one more question I think we have a question we do all right   what has been the most memorable part of  being in material science and engineering most memorable I would say  the most memorable to me is   nothing political most memorable to me  has been when I received the award from   President Trump he awarded me with this key  case award that comes from the white house   and that was the highest recognition and basically  white house recognized all the quantum materials   that I design all the quantum emitters that  I make is used in army and navy and air force   and they wanted to acknowledge that I think  that was most memorable to me that was last   summer I was really really happy super happy  super happy like I was jumping like a little kid   literally I was jumping like I was like I  couldn't believe it that was awesome I loved it   you said that was last year  that was last year 2019 summer   wow gosh 2019 summer yeah it was it was  great honestly so if I don't know anybody   is interested in let me write down my that first  of all let me write down my email before I forget and I'm gonna also give my instagram that is right there it is most social professor because  I'm the least social professor so   that joke is on me there so some of the pictures  are there that's why I just gave my instagram do we have other questions Chloe Jennifer no more well you have my contact  information feel free to reach out   thank you Nina and Shabnam this is a lot of work I  know hey I truly appreciate your hard work here I   mean that absolutely that's what we like to do  this is really really good stuff I'm glad that   I'm working with you guys thank you we love it  too all right I'm gonna leave now if it is okay to   leave yeah absolutely all right one more question  I see one more oh one more we got one more   oh thank you I learned a lot you're very  welcome thank you Jennifer I'm glad you   enjoyed it all right reach out if you have any  questions but we're going to close the room   now and I hope everyone has a wonderful  evening thank you you too bye thank you
