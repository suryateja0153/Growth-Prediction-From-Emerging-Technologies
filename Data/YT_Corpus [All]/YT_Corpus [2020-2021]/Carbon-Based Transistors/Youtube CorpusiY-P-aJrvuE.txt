 hi everyone welcome to the college of the environment's virtual visit day event just as a quick reminder this webinar is being recorded for future use my name is barbara owens and i am the undergraduate specialist and pre-major advisor in the dean's office in the college of the environment and i use she and her pronouns so i hope that you enjoyed the video you just viewed which provides a sneak peek into our undergraduate programs we are all excited to welcome you today to the first of five webinars exploring our majors in more depth and today's session is focused on our bio resource science and engineering major and we call it bse for short this is the only engineering degree program at uw that's outside of the college of engineering and in the video you just saw you saw the slurry that you'll learn more about today so next what we're going to do is you'll hear from our dean and you'll watch many lessons from two of our bse faculty and it involves one of our grad students as well and then you'll have time to ask them questions live and then that would be followed by an additional q a time with myself and three of our current students and we have two bse majors that are joining us for that so the whole thing should be wrapping up by about 2 30. so first we're going to hear from the dean and then we'll watch the mini lessons and if you think of any questions as you watch the lessons you can feel free to type them into the q a or just jot them down and you'll be able to ask them when we move to the live q a portion all right so here we go hello i'm lisa gromlick i'm dean of the college of the environment at the university of washington welcome to the virtual visit days so i'm a proud husky i'm an alumni i grew up in the midwest and went to undergraduate colleges in the midwest but i came to uw for graduate school and there were lots of choices out there but uw stood out way back when as a place where as a student i quickly learned that i came first and that i had the ability to define my passion and to pursue it with the best faculty on the planet i'm actually not kidding about the faculty part we are the largest college of its kind in the nation and our faculty are incredible and i'll tell you a secret about them they're actually also amazingly kind and they love to interact with undergraduates and you're going to get a chance to meet a couple of them very soon so i'm the dean i'm in charge of all the learning the research and the public education and i do this because i am passionate about the science both for the joy simply of discovering more and more about how the planet works but also by bringing our best scientific tools to address our most challenging problems if it's climate change or conservation or how do we become safe from hazards like earthquakes or tsunamis or how will we feed the world's growing population that is the kind of work we do here so thank you for spending time with us i know you're prospective students you're coming out of high school maybe a gap year you're coming from another college we also have your families with us thank you so much for your interest in our college these virtual visit days are meant to give you a taste of the college of the environment you'll get a chance to meet faculty you'll get a chance to virtually visit labs and classrooms on campus and connect with the staff and current students who will answer your questions beyond this one hour event we hope you'll continue to connect with us to learn more and in closing i'm going to tell you a little bit about our how we do the work of the college what is our mission in teaching philosophy we believe in immersive learning we believe people learn best by doing things so we in all of our classes we seek to have you try out skills we seek to connect you with the kind of skills that will give you a leg up in the real world of professional work in these fields we're hands-on we're solutions based and we have lots and lots of choices because did i mention we're the largest college of its kind in the country um but i want to say a bit about size um when you come to uw you are at a very large and prestigious university it's very large but when you're in the college of the environment you're with a couple thousand students if you think about it that's about the size of a small college private college and so it's the kind of place where faculty and staff will know you by name we know that when you are connected personally to your college it makes a difference in your happiness it makes a difference in your productivity and it absolutely makes a difference in your future success so once again thank you for joining us enjoy the virtual tour and i hope you stay in touch bye bye hi everyone my name is anthony di chiara i use he him or his as pronouns and i'm a professor of bioresource science in engineering in the school of environmental and forest sciences in the college of the environment at the university of washington typically you can find me doing research on renewable and multifunctional composites for various applications ranging from wearable electronics to sensors and water cleanup today i'm in my office and i will start by sharing a story that i tell all of the new entering bio-resource science and engineering students this story is about tales of the damascus blade so in the middle east in the middle age european knights were sent to middle east to retrieve religious artifact and in battle they encountered soldiers with uh those kind of like super magical swords because they were defeated in battle so many times and for those of them who made their way back to europe they told those stories and they told the stories or the tales of that legendary sword that carried magical powers and so they claimed that when they were fighting the soldiers carrying that sword they claimed that the sword could bend without breaking they claimed that the sword could pierce through their armor and shields because it was stronger yet it was still very lightweight so that the soldiers could end all the sword with a very high agility and dexterity and then yet again they could fight for a long time but that sword will never lose sharpness and they believe that that's all that's those magical powers because of that kind of mystical patterns wavy patterns that you can see on the surface and it's only a couple of years later that people have studied the properties of the steel and they realize that this is actually a very high performance steel and that's the damascus steel now there is a big mystery about why is it so good and how it was made and for so many years people some of the most famous people and companies put a lot of resources to try to understand how that steel or those swords were made and tried to reproduce it but you couldn't replicate it until very recently so how it was made so it's pretty simple to make steel you have to mix iron with some carbon and so here they didn't at the time didn't necessarily understood what they were making but they were mixing iron uh from uh some rocks that they could find around and they have to heat it up so they put the iron in a crucible and they use biomass like plants or wood that they found locally to heat up and to burn the whole mixture and after some processing they ended up with that steel but why this steel is much better than any other steel so until very recently a german group they used a very powerful microscope and they found carbon nanotubes inside of the damascus blades and carbon nanotubes this was a surprise because carbon nanotubes are thought to be discovered only in the early 2000s so people were puzzled carbon nanotubes are very very tiny nanomaterials with the best properties that you can find out there so there are artificial materials made by men you don't find them in nature and yet they have the best mechanical strengths and some of the highest electrical conductivity that you can find and what's very interesting about them is when you add them to sort of composites or steel or alloy they will act as reinforcing agent and they will basically transfer some of their great mechanical characteristics to the material so that's how the damascus blade was so much better than the ancient armoring shield all right so somehow ancient blacksmiths were able to figure out a way to synthesize the nanomaterials from the biomass and that actually happened because in the middle east they were growing biomass in a soil with quite a high level of minerals so inorganic materials and some of those inorganic materials like nickel or iron for example as you heat them up they will segregate and create some particles so usually you have very small amount of minerals in plants but that soil where they were making the damascus the blade in the damascus steel was very rich of minerals and so when they heat it up those minerals will segregate into particles and those particles become catalysis of the reaction of nanotubes carbon nanotubes and this is how they ended up getting carbon nanotubes into their steel probably without even knowing it but ended up with a much better still quality and so i feel that this story is a very good uh illustration of what the bioreal science and engineering is all about our goal is to produce in a sustainable fashion fuels chemicals and materials from renewable resources so in other words we want to utilize biomass and waste because we don't want to compete with food to make innovative products and high value products all right so with that being said uh because i've introduced paper as probably the most popular biomaterials out there let's talk about how paper is made because one of the classes i teach is basically a lab class where you get to make paper um on an actual paper machine and i'll show you that in a second so paper is made where you first have to pulp your wood or your biomass okay so here i show examples of wood but you will see that for us we use other agricultural residue or waste materials so you have two ways of pulping you could basically grind the wood into a small small sections until you get fibers and pump or you can use chemical treatments to basically remove the lignin that basically acts as a glue within the wood so if you remove the ligand you kind of exfoliate those tiny fibers so you have those two processes to make the pulp and you can add as many fillers or additives as you want in the process then you need to screen and remove the impurities and separate the good material from the rejects and you run that through a paper machine the paper machine will first act as a filter because you will have your slurry of fibers dispersed in water and you will slowly remove the water through different steps the first step is a gravity fat filtration so you will remove most of the water from that step and a fibrous network or a mat will form and then you will slowly remove gradually remove more and more water as you go so using pressing to remove the water and then using heaters at fairly high temperature to remove water by evaporation when the paper is finally formed then you can process it you can coat the paper or you can slice it and then finally ship the paper and that's what we will see uh when we'll visit the lab so i've talked about the lab so let's wear your ppe and let's go and take a look at the pilot scale paper machine first and then i will also show you the tabby certified testing lab i hope you enjoyed the tour and see you later so here we are in the pilot scale paper machine the woolen fair laboratory where you will do your practice of graduate experiments and since we've talked about paper you will learn about how we make paper in the modern way but we're not just making paper from trees or wood chips because that's not really sustainable we prefer to use agricultural residue for inviting species so like this this is sugarcane for gas that would otherwise be a waste so we will turn that into paper or some native species here which is arundo donuts it looks like a bamboo so you will have to first grind that material into a fibrous type of malt which basically looks like this then you will exfoliate those tiny fibers and make a slurry you will place it into those white tanks over there so you can see we'll have to make a lot of it but we had a lot of materials because we start with the waste and then we have a system of pumps that will bring your slurry onto this paper machine and you can see over there the wire so the white line here is a wire where filtration occurs where we basically remove most of the water from the the paper from the slurry and that's how the mat is forming and so the next step is to remove most of the water from that mat that wet mat we have the press and sort of a heating system to remove most of the water from the paper and eventually we get those type of sustainable papers so this one is a student project made a couple months ago where they made and they used a wig straw to make a sort of a cardboard sustainable packaging paper braid and this one is a writing grade where they had dyed purple because it's utep and to cycle back with what i said about the carbon nanotubes you know now we can make carbon nanotubes from sustainable materials as well we can also include those carbon nanotubes as additives in paper like this the paper is going to turn black because of the carbon nanotubes but this we call it a smart paper this is because it's electrically conductive and we can use that property to make very powerful sensors so this is actually one of the most sensitive water sensor in the world it's so sensitive that it can detect water molecules even from the humidity in the air so students are making a mask where they fit a little piece of this paper into a mask and that mask can now detect your breathing when you're running when you're walking uh in different activities in your lady life we can measure how you breathe in and breathe out because when you're breathing you change the humidity level within the mask so those are the type of projects that you will get to do in the bioreaction science engineering program and then we'll see that after you make this paper i'll show you the lab where you can test the properties of those different types of paper so now that you've made some renewable materials either paper from the pilot scale paper machine it's all downstairs or some more of a bench scale paper design where you're going to get those sort of hand sheets or other types of materials could be those pots for example made out of renewable pulp from agricultural residue any types of renewable material ends up in this lab for testing and so you can see the different instrumentation that we have available so right behind me here is a tensile machine but we also have a lot of other ways to measure and analyze the mechanical properties of the materials and then the two white instruments over there on that bench far away are instruments that allow us to measure the optical properties and the appearance of the materials that we are making so you will be spending a whole lot of time in this lab and you're not here with me to feel how warm it is in this lab but this lab is actually temperature and humidity control for a reason that it needs to be tested under very specific and rigorous conditions because this lab is certified by tappy standards which means that we can actually test materials papers and composites for industrial partners so i hope that this is a good illustration of what you will be doing in the virus science and engineering program you will for sure get your hands dirty in the lab with a lot of enzyme experimentation and practice on top of your theoretical lectures i hope to see you soon and i'm looking forward to your questions see you hello i am professor heidi goff i use the pronouns she and her i am a professor in the bio resource science and engineering major in the school of the environment at the university of washington typically you find me doing research on cleaning water or teaching the introduction to bioresource science and engineering course or industrial wastewater treatment and reduction today we're going to be at two different locations a remote classroom and an outdoor research lab for wastewater treatment in the background you see wink and water hall where often our lectures occur our lecture today is about the critical considerations in water industry and especially about how we can make sustainable products from plant materials so i'm going to show you how critical examination of the sources uses treatment and reuse of water in industry can help us reduce the water footprint and increase the final environmental sustainability of products so first what we want to do is consider a holistic view often you think of products within a box within the factory but we also want to consider what's going in and coming out of this factory so we have our raw materials but we also have energy and we have water we have a lot of water the bioeconomy and the pulp and paper industries need a lot of water to ensure that their final product meets all the expectations and quality assurance expected from that product we don't want our paper products coming out and looking at our piece of paper and finding there's gaps and holes in it we want a nice smooth piece of paper that can go through a copying machine and come out the other side and not jam things up and create waste we want to be able to use every single piece of paper similarly pulps made for surgical masks have to have a great uniformity to make sure that there's no spots available that everything is the same across there so the q a can see this final product is really really important and we can't do that without water on this side so what else do we have coming out of the final end we have solid waste sludges products that didn't work out and we have waste water we also have some things leaving the factory as air flows some of which are pollutants and then inside the factory there's still a lot going on that's impacting what does this look like how much of this did we need how much of that did we need and how all of these work together so for example water has been recycled within industry for a very long time water costs money so facilities want to reuse that water whenever they can so there's actually an internal water loop but also an internal energy loop here inside this plate when we consider all of this together and we can optimize all this we can minimize this and minimize this but today i also want to look a little bit closer at this because no matter what we do to minimize some of this is still going to occur we need to make sure that this can be treated in a way so that when it's released into the environment it remains safe so we're also then going to extend our factory line to include this because this is going to happen right on the site there's something pretty amazing that even if we did let this wastewater go straight out into a river that that waste would eventually disappear if we put the waste water into a river into the river there are naturally occurring bacteria in this water that can convert the pollutants here they actually will consume this as the food for the bacteria and make the potions disappear but the problem is if we do this in the river it makes the river all mucked up in the process so instead of doing this step in the river what if we brought these bacteria into a tank that's located within our factory that's exactly what we've been doing for hundreds of years it's converting from the river into a tank we put those same bacteria in here naturally occurring bacteria we put our waste water in these bacteria eat that wastewater all of the foods and then we can discharge clean water to do this process in the factory takes all of the chemistry physics calculus and microbiology knowledge of the engineers that are in charge of designing and operating the system but we can do something more interesting than this as well and that's what i'm going to show you at the field site water's precious so when we take wastewater and just throw it away we're wasting a valuable resource at the university of washington we're studying new ways to reuse and make our waste water safe again remember those bacteria that lived in the tank and in the water they also live in the soil so what if we could run our waste water through soil collect clean water out of the bottom and at the same time grow crops for turning into bioenergy hi abby hi hi i'm abigail cargill i use she her pronouns and i'm a graduate student in the school of environmental and forest sciences in the college of the environment at the university of washington you can find me either in the lab or here working with these trees i study the soil bacteria and what they're doing with in the trees and how they can be used to clean wastewater i take samples like this and bring them back to the lab for analysis what about the trees on top oh these trees are being grown as a bio energy crop so what we do is we compass them basically take a pair of scissors go right through the tree we take the top part and make it into a bunch of really cool chemicals and then the bottom part stays in the ground and it'll grow a new tree within a couple of years wow that's really great thanks abby we've seen how a holistic approach can both reduce the water footprint of industry while also producing sustainable products from plant materials but that's not the only thing you learn about in bio resource science and engineering you'll also learn how to do the chemistry to turn these trees into valuable products and how changing one step in a process can actually change the entire system i can't wait to talk to you and hear all about your other question all right well i hope you all enjoyed seeing some of our teaching and research spaces on campus and now anthony and heidi and abby are available to answer your any questions you might have we answered a couple of them that came up during while you were watching those mini lessons but feel free to type new questions using that q and a feature at the bottom of your screen there please don't share any personal student information as part of your questions just because everyone here can see all of the questions you can address your questions to a specific person if you want or you can just leave them open and we'll just answer them as appropriate this part of the q a session will end at about 2 p.m and then we'll move over to the student panel part of the q a so go ahead and start typing your questions into the q a box and i'm going to hand it over to anthony and heidi and abby is here as well maybe you guys want to review some of the questions that came up during the video just to share those with everyone yeah sure so one of the first question was uh what are the materials use carbon nanotubes in prison times so carbonated tubes because of their extraordinary properties in terms of electrical conductivity or mechanical strengths they can be used in a lot of very a lot of applications so right now if you want to buy a product on the market that has carbon nanotubes you can buy like skis or bicycles are pretty fancy you can find carbon nanotubes in airplanes uh so like some of the latest bowing airplanes and airbus they use carbon nanotubes because they make the material lighter and stronger and it's also electrically conductive so as you may know every airplanes in the life of an airplane will be struck by lightnings a couple of times so the airplane needs to be electrically conductive to basically look like a furry cage and so that's a problem when you use plastics or composites most of them are insulating so they need to reinforce the plastics with electrical materials and so carbon nanotubes can help with electrical properties and mechanical properties and then sensors like transistors uh like a horrible device like the mask i was talking about we are developing uh water leak detection as well so there's a really a lot of uh of applications possible and there are only a few of them that are commercially available right now well thanks anthony and actually abby i'm going to jump ahead to a question that came in for you what was the thing that you were holding to take the samples in the video yeah um so that was a soil coring device um and i use it to take samples of soil either at different depths so when i stuck it in horizontal like that um that's to take samples for different depths as things are moving through our system to see how they're being processed um and you can also just use it to take samples from the top and kind of do the same thing um so i can take that back to the lab then analyze what bacteria are present and see if there's different bacteria at different levels and how that might be affected by the pollutants that we're treating cool and that actually ties into one of the questions that came up during the video is what are the pollutants that are in the waste water sure i can yeah thanks avi i can answer that question so the things that end up in the waste water from a pulp and paper facility or from a biorefinery are just the residuals of what was originally in the um sample so for example if you're in a pulp mill you're going to end up with lignin tannins some of those words probably don't mean a lot to you but maybe tannins is something that some people have heard of um so these are large complex organic molecules that are naturally part of the tree but that we don't necessarily use in the the paper or the end product and so some of that ends up in the waste water anthony during his lecture mentioned adding additives and coatings to the paper to make special products a little bit of that's also going to end up in the waste water so those are the things that we're removing they're just large organic molecules that the bacteria love to eat we just want to make sure they eat it in the right place not in the river but before we put it in the river and then another related question that came up what bacteria are present in the samples so i guess when abby's checking it are the is there still bacteria or how does that work abby do you want to feel that one yeah sure um that is a that's basically the question that i'm trying to answer with my entire phd project um but generally there's a couple different types of bacteria that are really common in the soil um and basically the proportions of those bacteria will change based on what we're feeding into the system so um we are feeding it some of those chemicals from like a pulp and paper mill and then some other chemicals from industry and we just want to see how the different types of bacteria that are there will respond to those chemicals okay and then a question about the trees so the trees that filter that waste water are they any type of tree or are they special trees sure i can feel that question because it's a little bit broader you could use any kind of tree there's a facility in idaho that's using douglas for right now for municipal wastewater what we're researching is poplar trees and the reason we're using poplar trees is they grow very quickly um as abby mentioned we can compass them we can cut them at the base without just um without disturbing the roots you can't do that with a douglas fir if you cut down a douglas for the roots dye so this means we can harvest the tree without disturbing the roots so we like that for this system and poplar trees are really well studied for biorefineries so for turning into everything from aviation diesel fuels to really cool chemicals so we're trying to combine the two not just clean the water but grow useful bio energy crop at the exact same time cool okay and then we have um another question that let's see so it is a little confusing we are college the environment we're not college engineering but um so a couple people are interested in knowing what's the difference between this major and environmental engineering and i can probably feel that one too the um yeah they might actually be interested to know that um i've actually worked with both majors on this campus at some time right now i work with this major but in a past life i worked with the environmental engineering major and that's actually my undergraduate degree it's environmental engineering so on this campus a big thing that you can see that's different between the two majors is the environmental engineering major is focused on sort of five big areas of the environment so air pollution water pollution solid waste management radiation protection and epidemiology um and they take a very big municipal look at it so when they talk about wastewater they're usually talking about um municipal wastewaters like household wastewater and what goes to the city waste water treatment plant so there's definitely overlap between the majors when it comes to understanding water but what the bsc major does that the environmental engineering major doesn't do is give you a fully and industry focus so you understand a whole industry you understand the environmental engineering portion of that industry but you also understand the processes within the facility and the products going in so it's a different view all engineering majors use a lot of the same skills but this is the one this major is the one unique one that shows you an industry focus from start to finish so that you can actually serve and in go out and serve industry whether it's one of the industries we're describing or a different industry but you're given that industry view how to help them all the way through the process if there's follow-up questions i'm happy to answer i was going to say people might be wondering because i don't actually know this either um because i didn't do my undergrad here how does it work like application wise like does everyone apply to college of engineering and then goes into college of environmental and poor sciences yeah it is a little bit confusing so the way that it works at uw if you want to be in a college of engineering major you've got to put that as your first choice on the application because they consider you if you get into uw then the engineering college of engineering will say whether or not they will accept you into college of engineering and if you don't do that right out of the gate it's very difficult if not impossible to get into college of engineering majors so bsc is a little bit different we're a capacity constrained major so you can apply even if you didn't apply to the college of engineering um you can apply to it later it's about a 75 um acceptance rate it and that varies a little bit um and our students will be able to talk to you also about people get into that major in different ways and so we have two um students that you can talk about and we'll find out how they got into the major but it is different so college of engineering is specific because they're doing direct to college admissions whereas college of engineering sorry college of environment we don't do that but you still do have to apply to the bsc major so um this is an interesting question so when you're in the forest and if you see waste water spray area do not enter do you guys know what that mean is it pulp waste water or some other waste water so i've actually never been someplace i've seen this but i can take an educated guess okay so pulp wastewater isn't typically treated this way at least not in that in the pacific northwest in the southeast that could be different and definitely some place like australia um where water is much in in much shorter supply they might be doing that but normally it's going to be municipal water or municipal biosolids being applied to that site and then you'd usually rotate through like you you would apply it and then you'd let the site rest and then you'd apply it and you let it rest so that's probably what you're saying okay and then um anthony do you want to talk maybe a little bit about employers or careers that bse students go on to do yeah and so i will also follow up with the difference uh with other uh engineering majors like the environmental engineering um so in the bsc like id said uh you will learn about the whole industry uh pulp and paper industry but you will also learn uh things related to life cycle assessment methods to actually conduct life cycle assessment and techno economic assessments so it's actually closer to like a process type engineering uh where you will be able to look at a process to optimize a process and to make it as sustainable as possible and then on top of that you will also have some notions and concepts about material science because the different products you're developing you need to know how to characterize them so it's a very versatile major which basically you borrow some concepts from material science from environmental engineering from chemical engineering and actually when you look at the faculty who are teaching those classes uh i have a background in material science and engineering and nanotechnology heidi is from environmental engineering and we have professors from chemical engineering so it's a very diverse background and so that will also be reflected in the type of employers they will hire you so of course there will be a large majority in the pulp and paper industry and we actually have uh we're partners with the washington pop and paper foundation with a lot of industries uh more than 80 industries probably over 100 now uh partnering with us and they will uh take students for internships and they will offer you job opportunities uh they are not only pulp and paper people it could be like a chemical company so like you could also have starbucks boeing amazon uh we have alumni uh in uh consulting firms as well uh in chemical firms basf for example so all of those big players who care about sustainability more and more then they will hire our students all right and then a couple more questions about the application process so you can apply um you can list this major on your uw application um and then you can apply during your freshman year if you don't get into the major the first time you could play again um you would want to you know be in touch with the departmental advisors and talk about your application and it's a i would say it's a matter of timing like if you play in your freshman year and don't get in the first time you can probably reapply if you're a junior and you apply and you don't get in maybe the timing is a little bit different but certainly yes so hopefully that answers that cool um what kinds of courses do majors take so you guys didn't both introduce some introductory ones but what else are the majors doing do you want to start with some of your introductions for us yeah sure um because i teach the introductory class um which is meant to give the big picture umbrella view of um sort of the the first part of that lecture in fact i i think at least one of the students that you'll see in the student panel probably recognize the first part of that lecture because it's right out of my notes for the first day in that class where we start thinking about not just how do i do a process but where do the materials come from we even step back even further and talk about sustainable forestry other types of materials where where does all that come from and putting it together as a big picture students go on at the same time and abby has also taken the course the biorefinery chemical processing course where you get to use the steam gun yeah you get to like blast the cell lignocellulosic materials apart and get down to their little sugar content because it's that cool sugar molecules that are in the the trees or in the other kinds of fibers that you're using to turn into cool chemicals so they take that class i alluded to the process engineering class at the end of my lecture sub segment because like we said you can learn about each of these processes separately and that's what a lot of other engineering majors do they learn about one chunk but it's like dialing it in right if you um change one part of one process it's gonna change everything else so that's usually winter quarter senior year you get um that class where you get to actually calculate hey if i change this a little bit what happens over here what happens over here can be a lot of fun um anything anthony want to add some about the classes that you teach yeah sure so in in general i would say the entry level classes will be more theoretical so you'll be mostly in a classroom you will have some visits uh of labs and of some industries uh but uh you will also take some of the theory so theory could be in chemistry of biomass chemists you'll learn about cellulose you will learn about lignin and you will learn about my cellulose so it's a pretty much like organic chemistry but it's more applied to biomass you also have some math and statistical classes at the same time and then as you move on uh the classes will look more like a project based classes where you will spend more and more time in the lab working as a team to actually produce things and to answer some solutions some of my class so the my 200 level class we have some labs where you'll be making papers and testing papers uh you'll be making uh different types of products as the same time as you're learning about the theory about why is paper forming why is it strong and then as you move on you will get to use the paper machine you'll get to use uh other types of equipments and then you will couple your process of making papers or different other products you can make bioethanol as well and you'll couple that knowledge with models to actually assess the life cycle assessment of techno economic assessment and so all of those classes in your senior year will actually kind of like combine together to make a big project and that's also part of our capstone project which is like the the final goal of the program where you get to do a real sustainable project that involves like the creation of a new product and establishing a new process and evaluating its sustainability and its economic viability you're muted barbara heidi i think maybe you might be the best one to answer this next question about so for this particular major restoring ecosystems coral reefs cleaning up oil spills would those be applicable kind of topics so that's a really interesting question because honestly the the scenarios that have been put out there are really big problems right that um we call them what the wicked problems these are the big wicked problems and you never are just like one type of engineer or one type of scientist goes out and tackles these things these are teamwork and somebody from bse could definitely be a part of the team going out and working on one of these especially for the oil spills i'm thinking of some of the materials that anthony is making um in his lab and some of these materials are specific for um sensing things in the environment he has his smart uh see anthony now i'm gonna like say things probably not completely accurate you're better at it than me but he's got his paper that can sense oil um water spills um i've seen other people using uh nanotubes um to specifically help absorb oil contaminants or to sense them along the way so even if you're not i mean even if it's not the industrial wastewater type approach that i presented um even other professors the thing skills that everyone's learning goes towards solving these big wicked problems altogether um restoring ecosystems how would bsc work and that one i would want to think more about which ecosystem and why does it need to be restored before i fully answered that question if that makes sense i can head a little bit about the oil spill so yes uh you're right heidi we are using our sensors in a way to detect either oil spills or water spills water leaks in different facilities or municipalities but we also made um aero gels that we can change their chemistry so they're all made from wood or from waste paper for example and then you end up with sort of a sponge material and that sponge material becomes uh hydrophobic so it doesn't like the water but it likes the oil very much and we can use that and so i have actually a lab in one of my classes where students get to create those foams and then test if they can absorb the oil and not absorb so much water so we look at the efficiency of the oil cleanup at the lab level but yes that could be applicable to more like a real life application very cool all right so another question about environmental engineering and then if you start out in environmental engineering in the college of engineering and you're not liking it could you switch to bioresource science and engineering yes you can and it's not uncommon that we get students from the college of engineering coming to bsc um so it's that's the easier way to go you it's going to be again much more difficult if you start out not in the college of engineering and try to go that way into the college of engineering but come on over to us yep good to go all right so i'm going to mark that and i could add to that too you're not going to get off track if you switch if you're really if you're it entering the university and planning to spend four years there in your first year as long as you're targeting your classes towards being an engineer so you're taking your chemistry and you're taking your calculus and you're getting ready to take your physics you're pretty much set for any engineering all engineering fields have a core knowledge and that's what is being established is those engineering fundamentals core knowledge in that first year so it does um make it easier for switching so you're not like suddenly having to take a fifth year because you're off track you're still on track okay and then we uw is a big r1 institution lots of research going on so within bse are there opportunities to work with professors or do research in lab but then in addition to classes i'm assuming what they're asking about is undergrad research outside of classes yes i can start uh yeah for sure uh we always take and we're very happy to take undergraduate uh students for research and they are involved with the research pretty closely and so you have opportunities to do research for credits or you can also get paid to do research as well depending on the project uh so in my lab for example example uh every year i take between uh five to eight students undergraduate students they'll be paired with graduate students and they will work on projects uh specific projects and those projects uh involve sometimes the helping graduate students for the phd but more often than not they involve practical projects that we have linked with the industry so for example when i mentioned a smart paper where it's basically making a paper with carbon nanotubes that can detect the presence of water so that we have undergraduate students making the paper and because we actually ship the paper to cern over in europe so you know cern is the big particle accelerator and they have huge problems with leak detection and so they uh recently uh passed an order for for from us to uh order like a couple hundred meters of paper to cover their uh water cooling system that are underground and so we currently hired with that many couple undergrad students to work and produce the paper for them and there are other projects that are maybe linked to the capstone their other project may be linked to specific um demand from like amazon for example with specific packaging uh uh research interest and there are other uh projects more like tied to water cleanup in id's lab and maybe you can talk about yeah sure we also have undergraduates always active in our lab we also encourage the undergraduates who work on our lab to apply for the mary gates fellowship which is a fellowships only available to university of washington undergraduate students and it helps them give them a little bit extra money so if they have a cool idea that they want to pursue on their own and maybe it's not covered by for example one of the industry projects that anthony was talking about but they really want to do it that's a way they can actually get their own money to do that a lot of the undergrads in addition to the for credit option we often in our lab look for work-study students so if you're a financial a student who's using financial aid don't think that that means you can't do research in the lab because we can make those opportunities tie into your financial aid package you don't just work in the cafeteria when you work study you can come work in a lab as a work study student too and i know abby's probably excited well actually we have an undergraduate student starting today i was actually just looking at my clock her first day is right this minute in the lab she's meeting one of the other people there since i'm here um who's going to be working with abby really soon so yeah um always undergrads in the lab and abby i think there's a question specific for you so abby why did you decide to go to grad school cool yeah um so i i have a background in microbiology um and i did my undergrad and finish last year um and the reason i wanted to go to grad school is basically so that i can be like be like heidi like be the head of a project be the one coming up with ideas um because often in more so in life biological sciences than in engineering um you kind of can't run your own projects with just a bachelor's degree so yeah i'm here to get um my phd and then probably go on either to do work in academia or um some like bio remediation work for maybe private companies so that's kind of where like that restoring ecosystems and stuff comes in um so yeah if that's something you're interested in you can get that background here because you know i'm here and that's what i want to do cool all right and how about do very many students do study abroad in bse are there specific bsc study abroad or so i run a study abroad program every other year we go to jordan myself and another bsc faculty or the lead faculty on that program we go to jordan and study water in a dry climate and we visit one of their forests which even the students there didn't know they had a forest but we go and visit their forest and talk about the influence of forests on clean water so it doesn't focus so much on the bioproducts side but it focuses on understanding the many connections among water and water engineering so it's a engineering credit so it counts as for the bsc major it would count as your there's a i can't think of what the category is called but there's like you have to have a certain number of other engineering credits and so it counts there um and for those who have dug into the curriculum a little bit and know that you need a diversity credit it also counts as your diversity credit um because uh we do an immersive uh like you're with your peers your jordanian um counterpart peers the whole time we're there so we also have diversity portions to it there's also plenty of other study abroad options that are related to engineering so it might not be specific to the major but i think it's a great way to do your breadth of engineering is through study abroad um because engineers have to work in a global context and um cross-cultural competency is actually one of the the core learning objectives for engineers and there's no better way to learn about cross-cultural competency than to going someplace else awesome all right so the the next question that we have i think is actually going to be a really perfect segue for us to switch from the faculty panel um to our student panel if that's all right so i think we'll go ahead and wrap it up with anthony and heidi and abby you guys rocked it those videos were awesome so thank you so much and if you guys um if anyone wants to fire off one last question for anthony or heidi or abby you can go ahead and do that but i think at this point what we'll do is we will bring in our students to answer club questions how to find friends student life kind of questions so thank you anthony heidi and abby great job all right so the first thing we'll do is introduce you because you have introduced you to these three new faces so ryan you want to go first all right hey i'm ryan i am a junior currently in the bio resource science and engineering program and uh yeah he him pronouns there you go hi i'm jenna i use she her pronouns and i am currently a senior in environmental studies but fun fact i actually started out in civil and engineering so yeah i'm gregory i use he him pronouns i'm also a junior in bsc with ryan oh yeah all right and so jenna can talk to you about getting accepted into college of engineering and then saying i'm going elsewhere um and then gregory and ryan can probably answer best these questions about the clubs within bse and how you find friends yeah so getting accepted into engineering has changed a little bit since i first got here since i am now a rising senior but basically when i got here you got accepted into the engineering major that you wanted to be a part of um now that's changed a little bit now you get accepted into engineering if you're accepted as an incoming freshman and then you have to apply to this distinct major that you want um but it's an interesting challenge kind of figuring out that you want to leave engineering for a different major so if i were to leave civil engineering for example and go into bsc i would have been in a very comfortable space continuing my studies but for me i did a complete 360. i really wanted to go into the social aspect of things so i switched into environmental studies which is going from hard science a bs to more social issues and going into a ba um and that took a lot of support from my family and talking to a bunch of advisors but it's really freeing to know that you have time in your undergrad to kind of experiment in different majors and to not be locked into one so yeah i was wondering if i could uh touch up on that because i actually had kind of a similar experience so for me i have actually experience with the way the college environment or college of engineering is currently working because when i applied to uw i actually put engineering undeclared as my first choice and then i put bse as like my second choice so i applied to both of them and when i got into uw i got accepted into the college of engineering and the way it works is everybody their first year is uh engineering undeclared and you kind of go through these introduction courses to all the different types of engineering and then eventually towards the end of the year you're going to start applying to your major so you'll start applying to environmental engineering aerospace and then you'll figure out after that if you're going to get in for me i also applied to the bse program and then once i got in i um started taking some of those classes and i just figured that bc was where i fit in and so i just quit the college of engineering but it's definitely an option to like get into the college of engineering first and take those introduction classes about all of the different types of engineering and then from there you can kind of get an idea as to what you might be interested in so that was just my experience and how i decided cool gregory do you want to talk about the clubs because you're are you an officer in one of the clubs yeah i can start and then i'll probably quickly transition it to ryan but ryan and i are both on the officers for the student club or it's called tappy uh and someone was asking a question what does tapi stand for earlier so this is the student chapter of the technical association of the pulp and paper industry so lots of different majors have clubs like this mechanical engineering has a american society of mechanical engineers all that it's a social club for bsc but it coordinates events like visiting wastewater treatment plants or ryan can talk more about the events that they're that they put on but most bse students are in it and it's a way to just meet other bse students and faculty yeah and we we put on lots of different events for uh for example um fall quarter is usually when we're going through uh recruitment season like um when we're all going and trying to search for uh internships at different companies and so right before that uh the recruitment season starts we'll hold like a resume cafe where we'll get all of the students and faculty together and the students will bring their resumes and the faculty and some of the upperclassmen will help them like kind of refine their resumes in preparation for the recruitment season and then tapi also organizes um info sessions with a whole bunch of different companies usually from wppf the washington pulp and paper foundation so we'll have companies like georgia pacific come in or west rock and they'll basically have these like 30 minute info sessions about like what their company is and then you'll be able to ask questions about it and usually the day after um you can like hand them their your resume and like cover letter and then they'll schedule some interviews for you so that's kind of what tapi kind of organizes for the whole month of october is that all of these different companies come in and it's just basically a huge networking opportunity uh but there's other things we put on as well for example we'll do some fundraising events uh like in the december towards winter time we'll uh actually make some holiday paper um so some like wrapping paper uh we'll go down in the labs we'll dye it you know red and green and we'll uh make a whole bunch of these rolls and then we also have another fundraising event um which is a holiday tree sale which we kind of team up with a whole bunch of other environmental um majors and clubs where we'll just uh have this huge holiday tree sale we have a connection down by like olympia that sells us these trees for pretty cheap and we'll bring them up and we'll um sell them to people in the seattle area and uh we'll also sell our wrapping paper at that too and then kind of the last big thing i'll talk about is um we use those funds like those uh what we get from the fundraising and we'll send students on trips for example every year we try to send some students to the student tapi summit which uh this last year was held in atlanta and so we'll um help cover a majority of the cost for the students to fly down there and um stay in a hotel and they'll be able to go to this huge conference where a whole bunch of companies are at and um it's just a really great learning experience i haven't had the ability to go there yet but it's uh from the students i've heard that go there like it's a great networking opportunity to go to places like that so yeah and it's and the club's just a great place to get together and socialize with the students every once in a while we'll have barbecue stuff like that but um that's kind of what tapi is about cool and i forgot to mention for participants you can upvote questions so we just got a couple upvoted here so um top of the heap here so what made you guys want to switch from engineering what about bioresource pulled you in yeah so i guess i'll start and then ryan can go so i applied directly to uh bioresource science and engineering but it was still kind of like a what about bse pulled me in because i was debating between applying to engineering or applying to bsc and for me it came down to that bsc was in the college of the environment and i really wanted that community because that was my focus first and foremost was the environment and sustainability and engineering was an interest of mine so i combined those both into bse um pulling away from engineering i think it's like when i was applying i didn't exactly know what i wanted to do so it was like well environmental engineering is cool but it has some parts that i'm not really interested in like a lot of bridge construction and concrete and like that's great but that's not what i was interested in so it's like what overlaps the most with what i'm interested in so i just kind of landed on bsc so i guess i can go next so originally like when i was back in your guys position and searching for colleges to go to i was really searching for an environmental engineering major i knew i wanted to do kind of engineering and i knew i wanted to do something that would help the environment so i'm like i suppose that means i'm gonna go search for an environmental engineering major but then i actually came to like what would be the physical version of this event a couple years ago and i learned about the bsc major and it kind of really struck a chord with me because it seemed like it was a a bit more process based and a bit more like chemistry based and i was just a bit i am uh i really enjoy chemistry and so i kind of like learning the chemistry behind these sort of things and so that's kind of what attracted me to bac and it was the fact that we're just creating a whole bunch of different products from resources we can use in our environment and that was what i was really interested in especially because one of my main interests was biofuel and biofuel is one of the major products that we kind of look into in our major so that's what pulled me to bsc okay thanks you guys um ryan what year are you again sorry nbsc i'm junior you're a junior okay so you guys have a little bit of time before you got to figure out the career thing but do you guys know what you want to do for careers jenna knows jen is graduating soon well you have another year yeah i have another year um but what i really want to do is to get my masters in public health specifically in environmental health and also a concurrent degree in journalism because i'm really interested in science communication right now and i think it's very valuable in like the time that we're in and i can also real quick touch on is it better to get a ba or a bs because that's a big conflict i had within me when i was switching from engineering to environmental studies and i feel like a lot of people put pressure on getting a bachelor's of science because it's like oh it's scientific it seems so much harder than doing something arts related but realistically environment is such an field that each of these different items whether it's a ba or bs plays into it in a very important way and you're gonna um you're gonna come across things like science if you're getting a ba or other like communications issues if you're getting a bs so i wouldn't put as much weight on the type of degree you're getting but whether or not you're really passionate about like what you're studying yeah and i would just add to that thank you for addressing that one too jenna one is not better than the other what you just have to think about is what your future steps are and what fits best and in in some cases it's determined by your major so for bse it's going to be a bs there isn't an option so thank you for answering that i think for about the there's a couple of the career questions and the non-profit um i'll talk about what i want to do for careers or what i'm thinking and then ryan can go as well but i think what i like about bs these there's a lot of options and i'm kind of looking at all of them right now so when you think about it if you think about what anthony was talking about the materials science side but how do we turn wood into useful products and i have a few props so like when you come on campus and you do uh the dining halls in the dorms you have these trays that are made out of pulp and this isn't tree pulp but this is like sugar cane waste and especially now i'm sure you've noticed as you're doing all of this uh food delivery and food takeout at least for me every time it comes it's in this awful styrofoam container and it makes you really feel bad about doing it but right now there's no other option but you think wow this is really terrible um so things like alternatives to plastic is what really motivates me so i have like i live in the avocado capital of the world in southern california right now and there are these spoons and straws made from the pits of avocados so if you think about this is a company in mexico they have a lot of avocado pits that they would just throw away because you don't need them after you make the avocado and they turn them into biopolymers to make into these biodegradable spoons so you kind of minimizing plastic is what motivates me um and ryan can go ahead i think he's more interested in the biofuels side of it yeah i'm definitely more interested in the the biofuel side kind of i like the idea of trying to figure out a way to create renewable energy and so that's kind of what attracted me to biofuels but definitely like greg and like anthony kind of explained there's lots of different paths you can take with the bsc major another path i might be considering is um i'm taking uh microeconomics class right now this summer and it's kind of really intriguing me and so i'm thinking maybe i'll go to grad school maybe i'll study economics a bit and i could be like an environmental econo economist or i could take the path and i could go into industry and i could work in a biorefinery and i could work my way up into management from there in other words there's a lot of different paths you can take you're getting you're basically when you're taking bsc you're getting this engineering major and you're getting kind of this background information but you can definitely take it into a lot of different places especially if you want to go get a masters if you figure out there's a specific area that you're really interested in you can go and get a master's degree and you can go study that area further so but yeah for at least me for the types of careers i could want the two paths that i'm kind of looking at right now or either being like an environmental economist or maybe working in a biorefinery and working my way up into management from there cool and for now we'll come back to the non-profit question but you guys talk about the opportunities at uw to do entrepreneurial type things like we have there's the campus sustainability fund there's the environmental innovation challenge that bse students have been involved in so i think this relates to the question about if you're interested in being low zero or waste is this a good major there's a lot of opportunities i feel like to do to to try to get funding to do some other things you guys are talking about do you want to talk about that a little bit i think so yeah so um it depends on like there's a lot of sides to being low and zero waste so there's the side of well first we need the science that can make these products that aren't made out of plastic so if the science is there to make these products out of like sugar cane plastic and things like that that will biodegrade and that's great and that's the first step is having the materials and then the second step is like if you're interested in being zero waste is kind of more of like what jenna's doing is the sustainability side of it and how do you get policies enacted so that we're actually using these materials because you could have all of the greatest non-plastic materials in the world but if there aren't like if there isn't motivation to use them or regulations to use them they're just going to stick with plastic so jenna's side of like kind of taking care of like the behavioral changes that need to take place with the scientific changes um it's a good combination of both and jenna can talk more about those classes yeah oh go ahead ryan no you he was talking about you so you go okay yeah um so one of the classes that is kind of one of our core classes one of our options that we can take um within the program on the environment or environmental studies is um personal choices and sustainability so within that class we talk about how our personal impact affects the world um and one of the parts is carrying around a bag of trash that you make throughout a week so people are like why are you carrying a trash bag around campus it's like to analyze how much waste i'm producing which is super weird but super fun and it makes you think a lot about your own habits um but beyond that there are a lot of opportunities like barbara mentioned the campus sustainability fund where you can apply if you're in an rso or a student-led organization um to get funding to utilize different materials say you want to use compostables at your event and you can get funding to use that so even if you are creating waste you can find a more sustainable way to go about your social gatherings if you're allowed to have them along the lines of the campus sustainability fund what i was actually going to bring up is a a project that me and greg are currently working on so you're talking about being like zero or low waste so like a project we've been working on is actually in the center for urban horticulture in um the nursery that's essentially on campus they've been using these plastic pots to be putting their plants in and stuff and they have to each time they use the pots they have to use water and bleach and like it's just something we want to kind of avoid you know avoid using plastic and avoid using a lot of water and stuff with these pots so what me and greg have been working on with our lab technician kurt honrader is we're going to get this pulping machine that essentially will allow us to create these um pulp pots that could be replacing those plastic pots on campus and we've gotten some funding for it already and we're just hoping to get that machine and be able to reduce that sort of plastic waste across campus and so if you're asking whether this major can um do that for you like you can definitely do sort of stuff like that but it really um it depends on what side you want or what you want to do with the low zero waste if you want to be the one kind of designing these sustainable products that can replace or be alternatives for like these plastics then that could definitely be um aligned with bsc major if you want to go into more policies like if you want to enact policies that help um keep the companies accountable and reduce waste then there's definitely other uh places that you can do to get that sort of education but it's all uh what you want to do essentially to reduce waste yeah and a couple just to follow on this then and we'll move on a couple years ago bse students won the the alaska airlines environmental innovation challenge so it's really cool it's housed within the school of business and they run this environmental innovation challenge every year and bse students one for bio pots which at at that point the bio pots were made using um leftover grain spent grain from breweries so that was really cool so it sounds like now you guys are evolving the bio pots project and hopefully making it on campus if you guys get the equipment you need which is really cool um okay i'm gonna move on to working at nonprofits instead of a company so you should also know that jenna and gregory are student assistants for us in the dean's office and we have a career opportunities page on our website those two run it so they see all of the opportunities so do you guys want to talk a little bit about this and ryan you can chime in too if you know if you know bse students that have worked gone to work for non-profits um if you specifically mean bse with this question it might be a little bit different but certainly college environment has lots of folks that work for nonprofits yeah so um not exactly a non-profit but not a company either there's a lot of government opportunities to get jobs with bsc so city of seattle wastewater treatment and the likes um all the way up to like the department of energy i've been looking into they have a national renewable energy laboratory that does a lot of work with algae biofuels um and chemical engineering that's in colorado in terms of actual nonprofits i think if you like added on to your degree some like environmental studies classes and things that jenna is taking i could definitely see bsc graduates working in the likes of like the sierra club um and things of that nature uh for sure yeah i most of our majors i find have a pretty good pathway into each of the different sectors whether it's private public or non-profit um you just kind of have to do a little bit of searching and it's really how you look at your degree and how it can be applied to the different situations so i kind of like to think it's in your power to make your degree match up to the job if you think you can do it and you have the qualifications then you can definitely find a job somewhere all right and then we've got one more question here so can you take courses in the major and other courses too and unrelated stuff so uw is a it's a liberal arts degree that you're going to get no matter what degree you get so you there's general education requirements that are all over campus but do you guys want to talk about some of the classes that you've done that are seemingly unrelated to your major or just really broad other topics yeah so uh with bse it's really nice they give you a suggested course planning sheet so that's saying if you want to stay on track take these classes in this quarter and these classes in that quarter um and in that regard there's not a ton of flexibility but they they schedule in flexibility for you so like here's where you have a chance to take five credits of whatever type of this credit you want whatever writing class you want things like that and that's where you kind of have the chance to go off script a bit um i took a landscape architecture class because i was actually very interested in what heidi and abby were talking about earlier with the phytoremediation and the poplar you could work with like landscape architecture firms and plant those poplar trees in public parks and things like that think of like if you're from the area you think of gasworks park and how it used to be really toxic and the soil is still every few years they come out with a study that the soil is still pretty bad um what if you could plant some of those popular trees around the park and it could actually have a measurable difference in the pollutants and the soil things like that so it's combining bse and then some more arts type classes i would definitely say with engineering majors in general especially for the first couple years the schedules are pretty rigorous and it's really hard to get around because you're going to need to take your general chemistry you need to kind of have to take your general physics and your english requirements and stuff like that so for the first year so it might not be as flexible but like uw in general requires you to get a certain amount of certain credits so like you're going to need to get a certain amount of diversity credits you're going to need to get a certain amount of arts credits and within those requirements that's where you would be able to take those kind of different classes for example vlp which is the arts credits i've taken um uw chorale so i've sung and choir for a couple quarters before because that's just something i'm interested in i i enjoy doing so essentially what i'm trying to say if um there's going to be room in your schedule for you to take those types of classes it might not be a whole bunch of room but like there's still going to be your opportunity to take those different types of classes that aren't just you know cut and dry engineering type stuff because the college kind of makes you do that because they want you to get those uh different types of classes in there yeah i'm also a strong advocate for studying abroad in the summer and going into programs that you're not in because it's totally allowed and you can do super cool things like i studied human rights in sweden which was really fun and also for the interdisciplinary honors program because you get to see professors from all different departments and it's really interesting to get to know them all right so we've got one remaining question here so college of the environment does indeed have scholarships annual scholarships that we provide and those are so if you're an out of state student yes you're eligible for those as well the college of the environment scholarships are both merit and need based so you have to have financial need as determined by the office of financial and student whatever you know the finance people um so as long as you meet those requirements then yes we open up the application in winter ever every year for the following year there are so there's a bunch of different tiers to scholarship so the purple and gold is a university level um scholarship and then within the college we have college-level scholarships and then within bse there are scholarships um specific to the bse students and ryan and gregory i don't know if you guys have applied for those or if you're sweet tell us yeah oh do you want to say it or do you want me to greg you got it it'll be all mean all right so yeah so essentially um we mentioned the washington pulp and paper foundation before which is just a huge um got a huge group of local companies that are like from the pulp and paper industry or have to do with that and uh essentially these companies uh provide almost every single bse student uh scholarship uh every year so like for your first year it might be five thousand dollars and then it could go down app year after year but yeah so by partnering with these um the washington paper foundation they've uh they're able to offer scholarships to our students and uh and basically when you apply to the major you're also applying to the scholarship so that's what i did what right before i came to uw i was applying to bse and at the same time that i was applying to bc i was applying to the washington pulp and paper foundation to get some of those scholarships so and you but you do have to maintain a certain gpa level in order to maintain that scholarship throughout your time at uw hey are you guys from out of state or washington i know jenna is in state i'm freeze i'm from redmond washington originally so 20 minutes away but now i live in southern california and go to uw um but yeah from washington i'm from pewaul washington and i currently live there so yeah i'm in state and jenna you aren't telling where you're from specifically yeah i'm from spokane washington so further away than they are from uw cool all right well we got through is it nice that seattle washington is a pretty sustainable city we compost so much it makes my heart happy yeah we're pretty fortunate what city are you from anonymous attendee you can't ask that information yeah it is cool though because seattle is really salt lake city utah okay yeah seattle is really kind of like on the cutting edge of a lot of these things i think so yeah all right well our time is up here so thank you guys very much for joining us um yeah thanks we've got a couple people left on here so we have more sessions coming up um and i know you
