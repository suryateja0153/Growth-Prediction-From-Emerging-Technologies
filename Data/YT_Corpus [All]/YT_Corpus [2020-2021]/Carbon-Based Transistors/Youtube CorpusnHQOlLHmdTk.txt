 all right let's see who's coming in today all right hi jack and maybe simon's with you oh i see emily all right guys i'm going to get my slides up those of you who've been here before i know you know the drill so what we're gonna do i'm gonna have you all enter your names in the chat oh you know i'm gonna stop sharing for one second because i can't see the chat just yet so give me one moment here there we go okay all right so for those of you that don't know me i'm lauren treaster i'm the 4-h teen and leadership program coordinator and also put on these vermonting science cafes what we like to do when we get started is just introduce ourselves so i hope that you all can find the chat i see some of you are already doing that and just introduce yourself who are you where are you coming from adrian i love how you always give the best intro to rhode island that's awesome emma hi and emily is here with us today omar is with us todd and desmond and simon and jack eva's with us again nice to see you all so glad you all could come back again today hazel's here um so i'm gonna actually put in our closed caption link if you need closed captioning today just click on the link i just put in the chat and that will help you so as you are coming on in please continue to introduce yourselves but i'm going to just remind you all what our protocols we have when we are hanging out here in zoom land so remember everybody is muted you don't have the ability to unmic and you're nobody is on video except myself and our presenter but the way that we communicate is two ways we have our chat box and we have our q a box and we use those very differently the chat box is to respond to our presenter if she asks you any questions they kind of have a back and forth conversation or if you have anything to share that's on topic the q a box is your questions you have for the presenter and they're going to get cued up she may get to them right away she may get to them at the end of the presentation we'll see how that goes so just make sure that your question has some context to it because your question may not be answered when that that a particular slide is up so just make sure that you give some context to your question so we can make sure it gets answered um always be courteous and respectful to one another don't create any distractions and really in this environment it's just the chat box that would be the distraction so if i see that you are getting off topic and um not talking about today's topic i might chime in um because it does end up being distracting to other people who are really trying to pay attention so be engaged participate as you know we will always have polls and questions for you and you're gonna have your opportunity to ask your questions um of our topic and our presenter today so as always you know i like to just tell you about some upcoming programs that you can participate in as we're getting towards the end of the fall and into the winter we are wrapping up our programming but we're going to start introducing a whole bunch of new programming soon so you'll have to stay tuned for that but our science cafes go up until december remember here december 16th so we have many more cafes coming up and we also have our 4-h speak up contest where you could actually win some money to spend back into your community to help the local economy it's your opportunity to let your voice be heard about what issues matter to you what change you want to see in your community so if that interests you go to this link and check out the contest and i hope you all will participate in that i always like to give a shout out to our friends at the vermont brain bee they're doing weekly gatherings really focusing on neuroscience it's in preparation for the vermont brain b but you can participate even if you don't plan on doing the brain bait so you might want to check that out if neuroscience is something that you're interested in and then our friends at the lake champlain secret they do a program called zuma scientists they have one more coming up on december 4th and our friends in maine do their own teen science cafe modeled right aft based on ours here in vermont they have one coming up tomorrow and i know that they're they've been adding some more so you can always check out the website and i will put in all the links i just shared with you on aj and i see that you asked that so i'll make sure to get the links in the chat so you all know where to go find this information so we're going to get to the good stuff now right so today's topic is the power of the small why nano materials are unique and our presenter is dr linda shadler so a little bit about dr shadler she is the dean of the college of engineering and mathematical sciences and a professor of mechanical engineering here at uvm she received her undergraduate degree from cornell university and her doctorate from the university of pennsylvania in materials science and engineering she taught at renson i can never say that renzo rensselaer thank you polytechnic polytechnic institute for 22 years before coming to uvm her research started out in polymer composites the materials that you find in skis and skateboards but she now focuses on nano composites she has also been active in informal science education and she says to check out a website called molecularium.com which i will put in the chat for everyone so let's all welcome dr shadler hi everybody and they can't respond back unless you guys say hi back in the chat okay i think i have chosen the right desktop to share can you see that laura yeah okay so thank you all i'm i'm uh i have a bunch of things in a bunch of different places on two different screens so be patient with me as i um work through that but i'm very happy to be here today and thank you for joining us thank you for the highs in the in the chat um i'm i'm starting with a picture of the new science buildings and engineering buildings at the university of vermont so just so you can see those there we've really been um investing in our our stem complex at uvm so i hope you can come visit it someday so my first question to you and there's some hints in here is what are materials go ahead and and put your thoughts on what is a material or what are materials in the chat and when i'm looking over this way that's because i'm looking at the chat any ideas what are materials adrian says everything yep so any sp so by everything plasmas are plasmas materials materials are anything physical are electrons materials a type of object used to build other objects that's excellent okay so yeah i'm in a material tends to be something that we can hold in our hands but it's it's really anything that's made of atoms and molecules so it might be a bridge or a building or an airplane or a basketball but it's also human bodies water is a material gases are materials so really anything made of atoms and molecules and i'm spending a little time on this because if we're going to talk about nanomaterials we need to excuse me first need to understand what materials are made of so let's just take a penny a penny is an example of a metal copper with some a couple different elements in there but if you take a microscope and you zoom into a penny and then you zoom in yet another level you can see here this pattern and each of these patterns is a metal crystal so a crystal you know diamonds are crystals and if you were to look at the atomic structure of a diamond it would have a pattern similar to these it would be organized on a lattice so very periodic and that would go on for you know big distances so each of these sort of chunks that you can see in the different directions those are each metal crystals if you will so one example of a crystal that you might know about is quartz um and you can see it's it's a it's a single crystal that i'm showing here and it's it's transparent um it's ionic oh wait it's ionic um could could i need to follow the chat a little bit more um yes it's metallic and quartz is not metallic it's a metal oxide silicon dioxide and that's a ceramic we call it a ceramic or a glass now this is another piece of quartz on the right and this piece of quartz has many different crystals in it and they're joined together right to make one solid so instead of a single crystal it's many crystals put together so does anybody know why the one on the right you can't see through it and the one on the left you can see through it think about light trying to go through the one on the left and the one on the right given that the one on the right has many crystals anybody know why you can't see through the one on the right and just you know there's always a delay on the typing um but yeah they're coming in so emma's got polished and adrian says covalent so they definitely have covalent bonds so that's great um even if i polished this one on the right you still couldn't see it yeah there are too many crystals and the tiny crystals reflect the light differently excellent answer i am very impressed so if you think about it when two crystals maybe one oriented this way and one oriented this way come together there's kind of this region where the there's a mess and so when the light comes in it gets reflected off these boundaries and you can't see through so glass is also made of silicon dioxide or can be made of silicon dioxide and the and you can see through it the reason you can see through glass is because it's not a single crystal it's something we call amorphous where the the um atoms are not organized they're disorganized they look more like those atoms in the boundary between two crystals except it's the whole material and the reason you can see through the glass is because there's no boundaries so the light is not reflected so i don't know just sort of a side note about materials but they're made of atoms but they're also made of crystals or sometimes they're amorphous and we've talked about metals and metal oxides there's also materials called polymers so all the plastic that you see and polymers can also be amorphous or crystalline and i'm not going to go into the details there but the big difference about polymers is that there's these really long chains this is a short one a real polymer chain would be a hundred to a thousand times longer than this little picture that i'm showing you here so materials can be metals they can be ceramics they can be polymers they can be liquids they can be water they can be gas but they're all made of atoms and molecules so i think we can now turn to what are nanomaterials and i'm going to talk i just want to let you know my goals for today are to tell you about what nanomaterials are give you some examples of how properties change with size and then show you how we can use nanotechnology to solve some of today's challenges and then look ahead a little bit i want you to see that the pictures here um does anybody know what these on the left here the little bumps in this picture does anybody know what they are adams thank you eva you you you know yeah thank you emma so those are atoms and uh so that's an example of a nanomaterial right it's just an atom and they and there's control so um just keep that in mind i'll get back to that okay so what is nanotechnology it's the understanding and control of matter materials at dimensions of 1 to 100 100 nanometers where unique phenomena enable novel applications so unique properties like color or conductivity allow you to make materials with really special properties at the bulk scale and the other key part is that nanomaterials are materials where we have control of those dimensions at 1 to 100 nanometers and that's what's been really new about nanotechnology in the last couple of decades compared to the nanotechnology that's been here for a long time so it might be important to know how small a nanometer is or to think about how small a nanometer is you may have seen pictures like this before but an ant is you know five millimeters which is five times ten to the minus three meters a human hair is 50 to 100 microns a microphone can i jump in for a second there is a question from um cheyenne just what does nano mean yeah i'm gonna get to that in like okay 15 seconds cheyenne thank you for that question so micron is 10 to the minus six meters red blood cells are 10 of those so 10 times smaller than a human hair and dna the stuff in our cells is 2.5 nanometers so millimeters 10 to the minus 3 micro is 10 to the minus six and nano is ten to the minus nine so a thousand times smaller than a micron and that's part of the point i'm trying to make and then atoms are ten times smaller than that than dna so they're not even a nanometer in size they're 10 times 10 to the minus 10 meters so if you think about being able to you know pick something up and control it and now you know this is uh you know i don't know 10 centimeters something that's 10 orders of magnitude smaller than that how do you move it around and control it that's what's cool about nanotechnology and i'll just do the same thing on the sink synthetic side um a pin top of a pin is two millimeters big transistors in your phones or maybe a hundred nanometers and then there's these really cool things that we're going to talk about a little bit more later they are two nanometers they're called a carbon nanotube you can see a picture of one down here if we'd all been able to be there together i could have shown you a model of one but it looks like where i've got my pointer here and it's just a really really long tube made of carbon atoms it's like taking a sheet of graphite and wrapping up into a tube and putting a soccer ball on the on the end some people are having bad video resolution i'm sorry to hear that um i think it may just be this one slide and maybe the way the things were copied okay because it's looking good on my screen um okay so if a nano tube is two nanometers in diameter how many of them do you think can fit into a cross section of a human hair that's 10 to 50 to 100 microns all right so you i just launched a poll and put your answer in the poll if for some reason you don't see this poll that popped up you can go ahead and put your answer in the chat but let's try to get the answers in the poll if you see it okay so a spread of answers from a 10 000 to a million nobody guessed a thousand which is was not correct um so if you think about it two nanometers um so that's two times ten to the minus nine if you're going to do a micron that would be a thousand times bigger two times ten to the minus six so you're gonna have at least a thousand atoms but maybe probably more i mean nanotubes but probably more like ten thousand nanotubes across the section of a human hair so it's on the order of of ten thousand hundred thousands a bit too many so imagine the size of a human hair we now have things that we can grow and control called nanotubes where 10 000 of them would fit in the cross-section of a human hair so i think it's just hard to address that and get a concept of how small that really is that's why i'm focusing a little bit on that okay so what is different about something that's that small besides that it's small and hard to pick up the key one of the key things that's different is that the surface area is is much larger per unit volume so let's say we had a square that's this size the surface to the area which would be similar to saying the surface area to the volume is four to one and as i keep making it smaller and smaller and smaller boxes now the surface to area is 34 to one so things that are really small have more surface area so if you think about i mean just melting of ice cubes if you have large ice cubes or crushed ice it melts much faster because there's much it's got more surface area so that heats up and as the melting occurs the whole thing disappears more quickly so that's a kind of a simple thing that happens that's different for nano materials compared to bulk materials so in addition to a nanomaterial having more surface area what's different about atoms at a surface go ahead and put stuff in the chat so i'm kind of getting hints of it but not quite anybody else have an idea okay so if we think about this atom in the center of the box it has eight nearest neighbors if i were to draw the bonds it would be bonded to eight other atoms but if this is the surface of my crystal or the corner of my crystal i'm missing an atom here this one this corner one is only bonded to um even especially if it's the corner only bonded to three other atoms so if you were to think about how easy it is for an atom to break away from a surface the more atoms it's bonded to the harder it is for it to pull away from the surface so atoms at a surface are less tightly bonded to the material than the atoms that are in the material so what might mean that happen what happens oh i was going to do it as a pole sorry about that i missed that poll so they have fewest near fewer nearest neighbors that means they're bonded to fewer atoms and just as we talked about um they they will um you know just like in the ice they're going to get the temperature earlier and all of the above right i'll try to remember that i've got polls so we can ask them before i give you the answers okay give it a try so what'd you say that we'll throw the pole up there and make sure they heard you thank you so these these nano materials have huge surface area the atoms at the surface are less well bonded and it warms up faster so that means not only do they melt faster but the actual melting temperature changes so if you look at the melting point versus the size of the particle let's say if you were thinking about dirt particles or something like that the smaller they get look how much their melting point decreases and that's valuable because when you're for example trying to make these catalytic converters if you can make them out of ceramic nanoparticles instead of having to heat them to a thousand degrees in order to make them you know like when you've done clay at school instead of having to go to a thousand degrees to get them to make a solid you might only have to go to 500 or 700 degrees which is already saving the ceramics industry money because if you don't have to take it up to as high a temperature that can save you a lot of energy in your company okay uh and i'd love to say that all of this is new um but it's not romans so you know 2 000 years ago used nanoparticles gold nanoparticles of different size to change the color of glass they also did this with silver so these are gold nanoparticles in solution here and as you went go from 100 nanometers to 10 nanometers the color changes and in this case it's it's a roman cup and if the light comes from the outside it looks green if the light comes from the inside it looks red which um i'm i'm still trying to figure out how that totally works so does anybody know why the color changes when you change size this would come from your phys yeah super cool um this would kind of be something you might have learned a little bit about in physics class or maybe chemistry class but why would the size what might change as you get to really small particles that would make the color change okay i think i've waited long enough for guesses to come in but if you remember in your chemist oh more surface for light to reflect off the lights are more condensed different reflections um the light separating yeah so all great um all great questions but um the answer is actually that i don't know if you remember about electron levels in your chemistry class um and electrons jumping i mean energy levels that electrons jump to and from but those levels actually start to change so that the energy of the light that's emitted is at a different wavelength just by making the particles really small because now you have all these atoms on the surface so one of the other things that i mentioned about the definition of nanotechnology is that you need to have control not just observe them but you need to have control control um from uh at the at the levels of 1 to 100 nanometers i see thank you for your comment adrian so one of the tools we use to control atoms is an atomic force microscope non-contact atomic force microscopy one finding the surface the microscope's cantilever is activated to vibrate resonance as it is lowered attractive forces between the tip and the sample alter the cantilever vibration the cantilever returns to its unperturbed vibration when withdrawn from the sample the set point for the cantilever vibration determines the distance between the tip and the sample for imaging 2. scanning principle if the tip is scanned across the sample the tip height is adjusted by feedback to keep the count level vibration at the set point and the distance between the tip and the sample constant [Music] three scanning the sample as the tip is rest to scanned across the sample the tip height is adjusted to keep the cantilever vibration at the set point and so the tip follows the topography of the sample the height of the tip is recorded along with the coordinates of its point in the scan so this is an atomic force microscope um they're pretty common these days and you can use them to view atoms and so those pictures that i showed you were actually scanning tunneling microscopes not atomic force microbes the resulting map of tip position can then be processed to render an image of the sample topography with nanometer resolution okay i'm going to stop this now and um so that tool how thin is the needle so these are um they can be kind of nanometer sized at the tip right right at the tip yeah very scary voice i agree so the needles are are very very small on the order of nanometers in order to be able to scan the atoms um and so i want to port in an example here of the kind of control that you can have with a an instrument very similar to a scanning tunneling microscope called an atomic s very similar to an atomic force microscope called a scanning tunneling microscope [Music] [Music] [Music] bye [Music] [Music] so so you get the point they are able to use the microscope to those are atoms those are not balls those are atoms and move them in a controlled enough way to make a movie another example that we of showing of how we have control is and maybe you've seen movies like this one this is zooming into your cell phone and i'll show you when we get down to the nano scale it's been pretty impressive what they've been able to do in terms of organization so there's the chip chips are typically made on these big wafers and so now you're seeing a lot of chips and on each chip you have all sorts of transistors resistors capacitors and metal lines connecting them they're three dimensional when you go to the smallest scale the metals the metal wires connecting things are in the order of four whoops to 15 nanometers so all the electronics that you work with these days also demonstrate the incredible control we have uh at at the nano scale okay let me go to the next slide all right so then i just want to show you one one last example of control um and it's these carbon nanotubes i mentioned and these are better pictures of them hopefully you can see these a little better it's a tube of graphite wound up with ends and there's multi-walled ones as well where there's several layers just a tube within a tube within a tube these were a very exciting part of nanotechnology because they're the strongest materials in the world strength per density they're the strongest materials in the world their conductivity is close to copper and their stiffness how you know like like a rubber band has low stiffness and a piece of steel has high stiffness they're the highest stiffness per density in the world as well some people think we can build an elevator to the moon do you think we can build an elevator to the moon with nanotubes and and if so like you know why is it we can do it with nanotubes and not other things yes no desmond that's not an answer sure says jack nose said simon speaking in a sense desmond's note the answer is correct well is an elevator to the mood even possible no because it needs to be able to sway no okay well i don't really know the final answer because maybe someday just like we're figuring out how to go to mars in all kinds of places we we would be able to build an elevator to the moon but the reason we might be able to and again because theoretically the answer is yes is because nanotubes have a strength to weight ratio such that they the cable wouldn't break most materials if the cable gets long enough it's going to break due to its own weight but because of the strength to weight ratio of nanotubes theoretically it would be possible and as you can see from these images that i did not draw that a lot of people have been dreaming about this concept yes it could take a very long time and the base area of this elevator would be like the size of kilimanjaro or something like that so probably it's not going to be worth it but it's fun to think about but we can use carbon nanotubes in other ways um one is that people are looking into using them for electronics because at two nanometers that's a better conductor than a metal wire at 10-15 nanometers so people have been playing with how do you grow them in specific geometries and in specific ways so this is actually a pretty old paper showing nanotubes these are sort of columns of nanotubes look at this this is 10 microns so there's lots and lots of nanotubes in that cylinder and one of the reasons you can do this if you look back what i'm showing here is a silicon wafer like your electronics are made on but there's a little island of sio2 silicon dioxide the material we talked about in the very beginning and the nanotubes will only grow where there's silicon dioxide and not where there's just silicon so i wanted to show you one last video of nanolithography so somewhere on here is this video this short video will teach you the basics of electron beam lithography lithography is a word that comes from ancient greek meaning printing with stones with this technique a stamp is made by carving a pattern into a stone the stone is then coated in ink and pressed onto a substrate such as paper [Music] similar methods are used when making small micro scale devices or a pattern needs to be made repeatedly on wafers the two methods used are called electron beam lithography and photolithography ebl uses electrons to print while photolithography uses light both methods use an organic material called a resist which is sensitive either to electrons or light depending on the material used a thin coat of this resist is applied to the substrate in photolithography the resist is exposed to light through a patterned mask that has been transferred onto the substrate wherever the mask allows light to reach the resist a chemical reaction occurs in which large resist molecules are broken down into smaller molecules after exposure the next step is called developing the area of the resist that has been exposed to light is removed by immersing the wafer in an organic solvent the solvent dissolves only the small molecules that were produced during the exposure to light finally the pattern is transferred onto the substrate using one of two available methods method one is etching in which substrate is chemically removed from the pattern area that is not coated in resist after etching the remaining resist is removed revealing the pattern etched into the substrate surface method two is the liftoff technique in which a metal layer is deposited over the hole of the wafer the resist is then removed taking the metal layer with it the only area that now has a metal coating is the desired pattern where the resist had previously been removed in the developing step electron beam lithography uses so that is the method by which you can make these columns or pieces where you have silicon dioxide or not and i just thought i'd show you one more example of the kind of crazy patterns that people are able to make with these now and they can orient them vertically or horizontally so it and it's this is it's gone way past this at this point um another example of how we might be able to use these nanotubes and by controlled patterning is that if i don't know if you know this but lotus leaves are very anti you know water balls up on them just because of the high surface area and they can sort of clean the lotus leaves because these balls of water pick up dirt and then roll off the leaf so they're talking about again this is maybe it's not as far away as the yes they're hydrophobic thank you for reminding me of the word um if you think about airplanes and trying to do de-icing um if the if as the freezing rain is coming down and instead forms a ball and rolls off that would be better than coating the airplane uh with with frozen with ice the last thing i want to talk about in terms of nanotubes is how they might be used in composites to make something pretty cool um composites are a mixture of two materials and combined they make a material with properties that you can't achieve on your own so any anybody know anything you use in your daily life um hydrophobic by the way doesn't mean that it won't dissolve in water it means that water won't spread on it it it i mean that it's also true that things are hydrophobic tend not to dissolve but the idea of a hydrophobic surface is like waxing your car um the water the surface energy is such that it won't spread it balls up instead um but okay so back to this question what do you use in your daily life that is made of composites polyester is just one material but it is out of polymers so that's good anything you know of in your life that might have glass fibers and epoxy bathtubs metal alloys are a little different an alloy isn't technically a composite it's technically a mixture at the atomic level so we it can make composite like materials if you have two phases insulation tends to be just the glass fibers without the polymer but if you added polymer to the insulation wax would be a polymer that you could add to the insulation so answers your skis your tennis racket your skateboards those again if you were here i could show you things but maybe some fabrics the resin is the polymer that you put around the fibers if it's a fiber composite not the wax that you're putting on your skateboard but i think wood would be an example of a composite actually it tends it's made of two kinds of materials there's a fiber material and there's a binding material so your skis would be a great example bo the new boeing aircraft that we're finally going to put back in the air has a huge amount of composite in it carbon fiber with epoxy right that's in your skis and your skateboards in your tennis racket and one of the things you would notice if you cut open your skis and you saw these bundles of fibers is that there would be layers of them and that if you had a few layers of them they they would be like a half a millimeter thick might be a typical thickness of um a carb a fi a composite sheet that you're using in your skis so one of could you make a composite with bio materials you absolutely could so what if you were trying to build a really small aircraft like this one if your fibers which are your carbon fibers are 10 microns already and when you layer them up it's half a millimeter you can't make an aircraft that small and somebody did make an aircraft that small so one of the ways you could do that instead is to use carbon nanotubes so instead of making 10 micron fiber composites you would use the two nanometer fibers and this is um an example on the where i'm putting my marker right now is is a whole wafer of nanotubes and they're pulling them off um and kind of spinning a fiber but they wouldn't have to and then they're making sheets of nanotubes that's this picture here and now when you layer them up instead of it being 50.5 millimeters this thickness could be 50 50 or fewer microns thick so now you're at the level where you could make take a composite and build a teeny tiny aircraft instead of a really big aircraft yeah crazy i agree all right so you know nanotechnology is being used everywhere here's a picture before covid when people could hang out together and there's so many places that there there's nanotechnology nanomaterials in being used everything from the cosmetics to the electronics to the coatings on the glasses to the light emitting diodes that are in on your phone or your computer i mean you can see all these pictures here nanotechnology has really permeated um a lot of applications so let's talk a little bit about where we might use it to solve problems facing society so this thing this is another poll um what are some critical problems facing society global warming probably i think yes anybody wants the poll if you want to have them put it in the poll or do you want them to just write in the chat yeah either way you could you could answer the poll i find i didn't realize how well the chat was going to work but yeah so um i guess it depends on your pandemic i did not put that one there but i'm sure nanotechnologies also help with the pandemic yup food and water so it depends on your perspective but all of these things have been identified as critical problems facing society so i just want to take a couple of them and show you how nanotechnology right oceans and microplastics and fish food and water securing toxic waste so i think if you look over you can probably put some of those in the categories there so let me give you one example fuel cells are still under development for a renewable energy source they're not as widely invested invested in right now as as solar cells and wind but they are a technology that can be used very locally where you take hydrogen h2 so here's hydrogen with its two protons and two electrons and if you put it near a catalyst it'll break up into the two protons and two electrons and if you create the right membrane it'll only let protons through but not electrons so the electrons you can direct through a wire to maybe create energy invite a light bulb but when those electrons come back to the other side of the membrane you can combine them with oxygen that's what's on the other side of the membrane and water is what comes out so you put hydrogen in you get water out that's a pretty clean energy but critical to that is this material called a catalyst on the surface of the membrane that allows you to break up the hydrogen into protons and electrons so um one of the exciting things that's been happening yes the water is drinkable um or potable if you if you start to look at what people are doing to create better catalysts one of the problems is that um the hydrogen tends to not be pure it has co2 and stuff in it and that kills the catalyst um and so the net the fuel cells start being less efficient so one of the things that happens is that they're creating new nanostructured catalysts that prevent the they're not um i said carbon dioxide i meant carbon monoxide they're not susceptible to the carbon monoxide poisoning and they're faster in fact if you look at the catalytic rate as a function of the particle size it goes through the roof as the particle size gets smaller so to make more efficient and faster operating fuel cells why does the catalytic rate go up as the particle size goes down i think that might be our second our last or second to last poll i actually do not have this as a poll oh well tell me in the chat maybe i did it as a chat sorry i'm sorry more surface area see you guys maybe you already knew that but absolutely you learned very quickly because there's more surface area it has more surface area to react with the hydrogen and so the catalytic rate goes up oh i even said put your answer in the chat how about this one do you have this poll of the nine billion people on the planet how many do not have access to clean water i do have that as a pull so i'm launching it you guys can put your answers right into the poll so 1 million 10 million 100 million 1 billion or 5 billion and it looks like the majority is at 1 billion thank you very much so that's about right almost a billion people are lacking access to clean drinking water six kilometers is the average distance an african woman walks to get water 3.6 million people die each year from water related diseases and 65 million people are at risk for arsenic poisoning just in bangladesh so um one of the things that's happening is people are using nanoparticles these are rust these are iron oxide particles um and that the iron oxide particles will pull the arsenic to the surface and then you can filter them out and so that you can remove arsenic from the water and you can do that in a local level and rust particles are pretty cheap people are also doing things like taking nanotubes and sticking them together chopping off the top and the bottom and it's a great filter for really cleaning out toxins we have a lot of tools for cleaning out microbes but not so many for cleaning out toxins so those are just two examples there are others of how nanotechnology is is helping to help people get clean water this is a cool application for health care if you've got a a blockage to an artery there are ways to break that up and and clean out your artery but you need to do you want to deliver that locally and so they're using nanoparticles which are these blue particles in this picture clusters of particles and when they get to the blockage they break up due to the higher shear force right you can see if you think about a walk water going down a river when the river narrows the water moves faster and there's a kind of a shear there that breaks these up and then they will release their drugs and help remove this vascular narrowing and a cancer treatment where you can take metal nanoparticles now and you can put a molecule on the surface and i've just represented it as a blue kind of crayon thing here and one of the differences between healthy cells and cancer cells are the proteins that are on the surface of the cell and in the case of a cancer cell you could then tailor the particle to just attach to cancer cells and not to healthy cells and then you can use electromagnetic radiation to heat to like apply electromagnetic radiation that will heat up the metal nano particles but not where there aren't metal nanoparticles and so you can kill tumors and harder to find cells in the body that have that are cancer cells so this is this is under um strong consideration i feel like even some people are trying at trials of it but this is just a picture of a mouse brain and i'm you can see where the the metal nanoparticles gathered they did indeed find the tumor and not go other places and so you can very locally kill a tumor and without having to use radiation that kills a lot of other cells or chemotherapy that kills a lot of other cells in the body so here's the challenge though we have all of these but now that we have all these tiny materials how would you manufacture something very small besides electronics any ideas if you're aware of some of the new manufacturing that's out there i would make a fence is that to keep the uh to keep the nanotechnology out 3d printing thank you yes so 3d printing is the answer these are slides from my friend jennifer lewis at harvard but um 3d printing is is the way to make it happen but 3d printing yes you can print skin probably not a brain but you can they are printing biological materials now and um but typically the size that they're printing is on the order of 10 to 50 to 50 microns but that's okay the things that she prints are made up of nanoparticles so the reason she can even print things this small is because she takes nanoparticles and specially treats them so that they'll still flow through the nozzle and one of the things she prints the examples of what you could print is you do a 3d scan of a broken part of your draw let's say and then you can print the missing piece so that when they go to surgery it fits perfectly does anybody know a component of bone like what would you want to print this material out of yeah you probably can print liver tissue calcium is in it bone is not made of stem cells although stem cells will can grow and can be in the marrow of a bone that's okay so it's something called hydroxyapatite so she can take these um hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and print them into scaffolds and and the reason you want to do that is because now the body will think of it think of it as bone and it will the the body will create new bone that tightly bonds that um synthetic man-made replacement for bone to the real bone in the body so that it's securely in there and here's just some other pictures of things people have been printing so on the bottom is hydro hydrogel scaffolds where they can do things like grow liver cells and i have no idea how they did this one but this is a 20 micron image of an aircraft i don't think it can actually fly but who knows and they are creating little machines to be able to do micro machine nano machining so they create the machines at the small scale so then it can go do machining at a small did you see adrian's request he would like your 3d printer yeah the top left looks like a toy i don't think it actually flies that's kind that you'll share it i actually think there's some ways that the state is helping people buy 3d printers for use in their classrooms so maybe we can talk about that all right so i'm going to stop talking now um you know nanomaterials have been around forever what's different in these days is the large number of nanomaterials we can make our ability to see them with things like an atomic force microscope and to control where they are and how they grow to make cool stuff so all right so we're going to go into the questions but before we do i'm going to throw up our poll just to give us some feedback about what you learned from the presentation how you thought it was so there's two questions just take a couple seconds answer both of them and then we'll go into the questions if you have any questions to add you get them into the q a because that's what we're going to be doing at this point but i'll wait till a few more of you get your questions in all right i'm going to end the poll thank you very much so let's get into the questions first one would nanotechnology reduce air pollution if we can improve energy efficiency then we will decrease air pollution if we can make better filters for collecting the um the the the stuff that's coming out of your catalytic converter or improve the catalysts in your catalytic pro catalytic preview catalytic converter in your car you would reduce air pollution so there's many many ways that uh that nanotechnology can help reduce air pollution okay how much nanotubes would it take to make an entire synthetic plant more than i can count sorry i'm guessing that people use nanotubes for 3d printing they are using nanotubes for 3d printing absolutely and can you alter a clothing article with nanotube to make it knife proof so people do take make composites that are you know bulletproof vests and are made from composites so using nanotubes as part of that uh is definitely going on for the military so yes but i don't know that you could just take a fabric and like spray something on it it would it would but it would definitely be able to be more flexible than some of the bulletproof vests we have now would they be able to make 3d printed hearing aids out of nano materials i think hearing aids have a lot of electronics in them so you would have to have a mixture of the 3d printed earpiece that fits your ear really well sort of designed just for you and the electronics that provide the amplification okay so and let's see uh this may be our last question unless others have more to come on in uh could you make a type of nanotube that bends so nanotubes i know i showed you only pictures where they were straight in terms of the schematics but i don't know if you looked if you saw um i guess i'd need to go back a little ways but they are very bendy just like any really tall thin anything they end up bending quite a bit um let me just see if i can get back to that picture yeah so here's an example where you can see them sort of waving um in the in the cylinder there they're very they move they're very flexible they're very stiff but they're very flexible because they're so long and thin see another question just came in could this if improve them be a long-term solution for cancer you know in from my perspective it's a treatment of cancer it's not a cure for cancer so um i think probably that there's going to be a mixture of solutions for cancer immunotherapy is probably the most impactful right now but if you wanted to get rid of the tumors before you applied the immunotherapy it would help you do that without having to use things like chemotherapy so it could be much less damaging to the patient while you're helping get rid of the cancer in their bodies well that is fantastic if there are no any other questions to get into the q a those were great questions that you all asked i always say i do not have a science background so i did see omar was like i couldn't follow everything omar you're not alone i wasn't following because i don't have the science background but i learned a lot um this was great so let's all thank dr shadler for sharing her knowledge on nano materials with us and spending time and hopefully you all will come next week we're going to be talking about data privacy um so that one should be interesting as well so always a pleasure we're so happy that you joined us and thank you all for thanking dr shadler in the chat and we'll see you all next week thank you all for being here was fun
