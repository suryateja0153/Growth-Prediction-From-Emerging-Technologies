 hello everyone and welcome to a new episode of mit nano explorations so today it's a pleasure to introduce uh danielle rodriguez he's a graduate student in my group he is working on the quantum electronic transport of graphene-based new moderator structures and he will be telling us today about highly tunable junctions in magic and altruistic valley graphene tunneling devices please if you would like to ask questions and wait until the end of the talk the talk will be 30 minutes and then we will have 15 minutes for questions you can ask the questions in person after the talk or through the chat and you know the floor is yours thank you pablo for the introduction good morning everyone my name is danielle negren and i'm a grad student in a professor hayes aerials group and today i'm going to tell you about the recent experiment on magic angle twisted biography so first of all i would like to thank the organizing for for putting together these great seminars and giving me the opportunity to present our videos so first of all we have several platforms to study strongly correlated physics one is by directly taking a look at the quantum materials themselves which we have studied for several decades another possible approach is to build co-lab analysis which offer a higher control and today i want to tell you about the recent platform for strongly strongly correlated physics and superconductivity with a high tunability and accessible critical temperature so for magic and twisted by lego graphene the length scale of the super lattice is in between the one of the called atomic lattices and the one of the quantum materials and the typical energy scale which is on the order of one kelvin is also in between the two and therefore it offers a complementary approach so this is the outline of my talk our first introduced graphene and magic angle graphene super lattices then i will present our observations on creating sweeter behavior as a feeling of the superlative density and superconductivity after that i will basically show how we can exploit this unprecedented tunability within a single material platform to create fully tunable lateral just conjunctions then i will present how in the same multi-gated devices we obtain spectroscopic evidence of the superconductor and finally i will show how we can transform these devices into a single transistor displaying periodic coulomb diamonds so let me start from the beginning the developments onto the materials and van der waals heterostructures have led to many analogies one of the most popular ones the one with legos since both of them can be stacked on top of each other in any possible way one can think of however with student materials you can also do this we can stack them one on top of each other at any desired angles and the properties of the system dramatically change as i will tell you today and this is something you could not do before you cannot do this when you grow bulk crystals and you cannot do this for a terror structure for example grown by and b so in this case a more a pattern forms and the more equivalence of the memorial pattern that is the distance between those soccer balls you see here in the screen depends on the twist angle between the two sheets and the more a wavelength increases very rapidly for small angles thus giving us a unique knob to tune the balance so here we have the reciprocal lattices of graphene sheet 1 and graphing g2 if we join the coordinates of these two hexagons then we have the superlative because we have a large water wavelength in real space then in reciprocal space we have a smaller superlative brilliant drop so let me now show you a video of the electronic structure energy as a function of momentum as we rotate the angle from a relatively large angle three degrees towards smaller and smaller twist angles so within this energy window for three degrees it basically just looks like graphene so the first thing you will notice when we run this video is that the super lattice brilliant becomes smaller and smaller here at the exaggeration here and then at around 1.8 degrees so in a couple of seconds you will have here this pair of bands that are separated from the highly expressive bands and at around 1.1 degrees so now you get a very flat bounce and then it continues uh evolving so at 1.05 degrees according to our latest calculations with a group of caxitas we get these flat bands separated by uh gaps this to these other highly dispersive ones however you know the exact value continues evolving as more accurate calculations are performed so flat in momentum space means you know by doing the fourier form highly localized in uh real space you you know localized where well turns out that the electronic states in the flat bands are strongly localized in the a a uh stack regions of uh the superlatives uh where locally it seems like the two carbon atoms from the two carbon layers are one on top of the other on the other hand the density of says of the interconnecting a b and ba regions is low so it is probably easier to see that in the top view where the yellow spots are where the electrons like to stay to this peak here so let's talk about transport phenomenology so this is the phase diagram of monolayer graphene also large angle twisted biopin for example three degrees so if you take a look as a function of density and temperature you only have one interesting point which is the challenge and on both sides of it here and here you have metallic behavior if we reduce the twist angle of the twisted by graphene but not yet magic and converts it converting density to filling we get this i'm taking charge normality to be zero we can add or remove uh four electrons to those bonds uh here so this pair of bands are not yet flat so by moving the fermi energy by either adding electrons or by removing them we go from admit from metallic behavior to bond insulators so positive feelings meaning i'm adding electrons to the system whereas negative feelings in that direction i'm removing electrons or adding holes to the system so let me stop for a minute and do a quick recap on single particle uh band theory so i'm here plotting the density of states as a function of energy assuming a system with only two bands if the lower band is fully filled and the next higher upper one is totally empty then this is an insulator and basically this is called the band on the other hand if one of the bands is partially occupied then the material can conduct electricity this is a metal and if we're dealing with single particle physics then these are the only two options however sometimes it can happen that our fermi level falls in the middle of the band where in principle it should be a metal but due to the strong interactions between the electrons we can recreate a situation that is similar to this where the system behaves like an insulator and we call them correlated insulators because the correlated between electrons opens a gap here so now if we are at the magic angle this is the simplified schematics of the phase diagram details depend on various things and you know slightly vary from one device to another so with this notation phillips goes from zero at the charging to uh minus four so four holes for marine itself or plus four electrons per uh unit cell so we have again of course these uh band insulators and at um around two holes or two electrons per marine itself we have a uh correlated insulin so across the stock i will use d for dirac i for band insulator filling minus four c for the correlated insulator at filling minus two and primes will denote positive dotting so on the electron side around the correlated insulators both for the hose and for the electrons we have these two uh superconducting domes which i will label by s and s prime and by now several groups have observed a similar phase diagram for twisted biography which has actually been evolving very fast with inputs from several groups and is quickly getting enhanced in complexity so let me show you some data at millikelvin temperature and for that let's measure the temperature of a large angle twisted by graphene whose constructor is similar to monolayer graphene as a function of density so if our fermi energy is deep inside our valence band then we have an excess of holes so the system will conduct well if we increase the fermi energy and eventually we reach the charge mentality then you know we don't have much carriers and our large angle two by graphene will conduct poorly and if we keep adding electrons then our fermi energy is deep in the conduction band and then our graphene will conduct well so i'm now showing data for a device at a smaller angle 1.8 degrees but not yet magic and near certainty you still have this characteristic v shape like in graphene but as you fill with electrons uh this band or as we empty with uh electrons or fill with whole this other part of the band at filling plus four and minus four will reach a gap here and here therefore you know this is a network of a correlated gap and heads the labels c and c prime that i'm showing here okay sorry i messed up with the animation so this is 1.8 degrees but at the magic angle uh this is basically uh what happens when you have a 1.08 degrees so you have two correlated insulators that appear at sorry for that so basically we made new devices in a geometry that allowed to measure superconductivity that means shaped in a whole bar basically look like look like this and what we discover is that uh twisted by graphene at the magic angle superconducts when we dub the system with a hole so we can measure the iv curve we show finite current bias at zero voltage drop and because we can tune in the density of electrons or holes by just changing the gate voltage here similar to a parallel capacitor we can also do this we can zoom in around the correlator state four holes so this state and measure what is the resistance of our device as a function of temperature and density and so what you see is that this red region is the correlated instead of holes you know we can add more holes and we get a large superconducting dome and if you remove a few holes or add some electrons we get another uh superconducting dome here and this diagram has some similarities with the phase diagram of kubrick and this has generated a lot of interest and we can do this for many more devices these are data for devices ranging from 0.98 to 1.16 and what you see is that the shape varies from one device to another quite substantially so what can obtain the rt curves at optimal doping for all of those devices over a range of different uh twisting and by now we probably have you know in total a few tens of magic and devices here uh let me show you a more cluttered graph that keeps constantly growing as we keep making more developers so in fact we started to map out what is the critical temperature as a function of twist angle at optimal doping and uh we started getting some statistics so what you see is that the superconductivity has the highest critical temperature on the order of three kelvin around 1.29 degrees with the exception of a couple more uh disordered samples and it seems to follow actually a domestic so if we move away from these values we don't see any superconductivity but this is not the end of the story for the second part of my talk i will focus on our most recent arcade paper about highly tunable tunneling junctions so the question that motivates this experiment is why do we want highly tunable so this question is actually at the edge between physics and technology in the hope of making of making this topic appealing to our broad audience um here today so from a physics point of view they offer a platform to study uh superconductivity and correlated states and we actually have spent quite some effort in the group in that direction in the last year they are also ideal i would say for studying physics and interfaces for example in junctions and i would say they can even be used to shape some light on the intrinsic superconducting properties of the materials themselves and i will show you all of that in the next few minutes from a technological point of view channeling devices are actually ubiquitous in modern electronics superconducting qubits for example state-of-the-art charts and junctions utilize typically oxide tunneling barriers but you know do suffer from disorder and are not electrostatically tunable so if we want tunability we basically need junctions with several different materials and uh those may suffer from uh non-ideal interfaces and all kinds of fabrication challenges so we actually demonstrated recently in the group in the in collaboration with the group of uh will oliver a graphene-based transport qubit that circumvents some of these issues but now we have the ability to independently tune the electrons and the weak link into different phases in a superconducting junction made of a single clean material and this enables basically an exponentially larger number of tunable configurations which we can even use to make gate defined circuits with magic and crystal by graphene in future to the integrated electrons among many other possible configurations such as highly sensible magnetic field sensor and you know other ones divide from single leg the journal science actually fitted our work last week claiming that these devices could power uh a new generation of superconducting electric i would say that's quite a claim so let me first ask you a seemingly simple physics question how do you know if your favorite superconductor is really a superconductor well first you need zero systems however you know zero resistance can happen for many other reasons so this is not an ambiguous test a second confirming experiment can be the mice in the thing you know the complete ejection of a magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor when it's transitioning to the superconducting state so i think it's fair to ask is magic and autistic biography truly a superconductor well let's see the first condition is simple we have many devices now that show this type of curve the medicine effect on the other hand happens in all 3d superconductors however into the superconductors we do not have proper micellar effects for a reason that will become obvious hopefully very soon so an alternative unambiguous test to show superconductivity into the materials in addition to zero resistance is the jason effect but i enjoy the sun predicted more than 50 years ago than when two superconductors are weakly coupled through what we call a weak link which can be of many kinds and any dimension basically cooper pairs can tunnel through the tunneling barrier separating the two superconductors and supercurrent can those flow in this system json junctions are typically made from bulk 3d superconductors that are coupled via a web link and have important applications in quantum mechanics for example switch super conducting qubits and even to define the standard of one volt among many others but you know in the 2d case and in particular for magic angle twisted by graphene where both the wiggling and the superconducting electrode it is a little bit different than what you expect for bulk so to the gestalt junctions sorry to these superconductors screed external ionic diffuse in a fundamentally different way from their bulk counterparts while in bar superconductor the magnetic field decays exponentially at the edges within the london penetration depth in the 2d case it is basically essentially unaltered across the whole sample area and this is because the screening currents cannot effectively expel the external magnetic field anymore and this is why you cannot have meissner effect in a 2d superconductor so in this simulation the color scale represents the normalized magnetic field inside the superconducting electrodes and the streamlines represent the flow of the screening currents so in a in a bulged superconductor basically the magnetic field is expected within a rigid lambda of the junction and it's actually locked inside the junction on the other hand for to the joists junctions the magnetic field distribution is not locked in the junction barrier anymore and the json electrodynamics is said to be non-local in this case from the magnetic field distribution we can obtain the distribution of the phase difference across the junction which in turn gives the front huffer interference pattern so for a bulk johnson junction the periodicity is given by the classical front hover pattern from hoven formula which is the flux quantum divided by the width of the device times the width of the junction but it turns out that the framework pattern of a planet just some junction differs noticeably from that of a bulb so first the high field periodicity is now given by 1.8 finite divided by the width of the device squared so it depends solely on the geometry of the sample itself and it's usually much smaller than the bulk period and second the zeros of the critical current for the 2d planet junction are not equidistant at low fields as in the ball case the truth is is that already in the original paper the json effect was indeed present in magic and notification through this order that is in an uncontrolled way so this is the resistance as a function of perpendicular magnetic field and density at the beginning we thought that this does here that that was not here you know the resistance doesn't know what to do should it be superconducting or should i rather stay in the normal state so it breaks up into ireland superconducting ireland and insulating islands so if we park and measure the critical current as a function of magnetic field we have from hover-like oscillations which tell you that you are actually looking at the gerson effect between those islands so now i want to show you how we can make json junctions from magic and go twisted by graphene in a much more controlled way so for that we place a narrow topic on our device and this is the device structure so the twisted bile graphene is encapsulated between hexagonal boron nitrate on top and about on the bottom and we have a metallic gate that tunes the electron density through this bottom hbn sheet and basically a narrow target controlling the electron state of the weak link bias voltage is basically applied between the drain and the source electrodes and the four probe resistance is obtained from these lateral contacts the nano fabrication process is actually not trivial and it involves a few key steps first we stack the different 2d materials and use the tier and stack technique to achieve a controllable twist angle between the two if you're interested we can discuss it later in the questions and answer a session and after that most of the uh subsequent steps are performed in clear manchester facilities and basically include a few e-beam lithographies etchings and evaporations i actually take this opportunity to thank all the staff and in particular mark mundo for all his help so if we only have one gate this is the phase diagram and you know the gated regions can be in any of these phases including s s prime c c prime d i i prime et cetera so now using uh the bucket and an arrow topic together we can define three separate reasons within the same devices in series so let me walk you through the complete dual gate parameter space available i'm here plotting the resistance as a function of the bucket and the top hit the transition between the different series combinations of the central and outside regions of the devices are seen from the horizontal and the diagonal line lines of this map so the diagonal fitters here in green basically dependent on both vtg and vbg are basically stemming from the dual gated region beneath the topic so this region here and the horizontal filters which are independent of the target are coming from the regions outside of the top gated area so gated solely you know by the bucket so if we take a look at the intersection between a horizontal line and a diagonal line for example here dc prime and d that occurs when the central region enters the c prime correlated insulative state and the outside regions are at the charge centrality and similarly for other intersections of the dashed lines so if we take a line cut across this line when there is no topic applied we simply recover the resistance as a function of uh characteristic of magical language more interesting behavior happens around the dark superconducting regions with uh zero resistance so in this case super current through a variable jefferson junction is observed across the device if we use the bucket to globally tune the magic angle twisted biography into the superconducting state for example in this region here and then we use the narrow target to form a weak link in the central region with another state so for example s is here indicates that the superconducting electrodes um are in the you know in the superconducting state and the weak link is at the band insulating state so let me actually set the baggage controlling the tunneling electron junction into the superconducting state s and sweep the target along this line here so we can continuously vary the variance strength with the topic voltage to achieve a weak link that can be switched from insulating metallic to superconducting regimes generating a critical super current which is here represented in um beyond the band insulator we actually observed oscillations of the critical point with respect to the uh topic here in a fabri perot like resonance occurring from the interfaces between the different phases and are typically observed in high quality devices close to the ballistic transportation so let's now test the predictions we made for the interference pattern in two digits and junctions so based on the analytical expression uh 1.8 finite over w squared we expect a periodicity on the order of 1.7 milli tesla in our device when we put the json junction in a magnetic field so we first gate the device close to the superconductor band insulator superconducting regime sorry sorry for that and we observed i would say a periodicity on the order of one to one point five milli tesla for the finest oscillation in agreement with our simulations and consistent with uh the so-called uh per regime that governs the ultrasone superconducting electrodes if you take an approximation for the pore formula here we have a periodicity and expected periodicity of 8.5 terla so this is far from our measure oscillation period similar values of the periodicity are also observed close to the sc prime s and s i prime s configurations alternatively if we bring the wiggling into the ss prime s regimes then the oscillations in the critical current disappear so in this configuration there's a rather complex density profile that actually transfers the whole phase diagram but not only the junction kind of behaves like three superconductors so let me now jump to the last point of uh my presentation which is the evidence of superconducting gap and single electron transistor so we made two more devices with a complementary geometry and instead of a narrow top gate now we have a now we pattern two isolated topics that are separated by a narrow gap offering independent tunability of each half of the device so in this geometry we can basically reproduce all the main results i mentioned so far but the fact that we can control the right and the left sides independently and in situ have dramatic consequences and enables the creation of versatile tunneling devices so for example we can do tunneling spectroscopy of the superconducting app in magic angle twist topology planning spectroscopy measurements basically allow us to pin information about the density of states in a sample so this is the general schematics of the process the normal probe is a metallic electrode and then the tunneling barrier is some insulating state the density of states of the sample in this case magic can go twisted by the graphene can be extracted by measuring at a few terms of milk kelvin the differential conductance and the idv between the probe and the sample the biased voltage basically defines the energy at which the density of says is probed and the fermi energy can be tuned electrostatically with an electrostatic gate so here the turning barrier is actually provided by the manga present in the electron structure so by setting the left side into the superconducting state and the right side into a metallic state in the next in the next highly uh dispersive bands we can actually perform uh turning spectroscopy from metallic magic and lotus to graphene in into uh superconducting magic and notice to graphene via insulating magical notice so our electrostatic simulations show that the density evolves continuously and crosses the value and is equal to minus ns at the position between the left and the right gated regions and if we account for uh quantum capacitance effects in magical twist of graphene then we actually have this narrow region that is actually kept at density minus in s and acts as a tonic so using this configuration we obtain for the first time tunneling spectra of magic angle twisted by graphene in the superconducting state in two different devices so the data basically show clear spectroscopic evidence of a superconducting gap where we have two very well-defined coherence peaks and a minimum at zero however we do not you know we do not obtain a hard gap due to thermal broadening but we can obtain a quantitative measurement of the gap by feeding a model of the quasi-particle density of states obtaining a gap on the order of a few tens of micro ev as the temperature is increased above 300 millikelvin both for devices b and c the coherence peaks are actually significantly broadened due to thermal excitations and as the temperature is uh further increased the d-pad zero bias is suppressed and interventionally appears basically indicated that the system is no longer superconducting all together similarly if we apply a perpendicular magnetic field larger than the critical fields at this temperature then the coherence peaks also disappear and are suppressed because superconductivity so these gate defined turning junctions actually present a significant advance towards probing the superconducting or the parameter in magic angle uh twisted biography so last but not least uh by further exploiting exploiting the flexibility of uh the split the geometry we can create a single lightning transistor within the same multipurpose devices so in an sct electrons are actually spatially confined in a central region by turning barriers that quickly connected to the drain and the source so single electron transistors are particularly attractive nowadays for the potential to shrink circuits and also dismiss their thirst for energy so to achieve this we basically tune um the left and right sides into metallic states with densities beyond the full field and the central region which is single gated is brought into a metallic state within the flat banks and you know similarly to before the calculated density of states the sorry the calculated energy density distribution uh actually shows two insulating plateaus here and here with a density equals to minus ns which results in an isolated island in the central origin of the sun at low enough temperatures and provided that the traveling resistance is large enough electron tunneling is only allowed if there are available any discrete energy states between the fermi energies of the source and the drain electrons otherwise the coulomb blockade effects prohibits this type of tunnel this is typically observed by measuring the differential conductance as a function of the source strain bias voltage and the gate voltage so we basically observe well-developed coulomb diamonds with a zero conductance regime uh thus obtaining a single uh election transistor so to sum up i first introduced magic and twisted by graphene as a system with uh flat bands in the electron structure i hope i have convinced you that the twist angle degree of freedom is among the most unique characteristics of under vascular structures then i presented some uh transport phenomenology focusing on correlating trigger behavior and superconductivity and showed you why it offers a highly tunable platform for strongly in the second part of my talk i basically exploited that our magic angle twisted by graphene can electrostatically and in situ exhibit a wide range of phases from metallic to insulator to superconducting phases to make versatile quantum devices so i showed you magic and reduced by graphene jets and junctions where we have the ability to independently tune the wiggling and the tunneling electrodes and after that i demonstrated edge turning spectroscopy in the superconducting state finally by inducing a double barrier geometry we operated the devices in a single electron transistor regime exhibiting coulomb so from a marginal perspective what is this field of twist to the materials twistronics where is this going is it just graphene and graphene or is this more general well turns out that any 2d material placed on top of itself and rotating depending on the coupling it is possible to realize a magic angle condition where you will have flat bands either everywhere in momentum space or locally in certain regions of momentum space and by now we have all the condensed matter behaviors in one layer to the materials so we have metas heavy metals like graphene we have insulators we have semiconductors we have superconductors by themselves and recently we also have magnets and quantum spin liquids so by now you know we can stack any 2d material on top of any other at any desired angle and introduce correlations if no correlations were present like in the case of graphene or modify existing correlations if they were not already or you know create uh sorry modify existing correlations if they were not already there so there's a zero possibilities and you know many theory papers and some experimental papers are already exploring these directions so probably the most important slide i want to thank all my fantastic co-workers and collaborators without which no this would have been possible in particular i want to thank my advisor paolo gariorero yuan cow jane park sergio barrera malika randera and oriole riorda thank you everyone for your attention and if you have more questions i will be happy to answer them very first question i have uh to get this going uh you know it's remarkable what you can do with the stronx it's remarkable what you can do with 2d materials uh you have shown us an ability to use e-beam to 2d pad to pattern these 2d films which of course raises a question on the in the patterning process what happens at the edges what is the what is the effect of the edge effects on these devices that is that is a great question so usually we actually try to make uh sufficiently big devices that we can ideally uh you know ignore the effect of edges at least in this type of experiments other experiments actually study what happens at the edges but there are actually lots of things happening at the edges for example through other collaborations we believe that when you do some um etching in our devices actually the twist angle so the twist angle is never homogeneous across the whole sample we have uh two collaborations with the weyman institute with the group of shah halilani and with the globe of elizeldov where we can mark the twist angle across the device with a very high precision up to 0.0001 degrees and what we find is that the twist angle is not homogeneous across the device turns out that at the edges when you try to pin the angle by etching there are dramatic changes at the edges and so it's not that we can make devices that are completely homogeneous into this angle and it's not that we can ignore the edges however for this type of experiment we try to study rather the bulk of uh the material by making these uh long whole whole bar devices uh that that actually also brings a second question that would follow it's intriguing what you just said which is that uh the actual twist angle i'm assuming due to the folding of the sheet or maybe uh wobble in the sheet uh is not maintained uniformly at 1.05 degrees throughout for example throughout your uh sheet uh consequently i guess you are having uh multitudes of different electronic regions within that uh overlay sheets uh i guess uh the precision of it is really just a question of what is the domain extent uh so that that would i guess limit to your active area of a typical uh device right that's right so actually i like to compare magic and notice that i mean i'm in the kitchen so i like to compare my chicken into this type of cellophane film so imagine that when you put two twisted valley graphene one on top each other you have two uh films that are one on top of each other they are never going to be perfectly flat they're going to have bubbles they're going to have some ripples uh so as you as you said the vladimir that was that's exactly the point so the graphene will uh be you know will have some angle in homogeneity so that's a new degree of freedom that we have in the device angle in homogeneity which will affect uh the global transport of the device and right now this is something we cannot uh control so we make a device we aim at 1.1 degree and when i say that a device has a 1.05 degree what i actually mean is that the average when we do transport experiment is 1.05 degree between the electrodes which we're measuring if we had a very long device and we would put many electrodes one after the other would see probably different angles and even within these two electrodes the angle might not be homogeneous but what you're seeing is some sort of average between the twist angle this is why when we give the twist angle we usually give some error that tries to account for this twist angle in homogeneity so this is something actually we're trying to work on controlling trying to make devices that are as long as possible with the minimum amount of bubbles we're improving our techniques we're being able to make larger and larger devices in this direction but we're not quite there where we can make um actually we can make several micron devices that are very flat and have low twist angular in homogeneity uh but we're not quite there at the uh you know longer scale than that i would say oh i i think it also just emphasizes the need for the 2d material foundry that pablo has been emphasizing for a number of years now pablo i see you you are able to reconnect so uh please some somehow my my zoom crash as danny was going into the acknowledgement sorry but i was able to reconnect um i guess vladimir took over the chairship and even asked some questions are there any other questions by anyone for danny maybe while people type let me just add that indeed um vladimir i think while now the physics community is very happy to have a square micron of you know magic angle to stabilize graphene and investigate all its properties they feel good advanced enormously if we could create many devices several microns each or even you know going into the hundreds of microns where the twist standard would be uniform or varying very gradually so that we could you know say in a 100 micron street make multiple devices with slightly different twist angles and would allow us to study investigate the whole thing and for that basically right now we're limited by the mechanical stability the thermal stability the precision of our goniometers and and the number of things like that so having having next generation equipment to to process state-of-the-art devices will be very valuable for the community and to transition to possible applications which you know it's not crazy to think that some of these devices could lead to applications so but of course for that you need to be more you're able to modify and produce them if i can add uh maybe some more questions um until maybe a few more appear in the chat uh please which uh the 2d film on top of the other 2d film would have an optimal position right i mean the optimum position would be zero degrees because that's why that's how nature gives it to us and that minimizes the energetic uh disorder between the top and the bottom or maybe indeed is a potential minimum consequence of that is to ask as you twist that some of the distortions you might be experiencing indeed could be due to the kind of the actual mechanical positioning of paretos you use but i would also imagine there is some inherent uh stress and strain in this strained structure you can almost think of it as a strained semiconductor where you are forcing it into in a position that is not necessarily the most optimal energetically for the system that being said uh there might be magic angles that are mechanically magical meaning that more stable than others is that something that has been investigated at this point uh which is you know is there is there a push back by nature you know you try this angle but it's twisting you back into more optimal uh position because it would minimize the energy of the vulnerable bonds that that's an excellent question vladimir uh so indeed and you know zero degrees is we know it's one of the stable minima of nature so basically if you twist the magic angle twist to the graphene and for example you heat it up it will relax to a more stable configuration very often towards zero degrees same if we apply for example certain fabrication process processes straight ahead then you know if they are violent enough they will relax the the twist angle so we have developed some sort of uh techniques where the first thing we try to do is to pin uh the twist angle at 1.1 degree as soon as the stun is made the stack is made usually by the exact same thing i was telling you before we know that the edges pin the angle even though it changes the the twist angle so we believe that by doing an etching first we're gonna be able to pin uh the twist angle and therefore avoid it to be uh relaxed towards zero degrees uh right now the only uh magic angle twister by the thing that has been experimentally demonstrated in uh graphene is 1.1 degree there are other magic angles that are uh predicted 0.55 and then it scales down but none of them has been demonstrated experimentally in particular also because of this twist angle in homogeneity if you're far away from this twist angle they are probably not as robust as the first magic angle one point one degree so there are other tmd systems for example that have a larger window of uh potential magic angles that would lead to a flat band structure but then we're going to other different materials given the time allow me to just ask one last question i'm going to pass it to pablo to close the event uh the uh i i have been fascinated from the very first demonstration that uh uh your group has done this uh by the periodicity induced through the twist where on the nanoscale you're able to make conductive not conductive uh indeed through that repetition joseph's injection superconducting the demonstrations all of those indeed have been demonstrated it also leads you to recognize that this particular phenomena might make us understand conduction and superconductivity in ways we couldn't do before because finally we have a system that's repetitive on that scale in this domain uh region control that we could never do quite before in such precision um as you look forward uh you know your demonstration of superconductivity is uh still requires sub 1 kelvin type of cooling of the systems uh do we see an ability to maybe in a superconductive regime or in other regimes achieve behaviors of matter at more accessible temperatures uh hence yielding the possibility of beyond just physical appreciation of why the world works the way it does yielding maybe technological advancement akin to the way you're starting to explore with will oliver's group that's another great question um so indeed this is one of the questions we had from the very beginning if we want to make it accessible to the public we need to be able to either increase uh the critical temperature at which all of these phenomena happen or since dramatically the technology nowadays which seems much harder to do so i will you know i will quote one of pablo's examples he gives in his talks to respond to this question and there's actually some theoretical prediction from a group in norway i forgot the name where they claim that if you have graphite that is misaligned one with respect to each other as you increase the number of layers potentially then the critical temperature presumably increases so now we can try three layers four layer five layers and if we go to bulk graphite where the layers are twisted one will respect each other potentially we can increase and the critical temperature of magic and goodies geography for that i would say we also have to kind of reinvent a little bit the techniques we're fabricating these devices so right now we take a long graphene we till it apart because it's one single piece we know the crystallographic axes are aligned and we sit apart half of the graphene with an hbn flake we put on top of each other we rotate 1.1 degree with a motor and we stack them on top of each other so that you can do maybe one time two times if you really push it and have a long graphic uh it is not uh very scalable if you use micro mechanical exfoliated graphene we could go to cvd graphene we could use to any other type of uh you know long scale made graphene and eventually try this type of experiments in a much uh bigger scale so there is a possibility that uh this will happen i guess it's just a matter of uh keeping trying and uh more pgt is coming that's great to hear uh although uh leave it to pablo to conclude thank you okay uh thank you very much all of you for for you know for for attending this mit nano explorations talk thank you very much to to dani for for the talk and uh you know just to conclude that uh you know i think this this this field is really emerging and opening a big big avenue for exploration as the title of the seminar series is and i hope that there will be plenty other you know physics talks to follow up in this series and again thank you very much everyone and we'll be looking forward to the next mit and exploration talk thank you everyone you
