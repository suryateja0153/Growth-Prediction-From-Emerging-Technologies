 [Music] greetings to you we continue our discussion on ion selective electrodes and in my last class I had taught you about the limit of detection of the several ions using ion selective electrodes I had also told you that it is there we do not know any other technique which can determine the concentrations of the metal ions as well as any ons at these concentrations so now I am going to describe to you the solid state ion selective electrodes there what happens is in recent years lot of research has gone into making metal oxide semi conductors that is known as mos metal oxide semi conductors and these are basically semiconductors with field effect transistors so they have specific properties for conduction of the in the electrons and ions etcetera and they are popularly known as MOSFET semi metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors have been developed and these are something like solid-state devices for carrying out the chemical analysis etcetera they have been used quite a lot here a thin ion selective little membrane thin means really thin of the order of about 10 raise to minus 4 centimeter less than micron size may be below micron size that is interfaced with a thin mosfet that is the base which is encased in a non conducting shield I will show you a figure something like this here you see the membrane at the bottom red color so this contains the solid state ion selective electrode with a metal oxide semiconductor both are sealed here in the membrane and here other things as usual this is an internal solution of the analyte this is silver silver chloride reference electrode and this is the basically a plastic cylinder small cylinder and this whole thing looks like an electrode okay and this is sealed etcetera etcetera and then it goes to meter and we have a connection from here one more for a measurement completion of the circuit so the response time of such an electrode is defined as the time taken for the cell EMF to reach a value which is 1 millivolt from the final equilibrium value so the response time is obviously affected by the type of the electrode and particularly the nature of the membrane size of the membrane thickness of the membrane structure of the membrane and all those parameters that define the characteristics of a membrane it is also affected by the presence of interfering ions obviously and any changes in temperature also because most of the semiconductors have characteristics which are responsive to changes in the temperature so the response time is usually obviously affected by the all these things so if anywhere you use any mosfet electrode the manufacturer will prescribe to you the optimum time for minimum time for major wave midway measurement sometimes the digital meter or digital interface through which we read the numbers screen the digital screen is programmed to become active after a particular lapse of time maybe 5 seconds 2 seconds 2 minutes something like that so the instruction will say connect all these things put your sample measure the absorbance after two days sorry after two minutes you can say majorly you will get the reading or after wait for two minutes you will get the reading and so that is the whole idea is this MOSFET takes a little time for getting into equilibrium state general details of the care and maintenance of such electrodes are usually given in the literature this is what I was trying to tell you so when the membrane is placed in contact with a test solution containing appropriate ions whatever we want to determine that is hydrogen na+ k+ etcetera a potential develops and affects the current flowing through the transistors between the positive and negative terminals the measurements can be carried out with very small volumes of liquid and find application in biochemical analysis and intracellular measurements this intracellular measurement means basically you can put the electrode inside a human body you want to measure spinal fluid you just make a hole here at the back insert it and see what are the changes possible such intracellular measurements can be made with MOSFETs and I am sensitive feel the effect transistors these are known as ice FET I am sensitive field effect transistor electrodes have been specially developed for such purposes they have been there developed as non-glass we do not want foreign material to be inserted which is not compatible with our blood tissues etcetera so it should preferably be non glass because if the glass breaks there will be glass pieces hanging around inside the body which can cause problems and they should be rugged and clock resistant such probes required for working with liquids semi solids we enter pH measurements and they're difficult conditions so I sweat and MOSFETs are one of the recent innovations in the ion selective electrodes biochemical electrodes are an another set of electrodes basically they are all ISEF an increasing number of electrodes are being developed for such things what they do is to convert chemical into ionic chemicals into ionic products which can be classic all is quantified using is EF for example look at this equation 0 NH 2 twice h2o and water these are all water is available in our body 94% so water wherever we want to deal yeah anywhere in the body water will be a an essential component so CO NH 2 twice this is the ion and this is the H+ in presence of acid ammonia will be released and that will give you ammonium ion plus co2 carbon dioxide let's not cobalt and that is carbon co urea so the concentration of NH 4 i NH ions can be converted into urea present because here we are going to measure NH 4 plus as a response that can be converted into urea C 1 H 2 twice in the urea NH 2 0 NH 2 that's how I remember you the formula many people remember as a CO and H 2 twice or I prefer NH 2 C 1 H 2 that also tells me about the structure of urea so if urea is there acidity acidic material is there and then ammonium ions are released carbon dioxide is generated and the concentration of ammonium ions can be converted into urea present the you raise is an enzyme that is does this job of converting urea into ammonium ions the you raise is incorporated into a poly acrylamide gel it is set in the bulb of the glass electrode and held in place by a nylon gauze or it may be immobilized on to bovine serum albumin or even on to nylon so bovine serum albumin when you heat it it forms a sort of membrane you know nylon also we can use we can use nylon membrane II or any other membrane which you will act as a support so the potential developed is given by E cell is equal to K plus point zero two nine five log of activity of the urea so biochemical IOC's have been available commercially for penciling digoxin etc so let us discuss a little bit about the instrumentation and measurement of cell EMF if this cell can be either pH meter or is a way I am selective electrode meter okay basically operation of all will be essentially same so direct reading pH meters are available using solid-state circuitry they are useful and more accurate to measure small DC potential such as those from IOC's the modern pH meter can read up to point zero zero one pitch that is a fantastic Nernst equation makes it mandatory for temperature compensation because if you are want to you if you are accuracy required is point zero zero one P obviously it will be a function of temperature the Nernst equation now RT by NF RT by NF Ln H plus so the temperature he has got a direct effect on the quality of the pH and determination accuracy of pH determination so we want to make it a temperature whatever temperature we measure we need to compensate for the temperature difference from the normal measurement systems so this needs say biasing control which is something to do with electronics and electronics people if you tell them that you need a biasing control for temperature correction they will do it for you and I am NOT going into details how such a circuit can be made or how what sort of components go into that that will be part of electronics who if you are studying electronics you will be knowing about such things but such things should be available in the in the market shelf so all you got to do is buy that chip and then fix it into the you know into them meter pH meter so the biasing control will be there so whatever is the temperature or suppose room temperature is 25 and the today's temperature is 30 so you can make the compensation for by using turning a knob and then it can be manual or it can be automated also there's nothing very special about adjusting the a knob you using correct temperature in calibration nowadays these things are done automatically and it makes a lot of sense so some instruments include a slope control so what is a sope control if a meter is calibrated around pH for a measurement of nine would introduce some sort of error this I have already told you isn't it so in the alkaline range the error can be as much as one unit around pH 12 so the what do we need to do every time I want to standardize a pH meter I need to use a buffer so what is the buffer what should be the pH of the buffer which we want to use for Standardization we need to use a pH 4 buffer that is potassium tartrate solid potassium hydrogen phthalates is a standard material even that potassium hydrogen collected is available in the market as small tablets which you can resolve it in hundred ml use it as a buffer standard buffer so we use a calibrated buffer at pH 4 and then I want to measure a pH around 9.2 we know that it will not show their correct pH so in such case what do you do we have to adjust slope to RT by NF what is the RT by NF R is gas constant T is temperature and his number of electrons and F is fairly so whatever number you get that should be the slope so if I adjust the slope to RT by NF value that is then it is adjusted in such a way that a pH of 9.2 buffer should be read correctly as 9.2 that means 9.2 means 9.20 here also it must read nine point two zero not nine point three or nine point four or nine point one but nine point two zero I have decided not to write one more zero here because most of 90 percent of the pH meters are accurate to the second decimal i am rounding it off so nine point two zero would be should be read as 9.20 only in such case slope control is interested to read nine point two zero accurately then again pH for air to wash it change the solution from nine point two to remove it wash the electrode three times four times five times ten times because it's buffer so buffer che buffer will not change after one wash the pH of the buffer will not change after one wash so it will you have to wash it number of Tanks dry too using a tissue paper not a an ordinary paper or filter paper that will leave scratches on the membrane so such things should be avoided you have to just Pat it dry using tissue paper so wash it four or five times Pat it dry with tissue paper throw the filter paper again wash it and then put pH 4 buffer and then assume that the pH four if you adjust it like that if it gives shows pH four again you are ready for measurement of the pH in between solutions so what is the mode of operation for pH and I assume it is very simple all you got to do is switch it on and let it warm up normally 90 percent of the laboratories what happens is we come to the laboratory put the machine on and hold a it will be on as long as we are working only when we go up go home we switch it off and then go it doesn't require a lot of current or any other care except that we have to make sure that the water should be if the electrode must be in contact with the water all the time so whenever you want to measure you just have to remove that water put your sample solution and check so we standardize the pH meter once in the morning and maybe you in between if necessary otherwise next day morning they can do that many people do it once in a week or something that is also possible and usually when we have buffer the life of a buffer can extend up to six months sometimes the buffer will develop fungus so you will have to just filter it and use it to use the buffer regularly so all those things are part of the instructions and instruction manuals will tell you how to take care of before how to standardize and all those details here I am giving you only a bird's eye view of the maintenance of IOC meters or buffer meters I have seen in many engineering colleges and even arts and science colleges people do not know how to take care of the electrodes and 99% of the time whenever I visited colleges and they show sir this is our pH meter I always see that the pH meter is dry and if the pH meter is dry you will never get a proper reading out of that and the same thing goes true with ion selective electrode salts so if you if you take care of the Machine machine will take care of you so it is I am writing this slide especially for your benefit if you are part of the teaching faculty or part of the laboratory make sure that your laboratory if it has a pH meter or ion selective electrode keep it properly so that every time you you are ready to use it should be available if the pH pH electrode is dry then there is the ion exchange capacity will go down and you may never get the correct pH so we always advise always keep this electrode in the in a solution in a beaker dip it in a beaker come and top it up once in two days once in three days make sure that the water does not dry in the beaker and electrode also should not drive a beaker sometimes what happens is if the for some reason electrode is dried and you are not able to use it we dip it in HCl solution of about one molar solution and then keep it for a day or two and then try it if it doesn't work you have no other go except to throw it out and buy another electrode okay so getting back to this slide the normal procedure for operation of ion selective electrode is switch it on and let it warm up adjust the temperature control of the day maybe April in India everywhere approximately 25 degree centigrade should be ideal maybe 30 27 is also okay 27 is the average in India adjust the pH of the after putting the temperature control you have to adjust the buffer pH of the buffer solution to 4 and adjust the meter to read the pH 4 then you can remove the buffer wash the electrode properly like what I have described earlier and then test the solution for pH use only tissue paper to tap the membrane dry and then after measurement place the electrode in distilled water and do not allow it to dry again so how do I operate a fluoride meter essentially same thing here what we do is prepare 0.5 1 to 10 milligram per liter of standard fluoride ion solution you open any text book they will describe to you what salt of fluoride you should use and where it is available and what should be the quantity dissolved and how to make that solution so I assume that you all know such things and then so now I am putting it as a first sentence prepare 0.5 ppm that is milligram per liter and then 1 milligram per liter this is double and then 1 to 2 again 100% double and to 210 500 times level you have 500 times isn't it 2 to 10 five times so 10 melee fighter or teh up to 10 milligram from 0.5 to 10 milligram per 10 ppm you can use a prepare standard fluoride ion solutions then what else you need you need a tea is a bee solution it is nothing but cyclohexane diamino tetra acetic acid so you have to mix 57 milliliter of acetic acid 58 grams of sodium chloride 4 grams of cyclohexane tetromino die a minute a tri stic acid and then 500 ml of distilled water you have to adjust a pH to 5.5 and dilute to 1 liter with deionized water we do not want any ionic strength to be changed whenever we want to prepare such samples so we use only di water for dilutions then we can prepare our 10 milligram per liter of fluoride solution at 20 m 5 ml of dissolution measure the EMF using reference electrode reference electrode a usually is available or you can buy one or it is incorporated in the fluoride meter itself then we have to oliver to do is press the button measure their EMF using a reference electrode for all the standards now down the reading whatever it comes draw a calibration curve verse of EMF versus concentration and determine the concentration of they are known in modern gadgets what do they do is they restore the calibration curve in the memory assume that assuming that all other parameters are constant then if everything is stored all you have to do when you go on a field test is you just take the sample D pure fluoride matter simply read the concentration it will measure the EMF refer it to the calibration curve stored in the memory and it will display the concentration directly on to the display screen so now I want to describe to you what is a grand plot a grand plot is a very simple system of measurement a of measuring the RT by NF value that is the slope usually we say RT by NF two point three note three RT by NF is the slope of the electrode in contact with a solution when we make the calibration curve but if antilog of this quantity n f divided by two point three not three this is the sort of RT by this is not RT by NF this is an F by two point three not reality one over RT is plotted against reagent volume we should get a straight line this is a very simple concept so when this line is extrapolated it cuts the horizontal axis at a point corresponding to the concentration of the test solution so grand platz papers are available commercially because you have to plot the antilog value of NF by 2.3 not three RT so here is a grand plot for you and here here on the x-axis we have a titrant base volume in ml and then this is the x intercept the grain plots are here now RT by NF L is anti logs and this is in acidic medium see how beautifully the whole series of points are connected so here it is the acidic grain function on the left side and with the red one we have the alkaline their grain plots so the slope of the alkaline solution is minus o h ma - then 10 raised to minus B by kW and this is the other one and here is the potential on both sides and the intercept these the concentration of the substance that is volume so such grand plots if you refer to any research papers based on ion selective electrodes or the pH a metal ion electrodes you will come across several such presentations where they refer to grand plots don't get confused it is only the slope anti log of the slope plotted against reagent added so it is easy to handle the signal that is why so here we complete our discussion on the ion selective electrodes and we go into another concept of the electrochemical technology that is electrochemical sensors slowly we are moving from basic electrochemical the technology of measurement of voltage current etcetera on to this potentiometry precipitation reactions redox reactions polarography conductor AMA tree and then Karl Fischer titration and selective electrodes now we are moving into the world of sensors so after so we'll be dealing with the process effluents and other things and the electrochemical sensors I had to tell you that the oldest chemical electrochemical sensors laid back to 1950s almost 70 years before they were already there and they were used for oxygen monitoring they described to you the oxygen membranes as those things were being measured even around 1950s more recently the OSHA Occupational Safety and Health Administration began requiring the monitoring of toxic and combustible gases in come find confined space applications and new and better electrochemical sensors have been developed this is very important because confined spaces there is always a danger of someone getting confused someone getting hurt if there is not enough oxygen for example if AC weather or something is to be repaired a person goes down the sewer there is no oxygen lot of hydrogen sulfide will be there he will suffocate and die such things we keep on seeing in the newspapers all the time so we also come across situations where a person is confined in a particular place especially mines in every spiars confined space they keep on working and the oxygen level needs to be monitored very regularly whenever combustion is taking place we want to measure the what is the oxygen available for combustion because oxygen is a must for combustion treatment so by the mid-80s miniaturized electrochemical centers became available it's not very far you know we're all students at that time and then they were all new gadgets exciting gadgets for measurement and many of our colleagues were working on the electrochemical sensors at that time in R&D laboratories and we were all witness to developments exciting developments in the world of miniaturized Asian as well as electro chemical sensors world nowadays it is a world of sensor because wherever any monitoring is to be done we say why don't you put a sensor there you want to measure the temperature in there above the surface of the earth 20 kilometers above the earth we say ok put a balloon put a sensor there in a balloon so switch it on when it goes to 20 kilometers so you want to measure how much is peroxyacid nitrate in the stratosphere put some simply a balloon send the balloon there and then switch it on and then measure the altitude measure the altitude measure the sample peroxy as'll nitrate like that thousands of sensors for various chemical entities have been developed they are available in the market and there are not many made in India in that concept in that aspect Indian India is an underdeveloped country anyway as far as technology is concerned and many of the detection for toxic gases even now they are not available in India recently I wanted to measure the sulfur dioxide and then VOCs volatile organic carbons in an environment about 300 meters above the coming from a stack but there were no Indian equipments available for thee for me monitoring such VOCs what is they we will see we will see is a volatile organic carbon many of the organic carbons many of the organic solvents below the boiling point of 350 degrees are referred to as VOCs 90 percent of the petrochemical combustion gases would be VOCs and any solvent is a vo C among the VOCs there are methane waste and non-methane based non methane-based would be aromatic solvents and may be aliphatic solvents also but those based on methane or chcl3 ch3cl and then ch2cl2 think like that they are all ozone damaging compounds so you know in general we will see that classified as methane and nonmetal lewis's I found out that when I wanted to measure organic solvents like methanol acetone estar the egg and then ketones not one electrochemical sensor was available for measuring their concentration at high altitude so anyway but such things are available in the market there are people who will import them and sell it to you and the detection for many different toxic gases in PL ranges with the sensors exhibiting good sensitivity and selectivity so miniaturized sensors are available and they would be I have shown them here so the sensor you can see the sensors here very small sensors maybe about 5 centimeter and this could be about 10 centimeter here these are all to May to centimeter etcetera etcetera and such sensors are available very easy to fit in the electrochemical circuitry and they can show you they can show you the data on a display screen in wherever you are sitting at a longer some other distance so it is like having a camera and for detective camera in a particular place there so if this will be a detecting a sensor for particular specific chemicals and a variety of chemicals electro chemical sensors became available for the detection of toxic gases and then with sensors exhibiting good sensitivity and selectivity currently a variety of electrochemical sensors are being used extensively in many stationary and portable applications for personal safety you can even carry a sensor in your pocket and you can carry many of the sensors on your body for example I am carrying a micro microphone here but I can carry you can three my pen EF I can carry instead of the pen it can be a sensor if I'm a minor worker I can put it here and go down the sensor will catch all the radiations coming from the earth and there are a lot of radiations called something like red ants and radioactive material I can pick it up and then if the radioactive component from in my body goes up I will be put out of action for some time until the radiation level comes down so it's important to measure not only the physical parameter such as this temperature pressure if they're working places and then radiation levels and then oxygen level nitrogen carbon monoxide level and all those things fire people would like to be terribly afraid of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide also so sir wherever there are fire chances carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide sensors are required so the physical size and geometry and selection of the various components and construction of an electrochemical sensor usually depends on its intended use we will continue our studies on the sensors in the next class probably I will explain to you more about their functions we will not go into details of the manufacturing because basically most of them would be based on electrochemical sensors like membranes and other things which we have already discussed in the previous class that is ion selective electrode thank you very much
