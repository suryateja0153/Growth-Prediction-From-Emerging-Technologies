 yeah welcome everyone uh beginning in 2018 the purdue engineering distinguished lecture series uh really started uh inviting uh world-renowned um faculty and professionals um to purdue engineering to encourage thought provoking discussions and conversations and ideas really with our faculty and students regarding the grand challenges and opportunities in their fields now besides presenting a lecture to a broad audience of faculty grad and undergraduate students they also engage in an interactive panel with purdue faculty other stakeholders and experts as well as students today's panel is about thermal and energy management challenges in large-scale sustainable computing systems uh truly a grand challenge for engineering that arises at the intersection of exponential growth of the digital data of sustainability and new materials in electronics now without further ado i'd like to introduce the moderator for today's panel my colleague justin weibell justin is a research associate professor in the school of mechanical engineering at purdue university he is the director of the cooling technologies research center a graduated nsf iucrc that addresses research and development needs of companies and organizations in the area of high performance heat removal from compact spaces dr weibel's research group explores methodologies for prediction and control of heat transport to enhance the performance and efficiency of thermal management technologies and energy transfer processes he has been a key contributor to the development of transformative cooling technologies supported by darpa navsea onr src in addition to numerous sponsored research projects that transition these technologies to industry in projects with funding totaling over 10 million dollars uh dr weibel will be the general chair of ieee's item conference in 2021 he's associate editor of the ieee transactions and components packaging manufacturing technology dr weibo's academic record includes the supervision of 24 phd students 11 master students he's authored more than 140 referee journal and conference papers and was recently recognized as an outstanding teacher engineering teacher by the college of engineering here at purdue and received the 2020 asme electronic and photonic packaging division young engineer award uh over to you justin thank you for the introduction uh arvind and you know my parents panelists are equally and more accomplished than i am so we'll get to introduce them here in a few moments but uh really pleased to moderate the panel today and and i'll talk about and i wanted to start and maybe i'll just tell everyone kind of what we'll go through is i'll read a brief abstract to just kind of set the stage for what the panelists will discuss today before i introduce them um and then we'll go ahead and have a couple of key topics to do that so if i if i kind of read a short kind of abstract that was prepared and wanted to explain what we'll talk about you know it is our digital economy and it's this rapid growth in the applications we know about and hear about cloud computing 5g ai autonomous vehicles and all of these data-driven technologies are generating huge amounts of data and so there's a projections right by 2025 we'll have 175 zettabytes of data and no one knows what a zettabyte is because it's a ridiculous amount of right 10 to the power 21 bytes and to put it in perspective the total amount of data in the world that was kind of out there was only a single zettabyte in 2012 so this is really exploding and all of this data is residing in these large centers that are the backbone of the internet enabling computation storage management of all of this information and these data centers are extremely energy intensive so they use and consume about one percent um of the worldwide electricity usage maybe a little more and there's projections for various growth models of whether that's going way up depending on how we intervene or can we keep it right at a reasonable amount but regardless that's on the same carbon footprint as basically the aviation industry so it's a massive amount and in this very big picture challenge right of of large data center energy usage we can still drill down to like the transistors inside of it and there you've then you're dealing with heat flux densities equivalent to the surface of the heat flux of the sun so right you've got this multi-scale right problem where you have energy and thermal management from a few nanometers to the size of football or soccer fields and so we need to engineer these computing systems to be right efficient reliable and sustainable and so this is why we need to have right research at the intersection of this electronics packaging reliability techno-economic policy it's really imperative to these large systems so our panel today we've got industry and academic experts i personally feel that this is a an area where there's been a great history of industry academic partnerships um and to discuss their perspectives on how engineers can rise to the challenge of this particular problem and talk us through that so that's the background um i want to introduce our panelists i'll kind of just have them say hello um short short bios here just so we don't take up too much time but uh you know first professor reggie aganifer is our distinguished lecturer he's a member of the national academy of engineering a distinguished university professor of mechanical engineering at the university of texas arlington he has not one but two centers he's the site director of nnsf iucrc on energy efficient systems as well as the director of the electronics systems packaging center um at ut arlington and his research is on data center cooling 3d packaging and the cooling and reliability of micro and power electronic systems so welcome uh reggie great to have you here uh of course uh it's just absolutely uh we also have one of our new faculty um that we're really eager to start working with and collaborating with prevent professor rebecca she's an assistant professor in mechanical engineering and holds a joint appointment appointment in environmental and ecological engineering at purdue and her research is at the intersection of technology economics and policy to enable transition to decarbonized energy systems um so welcome rebecca great to have you here so dr ashish gupta he is the director of the thermo mechanical solutions at intel's data platforms group so he leads all thermal and mechanical architecture execution and innovations development for intel's full technology portfolio and that's this long list of different technologies and where they insert right their devices and of course i'd like to point out always he was recently recognized as well and will soon be awarded an outstanding mechanical engineering alumni award um for purdue because he got his phd here with uh professor jay gore in 2004. um so welcome issues thank you for joining professor carol handworker is the reinhard schuman professor of materials engineering at purdue she also has a joint appointment i know in eee as well and her research applies thermodynamics kinetic theory experiments with phase transformations and interface motion uh to solve important industrial and scientific problems um and i know she's been a lot involved a lot in the adoption or facilitating the adoption of lead free solders and electronics and a whole host of life cycle analysis reliability assessment of these systems so thank you for joining carol um and then we have doctor uh madua yengar who's a senior staff data center engineer at google and so in that role he's involved in the design and delivery of next generation i.t and data center if infrastructure i'll point out he's really a community leader in our field in our community on the industry side in thinking about energy efficient cooling technologies and road mapping activities he's the organizer and has helped uh been instrumental to writing the chapter on thermal management in the ieee heterogeneous integration roadmap as well so very pleased to have him here thank you okay so now i want to ask some questions and get the discussion going and stop talking myself um so i think we should start as kind of with some icebreakers because maybe many students and others in the audience are not really familiar with these topics so i i start with you uh deredjay if someone or a graduate student in the room wasn't familiar with what a data center is what it entails why is it consuming all of this energy and what are we doing for thermal management could you just give us a brief introduction to that to set the stage yeah so data center can be a large or small infrastructure that houses electronic equipment such as servers storage devices and so on and the purpose of it is really to transmit uh digital information so we have id pods that may be a few hundred square feet like the ones we built i'll talk about that later and uh we have companies like uh facebook i don't think marduk knows what that is just kidding but as uh for example in the local area in fort worth 800 000 square feet a data center right so and more so it's it's the size can be quite significant and you can certainly appreciate how important it is especially during the covert times being able to have access to information so it's really an infrastructure that houses equipment dealing with digital data and of course they they are then consuming right large amounts of energy to do that right and and what is produced from that the inefficiencies is a ton of heat right and and how to manage that yes i i could talk about that if you want me to as well i know i i think i think that's um you know just kind of the premise um so when we talk about it and and so thank you rayjay and you know i think we've got a couple of industry panelists on too so as sheesh madu i'd kind of kick it to you to say you know i know this is an area where there's been a lot of progress if you look at you know since the last decade we all know that the installed capacity it's like 500 something else but we actually haven't used that much more energy for computation so what what have people done to solve this challenge is just looking backward a little bit maybe before we look ahead sure you want me to go first justin yeah sure sure yeah i think uh you had a huge boom i think after the dot-com bust and data center growth in the 2000s and i think there was an intense amount of scrutiny on energy consumption and efficiency and a lot of good things came out of that in terms of reducing the cooling consumption best practices so i think the last 20 years has been a pretty awesome journey in improving uh the reducing the ratio of cooling energy use divided by the power power used by the i.t and i think where i see is going is that's only part of the story but the other part of the story is devices are getting more and more powerful which means they consume more power they have higher power density part of the reason for that is you know you have the mool's law where you keep adding devices and also reducing the length scale of the devices but you also have something called the end of dinard scaling where until about 2006 as you shrunk the devices the power consumption also reduced a great deal but you don't see that happening to that much extent so what it means is as you put more transistors on a chip and you don't reduce the power linearly you're going to have higher power densities so relating that back to energy efficiency the bar is now higher you need to you need to do the same highly efficient job with a much harder task of removing heat more more effectively yeah is it would it be wrong to kind of say that you know in the last we were able to kind of identify there was a lot of low hanging fruit previously right we knew of these like horrible inefficiencies laying out data centers you know just you know mixing hot and cold air streams those things have been resolved and now moving forward and especially with the end of this you know on the electrical device side we could just scale it smaller reduce power when that started to end then it became more and more challenging and will be a lot harder going forward yeah yeah exactly so yeah any thoughts on just that history sure i mean uh i think you guys said it correctly uh but uh i think the the history piece of it i think will continue with us for a little bit longer in my opinion you know a lot of when we establish those huge data centers that regi talked about or even smaller ones which may be very uh big cost investment for some of the companies which did that they want to operate it for as long as they can and at the same time their data processing needs are continuously increasing so they're trying to push the limits right i think even a small you know decimal point improvement in efficiency can actually mean millions and millions of dollars of savings so i do anticipate that the companies will just keep on pushing optimizing as they try to upgrade to the newer products which require more power they don't want to really go about changing the entire infrastructure or building another 800 or 1000 or a million square foot data center so how do i get the latest technology really service my customers in the is this existing infrastructure but i guess in that so it's still going to be we can live off these kind of percentage gains because it still means a lot right by economically there okay yeah and uh but at the same time like you started this panel right where we said in 2012 one zeta byte and 20 25 175 zeta byte right right so i mean as of now only the half of our data that we have right now was just created in the last past two years so we have reached this inflection point where entire industries are getting reshaped by leveraging data so while we see examples of digital transformation emerging it's important to remember that only less than two percent of the world data has been analyzed right it's like it's like the new oil right i think this term has been there for a while that data is the new oil and just like you dig in and you extract the oil you have to that data exists but people we have not really started drilling it out and being able to use it in an efficient way yeah yeah but so then i guess that's where i you know you kind of say it'll continue and where i kind of ask and would would be interested in all your opinions on is so if it is this massive increase right all the data was in the last two years we probably can't make efficiency gains at the same rate of the creation of data there's just no way to have exponential efficiency gains like there are increases in data so the total use has to go up right significantly in the end and we can't kind of maintain this level i think that's kind of the problem we're facing exactly i think uh you know sublinear growth is a popular term right growth is uh is is going to happen it's how how can you reduce the growth of energy with the growth of the business so the growth of the data data mining data consumption so trying to reduce that cost function or energy function or environmental function subdue that as much as you can while the actual growth of uh the internet and the cloud continues yeah so we're talking about uh growth of like energy and and uh economics and other things so now is my opportunity to pass it over to uh rebecca i think um you know your ex that's your focus of you know the lab and group you're establishing at purdue is this techno-economic assessment so can you just give us a little background about that and maybe where you see intersections with this community sure so most of my work to date has focused on electricity energy storage um so somewhat different than data storage uh so you gotta you can't just say storage is a shorthand in this talk um but so thinking about how we take technologies that have already been adopted so for consumer electronics everybody has a lithium ion battery in your cell phone um but how do you take those kinds of technologies and scale them up into systems that are low cost enough that we would want to use them in our cars or use them on our electricity grids to really incorporate more and more renewable energy and so when you start asking these different questions what might matter a lot in uh designing a battery for uh consumer electronics uh might not be all that important once you get up to these bigger and bigger uh battery systems you know for if you're trying to store energy for eight to 16 hours a day you might have very different requirements than you might have when you're thinking about these smaller scale systems and so how can you best manipulate the manufacturing process kind of change the design at like the fundamental materials level in a way that will reduce the cost the overall system level so how can you kind of take advantage of those to ultimately build these decarbonized energy systems to provide the electricity that's reliable enough to power you know our cars to switch over transportation but also providing all of the other electricity that we use whether it's in data centers or just in day-to-day life yeah and that's i i i liked the parallel between all of your work on battery systems and battery storage because you've thought about like the scaling of storage of energy right that perspective and this is on data and it i don't know if all the parallels exist but there are some and and i think it is this is a techno-economic driven thing right in general and what we can do and if we need new technologies um you know you know directed you know about trying to get technology transition right from right to industry it's hard and it's driven by right a more complex set of things than just right good thermal performance or cooling performance or other types of things yeah good yeah do you want to comment sure actually i wanted to say that the projections in electricity usage uh that if you look at and i'll show that in a slide later what was projected uh say in 2010 has significantly dropped because of improved management people like google and facebook hyperscale and hyperscale and uh and the cloud versus 10 years ago they're now going to be 90 percent it's going to be hybrid scale versus uh the traditional being 90 in 2010 right so there is so we are actually doing a really good job of improved efficiency so if you include best practices and and hyper scale your efficiency rate really can go down quite a bit you know you improve quite a bit and thus uh reduce the uh electricity usage so so we're actually doing a pretty good job we but we got to continue to do that yeah yeah this the idea of just with scale you can do things at scale you might not be able to do in these small outfits but but there's always the need for small too where there's like latency driven applications and needs small but it as it migrates and you know this massive data explosion i think is is going to be stored on hyperscale right systems okay carol it's i want to involve you too because kind of the other angle and aspect of this is not the energy use just associated with like okay the electricity being consumed but there's also these are not these are item you know products with a life cycle that get used and especially the turnover on electrical systems is quite fast and and the lifespan of them and there's an energy cost associated with that i know you've worked a lot on life cycle assessment of these systems can you can you kind of tell us more about what you've done there and your thoughts sure so um we've been talking so far about the fact that you know with data centers when doing a life cycle assessment you have the original energy cost and all the other costs there are like 11 different environmental and human health impacts associated with that anytime you j just for the manufacturing and putting it into place there are these costs that are associated with it that have to be divided by n where n is the number of years that the setter is going to be operating so it depends critically on what the reliability is what the business models are associated with the um replacement of the various parts of this and it's much more nuanced and is much richer than just figuring out what are the energy costs in a given year so i've done a lot of work with the electronics industry actually with google uh microsoft and cisco and seagate just in hyperscale data centers for hard drives so those hardware hard drives and ssds are swapped out every two years they still have three years of warranty in them but as was brought up before you want to be able to keep scaling the the services um and the equipment with with the demand so you want to be able to go up a factor of two or a factor of four in storage and so keeping the same physical footprint of the facility so life cycle assessment um is really sort of retrospective what one really needs to do is uh think about this as a circular economy and google is really great at this they sell over a million hard drives a year in the open market that they retire so and other systems they they sell these sell these in a cascading way through the the um through the world economy so these are other points just to remember yeah and carol i i said i'd warn you if your audio is cutting out so we did so maybe you want to go you know video but excellent um yeah so if maybe carol you mentioned before you might you're going to have to leave paris and and turn turn your video on yeah yeah but is the audio better right now the audio is better now yeah okay so basically there are a lot of different components i don't know what you heard that was part of that but um there are many more components that are actually switched out and their life cycle costs and and economic costs associated with those and it's really important that the more general public out there understand that um the companies are actually being very aggressive with respect to making sure they're just not putting these in the trash and that the the energy that's already um um embedded in all of these products they they actually aren't going to waste either yeah and that's another kind of critical perspective of this and one that's i don't know i always talk about and think about is like this hidden energy use that right can't be ignored but i think industry does a great job of being aware of that you know from a research perspective what is you know i know there's a lot of faculty at purdue working on life cycle assessment or however you know design for life cycle how does research help intersect and affect that process and inform what industry is doing how do we help and that so one of the key ways that we can help is that if there are these technological gaps that we take into account economic assessment like cycle assessment logistics as quickly as possible in as early as stage as possible in the technology development and because we don't want to develop a technology that nobody's going to use so that really it's been our approach that you know for low these ultra low low temperature solders that are being uh developed we're doing it with intel and major companies because we want to make sure that there aren't stow shoppers shows show stoppers along the way and they see it as a critical technology so we're getting involved with basically the whole range of stakeholders suppliers for the new technologies equipment manufacturers you know we work with glam industries or lamb research that is developing a lot of tooling applied materials and with asml so um you know that that's how we try to to mitigate the risks of doing things that aren't relevant so when we're working on you know advanced liquid cooling solutions and things i should be talking to you about whether or not we're using you know materials and fluids that have some horrible right long-term costs or benefits and i should be talking to you know rebecca about you know other kinds of economic assessments and how much they cost i think that's the point is that we've just got a it's a big picture this one is a big picture problem and it's we won't get we need lots of creative and good ideas but to get them matured uh early on we need to consider this even right and also operation environments are very important so i know that duraje has worked a lot on corrosion effects so in practice and uh um i was talking with my colleagues at juniper the other day where they they talked about a case that they had heard of where the there's actually a gradient in corrosion from where the air inlet air comes in to the air uh that that leaves the system so it's it's all of those things plus the um the harsh environments and the different locations where where things are going to be used well i think um you know we've kind of set the stage a little bit had some conversation and i hope everyone in the audience now is thinking about questions they would have for the panelists so i'll just say and and i i should introduce aditya candadai is a phd student you know working in this space and area so he he's kind of the moderator looking at q a so please do actually use the q a function if you have questions for the panelists uh we'll turn to him uh periodically throughout the event to kind of draw anything uh draw drops and questions if you have any so do type them there um i i don't know if we have any now or if we can go in i have a couple i have a couple of questions and i got from the q a that i can uh have for the panelists right now yeah let's let's do a question from the panel okay yeah so there's one question in the q a about uh different levels of liquid cooling solutions for data centers and if they can talk about like some of the examples and their opinions about what the future of these and where they they see the broader adoption of each of these technologies okay i can i can start on that one if that's okay with you justin anything yeah i'm not here to stop anyone from talking go ahead okay yeah so uh tradition i mean liquid cooling right this is about liquid cooling in data centers i think liquid cooling is already been extensively used in our data centers i mean first you have something maybe you call as free air cooling where you have data centers that's extremely cold temperatures we're just able to utilize air but as you try to pack more and more products or there's more system densification that happens at the data center the power goes up sometimes uh what over time what we have seen is that more and more companies are moving towards some form of liquid cooling where either you take the heat away from the in the air and then you cool the air through liquid and then you companies are trying to bring that liquid closer and closer to the place where the heat is getting generated so when it comes to like things like cold plate they are actually now getting quite popular over the last few years and uh at some point i think in the future we do anticipate that the fluid is going to get even more closer to the silicon and uh if you look if you just google liquid cooling micro channels silicon micro channels you're going to see a lot of papers research work happening in that i do see a big hurdle until we get that point because it is uh that's the place where the companies which are making the product and the companies which are deploying those products they really have to come very close to make that kind of a reality happen another big shift that we are starting to see right now is something called as immersion cooling i know this is has been an area in the indus in the academia for quite a bit of time i know professor derek has been working on it for also for a long time and i'm seeing an explosion of interest in that space now some of it is driven by edge computing and the anticipation of 5g coming the amount of data that is going to get created is going to be so big so so huge that it is not economical to move that data to a data center and get it processed over there for various reasons and if this time you can get into it or in interest so companies are trying to analyze the data either it's uh you know try really utilize that oil that like talked about earlier very close to the place where the data is getting generated and that's leading to some computing happening at all kinds of locations uh altitudes pollution and you cannot really have this keep on designing those individual small data centers so there's something called immersion cooling when you have a dielectric fluid and you immerse the entire system in the dielectric fluid so you're not really utilizing even fans in that space so that that is uh becoming very popular recently and i and expect it to really explode in the coming years all right i can inject too yeah i was going to ask you to please please so i i think uh just like she said that um you know obviously you want free cooling uh if you can just bring the outside air in certain environments you can do that you know from a thermodynamics as you know you there's what we call a recommended zone so you have to control assuming that the barometric pressure is fixed you need two properties to fix the state and so let us say that's just the relative humidity and drive up temperature so it has to be in a certain range so you might be able to do that and if you shift it's okay if it's out of there for a while if that doesn't work but then what carol said comes into play here if you start doing that then you're going to have some contamination so you bring the outside air in so you can have some contamination issue it's a lot we've done a lot of work in that area so i certainly can refer you to that now follow up on that free cooling is uh direct an indirect evaporative heat exchanger where now you use the latent heat that's very significant so unless you are in the southern part of florida certain areas where uh you know the uh the web bulb temperature does not allow you don't you don't have that delta t to work with you can do quite a bit of good stuff with uh direct and indirect evaporative heat exchanger directly better but indirect if you have to because it's a lot more flexible and plus you don't have to worry about contaminating things so a lot of work in that area and certainly is being used extensively people like ibm i mean google and so on and so forth use that extensively for the big data center it's very current start you see you use spray and then cooling media and so on then you start talking about um indirect liquid cooling i call it indirect right that's the ibm because the the uh the um the uh coolant in this case water is not a direct contact with the with the device because of it's not a dielectric so there's a lot of work in that particular area but i mean i remember being my ibm days you know thermal conduction module my do i know you know that well right they choose stuff so so we've been doing that for since the 80s but there's a lot of work now in that particular area you know using uh people call it micro but i'm not sure it's micro it might be a mini channel but uh there's a lot of work in that area we're we're right now working with a major company uh develop i mean looking at uh uh indirect liquid cooling so uh a lot of interest in that area certainly has limitations then you start looking at immersion cooling the the beauty about immersion cooling is as you start i think madhu alluded to this very well he's talked about dinar scaling right since early 2000s right that the uh uh the power stop scaling as the square root of 1.4 so the power density start creeping up so you have to fix the uh td thermal design power or or the other way we're looking at is the the frequency and so in order to get performance you got to start putting a lot of uh a lot of uh cores in there right so we've been doing that but as you start moving now and start looking at heterogeneous integration to gain leverage right because the frequency time between frequencies starting to really increase four to five years right it's still doubling transistors but it's taking more more time but you start doing this and start looking at heterogeneous integration where you're stitching a bunch of components either in two and a half d in 3d that is really not something that a lot of the folks currently looking at at the data center level but that's surely coming and immersion cooling is just a great way of doing it because it couldn't care less because it's dielectric fluid right but again it's the material people that win here too we the pue you can get 1.03 and stuff no problem it's the material compatibility issue that one has to work in so there's a lot of work that needs to be done in that particular area or else it's not going to sell yeah so and it seems single and two-phase flow so yeah so it seems like kind of what you're saying they're doing as well is and and i hear this question a lot is like you know liquid cooling where is it i guess it's always been there there's this suite of technologies there's going to be applications that need it right some applications that justify very high powers locally and for climatic conditions or other reasons and it's been an inward migration right do it freely with air if you can but different applications higher power densities more compact to the point where you know when there was bitcoin mining craze it made sense for the density of those systems to do immersion cooling and so these technologies are there and it's going to be the application that determines it um maybe i'll head i see a question i want to get to um soon but just because the term came up and and one of the trends and i'd like to just talk about it or i think make the students and audience familiar with it because we're going to hear about it a lot in electronics and thermal management coming up that you use duraj with heterogeneous integration so madu you lead kind of the thermal you know working group in ieee for heterogeneous integration for those that don't know what that term is what it means and what it means for us moving forward could you just say a little bit more about that and explain them yeah i i think derek said it very nicely right with the pure i guess sub device level performance uh getting better but taking longer to get better there's a huge exponential growth in innovation and stitching devices together putting memory close to the asic logic chip having other functionalities like photonics and maybe stacked memory so your cell phone is is not has a lot of heterogeneous integration just driven by all that functionality going into that phone and inside the phone there's heterogeneous packages so i think what happens then is purely from conduction you have conduction resistances you have a dissimilar devices with different requirements of temperature in close proximity you have devices heating each other so i think it becomes a pretty rich space for thermal research thermal innovation so i think that is definitely an area that is a big growth area for innovation and research which is why you're hearing about it a lot yeah yeah and carol you of course work in this space as well and and think about some of the materials and mechanical and reliability challenges about putting all this stuff that used to be separate and forcing it in the same package there's thermal challenges but um you know what other challenges do you foresee in that space that you're working on so there's one um particularly interesting one that i think most of the audience here hasn't heard about so if you start having really large uh dye and we're working with somebody who has an 85 millimeter by 85 millimeter die they're very thin so now you have to take this package and you have to assemble it onto a circuit board and you put solder on that you think okay you just put the solder on it melts the solder and it makes the um you can make the interconnects very easily the issue is that those packages and some of the ones that madu is talking about they're much more complex than they were before and they warp they warp like crazy so even before the solder melts you have them warping like potato chips and so with the conventional solders so we're having issues just in minimizing these kind of manufacturing defects and in addition we have to be able to to put all the um the heat dissipating systems on top of that we have to bolt them on top of it as well and if these are warped we can't do it at the end we have to actually do all of the processing with an applied load so it's not just to make the make the boards make the components and you can ignore the the manufacturing there are a number of serious uh challenges with respect to that and so one of them that came up in a question was oh low temperature solders why would you use those well if we don't heat have to heat the board and the component up as high it doesn't warp as much so we will so now we have a driver for low temperature solders however their maximum use temperature is not as high as some of the high temperature solders so there are a number of problems like that that uh we're dealing with not just in the um you know in the in the end do we have a reliable solder joint but all that has to take and be taken into account in design and manufacturing and we're not going to be able to um to test our way into this because one of the packages that we deal with right now it costs five thousand dollars a package so modeling simulation for the whole mechanical thermal electrical function is becoming more important so those are just a few of those issues yeah yeah and and i see you know i'll stick with one more i'm looking at the q and a one more question because i often see it at kind of the device level and then we can maybe talk about you know again some of the large-scale energy challenges is you know there's there's so much heat generation that we talk about are there promising what's on the horizon for revolutionary ways to store process data so we're just not generating the heat in the first place is that a viable solution and what's there does anyone want to field that question i think that's probably for computer scientists but but i i agree with you i i think storing data uh optimizing how you store data redundant data and so that is that is uh something that uh that needs to be looked at but uh interestingly to uh listening to carol there is so much opportunity for multi-disciplinary work it really that's that is really what i see here you can't really do for example thermal without understanding packaging you can't really do thermal without understanding materials in fact uh ravi mahajan recently ashish he gave a received an award and gave a talk and his call to action was you know tim materials that are order of magnitude better but when you start talking about new materials you gotta start talking about their reliability so those material people don't get away from us at all yes excellent um and there's some actually to the panelists too if that you want to field any of the questions by text in the chat too if we don't get to them all and and jay so jay gore asked a question as well and this is you know maybe thinking back about the you know the energy uses is there any way to use all of this heat generation so is there are there any viable or promising waste heat recovery uh where some of this energy just doesn't go to waste um you know i maybe i'll say a little bit about that but then turn it over to the panel it's certainly it's very low grade so that's one of the difficulties for this right the temperatures we're talking about produced by electronic systems are certainly right you know less than 80 celsius type temperatures and so many of the conventional recovery mechanisms just are not viable and but jay specifically said asks about thermoelectric generation to do some right powering of sensors or secondary circuits is that anything that is being considered or has been considered um maybe in the industry i can make a comment i think that's where our technical background actually reveals the drawbacks like you said when you calculate the carnot efficiency and you know real world devices maybe the refrigerant based ones they get to maybe 40 of carnot so when you do the math and you do the ratios in kelvin instead of celsius it ends up being you know sub 5 c 5 conversion rates i think uh so that is one challenge the second challenge is for energy conversion you end up having to put these devices in the heat flow path and that really hurts the effectiveness or efficiency of thermal the thermal resistance goes up so that also is a barrier i do think there's a home for some of these devices for lower heat flux lower power applications and i think sensors and many other lower power highly distributed lower power applications might have a lot of use case for the advances in these devices just following up quickly uh people on uh ibm zurich and so on right they're using a lot of the waste energy right for for uh heating and so on and so forth so depending where you are there's a lot of work in that area jay i can send you some information on that as well yeah that's sorry sorry go ahead yeah go ahead yeah i think the way i'm seeing about energy recovery is that the companies are when they put out their data centers at a large scale or small scale their goal is not energy recovery their goal is to meet their needs which could be performance or it could be cost or something else and energy recovery comes as an after thought however that's changing there are and i think europe is really leading in the forefront over here for example amsterdam which has the most number of data centers in europe per capita they are not going to allow any new data centers unless you have a plan of how you utilize the waste heat recovery and really you reuse it in a meaningful way so i'm seeing that trend i'm seeing countries which are putting limitations that if your pue is higher than a certain number then you know you have to pay more taxes or you have to buy back energy credits so i'm seeing a lot more movement in that direction and hopefully since this is such an important topic about the ecosystem about nature about sustainability that i hope that we do come up with a plan of how to utilize all of the heat that's getting generated yeah and i think that's the point is that we we can cool some very high power systems and do it but it's also just the as the raw energy consumption goes up how are we thinking about just if there's any other ways to utilize it rather than um you know reject it and on this i think you know rebecca is a good chance to kind of get your perspective here i know you've thought a lot about you know the whether it's in europe or corporate policy and how it's evolving towards this sustainability conscious right society and maybe is going to start driving some technology development in those areas can you kind of just talk about what's going on in that area sure so i would say we're sort of in like the second to third generation of uh corporate sustainability goals sort of related to energy use and how do companies sort of procure their electricity sources and so like 10 years ago when solar and wind were still relatively expensive compared to other technologies there was a lot of effort for companies to buy the equivalent amount of energy that they were using from solar and wind and so basically take a year's worth of electricity usage and say we're going to purchase that much solar or wind electricity but there really wasn't a drive to actually use all of that renewable electricity themselves right so they've introduced more investment into the market to drive technology adoption in that sense but they haven't necessarily transition to 100 renewable or zero carbon electricity and so more recently there's been a push to to move from that kind of offset uh mentality to actually having 100 renewable or 100 zero carbon um sources and so that means you have you have to adopt a lot more energy storage technology um and so to actually be able to use that renewable electricity later in the day or when there's no sun or wind um and so that's been like a shift as the the sort of electricity technologies have increased and improved um over time and then moving forward i think there's even a look towards how do you um even become carbon negative and so i've seen some different companies who've pledged to ultimately have net reductions in co2 and so investing in some kind of carbon removal technology it's still pretty early in those stages but and i think a lot of technology companies in general um are sort of on the forefront of that kind of of thinking and so it's still pretty early more looking at investing in research and development of technologies that have been proven at like the lab scale but haven't necessarily been implemented in the market yeah and that you know that that's exciting because i think it is one if you just look at you know there's various statistics and other things out there but the i.t industry i think as you mentioned and a few others and transportation is at the leading edge right are the ones who are trying to make that right conversion to right um you know at these various stages you talked about and given the fact that there are on the scale of transportation there is a substantial buying power especially if you're in these local markets like we're in amsterdam or amsterdam or other places where it might be outsized relative to other industries yeah yeah yeah i wanted to make maybe an orthogonal point but related to purdue education and the students and the in out there i think you've heard uh talk about life cycle analysis uh abroad multi-year thought process we just heard about you know tco i think it is important to know that as you try to become champions for new technology in industry you one of the skills that is useful is is to learn how to do the tco uh almost like a business case uh end-to-end because if something was super easy to introduce it would already be used so there is an element of effort that technology people need to do to make the ends meet and it may be very hard it may be tough roi maybe 15 years but that is really a very important skill for even heat transfer people if you want to make your energy recovery technology case you kind of have to figure out how does it make sense business with regulations without regulations and then you do have to sell it yeah yeah and that's a hard thing i can admit and i don't know if anyone else wants to confess here but it's hard it's easy you go to thermal management conferences there are other fields and it's often you you kind of stop at um you know heat flux or you stop at a temperature for a technology development um you know we know what immersion cooling we know what even embedded silicon cooling can do but it can't stop there right that's not what's going to get get insertion of the systems and that's a very uh difficult thing to translate across i hope that you know these panel discussions raise awareness of that if nothing else to try and speak outside your domain because the success does depend on being aware of actually getting this thing in and it's not a solo activity of course also when you run through the tco or the case and you might fail you might fail for a couple of reasons market's not big enough or something but when you do that effort and then you're watchful that assumption may change in five years or ten years and then you can come back so i just wanted to it's not directly related to the panel but i think it's an important item to be cognizant of yeah yeah no i think it is i think it is actually directly related or an important aspect of this to to think about okay timing wise you know we've got a few minutes i don't know if you have anything um that you know that hasn't uh been brought up that we should ask yeah there is one that uh dr gupta kind of briefly alluded to with respect to pue so uh there's been a lot of focus on you know industry getting down the pue and it's it's been going down steadily and the goal is to get it as close to one right so the question is um what needs to be done to create a drastic reduction in the it energy consumption that's coming to to keep it at close to that value of one and also theoretically like um what can we do to keep it as low as possible and what's the theoretical minimum yeah i mean one comment i would say is pue is a ratio so it's a ratio of the total energy or power of the data center to the power of i t so it does it does define how efficiently we are reducing the parasitic losses but changing the denominator is also very important so ultimately the total electricity bill is what matters or also matters very important yeah i uh wanted to uh uh add there that uh we have really been doing a lot of good work and efficiency and uh like i said uh when you talk about the improved management and the hyperscale big change right to the hyperscale systems uh right ashish versus the traditional the significant change almost flip that is uh definitely saving on energy but then you also got to talk about at the at the uh component level uh when you start uh uh you know uh putting things together like this 3d stacking and two and a half d and so on i think i'm not sure that the uh that the data center community certainly people like ashish and them who make intel who make this device are aware of it but i'm not sure that the data center community is ready to see how how do i cool a heterogeneous integrated system where i have uh you know a microprocessor and memory stacked on top of each other and several of them or maybe you might be using uh your uh uh either two and a half d or emmet the intel embedded bridge yes so uh i'm not sure we're prepared for that so the other thing i also want to say from education point of view i really encourage uh universities that talk about heat transfer to have a packaging class that also includes materials right and so on and certainly about the rois and the business cases that uh that my dude's talking about but i i think it's needed otherwise you get left behind you might start saying i'm doing micro channel right and then you find out oh this daggone micro challenge is nothing but a clogging nightmare right you keep saying your focus on we all know that the heat transfer coefficient inversely proportional hydraulic diameter right so i'm it's not about just getting that to zero right and going to infinity there's a lot of other things like pressure drops and so on so how do you understand this the system both from a packaging i talked about this two and a half d the stacking and so on are we anticipating that and then the education how we integrating these things as we start teaching uh because you can't just teach thermal management course without understanding packaging so yeah maybe justin you might say a word or two on that yeah maybe i'll say a word or two on that only because there's a lot of recent activity going on at purdue in this area i should just you know because there's students on the line as well and and carol knows this and is involved but purdue is part of of a national effort to kind of help improve awareness of packaging even at the undergraduate level in the curriculum because it you know electronics are such a ubiquitous system and the packaging of electronics touches so many things that there's people from all fields who don't have an awareness of basically the insertion of them from a thermal materials radiation hardening perspective and various other challenges and so with you know purdue in in collaboration with arizona state georgia tech suny binghamton has right excellent resources in this area we're actually co-developing and co-teaching across those universities a junior level kind of awareness course um for students who are interested uh in packaging i don't know carol do you want to say any more on on that but it that it's completely true right we need this we need education on on that whole area and even the electrical circuit design so the other thing that we are trying to do is insert problems even in the first year of engineering where they're learning how to handle data and use graphing programs and use statistics we're inserting some of those uh some of the topics related to packaging and even heterogeneous integration radiation hardening into the first semester freshman year because we don't want to wait until they're juniors to say oh and by the way look at all of this these issues with respect to packaging so we're working very hard to just introduce this in the core courses in introduction to materials electrical engineering 101 first in circuits so it's really a holistic approach to get the students to be aware of these as early as possible and so that they can build on it that it's not okay you have to take you have to take thermodynamics and heat and mass transfer and all these things and then once you are anointed then you can take the advanced heat transfer course or some packaging course no they've been exposed to it along the way [Music] so awesome yeah yeah that is the goal is to just be very excited about what you can tell yeah yeah it's a really um fun thing and that is the goal so i see arvin's picture uh which i guess means you you're going to tell us that we're out of time um fascinating out of time but i can see no lack of energy here yes we we could we could keep going but but i i i know many of us want to hear uh the ridges talk as well so we should yeah i'd like to just add you know to all the participants here uh please note that and including by the way our guests are panelists uh mother please feel free to join us for uh durage's uh talk he's giving the distinguished lecturer uh in just 15 minutes from now at 4 30 pm uh and a a real thanks to all of the panelists and to aditya for supporting the q a at the back end of this really exciting panel truly a grand challenge uh moving forward uh for the next few decades so really appreciate the great discussion uh and again invite all of you to join uh durage's talk here uh the invited lecturer uh at 4 30 pm thank you
