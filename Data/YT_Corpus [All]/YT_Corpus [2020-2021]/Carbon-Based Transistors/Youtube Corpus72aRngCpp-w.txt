 It's called the preamp because the circuit is based on the Benson Amps Chimera 30 watt guitar amplifier but substitutes FET transistors for the vacuum tubes. The result is an extremely amp-like and versatile clean boost/overdrive/fuzz pedal. "Treble" controls the brightness and sharpness, and "Bass" controls the fatness and heaviness of the tone. It doesn't diode clipping, so it has wide dynamic range and without compression when it turned up the gain. It also can use as a clean booster when it turned down "Drive". It brings amp-like saturation when it turned up "Drive" It also can get saturation by turned up "Volume". It brings the wild tone like fuzz by the combination of "Drive" and "Volume"
