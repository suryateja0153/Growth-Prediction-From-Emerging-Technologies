 it's perfect it just gives information and i really like this i don't know what kind of machine it is but it's very cool looking yes we use it to evaporate the gold and the solar cells as a cathode contact yes it's cool so this is gold actually inside yeah the gold is in a booth and uh what i take it by my hand it's the substrate sample i put the substrate sample then i close the door and i use the computer to process the vibration for the goal good afternoon and good morning and welcome uh everyone thank you for joining us um for the ibk webinar innovations in energy and avenues for engagement my name is dorothy hannah i'm the program administrator for the cacst mit evan hilde fellowship for saudi arabian women and today our palace will discuss their own contributions in the field of energy and where we go from here after their discussion they will answer questions from the audience please put your questions in the q in a section as we go along and we will answer all of the questions at the end first i'd like to welcome professor kamal youssef toomey he's a professor of mechanical engineering at mit and he is the director of the kaldun fellowship for saudi arabian women so professor kamal please give us a little more information about the ibk fellowship yeah hello everyone i welcome each one of you to this important webinar uh series uh the uh uh ebenhaldon uh fellowship program uh you know was created maybe 12 years ago or so and this is specifically for the uh uh saudi arabian woman uh i had mentioned before that the uh this was part of a program that we had with king university of petroleum the mineral uh program that we had in water and energy and at that time the university had only men in it and mit required that we had to create a special uh for saudi uh women and this is how the human haldum program you know came about um so uh we are i am very happy to uh uh to be uh or part of this uh seminar uh webinars series and also welcoming you know our distinguished uh panelists uh dr fatima uh dr malek dr neuf and dr sumra and the uh panel uh is about uh innovation uh and energy and as you know the innovation is very very important because uh you know behind it there is the research that drives the innovation the innovation drives the long-term economic growth and with these um innovations and both that the nations and the economies in the world you know compete and they compete based on innovation so this is a very important aspect and energy is the the base you know for everything that we that we do right and so i look forward to listening to the uh to our panelists and uh [Music] thank you and thank you to our panelists and i'd like to uh invite our panelists to introduce themselves uh in alphabetical order um so uh dr facma

with the program i received a huge amount of support from dr kama from dr professor johnny hart from trades and from everyone until today i focus my research is focused on early at the beginnings on desalination and optimization of these summation processes in consideration of environmental impact and economic issues as well this was extended later on to look at the energy because we cannot do this animation without looking at the energy source and then i started to look at the different sources of energy and i studied the use of renewable energy into desalination and how can we produce solutions that are innovative and sustainable uh to support both the demand of water and demand of energy while not harming the environment and minimizing the environmental impacts thank you we're really glad to have you with us today thank you um dr neuf will you introduce yourself please sure so salaam alaikum everyone um i'm no filmosa i'm a current demon holding fellow and an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at princess neural university and currently a research scholar with the department of nuclear science and engineering at mit uh my research basically includes plasma physics and plasma material interactions in nuclear fusion reactors also i'm passionate about investigating the effect of extreme environments and nuclear systems and by extreme i mean high pressure high temperature and high radiation and also highly corrosive nuclear environment and how these environments affect nuclear reactor components maybe in a bad way or by surprisingly sometimes in a good way as well i have some research expertise on storing spent nuclear fuel for the better of our environment as well so basically i'm passionate in anything nuclear in between splitting an atom for a fission reactor or fusing two atoms for a fusion reactor and until the fuel is totally spent and ready to be disposed and anything nuclear in between and i'm glad to be part of this webinar as well

forward to hearing from such a wide range of perspectives on energy so to get us started dr fatima will you tell us what does innovation look like in your inner field of energy [Music] okay uh so good morning and good afternoon everyone today i'm going to explain and show you some information related to the membrane material entitled membranes as energy efficient technologies for gas liberation during the presentation i'm going to give you a brief introduction and motivation for membrane visibility i'm going to talk about membrane structures after that i'll explain the membrane separation mechanism and then i'm going to talk about the future market of membrane technology and finally i'll conclude the presentation with the acknowledgements so let's move into the first part of the presentation which is the introduction in fact uh the main sources of the air pollution are the industrial processes with around 58 percentage of the co2 of little hydrocarbon that emitted every year while consumer solvent can cause around five percent of the air pollution motors and vehicles was around 37 so the extensive use and the production of a little hydrocarbon and co2 would make the minimization of these killer gazas so challenges or so difficult therefore they consider as a major air pollution furthermore the volatile hydrocarbon with the slow boiling point and high vapor pressure so they can evaporate easily and contaminate our environment furthermore both co2 and volatile hydrocarbon can accelerate the global warming which we can feel it by the shrinking of the eyes heating of the ocean and changing of the weather also it has been recorded that around 7 million deaths are recorded to the exposure to the air pollution so it is essential to deal with this problem and try to reduce the air pollution in fact there are different strategies have been developed for effective removal and separation of these gases like distillation drying evaporation and etc and as you can see here my brain-based vibration can consume lower energy comparing to the high energy that consumed by distillation process in 2016 the total u.s energy consumption was around 27 from four different sectors however from the industrial sectors up to 55 percent energy was consumed by separation process out of this percent around 49 percent of the energy was consumed by distillation process so distillation process is energy intensive and thermal driven process therefore we have to to find an alternative one of the alternative that have been developed is membrane-based liberation and has been confirmed that using membrane for separation system would save around 90 percent of the energy comparing to the distillation process so using membrane material can save around 100 million tons of greenhouse emission and around 4 billion us dollar in energy costs annually furthermore using uh or using using membrane material for absorption process like zeolite material metal organic framework covalent organic framework polymers and molecular sieve and enhance the separation efficiency of two ninety percent furthermore these material require the smaller space comparing to other system as you can see here so this space is required for membrane material and the other systems required larger space also membrane material can separate both organic and inorganic substances so what are membrane materials fact membrane material can be porous membrane or dense membrane materials and they act like filters so the small molecular size can enter the poor system and get separated while the larger molecular size would be prevented from entering the membrane material however for dense membrane the solubility and diffusivity of the glass will play the room the performance of membrane material depends on mobility and the solubility while the permeability is the ability of membrane material to allow the permeating gas to pass it through and it depends on the diffusivity and the selectivity solubility of the gas itself we can measure membrane material based on the membrane thickness area and the pressure differences across the membrane material and the permeate flow rate all the selectability selectivity is the ratio of programmability of two gases and a binary gas system however it has been confirmed that the membrane material that has higher permeability would have lower lower selectivity and vice versa and this is called the trade-off relationship and this is a like a problem of membrane material in membrane structures there are three types of membrane which are first membrane nanoporous membrane and carrier membranes for porous membrane the selectivity depends on the pore size and here is a real example of boris membrane material furthermore based on iobak the porous material can be categorized into three categories based on their pore size these categories are microporous material which is this uh poor less than two nanometer mesoporous material which was this for in between two and 15 nanometer and microporous material which was this larger pore size which is larger than 15 nanometer boris material could be used for micro filtration and ultra filtration a non-porcelain brain is a dense material and the polymer is a good example of non-porous membrane and the separation in this case depends on the solubility and cell and diffusivity of a specific gas so this material are usually used for gas separation here membrane material and this material there are some carrier molecules that have been added to the surface of the membrane material so this material this carrier has the affinity toward the specific gas so this material boosters high selectivity boosters high selectivity and can be used for gas and liquid separation for the mechanism membrane separation there are four mechanism and the first one is seismic is the most uh common mechanism that have been used to separate the gas flow however in this case the brain material is forced material and the pore size is just in between the small molecular gas and larger molecular gas molecules so in this case only the small gas molecules will be allowed to freely enter the poor system and get separated however the counterpart gas molecules will be prevented from entering the pore system a surface diffusion mechanism in this case the brain material has the affinity toward a specific gas so the more affinitive gas will get absorbed on the surface of the membrane material and move along the poor walls until it gets separated however the less absorbable gas molecules will have low probability to enter the poor system and gets separated solution diffusion mechanism in this case the membrane material are dense material and there are no port that facilitate the gas transport transport so in this case the separation of the gas depends on the solubility and diffusivity of the gas so the more soluble gas will dissolved and absorbed by membrane material at the feed interface and due to the higher pressure that the feed interface the gas molecule will diffuse through or across the membrane material until it reaches the permeate interface at permeate interface the pressure is low so the gas will be absorbed in this case however solution diffusion mechanism uh usually associated with low permeated flow due to the low solubility and diffusivity of the gas molecules therefore facilitated facilitated the transport mechanism has been developed in this case the membrane material has some carrier molecules that can be added during the sentences or boston detect modification of the membrane material and this carrier molecules will facilitate the uh permeability of the more soluble gas so in this case the carrier molecules will attach to the more soluble gas molecules and due to the higher pressure at feed interface this material would diffuse across the brain material until the 3 hp permeate interface due to the low uh pressure at permeate interface reverse reaction can occur and the gas molecules will dissolve while carrier molecule can go back to the feed interface to in order to attach and deliver another gas molecules in fact there are a huge number of membrane material and generally we can divided them to polymer membrane and nanoporous membrane for polymer membrane as the most common option that can be used in chemical ambiguous chemical industries for co2 separation from the gas flow also polymer membranes is a good example for solution diffusion uh mechanism so the more soluble gas will dissolve and the small holes that appeared in the surface of the polymers and then transfer from hole to another until it gets dissolved the main problem or drawback of polymer is the trade-off relationship so the material or polymer that has lower permeability would have high selectivity uh therefore most scientists in order to increase the probability of polymar they use the carrier molecules or they used different type of polymers which we can call it a glassy polymers this is a glassy polymer can change its mechanical properties during the absorption process a nanoporous membrane also is a huge materials and i mean there are varieties of these material and here i'm going to give you only four examples the first example is silica membrane or silica oxide membrane and this material are miso porous material with high porosity so this material have high porosity have has have higher permeability and low selectivity so in order to increase the selectivity of this material amino functional group can be added to the surface of the material and make the surface or increase the roughness of the surface in order to increase the selectivity of this material however the main drawback of this material is the coast that associate with the scale up of this material therefore new method has been developed which is producing the silica particle inside the polymers membrane in order to increase the selectivity and reduce because the second example is the light material zeolite material is the aluminum silicate crystalline material and this type of material attracted the attention due to the high selectivity of this material that depends on the pore structure or pore size and the polarity of this material the third example is metal organic framework this a unique crystalline microporous inorganic organic hybrid material this material was this high separation efficiency with this high storage capacity and high selectivity however the main drawback of this material is the stability water stability therefore a sub class of this material has been developed which we call it neolithic a zoolight framework this material says or inherit the separation properties from metal organic framework and inherit the thermal and air stabilities of rhombulite material for the membrane separation technology market it is anticipated that the market of using membrane technology will increase or will grow during the next five years and this is because of increasing application in water and wastewater growing beyond the prone food and the growing of the industrial applications and based on an ongoing studies that started in 2016 the aegean pacific will dominate the market across the um membrane material due to the combustion consumption from the countries like china india and japan at the end i'd like to thank ibk specifically nadia shaheed risa worth and professor kamal youssef for their usual support and help i'd like also to thank saudi aramco mighty energy initiative for giving me this opportunity to work at mit thank you thank you so much fatima for that very thorough answer and i want to say that some of our palace i think prepared more presentation style and some more question and answer styles so um dr malach i think you had baby a shorter answer prepared and i'll ask you the same question what does innovation look like in your field okay thank you well i defined innovators people who find solutions to achieve intended objectives in the best way so uh an energy for a solution to be innovative it is not enough for it to be just new because some sometimes people think of innovation just bringing something new to the field and this is innovation it's not enough to be new innovation and energy is beyond the choice of a new technology or introducing new technology or substituting an existing one with a new one it's it should actually bring in transformation in the energy system so uh in essence uh providing a sustainable uh supply uh and use of uh the energy that meets the needs and the demand of our planet of humanity is the successful development and delivery of innovative solutions sustainable solutions means that they have to tackle the areas it has to be economically sustainable means that it's cost effective it provides it is viable uh uh every in in whatever is there is a problem and this needs to be the solution this problem socially so it should brings and value to the people to the human uh should introduce another aspect of well-being to the people and ecologically which is environmentally effective does not harm the environment uh uh does not worsen the issues of climate change just like that uh mentioned in her presentation these are areas that we all uh all of us in the energy field will look at these elements in order to uh validate and check what kind of solutions we're providing and so uh this uh this means that uh uh in innovative and trans transformative uh solution should tackle uh the infrastructure the policy the technology the business model the infrastructure all together in order to be uh included as in the range of innovative solutions uh i uh from uh from my side and my contribution uh i i was recently alhamdulillah uh got the uh appointment as mission innovation champion which is for saudi arabia which is a program by claim energy ministerial that reward or recognize innovators in the field by by appointing a person or an innovator for each country of the 22 countries and the clean energy in syria and uh my uh my my research idea my idea that i proposed uh in order to get this appointment is that uh looking into uh innovative solutions at the intersection between water and energy to solve the problems of the increasing demand of both water and energy uh i don't want to take it this long but i can explain unless you want me to go on and explain uh what exactly my my research area please go ahead okay so uh specifically my research focus on using water desalination using renewable energy rather than traditional energy intensive resources also you such as pv solar also using hydrogen production from water uh and using water storage for instead of energy storage such as uh batteries uh technically this can happen using uh optimal scheduling of operations and this mechanism can enable cost effective and low carbon emissions solutions to reliance realize higher levels of renewable energy integration into the energy grid into the power grid and increase the renewable energy production in the energy mix and achieve major aspects of the circular economy why this is important kind of solutions important because it brings in addressing an issue of the high intensity of energy usage in the desalination today the desalination capacity in the world is 107 million cubic meters per day okay so which means that uh the minimum energy required in order to produce this amount of fresh water to cover the demand at a large scale even using the best technology available to us today this means about 428 000 megawatts of per day of electricity or of our electricity which would result in 190 thousands more than 190 000 tons per day of cl2 emissions so in order to uh to produce fresh water uh even using the best technology even using uh best technology available and minimum energy required with silicon to produce this amount of co2 huge amounts of co2 if we go the traditional way uh continuing with this then we can we the integration of renewable energy into the uh to the power grid it increases the complexity of the power we want to increase our portfolio of different renewable energy but it's not random no it's not the the power grid will have to accommodate all the variability that comes from the energy and the renewable energy also the cost of desalination if we switch to renewable desalination it will increase because it's not just membrane anymore but to the brick it's also additional components of the system which means that this is a higher cost specifically that you also need to add energy storage and it's storage still up until today still expensive economically and environmentally so what do we what do we do with batteries after we we're done with them what do we do with pvp modules after where they're not sufficient anymore so this creates these uh issues uh so uh the the main proposal or idea is that we can use um any water storage to utilize the uh desalination capacity water storage in order to uh provide electricity when needed so that by optimal operation of the systems then we can accommodate the energy the viability of the renewable energy and we can store energy and produce it as as needed thank you and congratulations on the new position it's very exciting thank you so much um dr uh nuff will you share with us what innovation looks like in the nuclear energy field sure so i want to first congratulate dr malach for the new position we're really proud of her so sure so innovation in nuclear is really i'm really sad to say it but it's going relatively slow comparing to other fields and indeed there is a strong need to accelerate innovation and nuclear energy so an innovation it's no question we we really need innovation in nuclear energy and here i mean innovation at both technical and institutional levels um the question here what innovation will be the most influential in expanding the global market for the nuclear energy so the institutional innovation is kind of out of our hands as an individual scientist and engineer but i thought i should give some credit for institutional innovation to be part of the answer for the big energy challenge i'm sure we all remember the most striking lesson of fukushima is that what might otherwise have been serious but a manageable kind of accident was transferred into a real disaster by multiple failures of their governance and what's needed to correct this kind of failure is really is well really understood now it includes transparent decision-making process independent regulatory bodies and the need to build a sustain and safety culture in the nuclear operation system so however as i said as we are an individual scientist and engineers we belong more to the land where avenues for technical innovations can be found and this is where we can contribute greatly so technical innovations and nuclear basically would be more important partly because they will reduce the burden of nuclear institution and the decision makers as well and they will also pave the way for institutional innovations so one of the keys to improve economic competitiveness of nuclear power will be to reduce cycle time for example in the nuclear industry which include also opportunities for technically driven cycle time reductions another inefficient phase can go to the design of the nuclear reactor so making the nuclear reactors sitting easier for example we have the gas cooled and the new generation of malting molten salt cooled reactor that required far less water to be cooled and they even can be cooled by air so this allowed them to be easily set in any inline region i would say also another phase of innovation can look like longer term possibilities which includes lifetime fueling for reactor cores which is represented by the concept of nuclear battery so in which the nuclear battery the fuel charge to the core at the start of the operation and would not need to be removed until the end of the life of the reactor also some reactors can be even optimized to burn their own nuclear waste which uh this way the innovation can allow transmuting the long the long life as the tubs which are highly radioactive in the waste into a short life species and hence this can reduce radiation hazards to the environment and to the radiation worker as well another venue of innovation involves materials and fuels which focus on microstructural and thermal mechanical and all the material properties of radiated nuclear fuel or nuclear material the structural material in the nuclear nuclear system so by studying these by improving the response of these materials to the extreme nuclear environment which include high temperature high pressure and the corrosive the highly corrosive medium and also the highly radiation environment this can prolong the lifetime of reactor components and hence increase the productivity and short the need for maintenance or shutdown for the nuclear reactor so all these phases of innovations are devoted towards enabling nuclear energy to play a harder role or a greater role in creating sustainable global energy supply and even more to do better in a leveling the carbon dioxide level i hope this should delight on how innovations looks like and near clear yes definitely thank you so much dr enough um dr thumrow will you share with us also what innovation looks like in your field and share the slides yes please go ahead yeah in my area the solar energy the energy of the sun is the original sources of the most of the energy found on the earth solar power is the energy from the sun that is compared into thermal or electrical energy polar energy is the cleanest and the most abundant renewable energy sources available and we know that we can use the sunlight to convert it to the electricity using the photovoltaic system with their their photovoltaic system can convert direct and light into electricity through the use of the solar cells and the history of the efficiency of the solar cells was started from 1975 until now 2020 and 1975 was about 0.1 efficiency the low very low efficiency and with the years and with the conducting research and using different material and different techniques the efficiency was increased today to be to hit 40 percent but the uh solar cells uh with the different structure and different materials there is was use the silicon and we know that the silicone need more longer process to produce and expensive and affected the environment and then the next generation was the thin film technology and the symptom technology you're using dangerous material for the environment like the cadmium arsenide which has affected the environment and the third generation or the emerging beefy using the organic material and this organic material friendly with the environment but the problem with this organic material was the stability and the low efficiency and through mit i worked in bravo sky silicon tandem polar cells for hot and ride climbs and in this research we're trying to unbroken the temperature stability for the broad sky solar cells which is essential for the commercialization success for this technology technology and the issue becomes especially for the solar cells operated in a hot and red climbed and this work we represented the first kite solar cell structure with different structures and improved the temperature stability suitable to operate as i said in the climate like saudi arabia uh also the mercologic morphological data is used to establish the relevant operating condition for saudi arabia in this region also we use different different material trying to improve the stability of this solar cells and this work was presented as i said uh in 2000 2018 in mrs in arizona the innovation in solar cells in the future i saw i see five solar innovations that could change the future first is the solar paint second the solar windows the solar cars and the solar roots and the solar water let us talk about every single one the solar veins is a being applied to the surface that will capture the energy from the sun and convert it into electricity color paint may look like your typical vent but it has a billion of pieces of light sensitive material this material that would transform the energy curvature uh from the paint for the solar windows solar winds are made of the solar panels that harvest the energy from the sun compared to the electricity and this panel refruit to the type of windows helping building owner achieve partial embedding independence of the power grid about the solar car in the solar vehicle used for the land transport solar cars usually run and only power from the sun also some models will supplement the power using a battery or use solar panels to recharge a battery or run a system for a car that merely use a battery bar about the solar roots is a modular system of specially engineered solar panels that can be walked and driven upon panels contain lit light to create lines and signing without paint and they contain heating elements to prevent snow and eyes accumulation and the bananas have micro uh microprocessor which makes them intelligent for the solar deceneration it is a technique to produce water with the low salt concentration from the sea water or bringing using the solar energy and there are two common methods for solar designation either using the direct heat from the sun or using electricity generated by solar cells to power a membrane's membrane process and the saudi arabia a plan to use a new solar technology to detonate sea water at noon and the solar dam plant will process drinking water more cheaply than converted to the plant and i have a short video about the project which will be launched in saudi arabia for the solar water we don't have any sound dr thumbra if you'd like to narrate for us a little bit didn't see the video no we see the video but we don't have any sound i don't know if you want to just mention what the what the video is describing yeah in this project the uh it is called the uh concentrated solar vowel where is the mirror uh concave mirror uh what sit in a way that's uh reflects the sunlight to the uh to the dome and the dumb uh take the heat from the sun and uh in the thumb there is a solution uh usually a salt solution which can store uh the heat from the sun and and this solution we can use it uh to reduce electricity or to uh [Music] use it to do for the water and this product is supposed to in the new the city in saudi arabia cool yes and that's it do you want me to talk about my project uh i don't know and i talked about my project in mit um no thank you for this and i think um we have we have more questions and maybe you can uh reference it again later um before we move on to other topics i wanted to check back i think some people talked about their current research uh dr noof did you want to mention anything more about your current research or what you people what what do you wish people knew about your research particularly yeah so my research is all about accelerating innovation nuclear structure materials development and characterization as well so i do this basically by combining ions and lasers and this will allow me to explore and know more about the microstructural evolution and the degradation of material as we expose them to radiation environment so the basic promise of my research is we want to sense indirectly and in a rapid way i mean directly means in non-destructive fashion and in a fast way as well the evolution of the defects or the radiation damage that accumulate in the material as we expose them to radiation uh so this material these defects are radiation damage can definitely leads to failure of nuclear system such as the volumetric void swelling which is the phenomena i'm studying so the in the in the void swelling that means the materials as we radiate them they fill themselves with voids or buckets of air or vacuum and that makes the material softens and weakens and eventually these components can break uh as you all know nuclear radiation can cause huge changes to any material going from human body tissues or solid like a hard alloys as well that can be used in nuclear reactor for example this phenomena that's the as we radiate material materials to tend to be weaken and soften material also can be destroyed by radiation damage and my whole goal is to sense this damage as it is happening in a real time scale so these micro scale voids also as i said can cause components to break and this can be associated with radiation uh leakage which can harm the environment and definitely the radiation marker as well so that being said and now knowing that these kinds of damage or defects are going to take place in material because we always have radiation in any nuclear system so it's very important and very critical to test any material for these kind of defects before we apply them to any nuclear system the issue with going traditionally to investigate materials and test their susceptibility to radiation damage is it takes so long so you typically have to do so many things from preparing the specimen of the material and it actually would have taken a year to accomplish to accomplish just such a study on testing the material susceptibility to radiation damage and we can detect radiation damage in nuclear material quickly with this technique it's a cutting edge technique actually that allow us to accelerate innovation nuclear sexual material development and characterization as well and we can make them accelerated to the speed of thought where a new material can be fabricated irradiated or exposed to a nuclear reactor then tested by using this photo acoustic technique that is based on combining ions and laser in mere hours of on a something like a bench top equipment which allow testing throughout dozens of materials for testing per week instead of doing this study bear a year which is less than one percent of the typical time if we do the old school radiation study so it's all about making the radiation the selection for the sexual material in a most in a more fast fashion to cake as well that's exciting and i imagine that it could also help prevent uh disasters in the future right if people understand quickly where the um weak areas in a reactor are exactly if we apply this technique and so my study is an x in an exit your fashion it can be easily converted to in situ fashion where you measure these or you detect these damage as they are happening in real time and this tells you when the material will be will will is closed to be filled as well because for example if the structural material has 10 percent are voided or empty buckets of air or vacuum that means it loses its ductility there is zero percent ductility which means the material will break in any second and that's what we call incubation dose which is the radiation dose that the material can handle before it totally break and we don't want to be near that incubation dose we want to know what what is this incubation dose which means what is the amount of radiation that material can handle so we run way behind the stove to avoid any failure for our nuclear system that's great to hear and um looks like we lost dr thumrah but hopefully she'll be able to join us again um dr malach this question is for you has the kovid 19 pandemic influence the way you think about your research or the future of your field of energy yes uh okay so i i don't i don't uh i cannot imagine any person uh work or any field that has not been affected so definitely energy field is one of the fields and the sectors that uh tremendously have been affected with the uh cover type team we of course we've seen and realized how during the lockdown the demand on energy fell down uh how the decline i mean on the on the energy demand foot down uh whether it is fully looked down or partially looked down it's definitely affected um i think the idea of transitioning to more secure and resilient systems energy system has emerged strongly again with the government team we realize more than ever and the importance of securing our energy sources we we we don't want systems that can fail and we don't want that system that can uh increase the price while we are in need and there is a prices as well so price increase within the time of crisis so overall the recovery 19 made it clear the importance to energy transition to clean energy clean energy will bring a healthier environment healthier environments needs means better health better for uh for everyone and means that we even our health will be stronger and we will be able to avoid such pandemics not totally avoid but at least be stronger in in facing these kind of health crisis so health healthier uh uh you will be will help in avoiding such crisis again uh of course there's positive and negative impacts uh positively that we we can realize the importance of clean energy on this uh sector localization is also emerged as important so uh it it emerged as an important aspect in all the the products so uh depending on other areas because of the lockdown you want to to continue the supply and you want to be dependent on different areas that that might affect it by the lockdown uh the in in terms of the uh negative impact is uh of course uh clean energy innovation in clean energy still requires it's a still new sector and it requires lots of funds with the uh covered 19 crisis and effects on the budgets this will affect difficulty the transition affect the the the projects the ongoing projects or planned projects for the future it might also affect the research and the fund overall the government support for new venues might also affect affected overall i think this situation created a a a global understanding that we need to have comprehensive and collaborative approaches and responses to such uh situations uh to recover from the government crisis and clean energy is one way to power this recovery in a clean way that makes sense to me no that's great thank you i think um kovit is such a part of everything right now it's nice to know how it relates in um in every situation um at this point i'd like to invite uh if there's any participants who have questions please do put them in the um question and answer feature it says q and a at the bottom of your screen and i have lots more questions for our panelists so i'll go on asking questions but if you as a audience member have a specific question for any of our panelists please put them in there and we will be glad to ask them so i'm going to move on to a question about each of your time at mit and i know two of you are currently at mit two of you are looking back on your time at mit and what influenced you um and was there things about being at mit that made you think about your research or innovation in a new way or a new creative way um so i'm going to go back to dr fatima dr fatima how about you how is your time at mit influencing the way you do research okay in fact mit is a such community where we can meet expert people who have the same passion and the energy research so we can discuss further and exchange the environment exchange the informations between us and if we face a problem we can discuss the difficulties that we might face as we can meet a lot people like professors postdoc and even students who are willing to work in this area furthermore it can facilitate the uh research by providing us different type of instruments and also they train us on this instrument so we can we can come independent user and we can conduct our research without worrying on how can we uh characterize our materials and etc also there is a sloan school where we can improve our skills and different uh area like management and innovation area so mit is a such community where we can develop ourselves and improve our skills and different aspects or different area i'm glad you're experiencing mit as such a supportive community especially even during this pandemic um how about you dr malach how was your time at mit how did it impact your research oh yeah okay so um i i believe mit is built in a way that the structure of mit is actually creates innovativity along the hallways and the classrooms and the research groups the the system itself it brings in innovation and everything that is happening in mit for me specifically i benefited a lot from being in research groups i i was during the time i was in two different research groups with professor john earhart racer group and professor steve graves research groups i also benefited a lot from also collaboration with mit lincoln lab which happened through also through professor lienhard hard and i worked on a project with uh with them uh for for one year uh this could not have happened if i was outside the doors of my team also the mit uh is known for their the research in energy with mit energy initiative and other initiatives that bring in uh the innovation to the uh to the minds and to the practices also all the different seminars and events happening with all the discussions the rich discussions with all the key researchers and key innovators in the field of course this will stir and the innovation and help you think of everything in a different way you might be working on something someone else is working on the same thing but you find that this is totally different ways of doing the different things so uh just having uh discussion is enough to bring in the ideas i was the first at the first time i i came into mit and to boston area i was calling back my family and friends i'm saying you believe it or not finally you are in a place where you can be totally intellectual and talk all intellectual talks and nobody will judge you you can you can do that finally and that being told that you're you're talking just too much time so too much for us so it's it's actually the the right place for research um yes it's definitely a place where you can talk all science all the time we have a question here from uh an attendee and i think it's a good question for you dr uh malach and maybe dr thumra um what is your plan to implement what you learn at mit to help empower saudi women in the energy section in saudi arabia yes wonderful i actually i've been very very active in the energy sector for women in saudi arabia i've been carrying on events to uh introduce an energy sector because we have probably it's the lowest participation of women in saudi arabia in this sector so i've been working on events conference conferences to introduce energy sectors and all the job opportunities bringing in pioneers in the energy sector from around the world to talk to youth and to young female to introduce to them the opportunities in the energy sector annually this event has been taking place i also established a saudi woman network for clean energy and it's the website is up and anybody can join the initiative and become part of the discussion uh we share news i introduce to them all the opportunities so that they can be involved as much as they can also in effort university in my university i involved my students in the engineering school in two different projects actual real-world projects to uh to design and install and operate solar rooftops two different rooftops so it became for them as as a practical experience that helped them uh now all of them they have secured jobs when they graduated because they can uh they actually touched and we actually learned firsthand how to deal with solar systems so uh i think uh if we all work together and my colleagues also here mr parkman and all of us then we will have a notable contribution of women in this sector um that's very exciting thank you and yes please dr thumbra go ahead i know you also as dr malik mentioned also we encourage in my university we encourage our graduated student to uh join an uh project in solar cells or in renewable energy also uh my university the quality of science the planning into allah to open a master degree in renewable energy who the graduated from the chemical or physical department can join this program master degree renewable energy also i think many uh conferences renewable energy i am trying to find an opportunity for my student to be trained in different company or different sector and renewable energy and make them have a knowledge of the solar vulnerable energy as the saudi arabia now has a lot of project and solar cells and a lot of opportunity for saudi arabia to be more [Music] and renewable energy resources that's very exciting thank you um while i have you would you like to talk about how your time at mit influenced your research um being in mit it's a fertile environment to order the creativity award and grow and flourish provide a wide variety of materials access to abort abroad the diversity of material proper source and a lot of learning materials and being an mit and not just about the research also you can improve your soft skills uh conducting different courses and the most of these courses at the free and we have a very good mit in january they uh have a lot of courses that the three you can come and learn and conduct this courses yes this environment make me learn from the expertise trying to improve my research and that's my time in my team thank you dr thumbra and we have a comment here from the audience thanking both of you for all of your efforts and saying it's very promising to see all your efforts to um include other women in the field of energy though so thank you for all that you do uh dr enough how about you you're still here at mit these days how is it impacting you and influencing the way you do research so i will echo all what the analyst said about mit being the perfect environment for creativity and innovation and the hard science that can change the world and solve the big world challenges personally my time at mit is really making me believe more than ever that innovation is the answer for the brighter future of nuclear energy now i believe more than ever that this technology despite its enemy and its challenges that it's facing it's an important option for the world to meet future energy demands and needs without emitting the carbon dioxide so now is the time to increase the efficiency and improve the safety features and to drop the cost uh also for nuclear power and any research will take us that will take us to these avenues is the right thing to do either at mit or at anywhere in the world innovation also is the fast track to make it happen faster and i believe more than ever that and the importance of it's really important to have an interdisciplinary studies that can solve the world challenges that is the only way we can succeed to have the interdisciplinary studies and to shed the light on complex world issues such as energy or health issues as well an example for my research the cutting edge technique that i'm using was borrowed from optics which is totally a different field and it's been modified and accordingly have been used in the nuclear field for the first time ever uh i just want to add that um although like for me my time and my research at mit was interrupted by this pandemic this coincidence also had just showed me how little i know and how narrow i was looking at the world's big challenges like energy for example i think this global pandemic also made the whole world realize the limits of their understanding and the boundaries of their knowledge as well so from this experience like being nmit and bureau and being under the pandemic i have learned valuable lessons on how the world should tackle and solve their problems i have learned that no single like hero can solve the world skill challenge alone so we have to work together great work challenges like energy as i said need all of us to work together and to unite as dr malek said uh the great mind and the superheroes out there need to unite their efforts and to work collaboratively and exchange on not their knowledge and have the compassion to solve these big issues uh we need to have the commitment to make this world a better place no matter if we're working on energy or health or poverty or any other world problem climate change for example which link other fields together we need all these talents from different fields to make nuclear energy innovative for example we need the physicist the chemist the electrical engineer the mechanical engineer the material scientists the computer scientists as well things that we never thought we need now we need more than ever oh we need to talk to each other we need to listen from each other and we need to think collaboratively on these topics and bring innovative techniques from other field as well so for example back when when everyone needed to work from home i really thought deeply about how this can affect the safety of nuclear uh like nuclear facilities and how this uh this is the really time to rely more on heavily on passive design feature to prevent nuclear disaster instead of depending on real people being there doing the work and uh depending on active engineered safety system and accurate interventions by human operators who sometimes will actually will not be able to be there for any reason other than war or pandemic or crisis or whatever so also cutting-edge techniques that involves robotics and artificial intelligence could be borrowed from computer science to nuclear energy this can help making the inspection and maintenance and the shutdown if instead in the case of emergency be done more easily and in a passive way so if you really want to accelerate innovation in this field as i said let's work all together we don't know how who can bring any idea from other field and make it really work well for different fields i have a question here that matches perfectly with what you've been saying dr nuff this question says i'm a computer science phd student and my research is an energy my question is how can ai be used to make intelligent energy management at smart cities from your point of view so if i understand very well the question it means that uh she's uh she's she works in a computer field so it was breaking yeah computer science i think we need computer scientists all the time like we cannot risk building a reactor actually and put it there and see how things go we usually start with simulation and see how things go we introduce all the factor in a virtual way and study the whole attack of the whole problem even before we bought anything in our in our labs so we much need these expertise and and artificial intelligence our computer science our robotics as well to solve our big challenges they save us time material and money as well research money as they will predict what will happen nicely and precisely most of the time can i also answer the question yes please do okay so uh basically artificial intelligence and data science is really one of the main areas that can contribute to the energy field there is i will explain to you or just give you an example from my point of view as a question in the question the way that i practice it so there is something a look a view for the future of energy sector that's our energy calls called internet of energy if you've heard of any internet of things there's internet of energy this means that every appliance every system that's plugged into the power sector or to the energy system the biggest energy system can be optimized in order to work in the right way so that it does not affect the whole system negatively but rather positively it can contribute to the uh to the of the holistic system and to the overall system by helping that system to work efficient efficiently more efficiently this can happen by introducing intelligent and smart components into all the appliances and all the uh vehicles uh into uh any component that actually requires energy so so that we bring in a holistic uh system approach uh so uh to for more efficiency in the operations uh i hope this will help you just give you an idea how uh you can contribute from one one on the very near area but there's many uh other areas that you can contribute to as a computer sciences um yes i'm fascinated to learn about the internet of energy as well and um audience member if you have more follow-up questions please go ahead and ask them as we get near the end of the time dr thumra i don't know if i gave you a good chance to answer um a question about your current research is there anything else you want to add about your current research yeah my current research and solar cells uh trying to improve the efficiency of the especially in the sky solar cells trying to improve the efficiency and the stability uh uh i do a collaboration with the here in saudi arabia and in germany and uk and last summer i conducted research in 2019 conduct research and trinity college of dublin um on this research we i worked with the professor sarah mccormack trying to creating a material that is uh synthetic for the sunlight and can be put in the building as a window to capture the sunlight and convert it to the as we know that silicon solar cells at the wavelength uh for the capacitor and the light photon from 500 nanometers to the 1000 nanometer with this material if we put it in the solar cells of silicon solar cells the photon in energy lower than 500 nanometer it can be captured but by this layer and compared to the area where the silicon solutions can capture the slides and improve the efficiency of this type of silicone steelers and this layer can be put in the windows and in the building uh trying to improve the performance of the silicon solar cells and this my research it was in 2019 and the trinity college of dublin and uh these days uh especially in the uh vandemink and i looked down and uh just working in the research uh i didn't feel uh the side effect of pandemic looked down i just trying to work uh different researches in solar cells and transistors and lib any any reason area related to my to improve my knowledge and to help me help my students in university in different areas of renewable energy and as we mentioned we are now in bristol europe planning to open a master degree in renewable energy and i am the manager of this program trying to find a program which can the chemical student or a physical physics student or engineering can conduct this master degree inshallah that's exciting so you're sort of creating an interdisciplinary program around um around energy yes um yes i have a question for you um i don't know exactly how it relates to your research but you mentioned the solar paint and how how is the energy captured out of the paint that seems amazing to me yeah the solar band there is a and this paint there is a species small material grains material that's sensitive for the light and if we uh if we have a building and we paint this building with materials and we connect it to the solar cells or other collectors this material can sensitive for the light and temperature the light from the sun and can convert it to the electricity and this building can i mean cut half of the bra of the bill from using the electricity also you may be uh heared about the skin paint for the solar no this is the artificial intellect yeah and yeah you can you charge your phone with your arms it's a new uh inflation area and the solar cells that's very cool see uh seems a little weird but it's very cool um thank you for updating us and letting us know about your current research it's very exciting the last topic we wanted to cover before in these last um five minutes is what would you advise young people who are thinking about um energy research to focus on what's the area that you would say go go this direction um i guess because i can see you dr millock i think you have a question and answer on your mind so please go ahead with this question okay so uh i would say that this area is is hugely open for any contribution i think you've heard uh we've heard it today several times that uh all the disciplines are very much needed and welcome to contribute to research in the energy but it helps to organize our thinking so basically if you can group all the areas that you can provide your contribution in energy into two areas engineering and economics and policy and then for each technology that you are interested in or would like to contribute to you can address these two perspectives from different aspects so for example for the pv uh solar photovoltaic then there is the pv cell fundamental uh research and the components that get into us we've heard from dr tamra and from dr fatima uh the the components of these cells and how they are many there's curveless wafers there's the how do we enhance the modules for the dust and to become resistant for the weather especially in saudi arabia we have dust issues so that's repellant and hydrophobic coating so uh also we can think of a power transmission modeling system level approach of uh evaluation and modeling the batteries how do we optimize the number and the need for storage the integration of data sciences and and artificial intelligence uh in terms of economics we can ask many questions uh what's the how can we forecast the the energy demand on a component or level or in the at the system level how the uh capacity uh can we can plan for an energy system or energy source overall for example uh solar versus wind how much we need or at even a system level so there is various level and there's various technologies and there's vast perspectives that we can look at and they're all open for uh research including uh how you finance the project how the government can price the energy how do we help the government price the energy is right for us and so all the disciplines uh economics and engineering finance law uh mathematics are are welcome to join and help will help the interdisciplinary approach will help in solving the problems it's an exciting field um we have just a couple of minutes left uh fatima no foreign would you like to add anything to that uh i might i might uh comment in this uh yeah so for anyone who wants to start a new research i want them to know the fundamental of that research read a lot of but know the applications i mean the possible application of that research and then from this point to try to change some parameters or properties to get a new application and my advice is to find something that can be renewable sustainable and uh could be more greener or greener i mean uh so because the future of the energy uh i mean if the trend is to have that the things that can't be end like a sustainable energy and renewable one and that's it well thank you very much for that and i want to thank each of you um dr thundra dr nuff dr fatwa dr milac thank you so much for taking the time to be here today and be part of our webinar and dr kamal as well and thank you to um our audience thank you for taking the time to join us and um learn more about all that's out there in the energy field and i have one final slide to share if you have more questions or want to get in touch with us we have uh many different ways to get in touch with us so thank you everybody for being here and being part of our webinar thank you so much dorothy and thank you so you so much see you all bye-bye
