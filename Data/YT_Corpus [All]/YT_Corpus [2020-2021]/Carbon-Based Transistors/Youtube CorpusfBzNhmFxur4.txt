 [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good afternoon and welcome back to the cornell energy connection 2020 we are glad you joined us here today my name is mark milstein i'm director of the center for sustainable global enterprise located at the sc johnson college of business here at cornell university and on behalf of the center and the energy club which is our student group that we work with we want to welcome you to the 11th annual cornell energy connection uh this is organizing collaboration with the cornell energy club and so i want to give a special thanks to three students who have been critical in making this happen this year mike calendar pierre henri gerard who we're going to hear from in a minute and brian martin and also i want to give thanks to monica twiner our associate director and our center coordinator sophia abdul hamid who did a lot of work behind the scenes to make this panel possible for those of you that may be unfamiliar with the center for sustainable global enterprise we conduct applied research teaching and engagement that's focused on business opportunities that come from addressing social and environmental issues through innovation and entrepreneurship and from our activities such as our speaker series to experiential learning opportunities that we create for students and executives we're always looking to engage new partners if you've never worked with us we hope you'll reach out and we'll find some way to collaborate we have a great lineup for the cornell energy connection for those of you that joined us last week we had a good panel discussion on energy justice today we're going to look at how data centers can become carbon neutral and i want to remind folks that next week on december 18th we'll be looking at the future of energy storage i also want to give some thanks here before we start to our sponsors who have made this possible this year chevron con edison distributed sun and edf renewables have all given us their support and we appreciate that so with that i also want to say one last thank you which is our partner e cornell for helping bring the cornell energy connection to everybody in a very uh convenient way for us all to be able to join this on our own leisure time at home so uh thank you e cornell and with that i want to turn it over to pierre henry pianri can explain a little bit about why this panel topic was chosen this year and who will be joining us pierre henry thanks mark appreciate it so as much said my name is pioneer and i'm finishing up my mba here at connell johnson prior to my mba i spent 12 years in the energy and consulting industries in europe most recently as chief technology officer where one of my roles was to design and implement digital transformation for customers in the energy pharmaceutical and manufacturing in industries and i came to realize that you know although digital transformation improved the operational efficiency and the on-site energy consumption for all clients it would not necessarily reduce the overall carbon footprint of the company if the energy consumption of data center was taken into account in the equation and that was kind of an important moment for me when i did realize that digital does not necessarily mean greener and you know i think that i'm thinking about all the internet connected devices the cloud computing the video streaming all the you know photos that we take with our mobile phone and then save in the cloud later on all of these make the data center one of the most energy intensive assets in the world and you know because a sustainable future is actually the only future we have uh we believe that it's worth spending an hour an hour and 15 minutes of our time today to address this fundamental question can data center become carbon neutral and it's an honor for us to have four leading authorities from microsoft google the united nations and birch infrastructure today to address this fundamental question so it's now my pleasure to introduce you to the moderator of today's panel um linsee on the sun so lindsay the anderson is the director for energy with the energy with the center for sustainability at cornell she's also associate professor at cornell university in biological and environmental engineering and her research goal is to accelerate the transition to a low carbon energy future through the effective integration of renewable energy in the system and the effective leveraging of distributed and demand side resources so lindsay the floor is yours great thanks pierre henry for this excellent introduction and to everybody who's here today it's fantastic you can join us on this friday afternoon um so you can see that we have a star-studded panel today um as mark and pierre henry pointed out in just a moment i'm gonna move things along and let them introduce themselves um because i know we're all excited to get started so i'm just going to take a couple of seconds here to give you a high level overview um first we're going to have an introduction from each of the panelists and then we're going to divide the conversation roughly into three sections uh first we're going to set the stage with a discussion of the importance of data centers both in our lives and in our climate and to our planet and then we're going to shift to focus on what it actually means to be a sustainable or carbon carbon neutral data center and some of the challenges that um you know that the industry is facing in getting there and then finally we'll talk a little bit about the future of data centers and and what our panelists see uh down the road and after that we'll have a few minutes to open up to questions from the audience so uh for the audience if you're here and you have questions at any time just enter them and then we're gonna collect and collate them in the background to ask as many as time will allow uh before the end of our panel at 4 15. so with that let's get started um the the first panelist that i'm going to ask you to introduce himself is christian valadi um if you could go ahead and tell us a little bit about uh yourself and and your journey um that would be great thank you hello i'm i'm christian belotti i'm vp of uh advanced development uh data center advanced development or dad because i'm the old guy uh at microsoft and my journey really started in the data center space in the late 90s where i was looking at efficiency of data center operations and it wasn't very efficient and that's when i came up with the metric called pue which is now used globally in the data center industry and then soon after that i joined microsoft at microsoft i was involved in some of the early strategic designs when they were starting to expand data centers and eventually took on the full data center operation and development team until 2018 at which point i realized i have to do something beyond where data centers were going we were doing a lot of step and repeat so after my sabbatical i came back to lead the data center advanced development team where we are focusing on how to change the game and transform the whole data center ecosystem to be much more sustainable and so that's my journey great thanks christian and thanks for being here so ken do you want to go next absolutely uh pleasure to be here i feel like this is a reunion not only did i grow up in ithaca but i worked for christian i've worked where reid did at google um you know uh pierre henry was uh worked with me over the summer and i even hired some of lindsay's students in the past so it's a real pleasure uh personally i've been at the intersection of data center renewables for about a decade or more uh 10 years ago created google energy and did the first uh off-site wholesale ppas that really kicked off this buying trend just yesterday you know we saw you know amazon announced 3.4 gigawatts of uh purchases so the industry has come a long long way most recently i was at microsoft in christian's organizations as a head of renewables and now started my own company birch infrastructure which focuses on renewable energy and data centers how to link off-site renewables on-site data centers and pair those two together in the most effective way thanks lindsey great thanks ken and thanks for being here so susannah cass hello everyone i'm dowling in from the bay area in california i am the data center advisor to the un sustainable development grow program i spent 25 years in the data center industry probably have built over 200 megawatt across 17 countries when i work at ebay as the ceo for the data center operation i also work for hp running the asia pacific data center located in asia pacific where renewable continued to be a challenge in terms of the power source for asia pacific so it's very dear to my heart to actually solve that problem perhaps can can help me and in addition i also have spent nine plus years at sun microsystem before i got acquired by oracle also working in a data center industry so i started as a computer scientist and i got my mba and my advanced business degree at stanford um at stanford also work as a volunteer and subsequently become an energy fella to actually help to convert our campus and shut down the dirty energy source that we use and we come together as a community as a research university and the rest is history now in terms of we are pledging and executing and demonstrating and continue to do the research in zero carbon zero emission and zero ways to service our community we've done all that and then we learned no one is actually on the campus using it but so let so glad to be here back to you lindsay thanks susanna okay and our uh final panelist is reid spolak great thanks and and thanks for inviting me into google to join this panel um my name is reed spolic i work in energy strategy at google i've been to google now about three years before google i was at amazon web services the cloud computing division of amazon i started the renewable energy program there um as ken mentioned there was exciting announcement coming out of that group yesterday about the 3.4 gigawatts so while i'm not working on that team i'm certainly the planet is better for it and we are all excited you know as an industry we compete across a lot of different things but in a weird way in the renewable energy space we're all very much very much aligned um so at google uh our team's responsibility is to meet these sustainability sustainability goals that i think we're going to talk about a little bit um and just to put for google in context um as i think a lot of you know electricity is just the lifeblood of these data centers for for google in 2018 we used a little over 10 terawatt hours uh which is about the same as two san francisco's of power in a given year so we like to put that in perspective and then just outside of renewables i think it's also important to highlight that there's a lot of other energy topics that data centers touch um you know in these when a single data center campus that a lot of people on this panel have worked with it uses the amount of power as a small city there's a lot that goes into that with the supply contracts the physical infrastructure contracts with the utilities to make sure there's the physical supply this leads into energy market reform a lot of policy and regulatory matters and so these are sort of common features across a lot of the sort of organizations represented here and i just want to make sure we highlight that those are very big themes in our industry as well but uh looking forward to the conversation thanks great thanks reed i hope we'll get to touch on all those topics um through the course of this panel it'll be a quick hour so i won't waste anybody's time but as i promised you now you can see what a star-studded panel we have um so let's get started as i promised we're going to talk a little bit about background here so in order to understand the relevance of data centers to all of us which are you know mostly invisible to the end user suzanna would you mind giving us some background um on sort of the important role that data centers play in our everyday lives uh thank you lindsay i'll be glad to so i'll go quickly but i'll start from the beginning the fundamentals of what the data centers are and why is it relevant to our daily lives especially we are all in somewhat a lockdown mode especially during this time so data centers are actually fairly simple this is actually where computing networking and data storage equipment is concentrated for the purpose of collecting storing processing and distributing to give access to large amounts of data that we need for us to do our work so these data center locations exist in one form or another since the advent of the computer for some of you want to take the first genera take a look at the first generation of what a mainframe computer era looks like one of my favorite movie is actually the hidden figures they actually need a computer room for nasa to actually host one mainframe computer so go take a look at that movie this one actually one of my favorite like i said it's a lot of wonderful lessons to be learned there and today you all have a smartphone that you hold with one hand or one parm it actually has more processing power and data storage than that one mainframe computer exhibit in the movie now why is it relevant to rfs because we all work from home and again thank you for dialing in today we are all here to learn from each other we're all here to live and work and play in the digital transformation age moving towards the industrial 4.0 the handheld smartphones that we all connected to these data center does the work for us either through the internet via the satellite the wi-fi or your local internet service provider that you sometimes love but you sometimes hate so we can then get access to the cornell energy connection session like we have today virtually and we can also use our internet favorite gadget devices from your home to either order up your favorite movie or order up the food or the device or any other gifts that you're going to be shopping for your loved ones this holiday anywhere anytime and anything you want covert 19 has proven two decades of this digital computing happened in just two months just like zoom they reported as a 400 percent increase consecutively for the last four months of their online usage it is because overnight it become an online social platform to learn to work and for some of us we just need to connect because we are people it is beautiful for us to actually learn from one of christian's colleague noelle that he she shared with us that microsoft reported 75 million team minutes are being used per day during the pandemic it is amazing in terms of the organization that i'm sure christian will educate us a little bit later about how he runs his data center to be able to reach hundreds of megawatt of capacity just got added in the last couple months now if you look back in the internet minute which i do have a report i'm glad to make that available to lindsay so you all have it in one second prior to the pandemic 18.1 million texts were being sent in two seconds 4.5 million youtube video are being watched by reed's company and during the pandemic it got reported to be 6.1 million per two seconds this is the reason why the data center are relevant because it helped us to live to learn to entertain and also to work and today if you want to take a look at where these data centers are located one of the startups that i'm part of is very simple go to edge fauna and take a look at the map for example where i am in california you can immediately see the interactive map just like the coronavirus keeping track of where where the cases are you will see 156 data center just in the bay area within the santa clara county and where new york is where um actually cornell right around there you can see the map there's like 84 of them so you no longer need to basically search for all the different data center location but you can basically use some of this interactive map to find out worldwide where many of these things are located and how is that actually relevant to you so data center today help us to live learn entertain and to work lindsay that's why it is important great thanks susannah obviously even more important now as you pointed out um so i'm going to go to christian next um so you know susana's made the the case that this is basically underlying everything we do now so um can you now that we have that understanding can you give us a little bit of an explanation of why that means sustainability is important especially in modern data data centers it seems to be a hot topic yeah so so i think one of the things we can point to is you know year over year processing efficiency gets better right there's moore's law where every two years you double the number of transistors on a die and so we've been blessed by by its nature to become more efficient you could argue we're more efficient and that this shouldn't be a problem energy shouldn't be a problem because if you weight enough doublings it'll go away to zero right but the reality is and this is where javon's paradox comes in you need to look at computing as a resource and the problem with our resource is year over year a computation gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper because of moore's law now moore's law is reaching some limits right now but i'm convinced we're going to engineer around that as we've done all all these decades i've been working so so when you look at what's actually happening because the resource is getting so a compute is getting so cheap what happens is the demand skyrockets and that's what we're seeing right now you look at the amazing growth applications that didn't have a business a business opportunity before because it was too expensive it's unbelievable to me because i've lived through all of this that i could get all my email and it's really not even costing me anything 20 years ago that was a big deal and you paid a lot to have that kind of privilege um or 25 years ago maybe 20 years ago is too recent but at the end of the day so what's happening is there's this huge expansion of data centers across the globe um not just with folks like microsoft and google and aws but really everywhere and even enterprises the same sort of thing although there is some movement of enterprise into the cloud and so where years ago i remember in 2007 we built our first owned data center it was a 13 megawatt facility we walked in and we're like we're going to be fired because who's going to use 13 megawatts right to our first computers that were coming in was a couple of megawatts we're in big trouble and that same site is now starting to push well over 300 megawatts right and so what's really happening is there's just this huge expansion of all the sites we never imagined back 15 years ago that we would see this kind of growth year over year you're always thinking okay it can't be more than this and it is and we should expect 10x more growth in the future and this is what really motivated me even to change my role in that if we look at where we are today and we expand another 10x the scale would be nothing the world has seen if we go another 10x beyond that what happens and these 10xs occur in five-year less than 10-year increments for sure so how do we continue to scale and the power that goes along with it there has to be a transformation we cannot continue doing it the same way you know when you think about what sustainability is i love this definition i got from someone i was interviewing sustainability is how did i want to say this sustainability is really being around for the long term and deservedly so and when we really think about our companies how do we actually create something where we will always be deservedly so to be around for a long long time and that i think is ultimately the thing in another 10x you won't be looked upon as a great service because you will be consuming all the energy on the planet how do we change that and how do we be proactive about that which is why all of the companies right now are really looking at changing the game and not being a problem but rather the solution to the climate change that's approaching great thanks that's a perfect introduction to my next question um so i understand that both google and microsoft have ambitious goals for sustainability and clean energy in the near future so what i'd like to do is give each of you a minute or two to um just sort of present to to the audience you know what those goals are um and if you have a second to to sort of highlight your approach to achieving them and let's start with reid great thanks i love that definition by the way i'm gonna go update my linkedin or something to put that as a goal and aspiration career aspiration um yeah thanks and and i think this is important to point out that there are different metrics um to define sustainability and a lot of these companies are going to use different metrics i think that's okay in many in many ways good um you know in the in the sort of panel introduction there was it was talked about how can data centers become carpet neutral and i think one of the big takeaways is a lot of us already are if you take the definition of carbon neutral in terms of offsetting your full amount of carbon on annual basis a lot of us are i mean google for example is actually in our third decade of climate action we first achieved carbon neutrality uh in 2007 and then our next goal after that was what we called 100 renewable energy matching so on the course of a calendar year on a global basis we buy as much renewable energy as our data centers use and we met that 100 matching goal in 2017 and have met that in each of 2018 and 2019 as well um a few months ago we actually uh set a new goal for ourselves i like to think of it as moving the goal posts to make it harder to what we're calling our 24x7 carbon free energy initiative and that's the idea that in every hour of every day our data centers are using carbon-free energy rather than just matching and the idea there is to be more reflective of what we think the grid needs to be in the long term um the grid needs to figure out how to power all of us with carbon free energy and so that involves a lot of real challenges in terms of when the traditional energy resources like a solar or wind are not generating what do you do then there's lots of um there's lots of obvious answers there's a lot of not obvious answers but we think that this is this is the fundamental problem and as a planet and so we as google are trying to take that head on um you know maybe we can talk about this later in the panel but one of the messages i'm hoping to to tell to the folks listening is that um i think it's fair to say google does not know how we're going to do this we don't have a very defined roadmap and we're looking for ideas the smart people who are who are here as part of the university and listening across all sorts of industries and focuses we need ideas and brains and people to help us to help us figure this out so we're sort of open to these types of business models or technologies or regulatory changes what is it that needs to change in order for you know let's say google to meet our 24x7 carbon free energy goal by 2030 but then the hope is then that that can translate to how do we transition the entire global power grid or the metaphor for what that sense um over time as well excellent thanks reid so christian you want to uh fill us in on yeah certainly so i i agree with reid uh you know i i we work together a lot our our data center teams um i'm close friends with uh joe cava um who is the vp of infrastructure there and clearly we have the same goals and and um uh and similarly we've been i think carbon neutral for a decade now and similarly we were moved away and now we're committing towards driving to 100 renewable there's a big difference right and and and re discuss that uh clearly um and so our goal is by 2025 is to be 100 renewable likely before then by 2030 to be carbon negative so we're actually consuming carbon and by 2050 we plan to actually have consumed enough carbon to pay back all the carbon emissions to 1975 and we made that announcement back in january of this year or this past year so so uh we made some really aggressive um uh goals and we want to make it so that any of the carbon associated with energy consumed by microsoft over its whole lifetime is going to be wiped clean so that's number one number two we're also investing and how do we go even beyond that because there's more to carbon emissions than just the energy you use it's about the supply chain and all of that and that's where a lot of our our research is in my own team if i look at my team's vision and i've said this publicly in many keynotes in the past that our vision is about making the data center disappear because my contention is that cost is is a fact it's kind of a representation of embedded carbon if something costs less you're statistically going to have less embedded carbon so by making the data center disappear you affect it or if you drive the cost down of a data center you're effectively driving the embedded carbon down and so one of the things if i look at how we approach this in in my team we are looking at it through simplification and integration right data centers i i know susanna you said they're quite simple when i go into the data center they look like quite complex and and the thing is getting more and more complex you know as something grows even if you're repeating the same thing over and over how it plays together the dimensions of complexity increase how do we simplify and so things we look at is why do we have all these electrical systems they let you know uh there's gas generation somewhere um it goes through the transmission lines um goes into the substation goes to our data centers we go from high voltage medium voltage low voltage you have all these conversions and in the end it pretty much converts back to what you started with which is dc and so we've been doing a lot of work in the area of fuel cells because if i could with fuel cells we essentially are going from uh 200 and uh or what is it to 400 volt dc to essentially servers which are 400 volt dc so we've created a data center a prototype data center or a pilot data center where your power generation is right above you and so not that it's still playing out from a cost perspective fuel cells are expensive but it's a demonstration that we should be thinking differently in about integrating ecosystems and power generation with data centers to substantially simplify uh the ecosystem and have huge benefits in efficiency you know it's not and so this is what we're doing we're trying to create new systems with massive integration in place part of that is disruptive technology all these all these things resource efficiency obviously all these things will play into it where it's a massive integration that absolutely changes the game it cannot be just the data center optimization anymore it's an ecosystem optimization great thank you um so uh coming back to sort of the question of renewable energy i want to turn to ken for a minute um because ken i know you've spent most of your career you know thinking about renewables and and how to sort of facilitate um their use right economically um so what do you see you know when you when you hear these goals about you know 100 renewable energy sort of time matched what do you see as as the main challenges of relying on complete renewable completely renewable energy to power data centers sure and i'll i'll go back to when i started google in 2008 you know reid mentioned that so you achieved carbon neutrality the year before and the question was both okay what's next so that was the time when data centers really said okay well let's start moving from carbon neutral or renewable energy equipment to these long-term sort of tpas and you know that was that was the next frontier um i think in this uh discussion we need to you know really differentiate between you know the means in the end you know the end is carbon renewable are the needs you know certainly if you're in the renewable business you know that is also the end but you know as a society and as a globe you know it's carbon reduction so you know microsoft has been there you know you know it's already carbon neutral and going beyond that google's there and then well what does renewables do beyond that and that's where i really think about the cost side of it because when you're talking about you know large numbers here you know uh reid mentioned that google was at you know 10 terawatt hours uh in 2018. you know you know that's uh well over a billion dollars of power no question yeah probably closer to two depending on the average rates uh yesterday amazon announced that they're buying 3.4 uh gigawatts of uh renewable energy depending on what their actual costs were that's a commitment and kind of the ballpark of 300 400 million dollars a year spent and pretty soon a billion dollars here a billion dollars there you're starting to talk about real money even for these big companies so how do you look at this from a risk management point of view because it's wonderful to charge and say we're doing this but i can tell you driving us out on both of those seats before you start sending a couple billion dollars of invoices uh to your treasury group and they start asking questions and when you're building these assets these are very long-lifed assets we can argue whether they're 10 or 15 years or maybe you could extend a lifetime beyond that but you know when google and microsoft kind of put down a footprint it's long term and we have to understand that in a world with increasing renewables there's a lot of volatility in power price so how can we take renewables which is a long-term fixed price and actually use it as a hedge so now that doesn't have anything to do with carbon yes renewables also can help achieve a carbon but if we're going to make this commitment we're going to spend this money how can we use it from a risk management point of view and that's really where i think you know there's some still some wood to be chopped here really for all the data center providers it's relatively easy to sign these contracts paying the bills and understanding the volatility impact of the wholesale markets i think that is a challenge and the the two that i really call out there that i think you know are the primary risks are location risk and intermittency so location you know if you do a wind farm in west texas it's not necessarily going to power your data center whether it be in the bay area or up in central washington like microsoft's uh large campus that christian previously mentioned so the prices in those two areas on the grid are not going to be the same you know the different dynamics different supply and demand that's known as basis risk and then the second is the intermittency the time of day you know shape risk and really the problem here is the more renewables you put on the grid the lower the price is when the renewables are generating so you know it's a cannibalization of the value of renewables in the us we call it you know uh the duck curve you know in europe they'll call the loch ness monster it's that belly of the duck whatever solar is generating your prices are very low so you can have extremely you know cheap solar but the value may be zero or even negative during the day how do you manage that risk because to manage that risk will enable others beyond you know the data centers you know all trillion plus dollar companies at this point you know the other smaller companies who don't necessarily have a a very uh compliant and understanding treasury group when you send them the bills so that's really i think one of the challenges as we start rolling this out and really using renewables which is the means to the end that we want which is carbon awesome thanks ken um okay so uh we talked about renewables we talked about why um sustainable sustainability is important um but there are there are lots of dimensions of sustainability in data centers right so uh christian if you could give us just a quick comment on you know what when you think about a sustainable data center what dimensions are you thinking about um and then i think we'll go to susana for some follow-up comments on that yeah so certainly agree with ken right um uh it is about carbon but it's not just about carbon right uh we've spent a lot of time and we're looking at uh substantially reducing water consumption and in fact you know my team is working on technologies and designs to eliminate the need for water period right and so we really need to be looking at every resource in the whole supply chain of the data center and seeing how can we mitigate the need for that and so the dimensions are endless and that's why again i go back to the saying and this is why i use this as kind of the the vision for the team make the data center disappear if i put a data center in a location and anything you know it's a control volume if anything is going into it that means we're consuming something how do we make those things going into it disappear because when you make that disappear the data center disappears the only thing coming out is data and so that's the ultimate goal is it possible there's no such thing as perpetual machines and all of that but you have to have that vision and that goal of where there is no resource nothing going into the data center because then that's what makes you question everything that revolves around that data center so clearly water even even uh people people are a resource they consume food they write all these things we have to be looking at the complete uh every possible dimension the complete ecosystem right and so um and that's what we focus on and then you know where can we take it from there at the end of the day i think data centers have a huge impact they consume land that's another resource right how do we mitigate that so all these things are important for us to look at and we have to look at it fast i believe there's urgency around this and it's something that uh all organizations that are growing this rapidly need to take care of because anytime new technology new ideas come up it's going to take a decade for it to become mainstream so we don't i don't think have a decade right and we we're expanding now how do we get this going faster great thanks susannah do you want to add to that yes i agree with christian he is the godfather of data center so we all need to learn from him when he actually speak the cleanest data center i also agree it's not one power by wind or solar or hydroelectric in the nordics which are abundant it's actually i believe is the one that we do not need to build which is i would say another way of christians saying make the data center go away so it is a privilege today to actually speaking with a lot of future leaders who are all homeschooled our future leaders are all homeschooled even though you all claim that you're going to get a degree from cornell um but humor aside i i fundamentally believe it needs a rethink we need each of you out there as a future generation not a few of us who's actually been around for two or three decades to actually lead what is really kind of going on you need to start demanding whoever you actually work on per kilowatt be it the movie provider be the content provider whoever you buy your product from you're gonna ask them for transparency in terms of what is their sustainability goal don't underestimate the power of consumerism and what you believe in your own personal sustainability goal is going to drive what reit said earlier the future thought leadership thinking that we all can incorporate and learn from you all which is why i fundamentally believe you are here is to teach us where the direction is actually going to be going and we are all here to facilitate the journey and i sincerely hope majority of the audience today are actually women because they promote one of the unsdg goal number five which is basically equality and empowerment of actually people regardless of what your race gender is going to be every voice matters to go back to a little bit on the specifics on the sustainable data center attributes what i'm basically working with is absolutely a privilege to be working with christian's team to basically doing the on-site carbon free design that by the way his organization just win the 2020 innovation award for carbon free energy he is extremely humble but his team worked really really hard for that journey especially one of the gentleman named sean james who look exactly kind of like christian actually over over the 10 years and he and his team he and his team worked really hard on winning the award and they did not do it just to win the award they did it because they can and they believe in it and it's basically a modular fusel that basically power the energy and correct my wrong christian he announced it that it is possible to use on site carbon free energy and still have no downtime knock on the wood since you guys have it in place when the grid around you will actually have faulty um performance and the emissions and the emissions is is water that's the other positive exactly so thank you for mentioning that because the last point i want to make lindsay to the future leaders who is going to be taking over the world and we need to all listen to you is i fundamentally believe the net zero data center should have a symbiotic relationship of shared infrastructure on energy connectivity mobility water and waste the waste coming out from the community should be converted and regenerated as clean energy source for the data center the ways that we came out from the data center throughout our life cycle such as district heating such as the heat that the waste heat that we have or even the equipment that we actually need to upgrade can be regenerated to keep this material in perpetual use in the community and if we can measure all the sustainability calculator and emission from end to end just like what google is actually driving in the data centers industry this will transform and transcend all of us to start thinking about what the real problem is going to be and again going back to the cleanest data center if we can actually reduce the waste perhaps we can get more out of the one that we have and we don't need to build more anymore and if we must the new data center that we build need to be sustainable and i have to say thank you for can founding his new company because we have some hope that is going to get us to be the equitable climate action plan that we all are hoping for thank you lindsay thanks susanna um okay so so that's fantastic so on the practical side i'm going to go and ask reid sort of upfront when you're you're designing and building a a new data center for sustainability um what do you need to consider to make sure that that that is going to be sustainable in the future and um you know in terms of using clean energy in terms of site selection um what what are the things that you really need to think about as you design and build that center sure uh great question i mean i would just echo some of the reese's the resources that were just pointed out are hugely important when we think about the sort of sustainability and the resource intake of the data center industry i'll just say as the as a power guy i won't necessarily speak to those but google would would echo a lot of those sentiments i don't want to underplay those um i think first and foremost it kind of gets to that same concept of just use as as less as possible um you know some quick stats about how google thinks about our data centers uh pue uh christian's metric which is is the standard of industry um google is reporting as in 2019 about a 1.11 compared to what we say is the industry average of about 1.67 um on average one of our current data centers uses about 50 percent less energy and delivers seven times more computing than five years ago and these stats are on our on our website um i think just putting some numbers to just how much the industry has moved even in the last few years but then when you talked about um the the factors we look at one is a factor of where we're going with our data centers and to your point that's can we power this with around-the-clock renewable energy that's a it's a matter of regulatory policy that's that that's resource mix that's resource access becomes a huge factor in where we are building out data centers and we're trying to communicate this to the broader called the economic development ecosystem which is you know this is a big factor in house and i'm sure a lot of other data centers are thinking about where to build is how we're going to meet these non-optional sustainability goals and so to the extent we can build that into the decision making process i think solves a lot of the instead of having to address our power use with with buying renewables after the fact if you can address it up front is increasingly a theme that i think all of us in the data center industry are leaning on um i'll throw out a couple other uh kind of unique things that google is doing related to sort of the the products that google um is creating from these data centers um one we've actually been running a pilot where we've proven that we use 30 cooling efficiency in a data center where we've allowed google ai to intelligently run our ac units so they figure out based on inputs such as temperature various weather controls when to run very localized ac units rather than you know a manual engineer and we're saving about 30 in in cooling power which we think is there's just a lot of um expanded effects to that that we can roll out over time uh another one that i particularly am pretty nerded out on is what we're calling carbon intelligent computing and this relates to our around-the-clock uh carbon free energy initiative and in this we're actually shifting non-critical workloads so think about like um we're updating google translate with more words or more phrases we can do those whenever wherever really makes sense and we're actually timing those and placing those based on where the sort of hourly marginal carbon emission is is lowest um this is still in its pilot phase and we still have a ways to to roll this out but i think these are the types of things where big tech can kind of use our own product in order to improve our own sustainability and we're trying to kind of develop more examples like this i do want to quickly plug google just a couple days ago released a series of podcasts kind of about this topic it's called where the internet lives you can search it on pretty much any of your standard podcasts downloading apps or services it's called where the internet lives and it's kind of a basic understanding of how data centers work and how the internet works and there's a big focus on sort of the technology and design around sustainability and so for those of you that are curious and just wanting to learn up a little bit on some of this i'd encourage you to listen to that one excellent thank you um okay so we are starting to run a little bit behind so uh i'm going to try to to keep my whole list of questions but if we could you know try to be super concise um there's so much to tell here i just want to make sure that we at least hit all the key topics um and so the next one is really um about this triple bottom line approach that that we hear now more in the sustainability space um and so susannah i thought i'd send this one to you to to ask you um how this sort of triple bottom line approach plays in in the in the data center space um how do you implement it and and is it likely to be adopted sort of at the at the finance office level that ken was referring to earlier is it going to be a tough sell or is this something that that is going to become mainstream thank you lindsay i'll try to keep it brief so cfo are all motivated by growth and return at least in the decades that i have worked with in running data center either at ebay or hp or sun and recently in the last couple of years have been working with many head of states in the energy sector as we start thinking about financing be it the design the site selection money that we need to buy material to build construct operate and frankly money that we actually need to spend to decommission and break down a data center or you know we started all again and actually scale a new one just like the one that christian mentioned a 17 megawatt will grow into a 400 very easily very quickly because of the demand um i'd like to share with the audience today that since you're all in a different you know different business school in cornell you are our future cfo and i hope you don't make the same mistake that the past cfo or the current cfo is is only looking at her or his balance sheet it is important that you also need to consider the stakeholders the planet the environmental factors the resource that we actually take to build one data center just be specific in this one year it's been reported 600 liters of water are being used to build the data center which i assume are some of the data evidence behind why christian and his company show a lot of care about the water volume that's gonna do and the continuous stress that i know rhys company is struggling with in the county of mesa in arizona when you're trying to build a data center in a desert that's why don't underestimate the comment again our godfather of data center christian said it's net positive we are actually generating water instead of using one so the cfo need to consider the double bottom line absolutely the single bottom line is the economic growth and return and we all hope after the pandemic we're gonna all come out very strong but you need to have the double bottom line the triple one comes in is the following i have a call to action for everyone listening in today and i plead you to assume your social responsibility it is extremely important that we also need to think about a data center only exists yes to process data and to emit data but also to serve the community the people not just the machine user that the data center lives in so hence in one of the startups i got involved with that does the carbon free energy the fuel cell that christian talked about we coined a term called sustainability cost of ownership and many of the new cfo now incorporated that absolutely make financial sense let's say in terms of addressing the bottom line the single bottom line in terms of total cost of ownership but we also need to incorporate the sustainability metrics such as the emissions in a software defined manner so we can calculate per kilowatt hour consumed we are using data energy and i'm not talking about synthetic instrument that you still use fossil fuel and then you just go offset it at the end of the year but you genuinely count it 24 by 7 per kilowatt consume it's actually clean energy and zero emission and i hope that we're not going to go over provision with a whole bunch of these generators sitting around which is why christian team won the award with the design that has been proven the future is now the climate crisis is here and now and we all must assume the social responsibility hence to triple bottom line and it is absolutely possible because the new technology if you look at that as a holistic system you are actually reducing the capital expenses because you have less equipment and you absolutely are reducing for example your operating expenses by one example is utilizing immersion cooling and it increases the computer density increases the hardware life or cfo is going to like you because they're not she or he is not going to always sign off on new acquisitions and at the same time the heat the waste that you might have the equipment that you may not need that come out from the data center can be regenerated and there is a second life for it well no surprise i actually work at ebay 17 years ago i actually like used items because if we can keep this equipment in perpetual use to embrace the circular economy attributes yes i fundamentally believe the cfo and i have not had too much difficulty convincing him or her that by actually looking at it long term but not just quarter by quarter using christian's term on sustainable in terms of looking at the long term it will be actually accepted and more importantly future leaders like you all listening in today who will become the next generation cfo in record time because you are smarter and you're homeschooled and you can basically change the rule and help us define what the future is going to be rather than just looking at a single bottom line in a balance sheet thank you lindsay great thanks susannah okay so we're now moving into our last couple questions on sort of future considerations um and you know i noticed that that basically all of our panelists at some point or another have talked about um you know integra like making integrated decisions with the grid um having this completely integrated ecosystem that that you know we make sure the whole ecosystem is sustainable as opposed to just the data center um and that sort of reminds me of this idea of of that people have been talking about in the in the power system space about operating data centers to provide flexibility to support the integration of renewables at a large scale oh this is for you ken uh so do you think that that idea is something that can can benefit data center operators as well as the grid or do you think it's just going to be sort of a a one-way kind of beneficial situation i'll use uh christian's phrase here uh and i'm surprised he hasn't said it yet uh you know data centers is it a data center or is it a power plant it's actually a data plant um you know because uh you know at least today all these data centers have backup generators you know there's a few exceptions microsoft's new data center and sweden one but most of them have backup generators and today they're on diesel maybe tomorrow natural gas a day after that hydrogen but they have backup generators and batteries those are the equipment that is needed to balance the grid we balance the renewables you know you could think about it as demand response you could think about it as your additional generation when the renewables are not there but data centers can have a proactive role rather than just you know pure consumption and today for the most part those that's underutilized capex behind the data center meter you know it costs a little extra to upgrade uh your generator or to make your battery two-way and feedback onto the grid but if you listen to the market and the data centers you know taking market price the market will tell us the right thing to do um you know whenever the renewables are there market price is low you don't have to generate and then when the market price when the renewables uh decline in the evenings or when the wind stops market price is there and it is that automatic signal to the data centers so you know as very large consumers data centers have a unique role to play here because they're the one of the only large 100 renewable powered consumers that have 100 on-site backup most do not have 100 homicide backup we think about the scale it's not a small scale um today there's you know my number's probably a year and a half two years old since i put together my pitch deck for my new business but it was about four gigawatts of data centers in the united states at that time and by 2030 is a factor of you know over 10x of that so i'd be 40 gigawatts of new uh fast ramp backup generators and 40 gigawatts of new batteries you uh if those are actually grid resources you give those numbers to any utility out there or any utility planner their jaw will hit the ground they have not thought about the impact of what will happen if you know these data centers actually take the resources they already have and are going to have to put in the ground for resiliency and turn around and face some good for renewable balancing it's a scary prospect of utility but it's empowering if you're a data center okay awesome ken's yes on um and in fact we are actually building our data centers now with grid interactive capabilities so when when the grid needs power we let them use our ups's and we've actually changed from lead acid to lithium-ion batteries because they can take more cycles and so so we're finding this win-win situation where we're ending up being an ancillary service and there's a huge opportunity in that space because for the most part our ups's are underutilized right to ken's point so ken is spot on and and we're already this this was a technology that was developed by my team we're already now down down the path of doing exactly that you know first it started with demand response which is a really crude form but now it's even to being much more integrated with the with the grid so i think it's absolutely a path that's going to be taken great sounds like i do have to give a lot of credit to christian his team sean james a lot of the innovations coming out of there let's just say i'm glad my non-solicit's over because you better watch out i love you ken i love you okay guys um know that this is great so so it sounds like there's there's great financial incentives for the data centers to provide this much needed service to the grid as well so everybody can win and i'm really happy to hear that okay so i'm gonna uh we're we're we only have about 12 minutes left in the panel so i want to soon skip to taking uh some of the the many questions from the audience um so i'm going to close with one last question that i'm going to give to all of you and it's going to be like one of these um sort of almost like the the game that you play when you're a kid where you have to say one word that pops into your mind except you can say a whole sentence um if if somebody asked you what are what's a suggestion that you have for the end user that as an individual what can they do to support sustainability and data centers and i'm gonna start with reed in the whole sentence wow um just be conscious consumers of what you're consuming on your phone and on all of your devices great uh let's go with ken so uh this is more to the programmers out there who are the users of azure aws google cloud um actually think about where you're putting your data a lot of give you choice of where you go don't necessarily just pick the one closest to you if you're in the bay area don't click bay area not only is that the most expensive but think about the carbon footprint you know montreal you know other places where it is a much lower marginal carbon footprint programmers have a lot of impact over where data centers are placed by where they make their buying decisions excellent thanks christian so i'm going to tell you essentially what i tell everybody and if you were to ask people close to me they'll say the same thing i say two things primarily be curious and think bigger and that holds for everyone on the planet super okay and susanna we'll close with you and then i'll move on to the the audience questions i would say thank you lindsay it was a great question every voice define your journey of what sustain is going to be the data center and all of us will follow you set the right goal for behind you we will all follow you in the journey that you're gonna define for us on sustainably great thank you okay um so moving to the audience questions it looks like we have about three categories of questions that have come through um the first category is on renewable energy uh and the and how they relate to data centers and then there's there's a set on site location and then a third uh grouping on sustainability beyond power so what i'm going to do is sort of sort of alternate between these categories um to hit as many as we can and so i'll ask the question and then jk can take it um so the first question is uh amazon is one of the largest purchasers of renewable energy given that uh amazon web services have some of the largest data centers around the world is amazon doing enough or what more can they do um maybe i'll start okay i have a recent conversation with them i actually asked them what took you so long and their response basically going to be um i said i was i'll believe it when i actually see ashburn turning not dirty and because of your footprint welcome to the welcome to the group we do need you because of your market leadership and i got very positive response once they make up their mind just like any other people in the data center they will basically take the journey and there are the other clouds as well such as alibaba in china and i think this is not just about u.s centric cloud it is the global um uh matter and climate crisis cannot be just one country specific so i think aws hopefully will uh catch up maybe not win the award for first movie advantage but most improved okay does anybody want to add to that yeah this is this is go on ken go on yeah i i'm obviously going to jump in there because we got to google the microsoft no one might want to touch that one um i'll just say certainly they're improving and when you dig into it google and microsoft amazon all have slightly different uh approaches and i think that's good you know we need a variety of approaches you know we don't know which one's going to win it's a kind of a competition among the three it's a friendly competition and certainly i'm glad to see uh amazon stepping up and pushing my two former companies to do a little better yeah so what what i was just gonna add was um what i'm really proud of is our industry in general um all of the companies and the leaders in these companies have gotten together and we're recognizing as an industry that we have to be better so to me that's the big win for i really don't care you know what aws is doing and what google is doing because none of us can solve the problem by ourselves for me the big win is when we collaborate together and we actually that's how we really move the dial we can't move the dial on our own and i'm really super proud of of our industry not i'm not saying we're done we have a lot of work to do but i'm super proud of our our industry for actually getting above and beyond the boundaries of their companies so uh i just have to leave that leave you with that that's fantastic quickly you know no longer at aws but i did start the renewable program there and without getting into all the details i will say amazon cares a lot about what their customers think i mean their number one tenant is customer obsession so that means speak up tell them what you want as their customer just because i'm a tree hugger as an employee they don't care about that they care if their customers are tree huggers and care about this so i'm saying that tonight about myself but um that's kind of the point of being a conscious consumer if you care about what you are what your suppliers are doing on this front speak up and be very loud about it excellent that ties right back into what suzanne has been saying about you know making sure that you you know stand behind your values i think it's great okay um from the site location category i have a question from bill card that says are there any data centers located where the waste heat is an input to another process for example a greenhouse yes uh definitely in bowdoin in sweden and lulia up in sweden and also in denmark um and also in stockholm it's actually all news for uh well new news for us american but all news for the nordics um they have been doing it for a long time now it's actually part of the symbiotic relationship that i definitely talked about it's a very well orchestrated system i learned a lot being there um recently and well recently meeting a year ago and um but uh absolutely uh and if anybody need more information lindsay i'm glad to share with you the entire blueprint and the approach that they do and frankly how much money actually you can make by selling the wasted heat to food clusters and uh district heating i'm glad to make that report available to you yeah the the other the other thing that we should add to that is um traditionally or i depends how far back you go because data centers at one time were all liquid cooled now they're air cooled but um liquid cooling is coming back and and it's a technology that's going to be much more prolific in data centers in the future and that has a lot to do with gpus and just power densities and all that kind of stuff once you go to liquid cooling that whole thing of reuse of heat becomes much easier because the problem with data centers when they're air cooled is it's low quality heat and the cost to reuse low quality heat sometimes could and as i said before cost is kind of the proxy for carbon content if it's going to cost a lot it means you're actually doing something to get the heat there that's costing money that has carbon associated with it so so the fact that we're going to be going to liquid cooling in the not too dis too distant future we will be able to operate at higher temperatures fluid temperatures and then now the cost of getting this higher quality heat than just air temp you know what you get with air becomes much more effective and i think there's going to be a lot more happening with district heating with time great okay um and from the sustainability and power um group here i have a question from danny that says uh are you looking at your co-location providers to be carbon neutral as well yes ultimately just yes yeah because that's part of our footprint and i'll i'll jump in there because i do a lot of work with the co-location providers i do think you know you know to the hyperscalers the the googles the microsoft's um there's confusion on who owns that uh responsibility you have some feel that it's the tenant's responsibility and or as the landlord and you know there's probably some work to be done on that uh baton handoff between the two a lot of the co-location providers that i talk to feel that they shouldn't be renewable because that their customers want to do it and the customers certainly want to do it so they feel they don't have to or they don't want to conflict with what their customers are doing so there is more work to do to really knit that together between the hyperscalers and colos and come up with a standard handoff on responsibilities and lindsay uh i'll just add to it uh many of the different colo are actually on their own also established at that carbon neutrality goal uh i cannot be more proud of them they actually definitely use that as a differentiator and in relation to them and excuse me in relation to that i would say many of the utility now are also pledging themselves being a carbon neutral for example i think one very progressive thinking one is southern company and they own many of the different companies and they service all kinds of data centers throughout they are the hidden gem in that regard they themselves are also making the carbon neutrality regarding what the customer is going to be so i think it's wonderful to actually be able to see end to end infrastructure provider stepping up not just the the hyperscaler and the cloud provider we need everybody to be part of it just like what christian said and it's not just our country if nothing else we were behind and we need to basically embrace it and step up after january 20th okay excellent so i'm gonna ask one more quick question because i think this is really on point before we before we wrap up um for the day and this this question i don't have a name beside it says but for smaller companies what would you recommend as the best source for purchasing offsets since we're talking about you know smaller companies and how they should play use the cloud oh i'm i'm happy to jump on that one absolutely it started as carbon the pendulum swung you know over the past 10 years through renewables um but there's a lot of confusion on you know the quality of renewable credit there's so much time on the carbon but i would go back to what is what is the means and what is the ends the carbon is the end so as long as you feel comfortable with the quality of that carbon credit you know you're getting one ton you do one megawatt of renewables for the small company it's hard to tell what the carbon content of that offset may be just uh bloomberg published two days ago it's a really deep dive on kind of all of the all of the hidden flaws of the offset industry and i'd encourage you to read that as just kind of the downfalls that ken's mentioning i i agree with uh what read said i i also need to mention one colleague with christian brian janus he and his jim collins have done some very creative well buy and diddle with uh reid's company with gary demasi in the whole georgia area so think about this way these big giants with phenomenal credit goes in and buy stack load of renewable and they welcome the community or small company if nothing else equitable company if nothing else the equitable climate action plan including small companies who on their own may not be able to buy the longer term power purchase agreement or enough capacity but they can also contribute it and gain at and pay the same rate that microsoft and google has already negotiated so it's a phenomenal attractiveness in terms of what these cfo has already done the scrutiny on and you are more than welcome to participate in that regard so that's basically what equitable climate action plan means and it it is available and then see i'm glad to make the link available to you for any of one like to take more resources so it's a good time to think pioneers such as reid's company and christian's company and others their ambition really lead and they think beyond themselves when they actually achieve their sustainability goal for their own data center so thank you for what you do for the data center industry to benefit rfs yeah okay and and i just want to you know reiterate that you know uh as a data center i think you know christian you know gary brian have done a lot the fact that southern company was just held up as you know progressive and innovative you know it's larger yeah i think data centers can take a lot of responsibility for that so it's been a sea change in the past 10 years awesome okay um i want to thank uh the all the panelists for your awesome insightful and timely answers today we only went like two minutes over which um is astounding because because you have such depth of knowledge and we hit a lot of different topics um so i'm guess mark's here so i'm going to close and and pass it over to him but thank you so much to all of you for taking the time and it was really great to see you all um you know sort of collaborating on this it's been really fun to just to watch um and to participate in so thank you very much and thank you to the audience um and with that i passed it back over to mark thanks lindsey i want to say thank you to you for your moderation and uh um uh to all of our panelists today that was a fantastic discussion really interesting thought provoking uh so thank you for taking the time to join us uh i hope we can continue this conversation going forward i also want to give a thank you again to uh pierre henry uh dehain i i miss stated his last name my apologies i'm sure the students will never leave me alone for that that is my cross to bear going forward uh i also wanted to say um uh thank you again to our sponsor chevron cod edison uh distributed sun and edf renewables as well as e cornell for doing the behind the scenes production and powering this cornell energy connection i want to thank everybody who attended this session and joined us today i hope you found the discussion uh thought-provoking and engaging and a reminder that next week we have our last session and you can register the same place you have for this session uh at cec2020.splashthat.com and we will see you on the 18th thank you you
