 Hi I'm Kevin, I'm the project manager. Hi I'm Peng Qi, I'm the background researcher. Hi,my name is Zhiwei Zhao, I'm doing data analysis in this project. Adaptive façade is an emerging trend of architectural design. It can improve the building’s energy efficiency, by changing its behaviour in real time according to indoor and outdoor parameters. Then, the energy consumption in the building like lighting, heating, and cooling, can be reduced. For our project, we introduced a powerful tool, known as machine learning, to simulate the building energy consumption model. The software we are using includes Matlab and Energyplus. In our project, EnergyPlus is used to evaluate the energy consumption of buildings while Matlab uses these outputs to compute a more efficient model. Adaptive facade has recently gained more attention in the building industry as the requirement for building energy efficiency is getting higher. By changing the properties of the facade, in our case using the electromatic windows. We’ve found that the Solar height gain coefficient (SHGC), U-value and Visible transmittance (Tvis) are the most relevant. These variables will be used as inputs to calculate the cooling, heating and lighting energy required from a building. Artificial Neural Network or ANN is a system that uses example input outputs to generate a model that makes forecasts. In short, ANN assigns a weight and bias to each input variable randomly. Energyplus is used to generate heating, cooling and lighting energy usage in the building. We used local weather data and Electrochromic glass properties found in industries to compute the outputs. We managed to use the given templates to train the network as well as computing output forecasts. R-value and MAPE are the 2 key indications to how well the network forecasts are. It is a difficult time for all of us but we will overcome the obstacles. Looking forward to see all of you!
