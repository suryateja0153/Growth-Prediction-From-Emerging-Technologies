 Okay everyone so in this video series we will  be working on vital signs the different types   of specimens that you possibly will have to  collect if you're working with a client at   home talking about fluid balance both intake  and output talking about catheter care we're   going to talk about a little bit about warm and  cold applications possible dressing changing   and as well as ostomy care so first things first  let's talk about vital signs vital signs are the   measurements the temperature - pulse respiration  blood pressure and nowadays we also include pain   level that monitors the functioning of the vital  organs of the body circadian rhythm on the other   hand is that 24-hour day/night cycle okay that  24-hour day a full day pretty much okay so this   is the ranges for vital signs that we need to  be able to be understanding just looking at   the oral temperature rectal and axillary knowing  that rectal temperatures will always be about a   degree higher and average and oral and then  the axillary which is underarm temperature   taking which is going to be about one degree  lower from the oral you know looking at blood   pressure systolic and diastolic those are the two  different numbers systolic is the number the top   diastolic is a number in the bottom okay so we  need to look at the different levels of what our   pre-hypertensive - what is considered hypertensive  okay so let's look at temperature there are four   sites where we can take them we always understand  that we want to stop using mercury thermometers so   we're using mercury free thermometers nowadays we  also have a lot of digital thermometers out there   it's starting to be used from oral rectal and XL  air temperatures we're trying to make sure also   to let you know that you can never use an oral  thermometer as a rectal rectal thermometer or   vice versa even if you're using sleeves on these  thermometers okay so making sure that we need to   learn that now for a lot of the thermometers  you don't need to shake them no more like we   use - back in the days if you've seen videos or  if you see movies where after to take somebody's   temperature they shake it those were typically  for mercury thermometers but since we're not   using those no more you don't have to do the  shaking no more so continue into thermometers   we also use tympanic thermometers which are fast  and accurate okay now rectal temperature to be   able to take your temperature rectally is pretty  much the most accurate level of being able to find   out your level of your Torah pretty much your  temperature all the thermometers must always be   clean after use even when you're using protective  covers okay and in addition to cleaning them you   must use protective covers as well moving on  to pulse pulses the number of heartbeats per   minutes your radial pulse is inside of the wrist  and the most common site for measuring your pulse   the brachial pulse is right inside your elbow  about one to one-and-a-half inches above your   elbow the apical pulse is on the left side of the  chest just below the nipple now when we're talking   about pulse the normal rate is between 60 to 100  beats per minute for adults okay slow weak pulse   may indicate dehydration a possible infection  or even shock now when we talk about a status   COPE other than using it to listen to your lung  sounds it's also instrument to be able to listen   about listen how your pulse is going you know  the rhythm is there any abnormal rhythms that   are happening okay so you want to be able to  make sure that you know the common pulse sites   you have your break peel you have your radio you  have your character pulse which is right on your   neck and I know you also have your Pinot pulse  as well which is right on your foot moving on   let's also talk about respiration pretty much the  breathing aspect of things you have respiration   inspiration expiration and apnea so respiration  is the process of breathing air into the lungs   and exhaling air out of the lungs inspiration  is the process of breathing air into the lungs   and expiration is the process of ex hailing air  out of the lungs so inspiration expiration hi so   pretty much you can try it if you want to the next  term apnea what is that Mia do you know somebody   that has apnea well apnea is the absence of  breathing okay so the absence of breathing   that's what apnea means this knee on the other  hands that means a difficulty breathing okay P   and EA means breathing dis is difficulty so when  we talked about the previous term the apnea a is   without P Nia breathing so without breathing  or no breathing you Kia EU that means normal   respirations orthopnea is shortness of breath when  lying down and the only way you can relieve it is   if you're sitting up okay so the next term is  tachypnea so P MEA means breathing tachy means   rapid okay so tachypnea is rapid respirations now  when we talk about cheyne-stokes respiration Zoar   also known as just cheyne-stokes it's altering  periods of slow irregular respirations and rapid   shallow respirations so talking about respirations  it consists of an inspiration and an exploration   your normal rate is around 12 to 20 breaths per  minute you want to be able to do two counting   while you're counting the poles as well do not  let the client know you are counting the breaths   as that person may start controlling it what  you can also do is you can put your right or   your left hand on their shoulder not pushing down  but just have it there just for that touch and to   be able to feel whenever there's the rise of the  shoulder that's a good way to be able to really   see and count the respiration you want to be  able to report any unusual sounds or difficulties   the client that hasn't breathing okay so we're  moving on to blood pressure right now systolic   is the measurement of blood pressure it's the  phase when the heart at work when the heart   is contracting and pushing the blood from the  left ventricle of the heart okay diastolic is   at the second measurement of the blood pressure  it's the face when the heart relaxes or rests or   pretty much the heart fills up again hypertension  hyper means excess okay tension is the pressure   okay so high blood pressure hypertensive  patients or clients are people that measures   on their blood pressure having a systolic of  140 or higher or a diastolic of 90 and haider we talk about pre hypertension this is a condition  which a person has a systolic measurement around   120 to 139 and a diastolic of around 80 to  89 these are pre indicators that the person   does not have high blood pressure now but there  could be a possibility that they'll have that   in the future so if hypertension is high blood  pressure hypotension is low blood pressure and   that is if there's a measurement between 100 to  60 or even lower now the next word is though is   a mouthful it's called a sphygmomanometer pretty  much it's a blood pressure cuff or a kit okay so   this is what we use to be able to collect and to  be able to measure once blood pressure moving on   to blood pressure the two parts of it are the bps  a systolic that's the top number diastolic is the   bottom number so we talked to butteri the normal  ranges and what's considered pre-hypertensive okay   when you place the blood pressure cuff you're  gonna place that in your brachial artery at the   elbow that's when you actually use that there are  a lot of blood pressure cuffs and automatic cuffs   out there nowadays that is for the wrists when  you are using the blood pressure the automatic   one that attaches to the wrist you want to make  sure that it's placed correctly follow the diagram   or the instructions written with it and you always  want to make sure that if the kit itself is right   above your heart okay so let's say for example  you're sitting down and you put on the client you   want to make sure you raise their hands up where  it's always going to be within level to the heart   so the fifth vital sign nowadays is we're talking  about paying now we want to be able to measure the   pain you know it's very important to monitor  as vital signs and the reason why is we want   to be able to know if the pain is affecting the  client so if pain has a high pain rate then that   could cause problems for the client to be able  to function on their daily living so the pain   is an individual experience everyone has their  own measurements of pain but we not we want to   be able to accurately question and get the right  information to be able to put in the clients chart   okay every time somebody says that they're in pain  you want to take that seriously okay so let's go   ahead and talk about several ways to be able to  reduce the pain you know if somebody is in pain   we want to be able to make sure we reported  right away we want to make sure we give them   the medication if they have something for it all  right some part of also for pain chore alleviated   is you know good body positioning sometimes if  a client has been laying down in bed for a long   period of time maybe we need to make sure we  have readjust them and this is where we talk   about repositioning every two hours if they cannot  position themselves you know if need be do we need   to give back rubs okay we need to be able to ask  and offer the client a warm bath or shower okay we   want to be able to maybe encourage your client to  be able to do some breathing concentrations allow   the client to be able to have a secluded quiet  environment and remember once again medication   is important if they have orders for medications  that they actually take it we of course don't   want our clients taking medications that they  don't have orders for because that can cause   problems later on we want to be patient we want  to be gentle we want to be empathetic what we're   caring for our clients as well now for height  and weight you know typically depends on your   agency Oh same thing with your vital signs not  all non-medical private duty companies expects   you to take their vital signs their clients vital  signs it all depends on the but he you work for   and what is expected over you now we're talking  about height and weight you want to be able to   report any weight loss no matter how small we  want to be able to see is there a significant   drop in weights greater than five pounds or  greater than five percent what is going on   with that client because if they're losing weight  in a in a mass scale we want to be able to see   if do we need to give them vitamins do we need  to give them supplements what do we need to do   for the client so when we're taking the height  and weight always make sure we provide privacy   just like any other procedures we do we want to be  able to provide privacy weighing part we want to   be able to also make sure we do at the same time  of day to be able to match up with the routine   you never know is the client eating a large dinner  at nighttime and that's why there's a weight gain   that happens every night when we're recording  the oral temperature I want you to keep in mind   remember we had to use a mercury free thermometer  okay this is the it's an oral thermometer always   make sure that you use the sleeves on them  as provided or as purchased okay make sure   that you wash your hands before and after it's  just very much important to do that now pretty   much on any procedure you want to wear gloves you  always want to wash your hands but now if we're   talking about rectal temperatures we want to make  sure that you really wear gloves okay you know   you have to understand that when you insert the  thermometer also make sure that it has a sleeve   and also that you actually keep it lubricated to  avoid any shearing or any scratches and then this   procedure especially we want to be able to watch  and offer the client privacy because we are doing   something that is evasive okay you want you want  to be able to make sure that when you place the   thermometer you don't let it go the whole time  that is actually within that person or within   your client and also just like any procedures  right after this make sure you wash your hands now when we start talking about tympanic  temperature thermometers okay these things   always comes with a lot of disposable sheets as  well pretty much the Chism panic temperature or   thermometer is taken through the ear you want to  be able to pull up the back of the peanut of the   ear that's the back of the ear to be able to pull  that up when you're taking your temperature okay   for children you want to pull your earlobe down  before you insert the tympanic thermometer when   you're measuring and axillary temperature right  under arm right on the on the armpits okay and   also understand that this is less reliable always  one degree lesser than the oral thermometers or   temperature being taken always make sure that the  site where you're about to place the thermometer   you want to be able to wipe it down people are  placing the thermometer if it's wet or whatever's   going on in there there are powder or anything  you want to make sure that any time that you   are about to do a procedure always always wash  your hands before and after moving on to apical   pulses so where is the apical pulse where do you  take your apical pulse before you we go ahead   and get started with that always understand  maining home health aids in home care AIDS   and home health or homemakers or caregivers they  purchase their own status copes so they can have   them available in the clients home at all times  now if it's a requirement that you guys do that   and you guys need to provide your own items then  you should have it with you if not make sure your   facility provides that for you as well you want  to be able to emphasize that the diaphragm and   the ear pieces okay the diaphragm is what touches  your skin or the clients skin and the ear pieces   are those two things that goes into your ears of  course it needs to be cleaned at all times and   always between the client care okay if there's any  regularities that your hearing or your ear pretty   much you know listening to make sure you report  that always make sure before you touch a client   if you wash your hands first it's a very much  important for that now moving on to respirations   and taking those always make sure that you have a  watch with you okay a watch that has that second   hand you know that's a mandatory thing when you're  caring for somebody you always must have watches   on you the ability to feel the pulse comes with  practice of course when you're taking the polls   and when you're recording your respiration it  takes time and you can practice on yourself   on a family member a loved one or whomever you  want to be able to emphasize that a pulse less   than 60 or more than a hundred has to be reported  to the supervisor as abnormal you always want to   observe and document any patterns and character  of the breaths and always always always remember   to wash your hands when you're measuring and  recording height of a client here's a couple   points put in mind the procedure will be different  for been bound and ambulatory clients and always   remember to wash your hands alright here's a  few more definitions and what we're going to   be talking about here is in regards to several  types of specimens that you as a care giver a   home maker or somebody that cares for clients at  their home has to collect okay so talking about   specimens specimens is that sample that is used  for analysis in order to try to make a diagnosis a   sputum is a thick mucus coughed up from the lungs  where a stool is the feces okay the poopoo hat in   healthcare is one of those collection containers  that is sometimes inserted in a toilet to collect   the measured urine or the stool so it doesn't  land in the water okay so let's talk about routine   urine specimen a routine urine specimen is a urine  specimen that is collected any type of person   voice they brought to urinate collect a clean  catch specially on their hand is a urine specimen   that does not include the first in the last urine  that is voided also called midstream 24-hour urine   specimen now that does is is a urine specimen  specimen consisting of all your invited in a   24-hour period so if a client needs to collect  a 24-hour urine specimen they're given a pretty   much almost a two liter bottle typically the color  is orange in it and of course has warning sign and   hazard signs on it now calculi are kidney stones  you know you may end up working with clients that   has kidney stones and these are very very tough to  pass and it's also very much painful for a lot of   clients so let's look at these points right here  to three types of specimens that you're gonna have   to possibly collect in the future our sputum stool  and urine specimens you as a home health aide as a   caregiver as a homemaker always must wear gloves  when you're doing these procedures because there   is always a possibility that you will be touching  bodily fluids and in in a couple chapters past ago   that we talked about the importance of being able  to not transfer any microorganisms especially when   we're dealing with blood and as well as other  bodily fluids always make sure that all the   specimens that we collect that we actually tagged  it correctly and store them correctly typically   you must place the client the clients full name  whatever their social security number is depending   on what's ordered for you sometimes it's just  a full Social Security or sometimes they just   tell you to put the last four digits they're also  gonna ask you put the birthdate also there if you   are obtaining this from a client in a facility you  might have to put their room number on it as well   now most typically agencies you know will have a  specimen containers ready for them so it's easy   for the client or the caregiver to obtain it okay  and if there's any questions you can always look   up all a lot of the different instructions on  how to use them correctly now here's additional   points you need to know when you're collecting  a sputum specimen understand the importance of   proper PPE protective equipment right so make sure  you wear your gloves make sure you're wearing your   masks make sure you're wearing a gown if need be  early in the morning is always the best time to   collect sputum because when somebody wakes up  I'm sure if at one time in your life you woke   up and you're a little groggy and you had a you  know a couple thick phlegm a little bit in your   in your throat and you would have to cop it out  well that's typically the best time to be able   to obtain a sputum specimen okay you want to  make sure you wipe off the excess peuta from   the container especially if it's in the outside  area and always don't forget to wash your hands   now when we're collecting stool specimens you  know you're in a toilet paper should not be   included in the sample okay we are containing the  stool specimen only so removing discard gloves   and wash hands before they know upon your return  put on clean gloves understand that the perineal   care must be necessary if there is any stool that  comes out you want to be able to make sure that   both you and the client must wash hands after the  collection remember in any of these procedures we   do we always want to be able to offer the client  to wash their hands also and also you want to be   able to be familiar with what specimen containers  that your agency's working and using so that when   you are faced of having to collect some specimens  you already know how to use it okay we're talking   about routine urine specimens now always ask the  client to put toilet paper in with specimen okay   you want to be able to make sure that there's no  toilet paper that's placed with this specimen you   just want the specimen alone you want to be able  to make sure that you're removing discard all the   gloves and wash hands before leaving the room as a  home health aide a homemaker caregiver you should   wipe off the outside of the container with paper  towel and label it correctly label it according   to what your standards are for your facility  you always want to be familiar with what kind   of collecting materials you're using with the  particular client so you don't mess things up   and always always always wash your hands and their  patients are in the clients hands now in what we   call a clean catch or a midstream catch we need to  understand that the lady of the female client or   the penis of the male client must be clean before  collecting the specimen the client must start to   urinate stop midstream and then start again so  the urine collected is not the first urine voided   at that time when the containers have fullness  specimen is completed and the lid is placed on it   okay you want to be able to wipe off the outside  of the container with a paper towel and label it   correctly and also remember to wash your hands and  to make sure the client washes his hands as well   a 24-hour urine specimen on the other hand is we  have to understand that we have to make sure that   whatever we're filling up is we actually label it  correctly okay we want to be able to include what   time we started collecting and what we stopped  collecting any the specimens should always be   kept cold at all times during a 24-hour of the  collection process pretty much your refrigerator   the urine from the first morning urination is  discarded the 24-hour begins after that voiding   and ends 24 hours later after the early morning  urination now there's gonna be times right where   the specimens are kept in a special refrigerator  other times okay the collection may be placed in   a large bucket of ice to keep it cold you always  have to be able to explain things carefully to   the client and the family you know that you should  not or day should not discard any urine during the   collection period or the entire 24-hour collection  will have to be started again and always wash your   hands before and after anything you do okay  let's talk about input/output eye nose as we   like to call them intake is the fluid a person  could assume in a daily basis and output is the   all the fluid that is eliminated from the body  which includes vomits feces urine perspiration   moisture the air that is even exhale as well as  fluid balance and emesis fluid balance is taking   in and eliminating equal amounts of fluids  whereas emesis is vomiting the echo vomiting   or addiction stomach contents through the mouth  or even the nose yuck to maintain how the body   must take in a certain amount of fluid each day  generally a healthy person needs to take in from   64 to 96 ounces of fluid each day that fluid a  person consumes is called an intake or an input   if a person's intake is not in a healthy range  he or she can become dehydrated like right now   for example I'm talking a lot so I am outputting  a lot of fluids because where every time you we   converse and I'm talking I'm actually exhaling and  fluid is coming out the we nailed see it but it's   coming out so of course if somebody's talking  for a longer period of time then of course is   gonna be the increased chance of me being more  dehydrated henceforth I'm drinking fluids while   I'm actually also doing this whole presentation  now always understand that all fluids taken in   each day cannot remain in the body it must be  eliminated as an output the output will always   include the faeces the urine okay and vomitus as  well as perspiration and moisture in the air that   of person exhales if a person intake ink see  exceeds his or her output fluid buildup in the   body tissues okay so if we cannot get rid the  same amount that we bring in then we're taking   in more fluids that fluid retention can cause  medical problems and discomfort that's what CHF   happens to be so we want you also to be familiar  with conversion tables and this is something that   you need to be familiar from from ounces to  milliliters and understand that milliliter is   also known as a cc okay similar stuff so one ounce  always equals 30 CC's six ounces always equals 180   okay so that's always a good thing to know now you  want to be able to remember these remember these   points when measuring and recording your intake  and out prefer client you need to understand   that measuring containers are necessary for this  procedure you need to know the different types of   measuring items including some that are marked  and ounces and milliliters measuring containers   should be placed on a flat surface and the years  should be measured at eye level never ever ever   splash urine when emptying your graduate also  remember and understand right and especially   when somebody is having or somebody is vomiting  we need to remember these things right here so   we need to understand comfort measures wearing  gloves removing soiled linens and offering a   drink or toothbrush afterwards we want to be able  to provide kritis e if possible clients may be   very sensitive about vomiting in front of others  now always cover the basin of emesis with a paper   towel as quickly as possible now moving on with  catheter care catheter is a thin tube inserted   to the body that is used to drain fluid or inject  the fluids a urine catheter is a catheter is used   to drain urine from the bladder and a straight  catheter is a catheter does not remain inside   the person it removes or it is removed immediately  after urine is drained or collected an indwelling   catheter that is a type of catheter remains inside  the bladder for a period of time urine drains into   a bag a condom catheter is a catheter has an  attachment at the end that fits into the penis   also called an external or a Texas catheter so  it pretty much looks like a condom and it just   has the same type of method of being able to  place into a person's genitals is to roll into   just like a condom but it has a hole on the on  the tip that attaches to a bag now when we're   talking about providing care for somebody that  has a catheter pay attention to these following   rules you want to keep the drench bag lower than  the clients hips or bladder to prevent gravity of   flow back right or back flow because if the bag  is above their bladder so what you're doing is   that you're trying to do something like an enema  and having the urine that's in the bag go back   into the person so you don't want that to happen  because that can cause infection and irritation   you of course also want to keep the drainage bags  off the floor okay you want to prevent any kinks   any twists and pressures on the tubing you always  want to make sure that you keep the genitals clear   and clean if there is any blood be urine or like  stoppage of urine or if the bag feels suddenly if   bag is out of place leaks clients discomfort and  orders make sure that those are being reported you   want to collect urine specimens directly from the  catheter not in the bag never ever click from the   bag because why the bag sometimes does not get  changed on a daily basis so at the same time as   you have a pool of bacteria probably pooling up in  there so you want to avoid that and that's why you   don't want to also have the bag above the person's  bladder because what happens is you're bringing it   back to your inside the person same thing at the  time Esther is build up there already and you may   actually have a false reading when you actually  collect those urines so you want to make sure   you're collecting that you're collecting specimens  coming directly from the Foley catheter so you   would have to clip onto the bag to keep it closed  detach it from the Foley catheter and collect   urine specimen from the catheter itself urine is  an inspection s'matter and must be handled with   gloves on and disinfected with solutions of bleach  and water so if you have any spillage you have to   make sure you clean it up correctly okay so why  it's important to offer fluids to clients who have   catheters in place well the most important thing  to understand is that we're actually draining   them with fluids were you know we're really  measuring things so we need to make sure that   we're replacing the person with fluids okay so we  need to make sure that it's done correctly also I   need to repeat this again and I will always repeat  this as wearing gloves and wash your hands when   providing any type of catheter care you want to  be able to make sure you're familiar with what an   actual catheter is what a tubing is and drainage  bag look like you want to make sure that you use   soap and water or antiseptic wipes when you're  actually wiping the catheters you want to be   able to make sure you wipe down the tubing's away  from the body never towards the body you want to   be able to wipe once and use a new wipe or clean  area of a washcloth each time you wouldn't want   to be able to remember you wear gloves and wash  your hands so now we're moving on to emptying a   catheter during each bag you know the bag that  clicks to urine the drainage system is a closed   system so that no infection can enter it must  remain a closed system even when being emptied   the drain spouts should be cleaned with alcohol  every time it is emptied and open so that the bag   remains lower than the clients hips you always  want to observe urine for color smell clarity   and amounts okay you want to be able to remember  to wear gloves and wash your hands as well now   when you're changing condom catheters you want to  be able to leave a space between the drainage tip   and the glans of the penis you want to be able  to make sure the condom is secure to the penis   with a special tape applied in a spiral manner  but also when you actually apply the tape that   you also make sure that you don't make it tight  too much that you actually cause restriction okay   or constriction remember to wear gloves and always  wash your hands that's very important okay moving   on to what we call warm and cold applications all  right so heat relieves pain it reduces swelling   it elevates the temperature in the tissue and it  also increases blood flow bringing more oxygen   and nutrients to tissues the cold stuff now they  stop the bleeding they prevent swelling also and   relieves the pain and brings down high fevers  so if you look at the cold and the heat the   heat reduces swelling cold prevents the swelling  okay and we want to be able to make sure that we   are using the right applications at the right time  anytime that you actually make something too cold   or too hot you want to be able to observe the area  okay are there any blisters coming up you know   that means possibly did you use something that's  really really hot you know is there a increased   pain in that site for that person we want to  be able to understand and we want to be able   to measure and we also want a document to what we  actually see and hear and we do okay so here is a   typical graph of what you need to know so you can  pause this video just to take a look at it further okay let's go ahead and move on let's go ahead  and talk about the benefits of warm and cold   applications so we want to be able to understand  in warm compresses we want to be familiar with any   commercial type of warm compresses whether it's  a plug-in compressed or if it's one of those warm   comforts that you have to kind of break a seal to  be able to mix two different chemicals to create   the heat you also want to be able to consider  using plastic wrap to keep the compresses warm and   wet longer and to prevent getting the better the  client's bedclothes wet when we're administering   warm soaks we have to understand the importance  of using the correct temperature you don't want   it to be higher than 105 degrees Fahrenheit and  you don't want it to be on the person or have the   person there for longer than 15 to 20 minutes now  the client may feel chilled so use a bath blanket   you also want to carefully add warm water to Basin  periodically to keep the water continuously warm   now let's talk about using a hot water bottle you  also want to make sure you want to pay attention   to the temperature when you're using a hot water  bottle it's a different temperature used for an   adult than for a child also same thing for about  the amount of time we need to make sure that we   read the rules and as well as what's covered in  regards to how long it should be on always want   to cover the water bottle and check the skin  every five minutes okay it alleviates that you   know a little bit pressure from the skin but  to be able to reassess things as well we want   to practice filling the bottle and pressing out  the excess air at all times another procedure we   should talk about our sitz baths it's a procedure  given you know is for the use of eight you know   since fat so when we're doing a sitz bath we  have to understand what this is gonna do it's   gonna help out with you know any swelling with any  joint pain and you know since baths are typically   ordered by a therapist or by the physician for  them when we're providing somebody a sitz bath   okay we want to make sure that you are always  wearing your gloves you washed your hands you   should always be familiar with of equipments  being used everything will vary at times because   there are different companies that will actually  provide the products for this so when we're using   ice packs now you want to be able to know that  the ice bag should only be filled 2/3 full and   never filled completely you want to be able to you  know remove the excess air in it and you also want   to make sure that whatever you're using has to be  always covered always make sure that when you put   the ice pack on an area of your skin that you  actually check it always for several you know   within like about 10 to 15 minutes every time you  have that on a person you want to pay attention   to the skin are there any blistering happening  are there any paleness are there any white or   gray skin or discoloration that's happening now  the climate may feel chilled or obviously they   should feel chilled that they have ice packs  on them so blanket is always suggested to be   able to be there and remember that it should not  be it should not stay longer than 20 minutes so   now we're talking about cold compresses so you  can add ice and then you can add water to it to   keep it cold but always remember that when  you're using cold compress always allow and   give the client a blanket now for cold compresses  because it's directly in the skin there's always   that risk or that greater risk for blisters  and paler and white skin so make sure for cold   compresses we're actually checking the client  every five minutes instead of every 10 minutes the next thing we're going to be discussing is  how to apply non sterile dressings so why do   we provide sterile dress non sterile dressings  why are we putting dressings on a site well the   reason why we're doing that is we now have an  open site and if you have one of those you can   increase the chance of getting an infection so by  having a site such as that we can actually and we   actually put a dressing on a wound we are actually  trying to prevent the access of a microorganism to   be able to enter that site and possibly cause an  infection so you always want to make sure that   you are actually changing your gloves every time  you're about to do something you always want to be   able to observe the dressing the wound for odor  the amount of color of drainage and any redness   or swelling that's surrounding the area you only  want to touch the outer edges of the dressing when   you're applying it and never in the center you  always want to make sure that when you're applying   dressing you always are washing your hands now  let's talk about 10 hoses I'm sure you've heard   this before or also known as an anti embolic  hose what this does it prevents any swelling   and blood clots and promote circulation in the  feet in the hands so typically when a client has   poor circulation and they start having an email  or swelling in the lower extremities they have   anti embolic hoses also known as Ted hoses that  we actually put onto the client when they're up   and they're out of bed but when they get back  in bed we typically remove that from the client   because you know they are laying flat so moving  on to ostomies so what is an ostomy an ostomy is   a surgically created opening from an area inside  of the body to the outside a stoma a other hand   is that artificial opening in the body okay a  colostomy that is a surgically created opening   through the abdomen into the large intestine that  allows feces to be expelled and an ileostomy is a   surgically created opening into the end of the  small intestines to allow feces to be expelled   so let's think about this question what are the  different body locations of the three types of   openings and why is care the skin and the stoma  so important well the most important reason why   the care for the storm is important is because  you know anything that comes from the inside of   our body whether it's your inner species has  a high acidic rate so if you know stools for   example or urine is touching that area that can  cause some irritation that we should always clean   that out so some of the careful guidelines when  we're caring for somebody with an ostomy is you   always want to observe for any changes in the  skin it's very important you want to be able to   empty it clean the ostomy bag whenever stool  is eliminated you always want to wear gloves   especially when you're dealing with body fluids  you know skin beers can be used depending on the   facility that provides it for you guys you know  food blockage can occur if large amounts of high   fiber food are ingested and if the food is not  shoot well so we want to make sure if somebody   is actually using a colostomy we want to make  sure that that person has adequate fluids and   at the same time we monitor that actually they're  not having any blockages so if charging fluids is   important to somebody with a colostomy or a knee  ostomies now there are gonna be a lot of clients   out there who are embarrassed about having an  ostomy because there is a differentiator about   you and another person so always always provide a  privacy for that particular client if there's any   odors that are coming from the client meaning  it's escaping the area we need to report those   to our caregivers we want to be able to report  any changes in color amount frequency or even   odor in the area as well as whatever's coming  out we need to be able to you know look into   things and make sure that everything is working  properly in a lot of cases the client is very   experienced using the ostomy equipment and will  even teach you about their products so you want   to be able to at least have a general look and  a general feel of what is actually being used   for that particular client so we just literally  covered a few information here I hope that we're   able to share that with you guys that be able  to give you guys some information you know we   we covered a lot of different topics here from  vital science and different types specimens that   we collect you know the in ticket output as well  as catheter care and then also talking about non   sterile dressings warm cold applications as  well as ostomy care now keep on watching our   videos there's gonna be an examination right  after this particular section if you have any   questions always you know shoot over an email  to us and we would love to be able to answer   that for you so keep on watching our videos and  thank you so much and you guys will be able to   be educated on how to be able to provide great  care for clients at the comfort of their home
