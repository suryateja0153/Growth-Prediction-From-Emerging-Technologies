 I think Google has been wonderfully good at executing on that co.design when we're at our best we put things together from multiple disparate parts of the stack to build systems that solve problems in ways that nobody else necessarily can see tensor processing units or TP use our domain specific piece of accelerator hardware that have changed the world that we live in literally TP use power so many of the apps that we use every day from maps to search to speech to translate and in this video we're gonna catch up with cliff young a researcher at Google brain on his journey and path towards becoming one of the designers responsible for the creation of TP use so how do you go about becoming one of the first people to join a Google team that's responsible for the creation and design of a revolutionary piece of deep learning hardware so my story into veins Pazuzu architecture actually starts before Google in 2003 there was another economic slowdown recession I get the dot-com bust and I was I was leaving Bell Labs and looking for the next route to do and kind of wondering whether they were still research labs to be found on the planet and I found one down the street in New York City working at a place called de sha research but David Shah the founder of it was a Columbia computer science professor who had always had a nutri in building special-purpose computers and thinking about what to do next with his life and what he really wanted to do was to cure cancer using structure based drug design methods on computers which he and his team had designed themselves ten years building two generations of anton molecular dynamics supercomputers the goal of the first five years was to build the first generation machine and our target was to speed up what a National Labs supercomputer could do by a factor of a thousand the trick that you know to beating a national lobster Peter was specialization in lab supercomputers don't just do molecular dynamics they do everything in the scientific computing universe they have to do adaptive mesh refinement calculations they do all sorts of other astronomical simulations they do plasma flow they they pretty much any large-scale computing task you can imagine they have to run and that generality means that they have to be all things to all comers whereas the molecular dynamics problem was a very narrow problem which allowed specialization sort of focusing down to one particular area and that focus allowed us to look for and find multiple different factors which multiplied together to deliver that factor of a thousand performance so that radical reengineering algorithmic hardware software Rhian visioning was something I learned in my time at Ishaan research I spent 10 years there building those special purpose machine and run around 2013 like it was starting to become time to think about the third generation machine have wonderful people doing this or is it time to look for something else to do and I hauled up a bunch of friends it turned out they're a bunch of super cool projects to work on and one of them Luiz Barroso helped to recruit me to Google and the time he he said something along the lines of now would be a really good time for you to come join Google and my reaction to that was come on Louise you say that all the candidates are trying to sell about Google but in fact I think he had in mind the construction of the first GPU because those discussions were happening between Louise and Jeff and various people in brain and platforms at the time I was interviewing and so Louise was saying how can I find people who could build special to those computers instead of he couldn't tell me hey cliff come into all the different central purpose computer but within two weeks of joining he introduced me to a team of people in Madison who were the hardware core that had had done preliminary work on the architecture I was the first california-based person in for software person on the team and I always said you know we high guys beat each other let's go figure this out and so that was this guy personally of the project I know for me personally it can sometimes be really hard to jump into a project without first taking all of the courses and listening to all the lectures and reading all the papers and really doing everything that I can to build up my domain expertise and so it was refreshing to hear Cliff's take on this because at the time that he joined the Google team there were no classes or papers or research on TP use because TP news hadn't been invented yet and I wasn't a an AI or neural network person at the point that I joined Google but I think a key positive or key thing that's enabled me is sort of curiosity about the neighboring field you have to be curious enough and and willing to be kind of off your balance to be a newbie news for me at least computer science is not an end in itself what what makes it what gives it life what makes my work really interesting is if I have a cool problem to which to to apply it and so if it's chemistry from ten years of my life and you know that works last seven years of my life there's been a hey there's this new area here about which I'm kind of a newbie or I'm not the domain expert I never will be the domain expert but if I spend enough time hanging out with main experts maybe I can get a little bit into their heads and ask them is this what's hard or is that what's hard when I asked cliff what the TPU team was like I was expecting to hear a lot of talk about engineers what I wasn't expecting was to hear about the deep level of multidisciplinary expertise that goes into building TP use going to the cross-domain thing I think the TPU team was also wonderful in the ways in which it knit itself together through a variety of disciplines to solve the problems as they relate to not just the application specific area that we're solving for but also deploying in Google Data Centers which are their own particular pieces of technology that have been managed in certain ways for again decades I talked about harbor software co.design I talked about algorithms and so those are maybe three aspects of a multidisciplinary aspect of the TPU team so there there are neural network researchers on the paper and yoora software people on paper and their hardware designers in the paper but then you could broaden that and sort of think about the different tasks that people performed that got the paper and there are application scientists or launching apps in Google there are the people who build the heatsinks and the printed circuit boards and the trays and they're the people who worry about deployment in google data centers like data centers are built with floors and racks on floors and you land racks at a time and so things like ratification and reliability and like how much power density is there and can be actually provision power to these devices all of those people are on the team and all of them had to collaborate across disciplines to make things work this was not the standard flow for anything like putting a new kind of machine into a Google Data Center broke a whole bunch of stuff and people had to be willing to change from their usual course of work and be open to new requirements and and and broaden what their systems did as part of landing these things well talking with cliff I was struck by just how curious and open he is to learning new things and taking big risks and that makes sense right because if you're building something new something cutting-edge something truly revolutionary well there isn't necessarily a playbook or set of instructions that you follow and what's more it takes a tremendous amount of collaboration across a multitude of fields I really hope you've enjoyed these talks with cliff as much as I have and if there's something else that you're interested in learning let me know in the comments below [Music]
