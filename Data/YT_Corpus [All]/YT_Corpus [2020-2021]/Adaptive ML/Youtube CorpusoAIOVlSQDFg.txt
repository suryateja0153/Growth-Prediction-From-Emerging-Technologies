 [Music] hello friends welcome back to meta lab health in today's video we are going to talk about how vitamin D is beneficial to human body vitamin D is sometimes called the sunshine vitamin because it's produced in your skin by the exposure to sunlight your body produces vitamin D naturally when it's directly exposed to sunlight you can also get it through certain foods and supplements to ensure adequate levels of the vitamin in your blood vitamin D has several important functions perhaps the most vital are regulating the absorption of calcium and phosphorus and facilitating normal immune system function getting a sufficient amount of vitamin D is important for normal growth and development of bones and teeth as well as improved resistance against certain diseases if your body doesn't get enough vitamin D you're at risk of developing wide range of diseases vitamin D plays a significant role in the regulation of calcium and maintenance of phosphorus levels in the blood these factors are vital for maintaining healthy bones people need vitamin D to allow the intestines to stimulate and absorb calcium and reclaim calcium that the kidneys would otherwise excrete vitamin D deficiency and children can cause rickets which leads to a severely bow-legged appearance due to the softening of the bones similarly in adults vitamin D deficiency manifests as osteomalacia or softening of the bones osteomalacia results in poor bone density and muscular weakness a vitamin D deficiency can also present as osteoporosis for which over 53 million people in the United States either seek treatment or face an increased risk the existing research suggested that vitamin D had a protective effect against the influenza virus the possible role of vitamin D in infections is implied from its impact on the innate and adaptive immune responses vitamin D supplementation helps to boost your immune system by stimulating naturally-occurring antimicrobial peptides which protect the body by destroying invading microbes these antimicrobial peptides live in immune cells throughout the body including cells lining the upper and lower respiratory tract there they are able to directly fight off viruses and bacteria that cause common immune and respiratory infections like colds and flu research has shown that vitamin D might play an important role in regulating mood and warding off depression according to w-h-o depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide affecting about 121 million people there has been research examining the relationship of vitamin D to seasonal affective disorder schizophrenia and depression the mechanism whereby vitamin D may be associated with mental disorders is not clearly understood it has been reported that there are vitamin D receptors in the hypothalamus which may be important in neuro endocrine functioning some investigators have reported that vitamin D is important for brain development those groups who are at risk for vitamin D deficiency include the elderly adolescents obese individuals and those with chronic illnesses like diabetes interestingly it is these same groups that have also been reported to be at risk for depression vitamin D deficiency may increase cardiovascular risk through altering the sympathy vagal balance and thus blood pressure blood pressure was found to be dependent on the vitamin D status vitamin D receptors have been found in all the major cardiovascular cell types including cardiomyocytes arterial wall cells and immune cells the experimental studies have established a role for vitamin D metabolites in pathways that are integral to cardiovascular function and disease including inflammation thrombosis and the renin-angiotensin system clinical studies have generally demonstrated an independent association between vitamin D deficiency and various manifestations of degenerative cardiovascular disease including vascular calcification however the role of vitamin D supplementation in the management of cardiovascular disease remains to be established vitamin D acts like a transcription factor that influences central mechanisms of Tamura genesis growth cell differentiation and apoptosis in addition to cellular and molecular studies if the d me illogical surveys have shown that sunlight exposure and consequent increased circulating levels of vitamin d are associated with reduced occurrence and a reduced mortality in different histological types of cancer people with levels below 24 nanogram per were nearly three times more likely to have stage three cancer than those with higher vitamin D levels the effexor sizing outdoors in the sunshine eating foods rich in vitamin D are taking dietary supplements to improve vitamin D deficiency could improve one's health status it would be a simple and cost effective solution for many who are at risk for above Disorders and possibly other kinds of disorders [Music] [Music]
