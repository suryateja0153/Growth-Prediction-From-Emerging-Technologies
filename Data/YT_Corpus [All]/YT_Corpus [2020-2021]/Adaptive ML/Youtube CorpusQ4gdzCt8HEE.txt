 in this video you will learn one simple trick that will help you to speed up your animation rendering more than 32 times using Intel AI denoiser and time warp effect in Adobe After Effects note that this method works well only in slow scenes with smooth camera movements it's very useful in dolly shots let's get started first off you need to enable Intel AI denoiser then set up the frame step in output properties tab in my case I set it at 4 frames and my frame rate is 24 frames per second that means that only each fourth frame will be rendered in the whole animation will took only 30 frames instead of 120 in this example so let's start render in this case I am using only GTX 970 for rendering but I suggest you to use both CPU and graphic card when rendering is finished let's check our animation since we rendered only each fourth frame of animation our footage looks choppy we can fix that using some magic it's time to start After Effects import your frames and don't forget to check force alphabetical order also you need to interpret your footage and setup correct framerate [Music] create new composition set your resolution frame rate in duration now drag and drop your footage into timeline enable time remapping and extend clip [Music] then add a time warp effect so this is the place where magic happens we rendered only 30 frames instead of 120 that means that we need to slow our footage by 4 times so set it up to 25% and now we have smooth animation playback if you need you can tweak some settings in this comparison you see how much faster this method us I hope you have learned something useful [Music] you [Music]
