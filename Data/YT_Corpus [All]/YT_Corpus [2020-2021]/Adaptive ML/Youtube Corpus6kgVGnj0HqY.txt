 Today's dynamic workforce is more dispersed and mobile than ever. The critical operations of an organization no longer just reside in the corporate network, but also in a diverse patchwork of cloud and SaaS services from Salesforce and Dropbox to Microsoft 365. This fractured arrangement renders the traditional paradigm of the network perimeter obsolete and also eludes the static and siloed nature of most security tools. Only 22% of organizations today feel they have an adequate visibility in the cloud. Security teams need intelligent defenses that are not only adaptive but also unified across their entire workforce. Powered by self learning AI, Darktrace's Enterprise Immune System is the only solution that understands the full scope of your dynamic employees, no matter where they work or the nature of their applications. By learning the normal pattern of life for every user across email, cloud, and the corporate network, the Enterprise Immune System detects subtle deviations indicative of compromised SaaS credentials or malicious insiders. These stealthy attacks are precisely the kinds of threats that evade static and siloed defenses, but with the power of self-learning AI, Darktrace protects our dynamic workforce and the full range of cyber threats in SaaS and beyond.
