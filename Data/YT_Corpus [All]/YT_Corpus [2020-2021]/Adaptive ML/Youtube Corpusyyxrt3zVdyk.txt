be presenting the latest advances in monitor iq 7.0 this is the latest release of our award-winning compliance monitoring and logging solution that will provide even greater ability to review broadcast content for compliance and quality but even more we'll demonstrate how we've coupled the power of ai with compliance monitoring to increase insights into your broadcast content as we progress through the webinar please post your questions so we can address them later digital nevada is known for driving innovation in two specific products and technologies over the past 10 years we've deployed monitor iq to over 800 channels worldwide used by marketing customers like discovery disney viacom and turner we've also deployed ai workflows to major networks utilizing speech to text and machine learning these workflows have primarily been used for generation transcripts captions and translations for both live and vod workflows today we will show you how we've coupled the best of class compliance logging with ai capabilities to provide fast access in many cases one-touch access to your broadcast content the ability to easily clip and share content to facilitate collaboration from engineering to the executive suite we have new functions to automatically generate reports and insights about your content and finally integration with ai services to empower new powerful applications that drive content compliance competitive insights and better content quality i'd like to now introduce you to keith derosiers keith is director of solution engineering with this nirvana previously keith held this position at volleycon where he's responsible for product definition and delivery to over 1200 customers worldwide keith take it away thanks russell and welcome everyone and thank you for joining our virtual tour of digital nirvana's mantra iq 7.0 i hope all of you and your family are safe and healthy martha iq is a feature-rich solution which provides core engineering teams with vital insights into their content but also provides essential features to many other departments within the media organization today i'm going to highlight some of those key features which russell mentioned that make monitor iq the best resource for locally or remotely viewing any aspect of your content and under the current global conditions being able to monitor your content remotely has now become a vital part of our everyday working lives i also want to introduce you to a few new features which help automate everyday compliance tasks and empower your sales team to generate more revenue with our integration into artificial intelligence for competitive advertiser recognition so let's dive in the monitor iq interface after logging in you will notice at the top of the page that monitor iq provides multiple pages or views to see and find content in any associated metadata the viewer page our initial landing page provides a single interface for all recorded video and audio channels where end users can view live or historical content the recordings page provides a listing of all recorded programs for all channels in chronological order the clips page stores all user and automated system generated content such as video bookmarks and clips the monitor page provides an overview of all channels being recorded and provides a single point of access to evaluate compare all metadata and the ability to quickly share repurpose and collaborate on content the reports page is designed to automate the everyday compliance and monitoring tasks let the system do the work reporting work for you and along with the automated task is the integration with digital nirvana's ai portal such as the ad report which provides a list of advertisements shown on channels which do not have as run integration such as advertisements shown on competitors channels but more on that in a few minutes let's first focus on the current page the viewer page here we can monitor one or multiple live video channels whether each channel is your own in-house channel or you're logging local or national competitors you can see that all in one intuitive interface simply check or uncheck the video to open one or multiple channels by clicking on the boxes just to the left of the names now i can easily control video while keeping all open video streams synced in time with the advanced player controls located at the bottom of the monitor iq ui or i can drag the seek bar left or right to move backward or forward in time i could also quickly navigate to any date and time using the calendar function simply click on the calendar function select the date and time you want to navigate to and all channels will quickly navigate to that time all while keeping videos synced in time now if an individual channel has multiple audio tracks i can switch between the auto tracks using the audio selection drop down menu i can overlay different types of metadata on any individual video i could also simultaneously create multiple video clips of all open video streams by clicking on the clip icon located at the lower right hand corner of the monitor iq interface and using the mark in and mark out tools define the start and end time of of my clip now everything i've shown you here are all standard features and more you expect from a compliance and monitoring solution but the true power of the monitor iq's viewer page is the ability to compare either the same channel recorded at different points in the video chain or compare your main channel to your competition you may be logging now a very common use case for monitoring the same channel at different points in the video delivery chain is for study message assurance now let's say you want to verify scatty messages are propagating correctly from your sdi feed to your post encoder ip feed our customers will record the same channel from each source and use the study graph to verify study messages translated correctly from 104 to 35 and the graph displays study messages received for each channel over a user defined period of time now the most common use case for comparing your main channel to your competition is to display a visual representation of audience measurement data in north america that could be meals and ratings in brazil ibope or in europe it could be kanta the ratings graph and display ratings data for each channel over a user defined period of time and correlate them back to video for any program at any time so the goal of the viewer page is to provide the user an intuitive interface with fast access to high-level content and associated metadata whenever it is live or historical but what if you need to dig deeper into any single channel or program with a couple of clicks you will have immediate access to any video anytime and all metadata associated with that channel or program at that time then we provide several methods to access all metadata you could click on the recordings tab at the top of the page to bring up a full list of all recorded channels sorted in chronological order and utilize the filter feature to narrow your search to a specific channel or program or you could use the global supersearch function at the top of the page to look up channels by program name or keyword or you could click the camera icon to quickly navigate to a specific channel at a specific time now i'm going to use the camera icon to navigate to abc at one o'clock on april 21st so let me quickly select the channel and open up the calendar function you see the program quickly loads and all metadata generated or captured about this channel and this program are one click away now unlike other monitoring systems i don't have to navigate to several different pages to hunt for specific metadata this was one of the big gripes of the vulcan observer users had to navigate to one page for study triggers another page for loudness measurements and they had another page to create clips and so on martha iq brings all metadata into one unified page users can see icons from all metadata is located at the top of the page in a simple single click away so if i want to see or compare all subtitle information such as closed caption 608 or 708 data teletext or dvd subtitles it is all located here on the captions page maybe an engineer wants to review bs 1770-4 ebu r128 loudness data a single click of the lavas tab provides all along this data related to this program well maybe someone wants to view scotty 104 35 or x31 or op47 triggers and see the actual messages in human readable form again all one quick click away on the q triggers tab there is also ac3 metadata as run traffic or scheduled data audio watermarks such as nielsen or kanthar imported audience measurement data such as nielsen or kanthar or ebope ratings data there is even a tab to annotate video which allows any user to create timestamp notes or tags or phrases to associate with any instance of video and all metadata in each tab whether it is extracted calculated or imported all hyperlinks back to a specific date and time in video which allows you to correlate metadata with full motion video now one of the most important features of any good logging and monitoring solution is the ability to quickly and easily create clips of content from live or historic video now every stakeholder within the media organization needs to review and clip content whether it is for legal purposes sales to prove a commercial ad review on-air talent or to repurpose content using the frame accurate storyboard empowers different departments to leverage monitor iq to collaborate and share content so from identification to clipping to publishing content monitor iq solution makes it simple for an experienced editor or a not so tech savvy sales person to easily create clips and requires less clicks than any other compliance and monitoring solution in the industry so let's say i am that not so tech savvy salesperson who needs to prove to a customer an advertisement ad well the storyboard displays a thumbnail video for every 10 seconds i'm going to quickly look through the content to visually find an ad right here looks like an ad for skye rizzy so what i'm going to try to do is find the beginning thumbnail so to do that i'm going to expand the storyboard thumbnails for every 10 seconds to every second now i immediately see a difference between these two thumbnails and i will expand the storyboard again to display thumbnails based on every frame of video to find the exact start of my clip now i'm going to navigate down and i can see directly that the transition from program to the add and the black frames in between now i'm going to quickly mark directly on the thumbnail mark in to mark the beginning of my clip now i'm going to repeat the process to find the end of the clip so i'm going to quickly navigate down i'm going to look these two look like the end again i'll expand it from 10 seconds down to one second and i can see the difference of these and then i'm going to quickly again expand it from down to every frame and look for that last frame and then again oh and there's the black frame between this add and the next ad i'm going to mark out directly on the frame now at this point i've defined the beginning and ending of my clip and if i want i can mark any frame as the reference thumbnail for the specific clip if i don't choose any thumbnail the first frame will be the default thumbnail since i don't want the black frame as my reference thumbnail let's choose one of these skyrizzy title frames as my reference thumbnail next i can choose what to do with this clip now i can preview the clip create a bookmark to collaborate with co-workers or export the clip now since the example is to prove an advertisement ran let's email the clip to a client i'm going to click on the export button and follow the tabs in a natural progression the first thing i do i have to give the clip a name now we automatically create the name based on the date and the time and you can choose any name that you want i'll click over it and let's call it uh skyrizzy for right now all right next do i need the transcode from the standard format to a different codec monitor iq can transcode on the flight to many different common formats but let's just keep it in the mpeg4 because that's playable really on almost any device next if there are multiple audio tracks associated with any channel i can choose which audio track i want to include with the clip the metadata tab allows me to include any tags or annotations that will be associated with this clip but also the ability to add a separate file to be included with this clip next the burn-in tab allows me to burn in any metadata such as date and time a logo free text right and then the next the sharing button allows me to the end user to upload the file to numerous destinations via ftp or to multiple shared network folders or i can send it directly via email as a link under attachment to any recipient well for this scenario the salesperson would email the client and i'll just fill up all the pertinent information and lastly click the export queue button that you see at the bottom and then the monitor iq solution takes over from here the clip will automatically be emailed to the recipient and i could keep the dialog box open to verify the progress of the clip or i could close the dialog box create more clips or navigate to another page in a monitor iq solution so with the frame accurate storyboard monitor iq makes clipping and sharing and collaborating on content visually quick and seamless for anyone in your organization now the last item i want to cover today is the reports page the reports page helps to automate everyday tasks or invokes digital nevada's media services ai portable to derive data from video and audio where no other metadata exists navigating to the page you can see five headings moving right to left the first item is the loudness report this is the first of three monitor iq automated tasks the loudness report automatically calculates loudness values based on every entry in the imported azron log no need for manually reviewing loudness values or combing through thousands of measurements the loudness report also automatically validates each average based on download and user defined upper and lower criteria for pass fail report columns can be quickly sorted by the column header so to quickly discover any violations and all results can be easily exported and archived the second automated report is the qre report which automatically calculates the uptime of video audio and metadata per channel per day this will give you a thorough overview of any events which occurred in the last 24 hours which impacted your customers quality of experience uptime is based in on video audio and metadata alerts configured by monitor iq by admins and triggered by issues detected by the solution video alerts such as black screen no video or static video audio alerts such as low or no audio and metadata such as missing closed captions all impact 100 uptime value of any given channel you can quickly see the alerts which impact uptime and click on any event to see a clip of the alert and its impact on qoe and similar to the loudness report the qra report is easily exported the study report provides a 24-hour report of all study triggers or other trigger messages received per channel per day an end user can quickly correlate receive messages between a channel recorded at different points in the video delivery chain or correlate data back to azure logs or scheduled data and yes like all the other reports this report is also exportable now let's get to an exciting new feature the add-in logo reports digital nirvana's monitor iq is now formally integrated with artificial intelligence and machine learning portal to extract metadata from video that has previously not been possible with any compliance system with the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning monitor iq can automatically upload or users can manually upload content to the artificial intelligence and machine learning portal the ai media portal can derive and associate metadata with any program or clip or video to generate metadata based on objects within any clip ai incorporates object identification such as facial recognition to identify contributor correspondent and reporter appearances from aired shows or identify faces and feeds and assets and assign values to that person object recognition to identify content that requires standards or clearance flagging optical character recognition to identify names dates and times topics titles and general metadata to match with internal data or local or advertisement recognition after processing the video the resulting metadata includes time codes for tagging enabling search and faster content retrieval there is also a speaker identification process which identifies which on-air talent is speaking to generate closed captions or transcriptions of programs which do not already include any subtitling or only has image-based dvd subtitles or to transcribe post-air daily schedule program identify keyword phrases generate a summary to describe the asset or translate english to multiple language and vice versa for limited content the speech-to-text engine supports up to 25 different language and will deliver a fully formatted document back to the customer which includes timestamps relative to video digital ivana's ai based automated classification engine auto classifies content for better value common use cases include classifying incoming advertisements prior to first airing using various labels to automatically identify and ingest ads such as classifying ads based on alcohol gambling political etc automatic classification of high points in feature length videos classification labels will easily integrate into existing workflows now the ad report feature incorporates the strengths of digital nirvana's artificial intelligence to automatically extract advertisements for one or multiple channels the resulting advertisement only clip is processed by object recognition in the speech-to-text services to discover what product each advertisement is about it will classify the advertisement as a coca-cola commercial a toyota commercial or jack daniels or kentucky fried chicken commercial and so on and all that metadata is collected along with the date and time and the frequency of each occurrence and of each ad and displayed here as a daily report per channel monitored the output of the ad report provides media sales teams with the opportunity to target or national advertisers or local advertisers that might be airing more advertisements on your competitors channels and generate more additional render ad revenue for your company now the local report is another integration with digital environments media services ai portal a couple of our customers want to leverage the a object recognition ai to produce a report of all advertisers logos seen during high value sporting events such as soccer matches or other sponsored events all metadata generated is timestamped and linked to corresponding video clips within the monitor iq this allowed our customers to provide proof via clips to their advertisers or potential advertisers regarding how many times an advertiser's logo is displayed during any event which again leads to additional ad revenue now i'm running short on time and i want to leave enough time for questions but as you can see the monitor iq is the right choice for your media organization now we will continue design monitor iq based on customer feedback which results in exemplary solution for all our customers an intuitive interface and faster access to content and metadata with the goal of being as few clicks as possible better tools to clip and share content faster and collaborate with others in the media organization or where anyone no matter what their level of technical knowledge can easily clip content and now with the integration of ai monitor iq is the new gold standard leading the way for compliance and monitoring loggers today and well into the future so let me turn it back over to russ for questions russ any questions out there sure mikey thanks for that uh first question how can i leverage cloud storage and computing for compliance applications uh great first question uh but they guess this is kind of more of a three-part question the storage computing and also um there's access to our cloud instance for microservices so let me first take the computing so the entire monitor iq solution can be 100 virtualized digital ivana was one of the first companies to virtualize their entire solution uh more than 10 years ago so whether you have a private or public or cloud option or maybe even your locally owned virtual hardware monitor iq solution can run in any cloud or virtual instance from a storage standpoint uh we have an archiving feature which would be optional and other systems come standard on ours uh the monitor iq uh this solution you know can use uh amazon's s3 some locally to a san or nas but be able to not only be able to archive that content out but also to bring it back in which is just another kind of feature for the monitor iq usually when you archive off it's kind of off of that session off of that kind of compliance system but we can bring it back in with all that metadata from an archiving spectrum and then the third real part is our integration with the digital's media services i uh iq which brings those micro services such as speed to text object recognition and other ai based services that help generate metadata for customers content so that integration with the ai and the cloud is kind of on just another computing metadata generation i hope that kind of answers that that question yeah very good here's another question what input sources do you support on the device no i don't know if there's a input source we don't really support at this point i'm really at you know we can capture content from anywhere in the delivery chain whether it's uh post-production such as an sdi feed or after encoder which could be ai i mean ip asi but it could be a dvbs from a satellite could be off air it could be post set-top box hdmi component but could also be from an ott standpoint it could be an hls feed but really anywhere from you know post-production to almost customer acquisition anywhere in that video delivery chain we can accept natively too okay good um can you give uh some information about the scalability of the system how many channels can you support and typically what is the the density how many channels per server is there a way you could uh describe that uh well let me take the first the channel one you know how many channels can we do it it's almost a limitless number of channels and user on the system the way we've designed and architecture the system it's really just scales up almost infinitely on uh because of the way the system's designed but from a channel density um on a per server it's really dependent on a then the storage how much storage that you want to put like i have customers that want to store content for seven years um so that kind of limits the number of channels or if a customer wants to do full resolution of storing content they want that output to be at 1080i or 720p at a higher bit rate that can also impact the channel density on a per server basis but again typical i see around anywhere from 12 to 20 hd channels per server anywhere and that and then sd and hls is exponentially higher okay okay this attendee says they have had a number of virus protection issues as it relates to windows um yeah yes the the painful window so that's kind of one of big differentiator for uh the digital nirvana montreal q system it's all based on linux so when you get those uh you know those windows updates that has to happen those critical noise updates that happen every tuesday it seems like uh you know there's always a report of windows having some sort of malware that kind of really doesn't exist in the linux world no no people are really building um out there hackers or building malware really targeted linux systems um so that's one critical right and updates for linux are kind of what we call plug and play architecture where windows you have to usually do a reboot and any reboot means you're not recording your content linux is kind of a live plug-and-play where you update that component and then you it just keeps working the system keeps working all the other devices and services keep running and lastly you know any virus protection that you want to put on a linux box is really targeted to windows type of malware coming into that box it's not someone else that's writing some for linux it's usually whenever i see i.t departments put on virus protection for a linux box it's usually to protect it from windows types of viruses or malware okay very good well i want to uh thank our audience for attending this morning keith thank you again for the presentation questions if you have further questions uh on the screen we have an email address that you can address those two uh there will also be a copy of the webinar that you can access but thank you again for attending our webinar
