 [Music] hey everyone today I'll be discussing about fascination examination and how to write a complete patent application in terms of you will see the pattern of questions of in paper to specially where about you need to write a complete specification for the innovation or technology in question or otherwise you will get a question on writing a provisional patent application so today this video will cater to the topic of patent claims because in complete specification which is part of the whole government of understanding IPR I will be discussing the patent claims so how you understand the content of what should go under the heading of claims is the question you need to answer once you are writing that people from the examination point of view you need to understand the the first claim is the independently and subsequent claims are the dependent claims so the dependent claims is going to depend on the independent claim in terms of to set the amber trial it's like a funnel like the broadest aspect is part of the independent claim and as you move down to the number 2 number 3 the claims depend on the defendant claim or it might depend on other aspects so how to understand and write the patent claims at the time of the examination because in the examination hall during the examination you need to follow the time rule because the rule of writing it in a fast speedy manner so claim from the most important most important section in terms of claims in Hindi is known as daba daba Kutty hey that your invention is talking about and your invention is illustrating the important embodiments embodiments means the way the invention can be implemented in one of more our ways so those are the aspects which has to be considered while you're writing Oh clean so when you talk about the claim set the first claim generally is known as the independent claim set or I would say the first claim which forms the ambit or the scope of the invention is independent claim and the subsequent claim which depend on the independent claim is known as dependent claim so the concept is independently dependent gained claim set is the set of claims which might have moved in one or more independent claims say for example it's a system so it might have a system claim an emetic a method claim is basically a process claim independent claim basically defines the invention or the innovation in the best possible manner now what does the best possible manner would be discussed in few of the examples and I would be happy to take any example which is given to us you can put your inquiries in the comment box below and we will try to solve it and share it with everyone so the independent claim is independent in structure that means it forms the ambit right so if an invention has more than one embodiment or say for example the element list or for an innovation might have seven to eight elements or components or modules and what is important is the invention can work with five important modules so the five important modules are going to form the part of independently and the rest three modules if you say there are eight modules the rest three modules are will form part of dependent claim a claim to claim three claim for and clean five channle in the examination process for the patent agent examination you just need to write for claims so I think the only thing you need to understand is how to bifurcate what is important and what forms the part of dependent claim now dependent claim or generally the claims will depend on the earlier claim or the presiding claim and the presiding claim may be an independent claim or a dependent King tipple dependent claims are generally not accepted by the Indian Patent Office so I am NOT getting into the thought process and I am NOT discussing that pointer right now always it creates a it doesn't set the ambit right so multiple dependent claims generally are not accepted by the Indian Patent Office how to understand a patent claim the first and very foremost body parts of the patent claims are the preamble to set the ambit right and just by reading the preamble anybody who is reading it for the very first time should be able to understand what the innovation or the invention is disclosing or whether this invention is of importance to that sector second most important part is the transitional words or the phrase which you use to write the back thinking and then the body of the claim which includes a lot of element list it can have components and modules coming to the point of preamble so preamble is basically a statement and it's a it's it's a way you write and stitch those words to understand the invention in the broadest possible manner say for example a ventilating machine this preamble itself suffice the purpose that the machine is a ventilating machine chick motto of the preamble is able to categorize the different domains of IPC's IPC basically is international patent classification and international patent classification is basically of demarcates different innovations in different categories and the tagging is done beautifully by WIPO generally are very good practice when you become a registered patent agent is to take the preamble from the IPC's so that the ambit is set right the invention or the innovation might relate to an article it might relate to a device it might relate to in apparatus composition formulation machine handheld device one thing which you can hold by hand so that so handheld device however something which you cannot hold by hand that is an apparatus or a machine so preamble in very simple words is simple definition of innovation without even studying about it in detail the protection basically starts off to the transitional phase so you need to understand once the transitional phase has been written then the body of the patent claim is drafted so the drafting of the body decides the faith or the ambit of the innovation in terms of if there is any third party infringement in your future so the first thing which is going to be seen is the party games so the battery limbs have to be read with a detailed description so the two most important sections of a patent application is your patent claims and their detailed description which in general words we call as DD so to explain the preamble of a patent claim we would be discussing one of the granted patent application from USPTO so the title of this patent application is is adaptive facial expression calibration coming to the independent claim this invention claims a facial expression calibration kind of innovation that's very very clear from the title now if we look at the patent claim and especially the first a patent claim this is an independent patent claim so in this independent patent claim a computing device for generating an avatar with a facial expression corresponding to a facial expression of the user the computing device so this is the preamble of this innovation and this comes before the transitional phase and in this case the transitional phase is the word comprising so before comprising it's a preamble and as the preamble suggests it's basically talks about the object of the invention or the main object of dimension that the claim is limited to a computing device it's a device for generating an avatar an avatar with the function of facial expression and the facial expression is the expression which is corresponding to the facial expression of the user the transitional phase here is comprising and after comprising whatever data matrix is written below that in claim one that is the body of the independent claim so let's just go through the main elements of the patent claim to get a better understanding of how to read a patent claim so the computing device here after the word comprising it includes a camera to capture or reference user image of a reference facial expression of the user the next important element list here is an expression generation module so this expression generation module is the hardware component and this Hardware component is performing certain functions now what is a function it is used to transform the reference user image from a first prospective to a second perspective where in the second perspective is the prospective of a corresponding reference expression of the avatar performing a number of steps the first step is transformed the reference image then generating reference facial measurement data perform feature extraction on an image determine distance between the identified facial features compare the reference facial measurement data generate real-time measurement data and apply the facial comparison data to the real-time facial measurement data to generate modified expression data an addendum ring module to generate the avatar having the facial expression corresponding to the current facial expression of the user as a function of the modified expression data so I understand in this pattern claim it's a complex pattern claim it's a complex language there are words which have been used around data however from the understanding point of view the basic understanding is the preamble is a computing device for generating an avatar with a facial expression corresponding to a facial expression of a user comprising is the transition word and then the camera is very important element of this then there is a expression generating module and the third module is a rendering module so these are the three main elements and the connectivity between the elements has been described in the independent patent claim if you have any questions related to how to facilitate your intellectual capacity put your questions in the comment box below and we will get back to you have a great deer head stay safe [Music] you [Music]
