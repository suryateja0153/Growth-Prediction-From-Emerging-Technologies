 next up we're talking about a renewable powered future with Azure IOT and Vattenfall to do that I'm joined by Connor Kelley and Mellie Marcus now when I first started my role as the green cloud advocacy leader at Microsoft I reached out to the world wide sustainability community and I asked who should I speak to in Azure engineering and they came back with one name which was Connor Kelly I when I got on the phone with Connor Kelly one minute in he's talking to me about electricity five minutes in he's talking to me about electricity 30 minutes in he's talking to me about electricity now six months later I just talked to everybody about electricity and now it's my chance to get you excited about electricity as well so please welcome Connor Kelly from Microsoft and Marcus melon from batten fall as they talk to us about how to get to a 100% renewable powered future so hi Connor Hanna could you give a quick introduction to yourself absolutely thanks a team my name is Connor Kelly and I work as a software engineer in Azure IOT and I focus on creating solutions around energy and sustainability helping to accelerate our partners in the energy industry to embrace decarbonized electricity system for the future awesome Thank You Colin and Marcus would you could you give a quick introduction to yourself also yeah Marcus Nolan I'm part of business sales Nordics I'm working with large and Nordic customers on issues related to energy some thank you so much so kind of let me start off with you what's actually stopping us from getting to a 100% powered by renewables future yeah absolutely and so renewables like wind and solar are intermittent by nature so when they generate they give us these great windows of really cheap and clean power but the Sun doesn't always shine of the wind doesn't always blow so and you know we make great progress in terms of integrating them into our grids but now as we get and to certain grids around the world that have you know a lot of renewables and to cover those times that those renewables are not generating we're gonna need to store some power or delay some consumption and to to meet those needs during the times that renewables are not generating and so that's the background this 24/7 hourly renewable solution and we see that as our path to get there and that's right that's because at least the way you told me actually was the way the grid works right now is it's it's all matching supply and demand there's not much in the way of storages just because the way the grid the way electricity has used to be created along the world around the world which is you burn some fossil fuels you create electricity if you need more you burn more if you need less you burn less but now we're in this wonderful world of renewables where you can't control how much you convert how much energy you get so we need solutions for that and that's what 24/7 matching is are sounds at us that what 24/7 matching is helping us get to so Marcus give us a bit of background to to vattenfall them and yourself as well yeah thank you well I'll give it a button policy European energy company and again I'm part of that as part of this organization and we we have an ambitious we're working towards an ambitious goal of providing enabling possibly living within one generation so no falsehoods essentially and we do that in a number of ways so we're working with the electrifying transportation we're working with electrifying industry and also renewables is obviously a large part of that as well and with renewables we're doing pretty much everything from building new capacity to providing it to customers and so we had seen this call it's a 24/7 issue and we also had an already a partnership with Microsoft so when they approached us with our D of the 24/7 matching and asked this was something we wanted to do together we were really excited and that's how we got started and I love I love that mission prevention at all we had to have a to aim for fossil-free living within one generation and all of that state must a beautiful mission to have so Connor what are the challenges and how is 24/7 hourly matching the solution the Microsoft and Vattenfall are working on together how is that going to help us get there solar and yes so as you say vattenfall had these incredible sustainability goals and so we wanted to do everything we could to accelerate them in achieving those and you know batten fall no energy no we know technology so that's what we brought and in agile IOT and so we'll step back to the bat and challenge as we've talked about so supply must meet and demand at all times so that implies having very a very detailed insight into exactly what's happening in real time and then having the ability to control that energy storage in real time so you can meet any shortfall in renewable energy and so that's what solution is about the technical solution it's an azure IOT based solution and it monitors that falls generation assets in real times their wind and solar farms and and it also then monitors consumption via smart meters in real time and having those and having those real-time insights allows the real-time control for the dispatch of energy storage and to continue supplying that store the noodle energy via azure IOT control and during those periods that renewable energy isn't generating and in that way we can get this really smooth real-time matching of renewable energy with the energy demand okay so that makes sense so what you're doing is you're matching your you're calculating the energy of the clean renewable energy that's been generated by wind farms and solar and other clean sources you know how much energy is needed to be consumed because you I owe Twp or you're measuring the consumption and then it's the case of making sure that whatever you consume is matched by some equivalent amount of renewable real renewable sources Marcus where do you get this clean renewable sources from and and how is it actually getting matched yeah so that's the other part of the solution so you need to be able to imagine those who need the renewable electricity so buttons are a different renewable sources and as a customer you can also connect your own to the matching solution but in we're looking now at Sweden and that's we have wind for example and we have hydro and of course wind is a little bit unpredictable you get what you get whereas hydro you can do more to control how much is produced when so Microsoft wanted a hundred percent renewable and preferably wind so that's what we also provide in this solution then so when there is enough wind they get wind and on the hours where there's not enough wind they get hydro instead and we check to see that there's enough of that so in this way Microsoft does get a hundred percent renewable and mostly wind and that's amazing so we're matching so essentially what's happening is that at the end of the day we're all connected to the grid and so at the end of day you're just getting whatever the energy mix is that you're getting so what we're doing here is we're making sure that we're getting the we are driving the creation of services the support renewable energy by making sure that whatever demand that we have is matched exactly at that moment so if we have a spike in demand somebody has to create that demand and then that's we're also driving a marketplace for this stuff as well so Connor where can we see this in practice and what are you excited about yeah so yeah this is where things get really exciting you know further rolling the site and so this is currently deployed in the real world on the Microsoft Sweden office campus and so that is that solution is monitoring those generation assets on the smart meters on that office building such that it's being supplied in real time with continuously variable energies and as Marcus pointed out there's a lot of hydro storage in Sweden so that makes storing energy quite moving and cheap most of other regions around the world are not blessed with the geography to allow easy hydro storage so this is where things get really interesting and we need to find other methods of energy storage but also flexibility and as we see more electric vehicles on the roads and more battery systems in people's houses as well as the technology you know the technology I mentioned agile IOT with the capability to monitor and control vast numbers of devices in real time with a high level of security that opens up all these really interesting scenarios when distributed storage and distributed flexibility where people can make some money perhaps by feeding power into the grid at times of high demand so we've all heard this in the past but now we're starting to see the technical solution to actually enable that to take place and so and you know we see this rolling nest in further regions globally using different types of energy storage and we think that the 24/7 solution would start to create the financial incentive to bring this energy storage online so both the bulk scale energy storage and but also distributed energy storage and flexibility and you know that would be generally the term of a democratization of energy where people can start to participate in these types of energy markets very seamlessly because of the advances and new types of technology such as Isis as your languages and the types of products that pratfall are trying to bring out so they are really really excited for the future of this and to see it low like globally that's amazing Connie you're giving me those goosebumps again when we when we told you ten I mean real energy Ned and I think just something interesting I remember I think it was two weeks ago in the UK or two Sundays ago in the UK there was so much wind and solar on that one day so for the between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. I think was two Sundays ago if you were with certain energy providers that would give you money back they were offering to pay you five cents per kilowatt hour to consume electricity between a certain hours because that's what we need to do there wasn't enough storage in the system and they need to create a financial incentive if I have like a I don't have electric car but if I hadn't electric car that's when I would have plugged my electric car in and I think the future you've just described is really interesting imagining a world where we all have electric cars we're plugging it in and we ourselves are helping to wheel the storage in the system we are this distributed storage in the grid system and we can take energy when it's available and then we can give it back when it's when it's needed and we can make money from that that's beautiful that's a beautiful future world that I'm imagining so Marcus what's next for that and fall for this 24/7 hourly matching and project yeah I'm also really excited to see this in other places in other places in Sweden where it's where you have to find additional solutions as well we do see a lot of potential with this solution for important companies that want to take a leading role so more generally we're really excited to just scale this up with more customers and we're hoping to do that going forwards that's amazing the more people who get to use this platform the more the more we can use renewables and that's really the challenge that we have right now the challenge isn't necessarily that we don't have the technology of renewables that it's not available the challenges grid grid challenges we've got the technology is cheap enough we just need to roll it out scale if you roll it out 200% we are going to be hit with these fluctuations and storage issues which is why the 24/7 hourly matching solution is going to help pave our way there and that's what's really exciting about the projects that you're doing so this is really incredible one of the things I talk about when I talk about Green is a being green is it is a question or a decision about the type of future that we want for ourselves a future that's worse than the present or future is much much better than one we have right now and I'm really happy the you Connor and Marcus are working to help us build a better future thank you I think now that I hope we I hope we've
