shares of conyers park if you don't know what SPACs are be sure to check out my other video what are SPACs after watching this video of course so what is advantage solutions since you're watching a financial youtube channel i'm going to assume you know what the fire movement is and one way to implement fire is through frugal living now how could a fire movement frugal living person save money on dinner i know let's go to costco eat all the food samples and bam just saved 20 to 30 dollars on dinner early retirement here we come i have to admit i've never done it but i've thought about it many times well the company that makes this possible is advantage solutions they are the exclusive provider of food sampling for places like costco walmart and kroger and today i'm going to talk about five reasons why i'm investing in advantage solutions via the spac conyers park ii acquisition corp so without further ado let's get right into it number one sales and marketing services leader advantage solutions is the leader in the sales and marketing services industry advantage solutions is a marketing and advertising powerhouse they are the exclusive provider of sampling services at retailers like costco walmart target kroger whole foods albertsons among others advantage was founded in 1987 by sonny king a 30-year veteran at vons with only two clients and a small amount of seed money from his retirement his vision was to build a nationwide retail sales organization as we can see from their website advantage solutions has a sales agency marketing agency technology agency retail agency international and business services when it comes to sales and marketing advantage solutions does it all advantage has over 3500 clients 58000 associates 400 data analytics professionals and 200,000 retail outlets some of their select brands i'm sure you've heard of them pepsico smuckers mars abbott att all these different brands across different industries and some of their select retailers like walmart amazon costco kroger the home depot all these other select retailers if a company has a product they want to sell at scale they're going to go to a company like advantage solutions and with their clients they establish long-term relationships take a look at some of the relationships here are over 25 years like with mars and costco and kroger walmart they have a client retention rate of 98 this client retention rate is better than a lot of software as a service companies SMASH THE LIKE BUTTON :-) so that shows how good advantage solutions is at what they do from this slide here you can see that their business is separated into two operating segments sales and marketing and in 2019 they had a total revenue of 3.8 billion dollars even though they are well known for their in-person sales and marketing prowess like their food sampling business they also have very strong e-commerce capabilities they are a leading partner at key e-commerce retailers including amazon and walmart this slide here just shows that they are a market leader they are two and a half times larger than their closest competitor and they just keep on taking away market share to use warren buffett's moat analogy advantage has a clear economic moat in this industry number two strong company leadership the next reason i like advantage solutions is for their leadership now advantage solutions and conyers park have a stacked leadership team but for this video i'm just going to focus in on two leaders first there's Tanya Domier the ceo of advantage solutions from their website advantage solutions ceo tanya domier joined advantage in 1990 quickly rising through the company's ranks holding a variety of executive level positions in sales marketing and operations she has served on the company's board of directors since 2006. so this is really cool because the ceo knows the ins and outs of the business down here it also states Domier is a member of the board of directors of nordstrom yum brands and enactus so she has vast amounts of leadership experience the other leader i wanted to focus on is James M. Kilts he's the chairman of conyers park acquisition and also the chairman of the board of the simply good foods company which was the acquisition target for his other SPAC conyers park acquisition number one from here you can see James M. Kilts is a renowned leader in the consumer industry with over 40 years of experience leading a range of companies and iconic brands previously Mr Kilts served as chairman of the board chief executive officer and president of gillette from 2001 until it merged with the proctor and gamble company in 2005. for those of you who are warren buffett followers warren buffett fans you should know about gillette because gillette was one of warren buffett's biggest investments in which he made billions of dollars on so it's always nice to know when my investments have some kind of ties back to warren buffett so you can read the rest of this here but james kilts is the who's who in leaders in the consumer packaged goods industry number three durable growth strategy the next reason i like advantage solutions is for their financials from 2007 to 2019 the revenue CAGR or compound annual growth rate was 12.6 percent organically it was only four percent but that's because their growth strategy is primarily from mergers and acquisitions they're growing their market share and their business by acquiring other companies they acquire roughly 10 companies per year their adjusted ebitda CAGR was 11percent and if you look here their adjusted ebitda margins have been steadily increasing the only time it really dropped was in 2018 but that was due to their acquisition of Daymon and what's really impressive is how they did during the great recession from 2008 to 2010. they had a revenue CAGR of nine point six percent adjusted ebitda of 11.8 percent and they held pretty high margins so of course with this economic situation that we're at in 2020 with social distancing it's gonna be rough for them but they already have a proven track record of making it through tough times so i have a lot of confidence that they're gonna get out of the current economic cycle a stronger player in the market number four using proceeds to reduce debt the next reason i like advantage is for how they're going to use their business combination proceeds basically the proceeds are going to be used to reduce leverage the resulting net debt is going to be 1.9 billion dollars or 3.7 times the last 12 months june adjusted ebitda and they expect to delever even more to 3.5 times at the end of 2021. if you compare this with one of their peers pepsico pepsico has a debt to ebitda ratio of 3.76 according to gurufocus so advantage solutions is very much in line with their peers number five successful track record the next reason i like advantage solutions is for how conyers park acquisition number one turned out that first SPAC made an acquisition of simply good foods company over here in 2017 so had i invested at that time for around ten dollars as you can see just three and a half years later that would be a two bagger already the current price at the time making this video is just around twenty two dollars per share and even at one point in time it was a three bagger it had gotten up to thirty dollars per share this is the same management team they're going to be the board of directors of advantage solutions now i know this is just one example but even in their past careers they have a proven track record of success so if this merger is as successful as their last merger this could be a potential two or three bagger in the next five years so to sum it up these are the five reasons why i'm investing in advantage solutions but tell me what you think drop me a line in the comments be sure to leave a like on this video before leaving thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time
