 my name's Neil and I'm a service pledge solution engineer here at Salesforce and I'm going to talk to you today about Service Cloud Voice and how we can integrate telephony into the world's number one service solution before I kick off it's very important to understand I'm going to be talking about a lot of exciting new features that are coming in the roadmap for Salesforce today so it's always important to remember to make all purchasing decisions based upon currently existing technology so why are we here today we all know this our customers are wanting to talk to us across a number of different channels an average of up to 10 different channels for every customer that they're engaging with us on but despite the proliferation of all of those other exciting digital channels 93% of customers are still reaching out to companies by telephone and 95 percent of our customers you are still talking to customers on the telephony on the telephony Channel what's important there is that actually we need to make sure that through the service experience we're delivering that consistent customer service experience that's been given on those other channels in the past onto that telephony experience for those customers and for your agents we feel at service cloud that it's time to do more with telephony so at least been left out of the AI revolution that happens on the service platform in the last few years the conversation between the customer and agent has become disconnected from all of the incredible power on the Salesforce platform and it's really challenging for contact centers to implement and integrate all of those channels into a single system that's something that we think we can make make a change to and it's why we're here talking to you today about service cloud voice and why is that important it's important because when we think about the things that matters to our customers to our agents and to you as a business 80% of all customers that are talking to companies are identifying the speed and convenience with which they are receiving service as being the most important thing in terms of defining their experience and customer satisfaction 56% of all agents are saying to us that they're having to toggle to too many Green's alt tabbing oats to a telephony system or to other channels of conversation why can't we make it a single plane of got a pane of glass for them and why does that matter to you as a contact center as an organization because that all drives cost just drive cost opportunity for any for efficiency as well as customers for customer experience and and greater a greater opportunity with customers going forwards that's why we're announcing Service Cloud voice intelligent telephony natively integrated inside of the Salesforce service co-consul service cloud voice is going to allow us to bring the power of Einstein to the phone call to the agent and to the customer we can integrate telephony and wrote all of our phone calls on a single platform no more having to jump between two separate phone omni-channel and all the different channels we can now go online and omni-channel and receive all of our conversations in one place it's going to boost our agent productivity by allowing us to use all of those powerful Service Cloud tools to reduce average handle time and improve the quality of our customer conversations it's going to allow us to leverage that voice transcription to actually surface AI powered agent recommendations how can we have Einstein listening to the conversation the customers having making recommendations of knowledge articles next best actions and other things that might help the agent to offer that great customer service and then finally it's going to offer visibility in one place across all channels to our supervisors allowing them to go into a single system and manage all of their team across all of their channels and assist in all of those conversations that are going on so how are we going to do that well that's why when we talk about service cloud voice we're releasing this as an add-on package to the service clouds that you are ad on today living alongside the great tools that you've got with digital engagement and ain't staying for service you'll be able to plug on Service Cloud Voice and start to experience all of these all of these great tools and capabilities for your agents and your customers and say the platform and the single plane of glass that you're working with with today excitedly Salesforce is going to be partnering with Amazon connect to be actually delivering a prepackaged version of this making it quick and simple for you to set up a reliable and scalable telephony solution but as well we know that many of our customers are working with a number of different execs on and exciting telephony vendors and so what's important as well to us is that all of these capabilities and packages will be deliverable as well through your own CGI partner should you be willing to to set it up allowing all of our customers the ability to say regardless of which telephony vendor on prepackaged if you want to so you can quickly set it up in say Salesforce get going with all of the great Service Cloud voice capabilities to deliver that efficiency to deliver those capabilities to the supervisor so I'm going to walk you through a quick demonstration today we're at an experience for a customer Robert Robert is an amateur astronomer who's recently purchased the telescope he's off camping and he wants to he wants to go and view the local meteor show that's about to be happening he bought that telescope on the Salesforce Commerce cloud experience the incredible experience that allows brands to actually deliver commerce through any channel that customers if customers want to but he's having a bit of trouble today focusing his telescope so he reaches out presses that channel menu and places a phone call to NTU connecting up through service cloud voice to Salesforce he talks to the IVR and tells it what it is that he's actually asking about where it can take that information to intelligently wrote the conversation to our agent nipper who's logged into our service cloud desktop now what do you see here you see here a single omni-channel experience where new pure is able to go online and receive conversations across every single channel whether it's chat email telephony or no voice and that phone call has been intelligently voted to napur where she can happily and excitedly accept the conversation and say to her console no more having to alter boats to external systems to handle it when that voice call pops up what's going on well firstly she's presented with a 360 degree view of Roberts Roberts customer experience we can see all of his purchase history on the online commerce experience including that telescope that was last bought as well as all of his loyalty information powered by mill soft and by the customer 360-degree platform and when we're ready to talk start that conversation we notice that Einstein is automatically transcribing the conversation and say the desktop experience for an occurred in the past the connection between telephony and the service was the agent they had to take notes and categorize everything that the customer was saying now as an agent we can focus on the conversation allowing Einstein to automatically record everything that's going on Robert mentions he's having some problems with focus and what happens Einstein realizes and recommends a knowledge article on the right-hand side here that's helping napur to know how to solve Robert's problem as quickly and efficiently as possible and the Kerr can share that article with him either sending a text or talking him through it fantastic but then as as Robert starts going on and talking we start to gain other insights and start picking up other things Robert actually notices and mentions well it's great that we fixed it but I wear eyeglasses and I'm having difficulty kind of understanding how to actually how to actually use it well in States picking up upon that again walking me through another knowledge article and recommending them and then finally doing it and actually recommending actions we can take as well there's an opportunity to to sell Robert an extra tripod here that might help with getting him that better experience so the pure could talk him through that experience Robert can say yes he really wants to and the per can send out a text message to Robert just to let him know so that he can go back onto that commerce experience and make the purchase what's great here as we think about all this that entire experience inside the desktop delivering recommendations can occur but then as she wraps up the call instant case wrap up is still at work automatically categorizing and filling out all the fields of it what was happening on the case no more again doesn't occur have to waste time documenting it she can have that automatically happening including the recording so that she can get on to the next phone call and help the next customer so let's pivot and think of it this from the perspective of Daniella Danielle is our supervisor and she wants to be able to manage all conversations and all of her team in one place so now she can see across all of those channels that we talked about chat email and no voice what all of her agents are doing and she can drill down in and monitor in the purest call not only in appearance code but actually multiple phone calls simultaneously because we're watching it as a transcription she can look at what's going on and offers some timely suggestions to try and help coach nikkor that's the ho best to provide service to the customer that she's working on getting all of that insight in one place really powerful for helping a manager to deliver the efficiency so to recap what we talked about we've talked about how we can be delivering telephony natively inside the Salesforce platform alongside all of those other channels and a single experience for the agents and for the customers and finally we've talked about how we can be delivering it from a management point of view again in a single experience and in a single system what's that going to do it's going to reduce the amount of systems that our agents are having to use it's going to allow our agents to spend more time focusing on excellent customer service experiences excellent customer service conversations and it's going to allow our call centers and our management team to focus on delivering excellent customer service across their entire team and across all channels so I'd like to thank you very much for your time today and invite you to come learn a little bit more about the exciting new release that's going on with Service Cloud voice by going to Salesforce comm forward slash
