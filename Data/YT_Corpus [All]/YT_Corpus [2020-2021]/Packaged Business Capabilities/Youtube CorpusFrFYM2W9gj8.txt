 hi everyone and thanks for joining us today today we're going to talk about running amthos from bad matter at the edge with major league baseball my name is omar abdirazic i'm a product manager at google cloud as part of the anthos theme and i'm here with my friend chris amy from major league baseball hi amir thanks for having me on today now i run the team at mlb that covers off all the infrastructure for our fan facing services which run on entos and a google cloud i look forward to showing you what we've got to offer awesome thank you chris so the first question is uh why the edge and why are we talking about the edge so customers are demanding a more connected experience and this is happening across different sectors whether it is three-tier connected factories healthcare and even gaming what this means is enterprises are need to deploy applications in many places whether from the left you're looking for something at the very far edge hundreds of thousands of sites very low latency very small footprint and some of the use cases of that is real-time control industrial security real time or you got something like the near edge where you have less sides probably less sensitively on the latency and you're looking at something like video and image analysis and processing or you go more to looking at traditional data center core or cloud and the challenge is how do you deploy across all of these and this is hard because as you're looking to deploy across all of these applications you're looking at migrating applications the developers are deploying applications differently every cloud or every site is different you need to deploy the application multiple times you can move everything to every location so it is just hard to uh trying to manage across all of these infrastructure and the good news is there is actually a perfect storm of opportunity about some of the technologies happening in the market that have been happening over the last couple of months so the first one of course is 5g uh there's a lot of connectivity options that are out there that is improving connectivity latency and bandwidth for those edge scenarios the second one is containers and you have a portable application form factor that allows you to deploy across different environments with ease and finally there is the open source the continuous innovation with novender lock-in led by kubernetes and many other technologies that are out there in the markets so this presents a great opportunity to use all of these new innovations and leverage your existing data and deliver your applications to what you want so we're going to have a little bit of how can emphasis help you with this problem so emphasis is our platform for application modernization it allows you to run on google cloud on-premise on other cloud providers or at the edge and the idea is anthos gives you manage operation the service management part and the marketplace and commerce so that you can even add more applications from third party providers and anthony's gives you multiple deployment options from cloud platform as we discussed vsphere aws you can even bring your own kubernetes or you can deploy it on bad metal edge scenarios and azure that is coming soon so across all of these options emphasis provide you the deployment flexibility to deploy application anywhere and have the consistency of your operational workflow and your developer workflow so we're going to talk a little about enthus on bare metal technical overview which is our newest offering that we announced recently so the idea for anthros on bad metal is you can run anthos on a customer provided operating system in this scenario you can install amthos where the customer deploys and manages the os lifecycle you have preflight checks to validate the minimum system requirements and then you have an idiom protein and declarative installer for all adverse components where you can run it from a compute capacity you can deploy this on a physical or a virtual infrastructure and we expect most of our customers to run this on physical server but running on your choice of visual infrastructure is also possible uh we intend to support rails and to us in ubuntu and from a networking standpoint l3 connectivity between the nodes is required and we need l2 between the low balancing nodes but google provides an overlay networking l4 and l7 load balancing from a storage uh you can integrate with your storage infrastructure using csi upgrade will be in place and from an observability standpoint of course we have out of the box stack driver or now cloud monitoring metrics and logs or you can integrate with the customer provided observable tool if you want we're also considering vm lifecycle options uh with technologies like cubevert and many others so this provides you a very flexible stack where you can employ a new existing infrastructure and easy run application using amphos so in terms of managing anthros at the edge some of the technologies that we are and the capabilities that we have makes it very easy to do so so we're going to cover some of those so the first one is the standardized architecture again you have the flexibility to deploy on vmware deploy on your favorite operating system so this gives you tremendous flexibility to deploy where you are and not have to retrofit your existing infrastructure in fact you can leverage your existing infrastructure to meet your current and needs and you can even modernize it in place without impacting the apps so that's the first uh piece of the uh application and more organization managing there the second is managing the entire fleet again one of the challenges that i've seen a lot of customers is they have thousands of stores thousands of locations so managing across all of these locations is very hard and having a cloud based monitoring solution and management solution helps you there so one of the technologies is the single pane of glass to have for your clusters and workloads you can manage the cluster from a single cloud-based work consoles you have visibility for your entire fleet no matter where they are and you can deploy workflows from a private registry or from a gcp marketplace all of this from a console or a centralized api through google cloud so this gives you a great flexibility and single point to manage and deploy all your cluster the second part of centralized login and monitoring as you look across all of these locations you need to understand what's up what's not you need to diagnose sending a technician can sometimes be a very costly and very time consuming and have an impact to the business if you have a store that is down centralized login and monitoring helps you with that by aligning all of the data and pushing it to stackdriver or now cloud monitoring and then you can see what's happening error rates performance you can even manage the life cycle of those locations and define slo and monitoring for your sre codes and signals so that's from from operations and then that gives you kind of the fleet wide policy management again to do this from a cube ctl you can also use get ops i so from a programmatic kind of sre kind of standpoint you can use devops technologies you can have your single team deploy for example as a canonical version of the app one place and it gets replicated across all of your stores in a matter of seconds so that also gives you a lot of flexibility of how to deploy apps across the fleet so we want to talk about edge deployment models here and one of the interesting innovations that we are introducing to the market as google is as a customer you don't have to manage or deploy all the apps it gives you different options to do so so the first part is worth mentioning is google's global network and this is something that is very unique to google not just by our data centers but our connectivity to region pops and networks that you've used over the years for search for youtube for stadium gaming so these are a combination of cdn edge point presence dedicated interconnect and even cloud regions that gives you a lot of flexibility in that so from that you have 24 regions we have 144 edge pops and thousands of edge nodes in telecom networks but that's the part that we are starting to have innovation for it as you integrate with existing telecom partners that gives you a lot of options to expand our network even further in this partnership and gives you even closer points of presence across the globe so this gives us a flexible operation model for the edge so we have three options that will make your life a lot easier as a customer to deploy the edge the first one is a google manage edge in this case you are using leveraging google's capability google's infrastructure for example like edge caching and service nodes and using edge point of presence on google cloud either coarsely regional zones or edge regions and loans so that's the first option the second option is telco edge leveraging our existing partnership with the telcos and using their small central office presence and large center office presence to deploy this for example so you don't even have to have it on the store you can have uh using a combination 5g and then have your equipment or actually the telcos equipment running your application this gives you the ability to deploy for example next to your store so you don't have to have the presence in the store itself but actually have something that is very close and very connected and finally of course the customer apps this classical customer edge scenario where you are deploying on your existing branch office or your existing kind of retail location and that gives you uh the traditional presence that you have but also gives you another option so between the three options that gives you a lot of flexibility on designing your own infrastructure to meet your needs and the appropriate operational model for your business for a sample edge architecture and how the edge is evolving this is for example a real-time inventory management and analytics architecture so if you build this architecture on just on a cloud-only kind of setup this is how it would look like when you have the point-of-sale inventory and rfid systems in the store but then you have a lot of capabilities in a cloud provider like google cloud platform using technologies like cloud pops up aggregation analytics and uh video apis but we also have in this what emcos gives you is a new architecture where you can move in some of those capabilities to in-store again to make it closer to where you are so that you can leverage your platform of your choice on the services that you need but still have the latency and the sensitivity so again flexibility in the architecture of how you build your applications gives you a lot of options on how you want to run your business so in terms of innovation our goal is to help you with our industry-specific solution from retail healthcare financial services media and telco manufacturing and public sectors across all of these there are many solutions that are built out there best practices and expertise within google cloud that we can leverage and help you to build your own indus specific solution so next i would like to introduce a use case of using anthony's at the edge with major league baseball thanks amir thanks for having me here so i thought what better way to start this whole section of the presentation off then let's go through what an actual end user experience is like so what we're seeing here is a product that we call game day you know you go to mlb.com you click on a game you can see a sort of virtual experience in a game here and what we're seeing is play-by-play data you're seeing pictures and how the pictures were thrown what the velocity was where they were in the strike zone then we get into like what actual plays happen you know did a did a run a steal was there a pick off attempt was there a home run hit and even that we you know we're loading videos of you know key parts of the game straight into the feed and so how does this all come together we start off with our new stack cast tracking system that we have for 2020. this is a completely new system that we've developed and deployed and uses machine vision with a whole stack of cameras that you know pick up velocity you know spin rate of the ball where players are what their poses are and you know what's happening in the game so what we're seeing here is a picture from the new york yankees this is a video that we took last year um of them actually throwing you can see how the ball you know we dig up the trajectory we can you know put it back in time to work out where it came from and where it's going to be going through so how does this all work well as you know in baseball it all starts with picture throw on a pitch so we kick it off we have an on-field play that happens you know there's someone in the stadium or a remote who clicks for the start of the play then they complete the play once it's finished um our tracking system is going to absorb all the data and all the events that are happening you know throughout that play we aggregate it and we process it in stadium on ethos so we collect all of that data we process it we set up a play and then we ship it up to google cloud or potentially in stadium if we have other subscribers that need that information you know for low latency reasons in stadium so what's where do we come from what do we do so you know in 2019 we had an aging hardware stack in stadium uh you know you can see that on the right that's what the end result looks like but we had this aging hardware we bring a new tracking uh solution coming in um and we needed a way to simplify modernize and bring consistency to our on-premise or in-stadium environment to know to what we run in the cloud and you know we had to have something that would run there be stable and enable the throughput and the latency requirements that we have in stadium so what does our environment look like no last year we basically had no one virtual machine for every application we ran in the stadium it had some local storage attached to it we packaged our apps you know with rpms you know we had no real automatic failover you know we had to run two copies of everything because if we lost one we had no way to like automatically stand it up and run it on a second location or anything else and you know if we had a burst in the stadium we had to process a whole lot of data you know potentially we were going to resend a whole lot of data from a game that happened in the past and we want to get it processed really quickly we had no way to flexibly scale up scale down as we need it so we come into 2020 what do we do uh we took anthos on-prem you know running on top of vmware uh we made the decision that we saw anthos as this you know standardization for containers for all of our applications regardless of where we ran them whether that's in google cloud whether it's on-prem or even in our stadiums we had this key requirement for automatic failover for our processing or worker nodes and we needed our applications to horizontally scale in the stadium just like they would scale you know if we're running on gk in the cloud so our architecture you know it's probably a little bit different from your standard entos on-prem architecture we have an admin workstation that runs inside gcp in the cloud and then for every ballpark of you know we've got two here displayed you know the rockies and the marlins no we don't have uh shared storage in the park we basically have two processing nodes uh that we run you know they run vmware uh and then on top of that they have you know local storage and we run the seesaw load balancer setup uh for each cluster so we have each node it's its own cluster it has their own admin cluster the control planes etc and then inside that actual you know physical hardware machine we have the various worker nodes we need in our case we run you know three different worker nodes so what's our end user interaction you know we do all this processing in stadium on anthos where does data go uh we'll ship it to in-standing experiences so that could be up on the scoreboard you'll see you know you see the the score change or you see a pitch speed or what type of pitch it was you know we offloaded to our broadcast partners like watching on tv and you know you see that the pitch trajectory or where the home run was here etc um we also then take that data and we ship it up to google cloud where you get experience from our digital properties and products that's what we started this whole session off with was game day which is one of those digital properties or products we also do advanced data analytics on all this and we do ai and ml to work out what's going to be the new metric that we're going to see come at a baseball in 2020 or 2021 so where do we go to from here um you know i covered off just before you know what we do right now on the web what we got loaded up here is you know a a rendering of an actual play that occurred you know virtually you know it's concepts around what could we do with this data um that we haven't ever thought of and this is where we see antholos as a key for our go forward with all of our data that we're shipping from the park so with that i'd like to throw back to amira uh really great to have to be here today and really excited to see what anthos can offer thank you very much chris that was a very cool use case and as you have seen it demonstrated the power of anthill's mlb team had a virtualized infrastructure at the edge they deploy it it's the same infrastructure that they deploy on the cloud and then the same infrastructure as they migrate to bare metal so our goal with anthos is to bring the same level of flexibility of and the power of google cloud to the edge with an open application platform flexible deployment option and a strong ecosystem so uh i encourage you all to try anthos on gcp you can see this link here the link has a lot of tutorials a lot to demonstrate and try a lot of the capabilities of anthos and um at the end i just want to thank you all for giving us the time today we know it's a crazy world out there so we really appreciate you taking the time to learn about our technologies and product and we look forward to partner and work with you thank you you
