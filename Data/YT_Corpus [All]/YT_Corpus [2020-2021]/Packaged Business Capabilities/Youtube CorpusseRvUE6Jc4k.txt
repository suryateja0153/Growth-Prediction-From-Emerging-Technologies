 from around the globe it's the queue with digital coverage of Dunkirk on live 2020 brought to you by docker and its ecosystem partners ok Jenny great to see you again James governor Palin the keynote there chat was phenomenal that was pre-recorded but James is also in the chat stream a lot of good conversations that hit home for me that keynote one because it memory lane was going down ride me the 80s when it was a revolution and we got him in the green room here James governor welcome James is here hi James there we go fresh jalapenos a revolution a revolution well in the 80s I just loved your talk a couple of key points I want to share and get your thoughts on was just to some highlights for the crowd is one you walk through some of the key inflection points that I think were instrumental to probably some other ones depending on your perspective of where you were in the industry at that time whether you're a systems program or a networking guy there was a proprietary world and it was it was a revolution back then and and UNIX was owned by AT&T if no one remembers you couldn't even use the word you had the trade market so you know we actually had to call it zina which is UNIX spelled backwards in all the text and whatnot and even open source software freeware was kind of illegal MIT did some work northeaster and berkeley and other schools it was radical back then so yeah we've come a long way for sure you know I think for me that was one of the things that I wanted to really point to in the keynote was that yes you know we have definitely come a long way and it's you know development culture is about open culture I think the thing that I like to point out especially hate to sound like I'm old but I am but I lived through that and the younger generation coming and have all these new tools and I got to say not that I walked through to school in the snow with no shoes on but it's a pretty cool developer environment now but remember things were proprietary back then if you start to see the tea leaves now I look at the world you see these silos you see silos that's kind of they're not nestle proprietary but they might necessarily be open so you kind of have a glimpse of open source and these projects and these companies whether tech companies it feels open but it might not be could be walled garden it could be data being hoarded so as data opens up this is interesting to me because I want to get your thoughts on this because in a way it feels proprietary but technically it's not proprietary you're at what's your thoughts on this because this is gonna be the next 20 years of evolution what's your thoughts I think the productivity wins who have the packages technology in a way that makes it most productive for people that's what wins and you know open source was productive it was very accessible it enabled new ways I mean you know didn't get install and you know you've got a package from you know you got access to just a world of open-source a world of software that was a big revolution and you know I guess the cloud sort of came next and I think that's been one of the big shifts you talk about proprietary what matters is how easy you make things people do their work and in that regard obviously Amazon is in fact a bigger distribution network makes technology super consumable by sending people so you know I think that we you know I guess I would say that open is good and important but it's not the only thing as you say data is a lock-in and it's right and people are choosing so this is that make them productive if we look at the you know nobody worries about whether Amazon lambda is is proprietary they just know that they can build companies or businesses or business processes on it you know it's interesting you know back in the day just to kind of segue the next topic we were fighting proprietary operating systems UNIX and others we're also fighting for private area network protocol stacks SNA was owned by IBM decnet was digital the number one network and then tcp/ip and open Sana's interconnect came out that's the OSI model for us old one that set the table that changed the face of everything really enabled a lot so when I see containers what docker did early on the pioneering phases of docker containers it unleashed a new reality of coolness and scale and capabilities and then in comes kubernetes and in comes micro services so this path is showing some real strength for new kinds of capabilities so how does a developer navigate Liz because data lock-in does it a data plane seems to be a control point what are we fighting now in your opinion shouldn't say we're fighting but what stuff what are we trying to avoid if operating systems was for closing opportunities and network protocol stacks before closing in the past what do you see as barriers that need to be broken down in the open source world around going down this great path of micro services decomposed applications highly cohesive architectures honestly this is enough work to be getting on with without like fighting I mean we're fighting against technical debt you know where we're fighting against I just I just don't think that people are serrated about fighting against proprietary anymore I think that's less than a concern open-source technology is great you know it's how most most work gets done in our industry today so you know you mentioned you know kubernetes and certainly docker though we did a phenomenal job of packaging up an experience that map to see ICD that map to the kind of workplace people like do phenomenal job and you know I think that that for me at least when I look at where we are as an industry it's all about productivity so you know there are there are plenty of interesting new platforms I think MIT no that's that's my question I'm less interested in in micro services that I am being distributed why I'm interested in one of the tools that are going to enable us to become more productive solve more problems build more applications and get better at building software so I think that's my sort of focus there will most be lock-in and I think we you know you will also have technologies mitigate against that I mean you know clear messages today from from docker about supporting multiple clouds you know for a while at least multi cloud seem like something only the kind waivers were interested in but you know increasingly we're seeing organizations where that is definitely part of how they're using the cloud and again I think very often it's it it's it's within specific areas and so you'll you know we see organizations that are using particular clouds for different things and we'll see more and the productivity thing I love the passion love that in the keynote that was loud and clear two key points I want to get your reaction on that you mentioned one was inclusion including more people not seeing news its kind of security and also virtual work environments virtual events you kind of made a highlight there so again people are distributed remote first it's not it's an opportunity to be productive can you share your thoughts on those two points one is as we're distributed that's gonna open the aperture of more engagement more people coming in so code of conduct not as they you know a file you must read or some rule culturally embracing a code of conduct and then also virtual events virtual groups convening like we're doing here yeah for me at least you know I wanted to Allison McMillan from github and and you know she she just gave such a great demo at the recent sunlight event where she finished that she was like this is you know it was all about I want to be able to put the kids to bed for a nap and then go code and I think you know that that's sort of thinking well you know people band around the phrase ruling this together but I mean certainly you know parenting is a team sport but I think it's interesting we're not welcome it was interesting that was looking at the chat go through I was being accused of being woke I was being accused of being a social justice warrior but look at the math you know the graph is pretty clear women are not welcomed in tech and that means we're wasting 50% of available resource to us and we're treating people like so you know I thought my underplayed that in the talk actually I sort of you know and I you know something like oh why is he complaining about Linus well the fact is is that Linus himself admit you know he needed to change his persona in order to just be more modern and welcoming in terms of building software and building communities so look I mean you know we've got people from around the world different cultural norms you know we can't all of the women I know who work in tech suffer so much from you know effectively daily harassment their bona fide EES are challenged these are things that we need to change because women are brilliant and it's it it that's all I'm not letting signaling you know the fact is is there that women are amazing at software and we do a terrible job of supporting them so women other nationalities we're not going to be traveling as much I think you can also grow no we can't keep flying around as much you know make an industry where were your parents single parents can can can participate more effectively where you know you know we could take advantage of that 200 million people in Nigeria you know this that hunger to to engage we won't even give them a visa and then we may not be you know treating them right I just think we need an industry reset I think from a we need to travel less we need to do better work and we need to be more welcoming in order that that could be the case yeah there's no doubt a reset is here and you look at the Kovach crisis is forcing that function there because one people are resetting and reinventing and trying to figure out a growth straight whether it's a business or teams and what's interesting is new roles and new responsibilities gonna emerge and I think you're right about the women in tech I completely agree and have evidence myself and report on it in ad nauseam but the thing is data Trump's opinion and the data is clear on this issue so anyone who will do social justice warrior you know I just say pounce and and tell them that you know go on their way and just look at the data and clear and also the field is getting wider when I was in computer science major back in the day it was male-dominated yes but it was very narrow wasn't as broad it is now you could you can do things so much more in fact you Kelsey Hightower's talk he talks about the to persona developers the ones that love to learn and ones that don't want to learn anything says one a code and do their thing and ones that care about just app development and ones that just want to get in and sling k-8 around like it's nobody's business or work with api's work with infrastructure some just want to write code so there's more and more surface area in computer science encoding or not even compute such as coding developing oh well I mean it's a bigger industry you know we we've got clearly all sorts of challenges that need to be solved and the services that we've got available are incredible I mean you know if you look at the work of companies like net the Phi in terms of developer experience you know you look at the the emergence of jam stack and the productivity that we're seeing there it's a really exciting time in the industry and as I say I mean it's an exciting time it's a scary time but I do I think that we're moving to a world of more distributed work and that's my point about open source and working on code bases from different places and what the cat cloud can enable you know we can work in in a different way and we don't all need to be in I love the vision there the passion I totally agree with it I think that's a whole nother distributed paradigm that's gonna move up the stack if you will and software I think it can be codified in cloud native and cloud scale creates new services I mean it's you know the virtual world you mentioned virtual events groups convening like the 67,000 people coming together virtually here at docker con large small one-on-ones group dynamics are a piece of it so share your thoughts on virtual events and certainly it's people are now just kicking the tires learning you do a zoom you do a livestream you do some chat it's going to evolve and I think it's gonna look more like a CI CD pipeline and anything else as you start to bring media together we've got 43 sessions here why not make it a hundred sessions so you know I think this is going to be one of those learning environments where it's not linear it's different what's your vision of illness if you had to give advice for the folks out there not event plans with people who want to gather groups and be productive what's what's your thinking on this well it sort of has to happen I mean there are a lot of people doing you know good work in this in this regard Patrick Dubois founder of DevOps days he's doing some brilliant work delineating just what are all the different platforms what does the streaming platform look like that you can use obviously you've got one here with a cube yeah I mean I think the numbers are pretty clear if event I mean Microsoft build had two hundred and forty five thousand registered attendees I think something that might have been deep beginning the patterns are slightly different you know it's not like they're gonna be there there the whole time but the opportunity to meet people where they are I think is is something that we shouldn't ignore I'm particularly in a world not everyone again has the privilege of being able to travel you know you're you're in you know a different country or as I say perhaps your life circumstances mean you can't travel from the accessibility perspective clearly virtual events offer an opportunity that we haven't fully nailed I think Microsoft performance in this regard has been super interesting they were already moving that way and you know Kobe just slammed it up to another level what they did would build recently was was actually I mean they're a media company right but but develop a focused media company so I think I'll be okay you're about the business of software John don't worry Microsoft ball no we're we're under the radar the cube 365 for the folks watching this is our site that we built with our software so you know we're open and docker was instrumental and I think the docker captains we're also very instrumental and trying to help us figure out the best way to preserve the content value I personally think we're in this early stage of you know content and community or clearly go hand in hand and I think as you look at the chat and some of the names that are on there some the comments really there's a new flywheel of production and this to me is the ultimate collaboration when you have these distinct groups coming together and I think it's going to just be a data dream where people aren't the product they're actually a contributor and I think this open source framework that you're talking about is going to be certainly just going to evolve rapidly I think it's just not even scratching this I just think this is gonna be pretty massive and services whatever you want to define that could be an API to anything it's gonna be essentially the scale point I mean why have a monolith piece of software running something you know this could something Microsoft teams will work well here zoom will work well there but ultimately what's in it for me the person this is the key question developers just want to develop you're going to hear that throughout the day Kelsey Hightower brings up some great points in his session and Amanda silver at Microsoft she had a quote on one of her videos she said app developers are the first responders in this crisis and that's the first time I've heard someone say that out loud and that hits home for me because it's true and right now app developers are one of the front lines they're providing the app support they're providing to the to the practitioners in the field this is something that's not really written about in the press what's your reaction to app developers are the first responders in this crisis well I mean first I think it's important to pay tribute to people that actually are first responders you know writing code can make us responsive but let's not forget you know there are people that are or lacking PPE and they are on frontline so not too precise a manner but I might frame it slightly differently but certainly what the current situation has shown us is you know productivity super important target has made huge investments in building on its own software development capability so they used to be like 70% external 30% internal and they turn that round to like 80% internal 20 external and they've been turning on a dime and and well there's so much going on at the moment I'm going to talk about target and remember what's happening in Minneapolis today but anyway we'll talk about that yeah organization's responding quickly look at that Shopify is having because all sorts of business is something like we need to be an online business what's the quickest way to do that and Shopify was able to package something up in a way that they could respond to challenges though [Music] challenges I'm a big believer I'm a big believer the future is unwritten at this point and I think there's a lot of problems out there you point out and the first responders are there I agree I'm just thinking that there's got to be a better path for all of us and this brings up the whole new roles and responsibilities around this new environment and I know you're doing a lot of research can you share some thoughts on what you're kind of working on now James that's important I'll see this what's trending here at docker con is compose the relationship with Microsoft you've got security Dockers now you know multi-cloud approach making it easier that's their bread and butter that's what they're known for they kind of going back to that roots of what why they pioneered in the first place so as that continues ease-of-use what's your focus area right now that you're researching that you could share with the audience me I've got probably three key areas one is what's called git ops so it's the notion that you using git as a system of record so that you know Barbizon off randomly making changes everything has a you know you have an audit trail you begin to have some sort of sense of compliance in software changes I think the idea of everything has to be by a sort of a pull request that automation model is super thing to me so I've been looking at that a lot of development teams using those approaches observability is a huge trend you know we're moving to the idea of you know testing in production the kind of stuff that's been evangelized so successfully by charity major so honeycomb is super exciting to me and it's true because in effect you're always you're always testing in production you know you're your dev environment I mean we used to have this idea that you'd have a dev and a dev stage you have a staging environment you know these different about the the only environment work that really matters is where the rubber meets the road and that is deployment so I think that having having better tools for that is one of your as I'm looking at so how it all is innovating in that area and it won't be the thing that is my own personal thing I've been talking about progressive delivery which is is is asking a question about reducing risk by by really understanding the blast radius of the service and be able to roll it out to cific use of populations first understanding who they are and and and and rolling it out so it's the idea that like maybe you roll something out to your employees first maybe you are in California and you roll something out in Tokyo knowing that not many people using that service it is a live environment but it's it's it's not you know people are not going to be adversely affected if it happens so Canaries Bluegreen deployments and also experimentation this sort of I'm one of the areas are being thrown all towards is is product management and how that's really converging with software development I mean like that that's one of the things I haven't fully you know I mean I think it's whether you have research focus but you have to respond to new information and you know they're spending a lot of time thinking about the world of those companies to be most respect in terms of companies that are crushing it in the digital economy they have such a strong product management focused everything is driven by product managers that understand technology and that's an exciting shift of one that I'm I'm paying you know you do some great work and I love the focus on productivity software development you know getting those app developers out there and it's interesting I just think that it's such an exciting time is almost intoxicating you know some people drinking on Twitter online and having beers cuz they're a different time zone but if you look at up and down the stack the action that's going on you got out the application developers side all the things you were mentioned in services but then you look at the cloud side you've got almost this operating system reset it's kind of it's a systems architecture so you have the whole thing that's up and down the middle of the stack to the bottom you have this operating systems thinking and evolution and then you got off the top the pure software developers and you know this is again to me the big aha moment for the industry is there's a true opportunity to scale that in unbelievable ways and you don't have to pick a side you can do a top of the stack bottom of stack so I think kubernetes and micro services really bring this whole enablement piece to the table and that fascinates me and I think that's going to change what the apps will look like it'll give more productivity and then making the internet programmable unit that's new systems so that seems to be the trend your system guy your gal or your developer how do you see that evolving do you get to that level I mean kubernetes is don't I mean it you know sort of developer experience is not necessarily the key value of kubernetes supremely flexible sort of system it does offer you that portability but I think what I'm seeing now is how people are taking kubernetes and kind of thinking so you've got you know VMware acquires hefty o brings people into the fold starting about what that platform looks like I think pivotal how foundry did a great job of thinking through operator experience operator experience is not the same as developer experience I think we're gonna see a bit more specialization of roles meanwhile at that point you've got the cloud players all doing you know pretty awesome job supporting kubernetes but it gives that that portability promise so I think for me one of the things is not expecting everyone to do everything it's like Kelsey said some people just want to come into work and do their job and then superwoman and so you know VMware I think all a history of you know certification of application environments so but so of them it's sort of quite an certification of humans it's quite natural that they would be somebody that would think about how do we make human entities more consumable and packaged in a way that more people take advantage of it you know there's a whole docker was such a phenomenon and and now seeing how that's sort of evolving into this you know that promise of portability is beginning beginning to be realized but I think the specialization the pendulum is going to swing back just a little bit I think it's just great time and congratulations on all the work and thanks for taking the time for participating in docker con with the keynote taking time out of your day and coming in and doing this live interview the chat looks good hit some great get some fans in there it's a great opportunity and I think as a pioneers pivoting in a new direction it's all about developer productivity and James you're been on it at Munk chips is his Twitter handle follow him hit him up John Ferrier here in the studio for docker con 2020 Ginebra CEO and you got Brett Fisher on the captain's channel if you go to the site you'll see the calendar jump into any session you want they'll be to be live on the time or on-demand instantly the cube track it's a series of enemies got Amazon we got Microsoft get some great guests great practitioners that are literally having an impact on society so thanks for watching change thanks for spending the time thank you for Mitchell okay change governor founder among chips great firm great person read monk is the red book bad red mug at monk chips is his Twitter handle at red mug is the firm thank you for the correction okay more coverage docker con after this short break stay with us next segment is coming up stay with us here at the cube docker con you [Music]
