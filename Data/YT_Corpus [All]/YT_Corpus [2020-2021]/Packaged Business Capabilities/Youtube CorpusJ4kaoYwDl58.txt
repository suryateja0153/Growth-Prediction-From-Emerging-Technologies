 [Music] [Music] good morning everyone and welcome to build 2020. we have some great content and announcements to share today and i'm going to be joined by some amazing speakers our mission at microsoft is to empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more and our goal is to empower developers with the platforms and tools that'll make you incredibly successful in this presentation we're going to walk through and demo our latest development tools and cloud platform innovations developers are the driver of innovation in the world we live in today and this is especially true now as the world has had to go even more online and as every organization is having to rethink and rework their business developers are more critical than ever before our goal at microsoft is to give you the tools that enable you to create more innovate more and solve more problems this isn't just about enabling you to move faster it's about enabling you to unleash your ingenuity your creativity and provide you the ability and agility to support the needs of your customers and your businesses and we're doing this in a way that allows you to also collaborate with other developers on your team no matter where you work or where you're located with azure we've built an end-to-end cloud that enables developers to focus on building apps and not have to worry about the underlying infrastructure the apps run on azure is open and it supports your favorite development language open source framework or tool azure also makes it easy for you to learn new skills and grow your career every developer is welcome with azure and over the last few years we've seen developers across the globe invent build and deploy some truly amazing solutions using azure over 95 percent of the world's largest companies are running their businesses using azure today and throughout the build event many of our customers will share their stories about how azure is helping them achieve business success and how we are partnering with them during these challenging times we've also been rapidly building out our azure regions we now have 61 azure data center regions around the world this allows you to run your apps close to your employees and customers wherever they are it also helps you meet local data residency requirements we recently added new regions in israel mexico spain italy poland and new zealand and we're building out all of this cloud infrastructure in a sustainable way in january of this year microsoft announced that all of our cloud operations including our microsoft cloud services will be carbon negative by 2030. we've committed that by 2050 we will remove all of our historical carbon emissions since microsoft's founding in 1975. we also announced a new one billion dollar climate innovation fund that invests in companies that are helping improve climate change when you build on the microsoft cloud you can know that you're helping improve the world's overall sustainability and also helping with climate change every organization is affected by covet 19. microsoft is working closely with thousands of organizations around the world to help them use the microsoft cloud to address today's challenges businesses and organizations of all sizes are adopting solutions to enable remote work while staying secure and creating brand new applications because of the pandemic let's talk about two examples swedish health services one of the largest non-profit health providers in washington state built an emergency response solution using azure power bi and powerapps it allows them to track and manage real-time insights of bed and staff capacity covered patient statistics discharge pipeline and even see supplies on hand like masks and gloves in the burn rate on critical supplies and the source code for this solution has been published as open source on github and has been adopted by healthcare providers around the world another great example is sheba medical center which is the largest hospital in israel sheba is using hololens and the microsoft cloud to train healthcare staff on using ventilators and ppe equipment from remote locations and they're now also partnered with other top hospitals who are using the solution including ones in montreal detroit philadelphia and minnesota we're also helping organizations around the world to enable their employees to work remotely in a secure way with microsoft 365 and azure microsoft 365 which runs on azure is playing a critical role in helping organizations stay connected through video meetings calls and chats and teams has experienced a significant spike in usage and now has over 75 million daily active users and over 4 billion meeting minutes per day it is a cloud native application built on azure and the fact that it was built on azure was critical enabling them to handle the sudden hockey stick of growth teams is built using a microservice based architecture that takes advantage of technologies like azure kubernetes service and azure service fabric and this enabled them to dramatically scale up to millions of compute cores as usage increased because of covid teams also uses platform services like azure cosmos db and azure media services and uses a fully automated devops approach using azure devops and what's great is that all of these services are broadly available for you to use as well using azure you can build cloud native solutions that can scale to literally any business need with azure you have access to an end-to-end cloud platform with over a hundred highly engineered platform services that provide you with building blocks and a secure foundation for all your applications and in the rest of this presentation we're going to go deeper on a number of these services and how you can use them to create great apps of their own i'll be joined by a few guest speakers who will cover developing for the cloud cloud native applications analytics and machine learning and to start i'd like to welcome amanda silver who'll be joining me today to talk about our latest innovation for developing for the cloud here's amanda thank you scott i'm amanda silver the cvp of product for the visual studio family and our developer experiences i'm delighted to be able to join you today from my home office i want to express gratitude to the developers that built the apps and infrastructure that connect us today all over the world now let's talk about developing for the cloud the developer experience for azure brings best in class tools sdks in every programming language and a platform to support continuous collaboration and delivery developers building modern apps all face common challenges every team needs to ship faster and iterate with confidence agility is top of mind we all focus on faster time to market and shorter lead times to bootstrap new projects with the more rapid cadence we still need to ship confidently and securely let's face it we work in one of the most dynamic industries we're learning all the time and that's why we love it we're constantly expected to master new technologies whether it's new languages new frameworks or new cloud services architectures we're dealing with a ton of complexity and novelty now more than ever we need to collaborate with colleagues down the hall down the road or on the other side of the planet azure has an end-to-end developer experience that helps you create reliable global and secure applications faster you can use your favorite languages open source frameworks and tools that make you feel at home azure provides services that enable developers to focus on building applications without having to worry about infrastructure you can build test and deploy from your code to the cloud with azure tools and github actions our tools have integrated collaboration to help you and your team master new skills together the app i'm about to show you is based on a common app architecture for modern cloud apps a static web app aka a spa backed by some serverless apis i used pre-built services in azure to complete authentication video transcription geospatial services and storage and plugged them into my app as azure functions the result is a geodistributed serverless web application i can quickly scaffold this azure static web app in the portal initialized from a git repo that then creates a series of github actions to set up continuous integration and continuous deployment for me if a new developer wants to contribute to the app with azure they can get a dev box set up in seconds and access it from any device let me show you how my team and i are collaborating remotely to build a cool new azure static web app let's start with donovan thanks amanda today i've been working on a spa a single page application that's html css and javascript that gets downloaded to the user's machine and runs in their browser that code calls our backend thanks to azure static web apps that's just javascript running inside of azure functions azure functions is our serverless offering that allows your code to scale up or scroll down on demand but don't worry you don't have to configure the functions we're going to use conventions instead just put your code in the api folder and static web apps will turn them into azure functions for you let me show you the app this is sunrise stand up it's the app that we use because our team is globally distributed and working remotely so that we can see what everyone's working on you can record a short video and tell everyone what you've been up to hey thomas here everything is going well in switzerland today i redeployed my azure lab environment tried out azure static web apps and created some awesome content for microsoft build all this code is sitting inside of a github repository and there's the api folder i was telling you about where you put in your code and we'll turn it into an azure function for you my goal get the code out of this repository and into an azure static web app to do that i'm going to visit the azure portal click on create resource and search for static web app now simply click on this tile click on create and then fill in the form i want to create a new resource group that i'm going to call sunrise i'm going to call the app sunrise as well i pick my region and then i sign in with my github signing in with github is going to give azure access to all my organizations allow me to select my repository and then from my repository select my branch now i can go ahead and click on create in the background azure and github are working together to make sure that i have a github actions pipeline github actions is a workflow automation engine that's built in to github that allows me to create ci cd pipelines ci or continuous integration is the practice upon which every commit to the repository the code is downloaded compiled tested and packaged for deployment continuous delivery or cd is the practice of taking that package and safely deploying it into the resources inside of azure if i go over here and click on the resources we can see that there's a url we can click and also the github actions have already been configured and are running in the background now what i'm going to do is simply click on this url and navigate to our application that is now running in the cloud the github actions have run and safely deployed our code into production one other thing i wanted to point out was we also have this map feature now it's not complete yet but what we're going to do is we're going to have amanda show you just how easy it is to add new functionality to this map by using azure static web apps so donovan just reminded me that i need to add pins to our azure maps so that we can visualize our global team now what that means is that i need to add another endpoint to this azure static web application now what you can see here is that i already have the azure static web app in my visual studio code instance and everything's defined by convention so i have all of the apis under this api folder get github avatar get sas token get videos and as you can see i'm already running everything locally on my machine so that i can iterate really quickly as a developer so we have get videos github get github avatar and get sas token and you can see that the azure functions application is up and running and i can actually run the sunrise stand-up app right here i can go ahead and play this greetings everyone brian benz here in las vegas all right so he's in las vegas let's go see if we can see him on the map unfortunately no dice there are no pins on the map so we need to fix this let's go back to our visual studio code instance all right so what you can see is that i have this application in visual studio code but what's really cool is that if i install the azure static web apps extension into visual studio code i get some really key functionality in a few important spots now one of the areas that i get additional functionality is if i go into the azure viewlet you can see that i have the static web apps viewlet right here now i need to add the additional api endpoint so all i need to do is to click on this lightning button now it's a lightning button maybe because it happens really fast so pay attention i just need to create a new endpoint get locations for the name and you can see that it actually scaffolds out a new function for me right here and it does everything on the back end as well so all i need to do then is just replace this with the code that i want to write okay okay so now that we have that code written we want to see if it actually works so let's go back and look at another spot that the extension adds some pretty cool functionality in addition to being able to launch the node functions i can also launch a full stack application with the azure static web apps application which launches both the back end with the functions as well as the front end for the full stack app so i'm just going to switch to that and we're going to start debugging and as you can see it's going to actually kick off a new debug process it's going to run npm install it's basically going to get the azure functions runtime up and running super super quick cool so now we actually have the azure functions running right here so now let's go look at the at the app again and see if it's working all right cool so now we can see that the pins are actually loaded and we could see mr benz from las vegas but what's really cool is we can visualize our global team but even better this app is already globally distributed without me having to do anything just by using using azure static web apps it's actually been globally distributed all over the world so everybody on the team gets super quick access to the application so now i just need to get this fixed to donovan so let's go back and then i can use the github pull request extension to create a new pull request from right inside visual studio code so i can just go ahead and create a new pull request it'll automatically be populated by my commit so i can choose master add map endpoint and that will create a new pull request now all i need to do is just add donovan as one of the reviewers to this pull request click ok and he should get the message where does this part even go i just hope i can find it on the internet even better a notification from work this is a pull request notification coming from microsoft teams thanks to the github app as we can see amanda completed her changes and i can click on this link and jump right to them inside of github a pr allows me to review the code before i merge it into master reading the code is one thing but running the code that's even better but i don't have all the tools that i need on this machine luckily azure static web apps has me covered i simply click on the link that's automatically added to every pull request that allows me to see the code actually running in a staging environment and as we can see amanda did a fantastic job we can see the pins we'll hover over the pins we can see the avatars of the users the one thing i wish i could change is the theme here in my garage it's really difficult to look at this light theme but a dark theme that would be better but again i don't want to run upstairs i don't want to have to get cleaned up i just want to do it right here off of this machine and luckily code spaces turns any web browser into a development machine even this old machine that i use in the garage it has no development tools on it and i installed linux on it just for fun but i can actually use code spaces to develop clicking on this link is going to spin up an entire development environment for me in the cloud far more powerful than the machine that i'm holding it's going to have visual studio code on it i can install all my favorite extensions and all the libraries and frameworks i need will automatically be installed now that my environment is spun up i can do what i would normally do i can open the file that i want to modify i can go ahead and import the dark theme and just like i would if i was upstairs i can simply click on debug doing that is going to spin up all of the functions which is the back end that we talked about earlier and the changes that amanda just made then i can click on this link that's going to allow me to see my changes right here in real time i can set breakpoints i can step through the code but as we can see the dark theme was applied correctly i can commit this code right here from the web browser and go about my business trying to fix my car when you combine the power of azure static web apps github actions and code spaces you turn every device you're holding into a development machine thank you so much everyone as you saw in this demo deploying to azure is a breeze static web apps are incredibly easy to stand up back-end infrastructure is provisioned based on convention a customizable ci cd pipeline using github actions is created for you with code spaces you can access your dev infrastructure from anywhere for focused task completion today i'm excited to announce azure static web apps modern single page applications don't rely on traditional web server frameworks they deliver static web apps with less compute using serverless apis these apps can be built using frameworks like angular react and view or static site generators like gatsby all you need to do is check in your code build and deploy code to cloud with minimal azure configuration your app is deployed globally in minutes and you can optionally configure routing authentication and custom domains we also showed you accessing your dev box in the cloud one of the most common pain points for developers is setting up a new dev box that you can access wherever you need to work so if you feel this pain today try out the preview visual studio code spaces uses the power of azure to enable developers to create fully configured developer environments in minutes for any project for any app from any repro you can connect to code spaces from your favorite code editor visual studio code visual studio or a browser-based editing experience powered by vs code azure has an end-to-end developer experience that makes it effortless to go from your idea to code to the cloud back to you scott thanks amanda as amanda showed one of the unique things we're trying to do is to really provide you with developer tools that make you incredibly productive when building azure based solutions as part of that we're also delivering great cloud native services that enable you to focus on developing your apps versus spending your time on the infrastructure below them i'd like to invite jeff holland now to talk about building cloud native applications on azure here's jeff thanks scott i'm jeff holland principal program manager for azure serverless and i am thrilled to be with each of you here today at build from my home office so let's talk some more about azure azure provides a number of services to enable developers to focus on their apps and not the infrastructure we're excited to share that everything from kubernetes to ai we have over a thousand new features and improvements we also have unique end-to-end solutions so that you can partner with non-traditional developers to harness talent across your organization and building these apps let's start with kubernetes azure kubernetes service is enterprise grade by design it's a fully managed kubernetes offering to build scale and run your deployments using azure arc your clusters can sprawl across clouds data centers and the edge but all be centrally governed and organized with azure azure provides additional layers of security for isolation of networking compute and data and you're able to take advantage of the full ecosystem that kubernetes provides we've recently announced a number of improvements to aks windows container support is now generally available so you can bring existing windows applications lift and shift them to run in a fully managed kubernetes service in azure the best cloudford.net so these applications get the benefits of scalability portability and health healing that kubernetes provides private link allows you to communicate with the kubernetes apis all within your private virtual network and spot pricing provides cost benefits for workloads like batch processing or machine learning that can tolerate some interruptions now just as important as the compute is the data for your apps and azure has a number of flexible options for you to choose the right database there's fully managed versions of microsoft sql mysql mariadb redis cosmos db and more each of these fully scalable and backed by an sla this gives you the productivity that you need but the freedom to leverage the tools your team prefers today we're announcing more cost effective options for running cosmos db the serverless capabilities coming soon enable you to efficiently run your workloads even with spikey workloads you can use the auto scale feature to have your database instantly scale but still get that single digital millisecond latency and our 99.999 availability slas using auto scale with the new cosmos db free tier your first 400 r use of throughput and 5 gigabytes of storage are completely free now moving to ai ai is opening up new scenarios for every type of application and any developer with any skill set can start to use ai with cognitive services cognitive services provides the most complete options for models ranging from vision speech language and more so in just a few lines of code you can start to access these models no machine learning experience required each of these models is customizable so you can fine-tune it based on your data and your application we continue to innovate with cognitive services personalizer is the only reinforcement learning based ai rationalization service and today we're announcing a new capability apprentice mode so that you can run it alongside your existing recommendation solution providing high accuracy results from the moment you deploy the service recently we announced new voice options for cognitive services newscast customer service and digital assistant enable developers to tailor the voice of their apps to meet their unique brand and their unique scenarios finally you can run cognitive services anywhere using containers and today we're expanding that support with general availability of text analytics and language understanding our tools enable everyone to be a part of the developer community and accomplishing tasks like building microservices and apis and using low code platforms as you know azure has a number of options to write applications using any language but often one of the best ways to surface that information to end users is by pairing it with the power platform the combination of azure the power platform and dynamics 365 is incredibly unique it lets developers focus on those high value tasks and accelerates the delivery of these cloud-based application powerapps is our low-code platform for developers and citizen developers to build rich applications quickly and easily powerapps is a low code environment to write apps for both web and mobile so i want to show you how we can use this to build an application and we're going to build an app inspired by how we've seen our users leveraging cloud native tech as part of the covid 19 response the mobile application was built using powerapps and it's calling data and services that's running in azure i'm using those tools that i love that donovan and amanda showed us earlier today to build this application so i'm showing this application now on my mobile device this is an app for screening at different points of entry around the world so i could come in and enter the details or the symptoms of a traveler at this point of entry or if they filled out a form ahead of time i'll actually select this scan button and i can go ahead and scan a form after i select to use this photo it's now scanning this image and automatically filling in each of the fields here so now when i select submit all of the text was filled in without me having to do any typing so let's show how we built this experience we're going to start here in the azure portal and every application needs data and for us we're going to be using azure cosmos db cosmos db is perfect because it auto scales to trillions of events every single second i can already see some of the data here that we've uploaded to our database for instance i can navigate to screenings and see those details here i'm even using the new cosmos db free tier so i'm storing and retrieving this data at no cost now that we have our data here in the cloud i want to be able to access it through an api so if i come back over here to visual studio i can create a brand new asp.net app i'm going to select the web api project now i need to get this api connected to that cosmos db database and the new connected services experiences is just what i need i'll go ahead and select to add a dependency here i'll select to add cosmos db visual studio is connected to my azure account so i'll select my database it's pulling in the connection details for me i have the simple configuration option to choose to either store these details locally in a secrets file or securely encrypt them within azure key vault so they don't even stay on my machine now once i'm connected to cosmos db we can go ahead and start to write some code you can see here this is an example of one of our api controllers this is for screening data so i can get screenings either by id or all of them i'm actually using the.net entity framework with the cosmos db sdk so i have something here like a link statement now i want to be able to test these statements and i want to try this api but testing apis can be cumbersome because i don't always have a ui to drive the experience so i'm fiddling with clis or other tools to try to navigate but i want to showcase this pretty cool new tool right inside of visualstudioand.net called http reppl what http repo allows me to do is browse and debug my api the same way i would navigate a folder structure so i'll start a debug session it's going to open up this console window you'll notice instead of being connected to the c drive i'm connected to localhost i can now navigate using dur or if i want i can type ls it's going to return back to me the different endpoints including our screening data that we're just looking at let's navigate to it and even do a get it's now executing my code and returning that data from cosmos db now within my visual studio project so we have some code working i want to now deploy this to run in the cloud and my first step is going to be checking this into github let's add a quick commit message here i'll push this up to github and navigate over to our repo this is just a regular github repo but i have a github action that is kicked off and is running now this is just like the action that donovan showed you earlier today for my project it's taking the.net api it's containerizing it inside of docker i'm going to publish that container to azure's container registry and finally deploy it to run in the azure kubernetes service now my code can run across incredibly elastic compute so i'm confident this api can scale to whatever demands my mobile application might have so my app is now running inside of kubernetes but i want to build some experiences around it i need to put it in the hands of my health screening professionals and rather than having to code this application manually by hand to target all the various devices my team might be using i'm going to leverage powerapps to quickly surface this data in an experience you can see here in the powerapps studio i can visually create this mobile application in just a few hours i have access to over 300 connectors out of the box or i can use our own api this screening api now running in kubernetes let's go ahead and add some information to this screen i'll come in and insert a vertical gallery i can even go ahead and choose the data source let's choose that screening data that we've been looking at so far i can move the table down go ahead and resize it i can customize the look and feel by choosing the layout i like this title layout right here so we'll go ahead and select that i even have the option to choose different fields to surface because i published this api through azure it knows hey i have things like contact number and visitor name from this api so go ahead and select it to show the visitor name and contact number so we've customized our form to show exactly how we want now this is a full mobile app it could run across windows android any device you can see here i have a number of screens here including our main screen and that screening data form and i want to show you how we hooked this form up to those ai capabilities that let me scan a picture i did that by navigating here still in the powerapps experience to enhance my app with ai i have a number of capabilities at my disposal like object detection i want to go ahead and choose form processing we'll give our model a name it's going to let us upload a few sample images and after i upload a few samples it's going to create and train a machine learning model for me without having to write any code i can now come back over here to powerapps and tell it hey if someone clicks the scan button go ahead call that forms processing model i can now map this to those different fields and do all the typing for me so our app looks pretty good now and i just need to publish it to get in the hands of our users and our team just like the 75 million others out there has been using microsoft teams heavily during the kova 19 crisis and with new capabilities i can now go ahead and choose to take any power app and instantly add it to my team by clicking this button now my application has been deployed to whatever teams whatever channels or my entire organization so now everyone using this teams app has access to it instantly deployed so let's open up my phone again i can select to see the apps i have here and there's that covet screening app integrated in the team's experience in this case on my mobile device i can go ahead and open it up and i could start to conduct those screenings so you can see by using cloud native tech i was able to build this application very efficiently both in terms of cost and in effort powerapps was a productive environment that even non-traditional developers can use to build these experiences and by weaving in microsoft teams i made this instantly available to my entire organization with a single click only microsoft provides a solution that spans from the power of kubernetes to the collaboration of microsoft teams all in a single cloud native platform thank you so much scott back to you thanks jeff now one of the things that makes the microsoft cloud unique is how comprehensive it is you know with azure we provide a cloud platform that enables you to develop custom applications and leverage cloud infrastructure and you can also take advantage of our sas solutions like microsoft 365 dynamics 365 and the power platform to connect your employees and business processes to your custom applications as jeff showed this enables incredible agility and productivity as you build solutions using the microsoft cloud now starbucks is a great example of a customer who's using the combination of azure microsoft 365 dynamics 365 power bi and teams to drive solutions across their business and to share more about some of the great work that starbucks is doing i'd like to invite julia white from microsoft and jerry martin flickinger executive vice president and chief technology officer from starbucks thank you so much scott now jared great to be here today i of course have my starbucks ready to go and do i perfect now starbucks has been on a journey with technology around their transformation and got starting with office 365 back in 2015 and then adding things like power bi and github and then even more recently azure sphere so i'd love to understand what that journeys look like for starbucks it really has been a transformation the first is helping our partners grow and partner is what we call all of our employees we've done this by ensuring that we're actually promoting intellectual curiosity and embracing a growth mindset every year we have a number of learning journeys for all of our partners including something we call the starbucks innovation expo this past year both satya as well as brad smith came and spoke to our partners and it was so encouraging and enlightening and really brought a new perspective on the external tech market we have really evolved from an organization that focused heavily on buying and installing software to one that also built and thinks about modern techniques like microservices and ci cd pipelines we leverage the cloud extensively for scalability and flexibility we're using aiml for hyper personalization in many of our customer digital properties we are really thoughtful about making sure that our architecture is going to carry us into the future and give us the kind of agility and ability to innovate quickly that we need so it's been a great transformation journey so far now jerry as we all know a lot has changed very recently and that's really impacted starbucks business and so you've needed to rely on technology to adapt and change how you do business and how you engage with your employees too so what does that look like so let me talk about three different ways that tech has really helped us get through this crisis to this point the first is collaboration tools not surprising we use microsoft teams and really just overnight we went from modest adoption to complete adoption and you know of course like all of us i'm looking at metrics around this and we've had in the last four weeks about 140 000 scheduled meetings but the number that gets me really excited is the fact that in the last four weeks we've had about three million informal connections on microsoft teams and to me those informal collaboration moments are when people are connecting in the coffee room and it's that ad hoc conversation that i think is really important so the bottom line is covet 19 is really teaching us to work differently in the era of collaboration the second aspect of tech that has really helped us through this period is what i will call customer channels we've been able to very rapidly extend customer channels to include delivery and new forms that we hadn't used before like curbside pickup so being able to move quickly and rapidly built on a foundation of scale and agility is what's been able to let us do that in a really fast time frame and then the last is where we've gotten with analytics data visualization and our ability to really thoughtfully think about reopening our stores we've been able to take real-time data that we have from our stores along with third-party data around covid 19 status and do scenario planning against that to understand how to reopen and which stores to reopen and what formats to reopen and that is helping us bring our business back uh through this time thank you julia thank you derek for joining us and thanks for sharing your perspective and your learning so with that i'll hand back to scott great thank you julie and jerry it's great to see how starbucks is rapidly evolving to the changing needs of their employees and customers using microsoft technologies now as part of that change every organization is looking to use data and ai to run their business more effectively and with microsoft azure we provide a rich set of services and capabilities that make it easy for you to do this to talk about our latest innovations here i'd like to welcome rohan kumar thank you scott hello everyone i'm ron kumar corporate vice president engineering of azure data i'm really excited to be here joining the keynote from my home office it is becoming increasingly clear that predictive analytics using ai and machine learning is a critical element in every enterprise customers digital transformation journey let's start by looking at what's new in azure analytics and machine learning and how it can help you build your solutions in much easier and faster than ever before the modern data warehouse pattern which you see on the slide has really resonated very well with our customers who are modernizing their core enterprise data warehouse while this pattern has worked well the customer feedback on the amount of time cost and effort it takes to stitch together multiple services into an end-to-end analytics solution was very clear so in november at ignite we announced azure synapse analytics synapse significantly reduces the complexity of building and operating end-to-end analytical solutions by enabling a simple intuitive visual no code experience we've deeply integrated synapse with power bi and azure machine learning making them an industry leading combination to build predictive analytic solutions customers can continue running their existing data warehouse workloads in production today with azure synapse and will automatically benefit from the new capabilities which are in preview while we have taken a huge leap forward with synapse the barrier between operational databases and analytical systems has been difficult to overcome current solutions involve creating etl pipelines which are extremely complex very expensive and challenging to maintain these pipelines often cause significant delay of hours days or even weeks resulting in decisions being made on stale data which is why we are very excited to announce azure synapse link synapse link is the industry's first cloud native implementation of hybrid transaction analytical processing synapse link links your azure operational databases to synapse providing the ability to get immediate insights for your business in fact as soon as a transaction is recorded in your operational database it will be available in columnar format for analytics in mere seconds and the best part all it takes is a click of a button and will handle all the work for you no need to build and manage extremely complex and expensive etl pipelines or worry about negative impact on the performance of your transactions instead of understanding what happened yesterday or last week synapse link enables you to understand what is happening now providing clarity in an instant and in these uncertain times making decisions based on the now is very critical as businesses must react to sudden changes available in cosmos db today we will get this to other azure operational databases over time let's see synapse link in action through a demo for the purpose of this demo please imagine that i'm a data engineer at a large automotive company we have multiple factory locations worldwide sending data from their production lines i am accountable to author and maintain a kpi dashboard using power bi for our business users in the past we were never up to date with what's happening on the factory floor which resulted in several fire drills we addressed that challenge using synapse link let us see how we made that happen we deal with a very high volume of data and have extreme low latency requirements since our manufacturing plants are in multiple regions worldwide support for features like jio replication is essential for us to build highly responsive applications and workloads azure cosmos db is the perfect operational database given our requirements now to avoid any disruptions to our supply chain we need the database to serve our parts catalog and ingest input feeds from our factory floor in real time 24 7 globally with zero downtime we've achieved five nines of availability with cosmos tb using the multi-region multi-master rights now as you can see on the screen my cosmos tb database is ingesting millions of transactions per second and is able to serve data with single digit millisecond latency now my cosmos db database also happens to be the source repository for our failure reports let me show you using the data explorer view what the documents look like inside the database let me go ahead and click the supply chain database here and now pick the quality assurance folder uh and items now as you'll see on the screen in a short while there's a json document for every quality test report for all our manufactured items it contains all attributes of the report including the part id description and the test result this is exactly the data that we need real-time access to to enable immediate insights on failure rates welcome synapse link with a single click i can enable synapse link on my cosmos tv account and select the synapse workspace an existing one where my analytical queries will be run now behind the scenes synapse link created a live optimized columnar representation of the cosmos db's operational data and made it available to synapse without impacting the performance of cosmos db's transactions i did not have to spend any time or resources building highly complex very expensive and hard to maintain etl pipelines it just works which is awesome now let me go to my synapse workspace and query the live cosmos db data using the synapse link that we just created here in my synapse workspace i can bring together all my enterprise data integration data warehousing and big data analytics into a single unified experience for my immediate bi and machine learning needs let me enter the data hub using the data hub in synapse studio i can access all my data that's been managed by synapse including files tables data sets etc i can also access the real-time data that's enabled through synapse link from cosmos db with a simple right-click i can create a new sql script or create a notebook to run a spark job on my live cosmos db data let me go ahead and bring up a sql script that i wrote earlier that essentially gets real time failure rates from the cosmos db feed you'll notice that when i rerun the script the timestamps get updated the view that you see in the result set is not from last week or yesterday or even the last r the view that you see is from what's happening right now which is really cool now we've deeply integrated synapse with power bi which enables me to create power bi reports and enterprise grade semantic models right from within the synapses workspace now this is the dashboard that's being backed by the synapse sql query that you just saw to get the failure rates let me go ahead and refresh this power bi report to get real-time insights now business users can rely on this dashboard to deal with incidents as they happen in real time now as you can see on the screen the failure rate for some of the parts is higher than the expected threshold let's figure out how to go handle this problem now using the data flows in synapse i've already ingested the stock levels and prices from all our suppliers in our sap system and supplier contracts and delivery terms from our dynamics 365 system now to mitigate the current situation we need to find a supplier to source the parts whose failure rate is above the acceptable threshold to predict the next best supplier i need to join the synapse link enable live data from cosmos tb which has the list of the bad parts with the supplier data from dynamics 365 and the stock levels and the pricing data from sap and run a predictive analytics query across the combined data set the sql query that you see on the screen captures this logic now one of the things that i want to showcase is the use of the predict function in the sql query which allows us to apply a model that was created in azure machine learning to score against the combined data set let me go ahead and run this query now in the results section in a few seconds you're going to see a ranked order list of suppliers that meet our requirements you know i'm not a data scientist and synapse made it really easy for me to do predictive analytics by leveraging the model that was created in azure machine learning to get the results the predictive analytic results that i want now let's go ahead and go back to our power bi report and add these predictive insights to this report so we can share them with our business users doing that is really simple just a few little clicks to add the insights that you want i go ahead and click here and get the high value and that's it when i go ahead and click save these new predictive insights have been added to the power bi report and shared with all the business users now they can go to power bi online and double click to understand more details of how the prediction was made what elements of the machine learning model influenced the prediction decision it gives them a little bit more insights deeper insights into what happened behind the scenes now some of you may be wondering how did i create the model that i used in the predict function here i am in the new azure machine learning studio it is designed to be a self-contained environment for all your data science needs from model creation packaging deployment through to monitoring and management azure machine learning has tools for all skill levels it has notebooks for a code first experience a designer for a drag and drop experience and my personal favorite automated machine learning click through wizard let me show you how someone like me who is not a data scientist was able to create a state of art machine learning model to predict the next best supplier let me start by creating a new automated ml run now the very first thing i have to do is pick a data set to train my model against now given the deep integration that we've done between synapse and aml the data set over here that are processed in synapse is automatically available to me in the automl workflow let me go ahead and select that and click next now there's a few pieces of information that i need to provide starting with the experiment name let me pick an already existing experiment that i have ongoing the target column to score on which is the forecast delivery days here and then finally a compute environment for automl to run the training on that's it i go ahead and click next and finally i pick the task type as classification because i'm dealing with a limited set of suppliers and click finish now behind the scenes automl is leveraging the compute environment that i provided to train the machine learning model that best suits the requirements that i have now this process is going to take a while now let me show you how easy it is to deploy a model once it gets built let me start by click clicking the experiments tab here and over here you see the active experiment that i have ongoing let me go ahead and select that now in this dashboard over here you would see a lot of information about the experiment the number of models that have already been created the active one you see run 221 is the one that i just started and there's information around things like the accuracy of the model etc now let me go ahead and pick round 166 which is a model that has been recently completed to show you how easy it is to complete the deployment from here i just select the algorithm name and that's it i'm here on this screen where i can just click the deploy button and then this model which i have built automatically gets available for synapse to run sql query spark queries on that's it it's that simple now in summary synapse link makes it really easy to do real-time analytics on your operational data in ways that traditional highly complex very expensive and hard to maintain etl pipelines couldn't synapse link is a game changer synapse power bi and azure machine learning is an industry leading combination to do predictive analytics now let me move back to my presentation as organizations look to adopt ai they face a major challenge in developing and using ai responsibly customers want to understand the inner workings of their ai models what is driving them are they accurate and unbiased how to build and use them while protecting pii data and staying compliant a great example of this is mortgage lending consumers and lenders alike want to ensure that the models being used in their predictions and recommendations are both avoiding unintended biases and protecting privacy to address these concerns we are announcing several new capabilities in azure machine learning these are designed to empower data scientists and developers to understand protect and control data and models throughout the machine learning life cycle with these new capabilities they can understand model behavior by getting explanations of how models work had both training and inferencing as well as assessing fairness and mitigating bias protect through differential privacy compute capabilities to build models using sensitive data while safeguarding the privacy of individuals control by tracking the entire machine learning process and maintaining an audit trail of all the machine learning assets to meet regulatory and compliance requirements fedex is a customer that will greatly benefit from these capabilities microsoft and fedex announced a strategic collaboration fedex is on a transformation journey on how they leverage data and microsoft is partnering closely with them to make this a reality combining azure analytics and machine learning capabilities with fedex's data about millions of packages moving around the world and external data like weather and traffic in real time will provide fedex and their customers an unprecedented level of insight and intelligence for example an important package needs to get to a hospital or a manufacturing facility that could be shut down in these cases seconds matter and that's why fedex is leveraging azure to accelerate insights allowing for corrective action within minutes of detecting an anomaly this journey is just the beginning and i cannot wait to share more with you soon we can't wait to see what you build with all this amazing innovation back to you scott thanks rohan well we've covered a lot of territory in this presentation watched some amazing end-to-end demos and announced a lot of new services you're going to see even more throughout these next two days and some of the other great sessions that we have here developing with azure puts the latest cloud technology and best in class development tools into your hands no other cloud offers the comprehensive end-to-end platform that the microsoft cloud delivers and we really look forward to the amazing solutions that you build on top of it thank you and have a great event you
