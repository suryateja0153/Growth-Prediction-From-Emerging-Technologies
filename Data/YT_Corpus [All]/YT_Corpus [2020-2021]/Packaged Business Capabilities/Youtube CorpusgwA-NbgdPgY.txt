 WELCOME TO ANOTHER MICROSOFT BUSINESS SUMMIT SESSION. THE SESSION'S NAME IS UNINTERRUPTED SUPPORT. MY NAME IS HECTOR AND I'M THE PRINCIPAL AND HERE WITH ME IS THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR DYNAMICS 365. WE'RE EXCITED THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO JOIN IN THIS SESSION BY THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. WE WOULD VERY MUCH LOVE TO BE WITH YOU IN PERSON BUT GIVEN THE CONDITION, WE'RE STILL SUPER, SUPER EXCITED TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY. WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT CONTENT THIS MORNING. WE'RE FIRST GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME GOING TO THE LATEST AND GREATEST TECHNOLOGY OF EACH OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HOW WE ARE SEEING OUR PRODUCTS REALLY EMPOWERING SERVICE TECHNICIANS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS SO YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK US ANYTHING YOU MAY HAVE IN MIND. WE HAVE A GREAT GROUP OF MODERATORS TO HELP OUT WITH ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. FOR OUR AGENDA WE HAVE TWO TOPICS. THE FIRST IS HOW TO LEVERAGE DATA IN NEXT GENERATION OF MOBILE USING DYNAMICS 365 SERVICE. WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ALL ABOUT THE LATEST AND GREATEST ON HOW CAN YOU CAPTURE DATA FROM YOUR ASSETS, SEND IT TO THE SERVICE FOR DEEPER ANALYTICS AND NOTIFICATIONS AS WELL AS GETTING TO KNOW ALL THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY IN THE MOBILE TECHNOLOGY OF DYNAMICS 365. THEN WE'RE GOING TO SWITCH GEARS AND TALK ABOUT HOW TO EMPOWER YOUR TECHNICIANS IN HOW TO MAKE THEIR WORK MORE EFFECTIVE USING DYNAMICS 365 AND EMPOWER SUCCESS THROUGH AR AND COMMUNICATIONS. BEFORE WE GET DEEP INTO THE TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE PRODUCT WE REALLY WANTED TO SET CONTEXT INTO WHAT ARE THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING WHEN WE GO AND MEET CUSTOMERS ON A DAILY BASIS. IT IS CLEAR THAT CUSTOMER AND TECHNICIAN ENGAGEMENT IS TRANSFORMING AND THE CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE ONLY ACCELERATING THAT. WE'RE ENGAGING OUR CUSTOMERS ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS AND THERE'S THE FOLLOWUP. TECHNICIANS ARE EXPECTED TO REACT TO RAPID CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, MULTIPLE COUNTRIES ARE SWITCHING STAGES AND SWITCHING REGULATIONS AND IT HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON WHETHER TECHNICIANS CAN WORK ON SITE, OFF SITE, REMOTELY. IT'S HARD TO COORDINATE BETWEEN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND DIFFERENT REGULATIONS. THIS IS MAKING IT HARD AND TECHNICIANS ARE EXPECTED TO REACT. MORE IS DEMANDED FROM THE TECHNICIANS. WE KNOW FROM QUARANTINE AREAS, FROM REGULATION RESTRICTIONS, SAFE DISTANCE, ET CETERA, MORE WORK IS DEMANDED FROM THE TECHNICIANS. THE THIRD THING WE'RE SEEING FROM THE CUSTOMERS IS GATHERING INFORMATION HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. OF COURSE, IN THE PAST WE'VE KNOWN IT'S HUGE, SUPER IMPORTANT, BUT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THAT DATA REMOTELY IS MORE IMPORTANT AND KYLE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THESE ARE SOME SETTINGS IN THE CONTEXT THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM OUR CUSTOMERS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY GO AND TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ON WHY THE TRENDS ARE HAPPENING. NOW I'M GOING TO PASS IT ON TO KYLE WHO'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE LATEST AND GREATEST ON FIELD SERVICE AS IT RELATES TO IOP AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS. ON TO YOU, KYLE. HI. I'M PRODUCT LEADER FOR DYNAMICS 365 FIELD SERVICE. AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE JUST FINISHED RELEASING THE NEW FIELD SERVICE FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES IN 2020 WAVE ONE. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VIEW THE PRERECORDED SESSION WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE WHICH HAS MORE DETAILS ON THOSE FEATURES. WE ALSO EMPATHIZE WITH ALL OF YOU WHO ARE WORKING THROUGH THE CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT SITUATION. WE COMMONLY REFER TO FIELD SERVICE AS ON-SITE SERVICE WHICH IS CURRENTLY MADE MUCH MORE CHALLENGING. THIS HELPS TO HIGHLIGHT THE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE IN THE INDUSTRY TO LEVERAGE THE POWER OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS, IOT. IN LOOKING AT INDUSTRY DATA WE FIND THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE PLANNING TO LEVERAGE IOT IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND 60 OF OEM PRODUCTS HAVE IOT CAPABILITY, PLUS USE OF IOT LEADS TO MEASURABLE INCREASE IN TECHNICIAN PRODUCTIVITY. OUR FIELD SERVICE APPLICATION SUPPORTS TAKING ACTIONS AND SENDING SIGNALS REMOTELY BASED ON IOT. NOW WITH WAVE ONE, YOU CAN REMOTELY VIEW IOT SIGNAL CORRELATED WITH SERVICE HISTORY TO HELP TRIAGE AND DIAGNOSE IOT ALERTS. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO EXPLORE THESE POSSIBILITIES ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TIMES OF MINIMAL PERSONAL CONTACT. MY NEXT TOPIC IS THE RECENT RELEASE OF THE NEW FIELD SERVICE MOBILE APP BUILT ON POWER APPS. THIS APP IS NOW AVAILABLE AND WILL WORK WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF FIELD SERVICE WHICH IS ROLLING OUT NOW. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK OUT THE NEW APP. HERE'S A QUICK DEMO OF THE APP. THIS IS A NEW FIELD SERVICE MOBILE APP BUILT ON POWER APPS PROVIDING ONLINE AND OFF LINE CAPABILITIES FOR FIELD SERVICE TECHNICIANS. THE CALENDAR SHOWS BOOKINGS ASSIGNED TO THE TECHNICIAN BY DAY, WEEK OR MONTH. OPENING THE BOOKING SHOWS ALL THE DETAILS OF THE BOOKING AND THE ASSOCIATED WORK ORDER. IT IS EASY TO CHANGE THE STATUS FROM SCHEDULED TO IN PROGRESS. THE TECHNICIAN CAN EASILY VIEW CUSTOMER INFORMATION INCLUDING LOCATION, MAP, AND THEN SIMPLY GET DIRECTIONS TO THE SERVICE LOCATION. AFTER ARRIVING ON SITE, THE SERVICE TASKS GUIDE THE TECHNICIAN THROUGH THE WORK TO BE PERFORMED, INCLUDING MARKING TASKS AS COMPLETE. THE PARTS REQUIRED FOR THE SERVICE ARE ALSO AVAILABLE AS WELL INCLUDING MARKING THE NUMBER OF PARTS USED. THE APP ENABLES CAPTURING NOTES, PHOTOS AND VIDEOS OF THE SERVICE. THE VISIT CAN BE COMPLETED BY CAPTURING THE CUSTOMER'S SIG NUR. THIS NEW APP IS CAN BE TAILORED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS USING THE EXISTING POWER APPS MODEL DRIVEN CAPABILITIES. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK THE NEW FIELD SERVICE MOBILE APP IN EITHER THE APPLE OR ANDROID STORES.  THANK YOU, KYLE. THAT WAS GREAT. NOW IT'S OUR TURN TO START TALKING ABOUT DYNAMICS 365 REMOTE ASSIST TO REALLY EMPOWER TECHNICIAN SUCCESS THROUGH RAPID COMMUNICATION. BEFORE WE GET STARTED I ACTUALLY THINK A VIDEO IS WORTH 1, 000 WORDS SO I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU A VIDEO THAT SHOWS THE USE CASE AND VALUE PROPOSITION FOR DYNAMICS 365 REMOTE ASSIST. LET'S PLAY THE VIDEO.  WHAT IF THERE WAS A WAY FOR EMPLOYEES TO WORK TOGETHER FROM ANYWHERE WHEN EVERYTHING IS ON THE LINE. EMPLOYEES ARE THE HEART OF EVERY BUSINESS. IT'S THEIR RESOURCEFULNESS, INGENUITY AND DRIVE THAT GET THE JOB DONE. BUT EVEN THE BEST EMPLOYEES NEED HELP FROM PEOPLE WHO AREN'T THERE WITH THEM. NOW EMPLOYEES ON SITE CAN WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH EXPERTS IN REMOTE LOCATIONS. IN AN INSTANT THEY CAN SHARE WHAT THEY SEE, LEND A HELPING HAND, WALK THROUGH THE PROCESS STEP BY STEP , HELPING SOLVE PROBLEMS IN REAL TIME. THIS IS A NEW VISION FOR WORK. NOW EMPLOYEES CAN WORK SMARTER AND BRING IN THE PEOPLE THEY NEED WITH JUST A TAP. THEY CAN TROUBLESHOOT, REPAIR AND PERFORM WITH CONFIDENCE AND SPEED. THEY CAN MOVE FREELY, PULL CRITICAL INFORMATION INTO VIEW, AND STAY FOCUSED ON THE TASK, THEIR HANDS FREE TO DO THE WORK. THIS IS COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING AT FULL SPEED. YOUR PEOPLE, UNITED ACROSS TIME AND DISTANCE, MORE CONNECTED, MORE INFORMED AND MORE EFFICIENT. NOW EMPLOYEES CAN WORK TOGETHER FROM ANYWHERE. THEY CAN GO THERE WITHOUT BEING THERE. THIS ISN'T THE FUTURE. THIS IS HERE AND NOW. IE HOPE THAT GAVE YOU A SUMMARY OF THE VALUE PROPOSITION AS IT PERTAINS TO EMPOWERING TECHNICIANS TO COLLABORATE MORE EFFICIENTLY. WE CAN SUMMARIZE THE VALUE PROP IN THREE MAIN BUCKETS. NUMBER ONE IS THE ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN REAL TIME SO YOU'RE COLLABORATING REMOTELY BY SHARING YOUR REAL TIME VIEW AND REALLY USING THE POWER OF MIXED REALITY ANNOTATIONS TO GET A MORE EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION WITH YOUR TECHNICIANS. THE NUMBER TWO IS CRITICAL INFORMATION INTO VIEW. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCHEMATICS, THE DOCUMENTATION, BUT ALSO FIELD SERVICE WORK IN A REAL WORLD ENVIRONMENT, HANDS FREE OR WITH YOUR MOBILE APPLICATION. TIME IS MONEY, ESPECIALLY IN THIS CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT. NUMBER THREE, NOT BEING ON LOCATION. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WANT TO DO A REMOTE INSPECTION OR COMBINE FIXING SOMETHING BUT YOU NEED TO BRING THE EXPERT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE REST OF THE FACILITY. YOU CAN ACTUALLY VERY EASILY ALLOW THE OTHER PEOPLE NOT ON THAT FACTORY FLOOR OR NOT CLOSE TO THAT ASSET TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AT THAT SITE. WHAT IS THE SUMMARY OF HIGH LEVEL CAPABILITIES THAT DYNAMICS 365 OFFERS? FIRST OF ALL, IT'S WIDELY AVAILABLE. WE'VE GONE GENERAL AVAILABILITY ON IOS AND ANDROID DEVISES AS OF LATE LAST YEAR. A HUGE AMOUNT OF DEVICES THAT YOU CAN GET STARTED SUPER QUICKLY. IT IS MUCH MORE THAN AUDIO AND VIDEO BECAUSE WITH MIXED REALITY ANNOTATIONS IN 3-D AND 2-D, YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THE ESSENCE OF TECHNICIAN WORK, POINT TO THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM, EXCHANGE MUCH MORE OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. OF COURSE, DYNAMICS 365 FIELD SERVICE, YOU CAN CALL FROM OTHER APPLICATIONS USING OUR PROTOCOL ACTIVATION FEATURE WHICH ALLOWS REMOTE ACCESS FROM YOUR CUSTOM APPLICATIONS. LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST, WE LEVERAGE BEST IN COMMUNICATIONS BY USING THE PLATFORM IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THIS FUNCTIONALITY. TEAMS IS A FANTASTIC TOOL THAT IS WIDELY AVAILABLE WHICH MAKES DEPLOYMENT OF REMOTE ACCESS MUCH EASIER. SOME OF THE CAPABILITIES WE OFFER ARE IN MEETINGS AND OTHERS. FINALLY, BEFORE WE GET INTO QA, I WANTED TO MENTION THE BETTER TOGETHER STORY WE HAVE WITH DYNAMICS 365 FIELD SERVICE AND REMOTE ASSIST. THESE ARE SISTER TOOLS THAT GO HAND IN HAND TO REALLY EMPOWER TECHNICIANS IN ALL DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. FROM A CAPABILITY STANDPOINT, WHAT FIELD SERVICE USERS CAN DO WITH REMOTE ASSIST IS PRETTY POWERFUL. YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEVERAGE REMOTE ASSIST TO CALL THE DESIGNATED EXPERT IN YOUR BOOKING. WHILE YOUR BOOKING IS IN PROGRESS, IF YOU HAVE A DESIGNATED EXPERT YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY LAUNCH A CALL ON MS 365 FIELD SERVICE AND REMOTE ASSIST. THEN YOU CAN SAVE ALL THE DATA INFORMATION AS YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH THE REMOTE COLLABORATOR DURING THE INCIDENT. THAT INFORMATION CAN BE SENT BACK INTO THE FIELD SERVICE BOOKING FOR FURTHER PROCESSING. FOR EXAMPLE, CAN BE SHARED ALSO FOR POST PROCESSING ANALYTICS ON THE FIELD SERVICE SIDE. OVERALL, A REALLY GOOD STORY AND I HOPE YOU'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE CONTENT THAT WE'VE PRESENTED TODAY HOW DYNAMICS FIELD SERVICE IS HELPING EMPOWER TECHNICIANS BY BRINGING STATE-OF-THE-ART CAPABILITIES AND OF COURSE OUR LATEST AND GREATEST TECH ON THE REMOTE SIDE AND I HOPE YOU LEARNED THE POWER OF REMOTE COLLABORATION AND HOW TIGHTLY INTEGRATED IT IS WITH THE DYNAMICS 365 FIELD SERVICE WORKLOADS. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS TO THE AUDIENCE. WE HAVE A GREAT SET OF WONDERFUL MODERATORS THAT CAN HELP OUT WITH THAT. WITHOUT FURTHER OR DO, IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS, MYSELF AND KYLE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU, KYLE AND HECTOR. THAT GREATS INFORMATION FOR HOW REMOTE ASSIST AND FIELD SERVICE WORK TOGETHER TO EMPOWER TECHNICIANS. A FEW QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE. IS THE NEW FIELD SERVICE APP ALREADY AVAILABLE?  YES. THE NEW FIELD SERVICE APP IS AVAILABLE IN APP STORES. IT'S CALLED FIELD SERVICE PARENTHESIS DYNAMICS 365. THAT'S HOW YOU'LL FIND IT IN THE APP STORES. THE BACK END FUNCTIONALITY TO WORK WITH THE APP IS PART OF THE LATEST FIELD SERVICE SOLUTION AND THAT'S ROLLING OUT NOW BY G GEO. SO IN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS IT WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ALL GEOS, THE BACK END FUNCTIONALITY THAT GOES WITH THE NEW MOBILE APP.  FOLLOWING UP ON THAT, I HAVE A QUESTION AROUND THE MOBILE APP. CAN THE NEW FIELD SERVICE MOBILE APPLICATION BE CUSTOMIZED LIKE THE REST OF THE FIELD MOBILE APPLICATIONS? YES. THERE IS CURRENTLY EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT'S A MOD P EL DRIVEN APP. YOU HAVE THOSE SAME CAPABILITIES THAT WILL BE APPLIED TO MOBILE. WE'LL BE DOING SOME MORE WORK DOWN THE ROAD SO THERE'S ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY FOR THE CLIENT SIDE WHEN THE APP IS OFF LINE. WE HAVE WORK TO DO THERE. AT THIS POINT YOU HAVE ALL THE CAPABILITIES OF THE MOBILE DRIVEN FUNCTIONALITY. ANOTHER ONE FROM ZACHARY IN THE AUDIENCE. IS IT REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT REMOTE ASSIST THROUGH FIELD SERVICE OR CAN IT BE STAND-ALONE AS WELL?  I CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION. ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN IMPLEMENT REMOTE ASSIST AND DOWNLOAD YOURSELF STAND-ALONE. YOU DON'T NEED DYNAMICS FIELD SERVICE TO USE REMOTE ASSIST WITH YOUR TECHNICIANS.  WILL WE BE ABLE TO CONNECT OR LOAD DATA EXISTING COMING FROM SAP, PM OR OTHER MAINTENANCE PLATFORMS?  IS IT THE QUESTION ABOUT REMOTE ASSIST OR FIELD SERVICE? I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE ABOUT FIELD SERVICE.  THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN ACCELERATOR, PAMPHLET BASICALLY, GUIDANCE OF HOW FIELD SERVICE CAN WORK WITH SAP PM, PLANT MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONALITY. SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE ACTUALLY DONE THAT INTEGRATION, AND THAT CAN INVOLVE HAVING DEMAND COME FROM PM LIKE WORK ORDERS THAT COME FROM OUTSIDE AND THEN ARE ACTIONED IN FIELD SERVICE AND ALSO IT CAN SERVE AS A MASTER FOR THE ASSETS THAT ARE IN FIELD SERVICE. SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY SOME GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW FIELD SERVICE AND SAP PM CAN WORK TOGETHER. THE NEXT ONE WILL BE DIRECTED AT YOU AS WELL, KYLE. WHAT ARE YOU CURRENTLY DOING FOR TECHNICIAN TIME INJURIES? [INAUDIBLE] LET'S SWITCH GEARS TO REMOTE ASSIST QUESTIONS. HECTOR, CAN YOU TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT THE TYPE OF CUSTOMERS USING REMOTE ASSIST?  ABSOLUTELY. CUSTOMERS LIKE MANUFACTURING WHERE THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT NEED TO COLLABORATE BETWEEN TECHNICIANS TO DO REMOTE INSPECTIONS OR REMOTE COACHING FOR EXAMPLE, WE ALSO SEE A LOT OF TRACTION IN UTILITIES. LOTS OF CUSTOMERS ARE EAGER TO USE REMOTE ASSIST TO HELP THEIR END CUSTOMERS WITH THEIR SPECIFIC ASSETS. THEN OF COURSE A LOT OF TRACTION IN MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WITH THE RECENT COVID-19 AS WELL AND MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES AS WELL. ALL ACROSS THE SPECTRUM WHERE THERE'S HEAVY ASSET ENGAGEMENT, HEAVY SERVICES ENGAGEMENT WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON MANUFACTURING, UTILITIES, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SOME OIL AND GAS TOO. NOW WE'LL SWITCH TO A QUESTION FROM CHERYL IN THE AUDIENCE. CAN YOU CREATE GUIDES FOR REMOTE ASSIST FOR ANDROID IN THE SAME WAY YOU DO WITH HOLLOW LENS?  365 GUIDE IS NOT PART OF REMOTE ASSIST. WE'RE WORKING HARD TOGETHER ON THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING GUIDES AVAILABLE INTO THE REMOTE ASSIST APPLICATION ON HOLLOW LENS AND HOPEFULLY SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE ON MOBILE. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SHARE AT THE MOMENT.  FOLLOWING UP, ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ANDROID AND IOS WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF FOR REMOTE ASSIST? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE BIGGEST REQUIREMENT TODAY IS THAT THAT DEVICE HAS TO BE AR CAPABLE. AR REQUIREMENTS -- AND YOU CAN FIND A LINK TO THE ACTUAL DEVICES FOR IOS AND ANDROID WHO ARE AR CAPABLE, BUT WE'RE INVESTING HEAVILY IN ALSO HAVING A STREAMLINED VERSION ASSIST FOR THOSE DEVICES WHO ARE A LITTLE OLDER SO THAT REMOTE ASSIST CAN ACTUALLY WORK ON THEM TOO. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK OUT OUR REQUIREMENTS PAGE ON THE TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS SIDE FOR REMOTE ASSIST. THANKS, HECTOR. ANOTHER QUESTION FROM ANDY IN THE AUDIENCE. IN THE FUTURE, WILL THERE BE SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS 2? LAPTOPS ARE QUITE POPULAR AMONG FIELD SERVICE TECHNICIANS AND NOW THAT IT'S A MODEL DRIVEN APP IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ANDROID AND IOS. YES, ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AND WE HOPE TO HAVE EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENTS AROUND THAT IN THE COMING MONTHS. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REQUEST. I THINK IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE. LOTS OF FIELD SERVICE TECHNICIANS LEVERAGE WINDOWS AND WE REALLY WANT TO HELP THEM LEVERAGE REMOTE ASSIST TOO. WONDERFUL. MOVING FORWARD, WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES LEFT, SO I ENCOURAGE THE AUDIENCE TO CONTINUE ASKING QUESTIONS. THE NEXT QUESTION IN THE QUE, DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS TO MAKE THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN REMOTE ASSIST AND FIELD SERVICE EVEN TIGHTER? ABSOLUTELY, YES. KYLE AND I SPEND A LOT OF OUR TIME THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT EVEN GREATER. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY PLANS, ANY DETAILED PLANS TO SHARE AT THE MOMENT, BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT OUR VISION IS THAT FOR CUSTOMERS WHO USE FIELD SERVICE AND REMOTE ASSIST TOGETHER WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM JUST WITH ONE APPLICATION SO THEY WON'T HAVE TO IN THE LONG TERM -- WE DON'T HAVE TO ENFORCE THEM TO USE TWO SEPARATE APPS. NEXT QUESTION, IS THAT VIDEO OF DYNAMICS 365 REMOTE ASSIST THAT YOU SHARED AND HOLLOW LENS TWO AVAILABLE AS A DOWNLOAD SO I CAN SHARE IT WITH MY MANAGEMENT TEAM? YES, ABSOLUTELY. IN FACT, YOU CAN FIND THAT VIDEO ON OUR REMOTE ASSIST YOUTUBE CHANNEL. WE'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY -- I THINK THE SLIDES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AND WE WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO LINK THAT SPECIFIC VIDEO, SO, YES, IT IS WIDELY AVAILABLE. WE JUST MADE IT PUBLIC A FEW WEEKS AGO. THANKS, HECTOR. A QUESTION FROM TONY IN THE AUDIENCE. CONCERNING REMOTE ASSIST, ANY TIMELINE FOR WINDOWS APPLICATIONS FOR ANDROID AND IOS? GCC HIGH FOR ANDROID AND IOS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T HAVE A DATE YET BUT WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN IN THE COMING MONTHS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AT THE MOMENT BUT WE UNFORTUNATELY ARE NOT READY TO COMMIT TO A DATE YET. ON THE WINDOWS, SAME THING, SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON AND HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WE'LL BE ABLE TO SHARE MORE DETAILS. NOW WE'LL SWITCH BACK OVER TO KYLE. CAN YOU INFORM PEOPLE WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON WITH INSPECTION. GREAT QUESTION. FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE HAD A NEED IN THE PRODUCT TO HAVE INSPECTION FUNCTIONALITY. A LOT OF TIMES TECHNICIANS ON SITE NEED TO GO THROUGH THAT CHECKLIST MOTION TO COMPLETE THEIR WORK. IN PREVIEW NOW WE ARE MAKING INSPECTIONS AVAILABLE SO AS YOU DATE WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF FIELD SERVICE BE SURE TO GO IN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SLIDE THAT INCLUDES INSPECTION. IT HAS THE ABILITY TO DEFINE INSPECTION USING A GREAT DESIGNER EXPERIENCE, ATTACH IT TO A WORK THROUGH THROUGH INCIDENT TYPE AND COMPLETE THE INSPECTION ON THE TECHNICIAN'S MOBILE APPLICATION AND THEN STORE THE RESULTS SO THOSE CAN BE VIEWED AGAIN AGAINST THE WORK ORDER. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK IT OUT.  THANKS, KYLE. FOLLOWUP FROM CHRISTOPH IN THE AUDIENCE. IF FIELD SERVICE AND REMOTE ASSIST ARE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS, ARE THE FIELD SERVICE APPLICATIONS MAINLY FOR SCHEDULING SERVICES AND IS THE FIELD SERVICE MORE OF AN OPERATIONAL THAN CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT APP? I CAN TAKE THE FIRST PART OF THAT. WE BELIEVE CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT IS A WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS. WHAT WE FIND IN THE FIELD IS LIKE CUSTOMERS WITH HIGH DEMANDS ON WORK ORDER MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCE SCHEDULING, ET CETERA, IT'S A GREAT FIT TO GO AND START WITH FIELD SERVICE AND WE'RE SEEK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SUCCESS WITH THEM. CUSTOMERS WHO REALLY WANT TO START WITH REMOTE COLLABORATION, REMOTE TOOLS AND USING REMOTE ASSISTS, WE FEEL LIKE REMOTE ASSISTS IS A BETTER STARTING PATH. WE SEE THE TOOLS AS COMPLIMENTARY. TOGETHER THEY FORM A REALLY GOOD PORTFOLIO WHEN WE LEAVE CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT FROM END TO END. KYLE, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD A LITTLE MORE ON YOUR THOUGHTS.  ON THE QUESTION OF CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT, IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYTHING THAT'S LIKE MORE ENGAGING THAN SOMEBODY WHO'S YOUR BRAND AMBASSADOR ON SITE REPRESENTING YOU. SO WE THINK ABOUT THAT AS BASICALLY IN THAT CASE THE TECHNICIAN IS REALLY REPRESENTING YOU AND YOUR COMPANY. WE THINK A LOT ABOUT HOW DO WE EQUIP THAT TECHNICIAN, PUT THE RIGHT PERSON IN THE RIGHT PLACE WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS AND THEN THE RIGHT TOOL SET TO BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE THEY'RE REPRESENTING YOU AND YOUR BRAND. WE HAVE A LOT OF FOCUS ON THAT FROM AN ENGAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE. NOW, THERE'S SOME OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OBVIOUSLY TO MAKE ALL THAT HAPPEN AND MAKE IT WORK TOGETHER. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE THINK ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS AS THE NORTH POLE ON WHERE TO FOCUS DAY TO DAY.  THANKS, KYLE. WITH JUST TWO MINUTES LEFT I THINK WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS. IS THE NEW RELEASE OF THE OLD FIELD SERVICE APP OR IS THIS A COMPLETELY NEW APPLICATION THAT'S BEING RELEASED?  I THINK THE QUESTION RELATES TO THE MOBILE APPLICATION. THIS IS COMPLETELY NEW, THE NEXT GENERATION MOBILE APP AVAILABLE ON POWER APP. WE STILL SUPPORT OUR CURRENT CAPABILITY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND THERE WILL BE COMMUNICATIONS COMING OUT ON THAT AT THE END OF THIS WEEK BUT THIS IS THE FUTURE NEXT GENERATION BUILT ON POWER APP. THANKS, KYLE. OUR LAST QUESTION WILL GO TO HECTOR. IS THERE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN A REMOTE ASSIST ASSET PACKAGE FOR UNITY FOR ENTERPRISES TO DO THEIR KCU CUSTOMIZATION OF REMOTE ASSIST?  AT THE MOMENT IT'S BEING PACKAGED REVOLVING AROUND BEING ABLE TO CALL REMOTE ASSIST THROUGH OTHER APPLICATIONS BUT WE SEE REMOTE ASSIST AS A FIRST PARTY APP FROM A SOFTWARE SERVICE STANDPOINT. WITH THAT, I THINK WE HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT. WE REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT. WE DEFINITELY ENJOYED THE SESSION A LOT. IT'S PROVEN THAT ANYTHING CAN BE CONQUERED IF THERE'S A WILL TO DO IT. WE'LL BE SHARING THE SLIDES. I HOPE EVERYBODY CAN STAY HEALTHY AND STAY GOOD, AND THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR LISTENING AND WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME. THANK YOU ALL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      MY PACKS IS POWER APPS. THAT'S WHAT INSPIRES DENNY. OH, ACCELERATORS FOR PARTNERS.  ARE ACCELERATORS JUST FOR PARTNERS? THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. ADAM, CAN YOU TAKE THIS ONE? ACTUALLY, NO. I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL FIND OUT THOUGH AND RESPOND. PERFECT. THANK YOU.  HERE'S ANOTHER ONE, WE USE HEALTH PANES TO ASSIST USERS. CAN YOU EMBED A POWER VIRTUAL AGENT IN THE POWER APPS HELP PANE? YES, YOU CAN. GOOD NEWS FOR EVERYONE. YOU CAN EMBED A POWER APP BY SHARING IT. SO YOU SHARE IT AND ADD IT WITHIN HELP PANES, WITHIN YOUR POWER APPS PORTAL, LOTS OF PLACES. WHAT WE RECOMMEND YOU DO IS BUILD A POWER VIRTUAL AGENT THAT CAN RUN ANYWHERE, THAT CAN RUN ON YOUR COMPANY'S WEBSITE, IN SO MANY PLACES. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE COMMENTING RIGHT NOW.  SHOUTOUT TO DENNY IN THE FAR RIGHT CORNER THERE, MY PASSION IS POWER APPS. HOW HAS THE USER VOICE SEGMENT CHANGED THE WAY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY AND SOMETIMES COMPLETELY SCRAPE OFF THE IDEA BECAUSE CUSTOMERS ARE NOT USING THAT MUCH? I CAN ANSWER THIS ONE AND I'LL DO IT AS QUICKLY AS I CAN. THE USER VOICE EXPERIENCE HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED HOW WE'RE DOING POWER PLATFORM. WE IMPLORE YOU TO SHARE YOUR IDEAS, FEEDBACK, AND WE REALLY DO LISTEN. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT IN POWER AUTOMATE WE HAVE DELIVERED 60 OF THE IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED AND PLANNED. TO ANSWER THAT, IT IMPACTS IT IN A MASSIVE WAY. I WANT TO SHOW A BIG KUDOS TO EVERYBODY WHO'S CONTRIBUTING. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T, PLEASE JOIN IN. WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.  ELIZA, I HEAR YOU HAVE A GREAT STORY TO SHARE WITH US. WHAT'S GOING ON IN NEW ZEALAND? FOR OUR NEXT TRANSFORMATION TALE, I HAD A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE MICROSOFT TEAMS WITH ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS, JOE, ABOUT HIS INTRODUCTION TO THE POWER PLATFORM AT A MICROSOFT EVENT IN THE NETHERLANDS. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.  I WASN'T FEELING FULFILLED IN MY CURRENT ROLE AT THE TIME AND I WANTED SOMETHING NEW. I WANTED -- I WAS CODING A LOT AND I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING MORE CREATIVE AND VISUAL AND INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE. I WAS QUITE SHY SO I WAS QUITE NERVOUS TO DO THAT BUT I WENT TO A MICROSOFT EVENT AND GOT TO MEET LOADS OF AMAZING PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT PUSHED ME TOWARDS LOOKING AT THE POWER PLATFORM. I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT DRAG AND DROP WAS GOING TO REPLACE WHAT I SPENT HOURS AND HOURS OF MY DAY DOING. I GOT HOOKED. I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW EASY IT WAS TO ACTUALLY DO AUTOMATION WITH JUST DRAG AND DROP. FROM THERE I'VE BEEN LEARNING AND LEARNING AND LEARNING. I'M NOW ALSO PRESENTING TO PEOPLE, 30 PEOPLE AT A TIME AND TEACHING HOW TO USE THESE SYSTEMS. IF YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT LAST YEAR, I NEVER WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT. IT'S ALL THANKS TO ME STARTING WITH THE POWER PLATFORM. I'VE GROWN AS A PERSON AS WELL AS MY SKILL SET. I REALLY LOVE THAT. I LOVE HOW JOE HAS TRANSFORMED HIS CAREER WITH A POWER PLATFORM. HE'S NOW A SENIOR POWER PLATFORM SOLUTIONS DEVELOPER BASED IN VANCOUVER. JOHN, OVER TO YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THIS HITS HOME WITH YOU. YOU MET JOE IN THE NETHERLANDS. YEAH. THAT STORY IS SPECIAL FOR ME. SHOUTOUT TO JOE. IF YOU DON'T KNOW JOE, YOU SHOULD FOLLOW HIM. LIKE HE SAID, HE NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD BE TEACHING BUT HE'S A GREAT TEACHER AND YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT HIS STUFF. ANOTHER STORY, I RECENTLY HAD THE CHANCE TO SIT DOWN WITH JAMES, VICE PRESIDENT OF SALES OPERATIONS AT C. H. ROBINSON AND HE SHARED THAT THEY HAD IMPLEMENTED DYNAMICS 365 AND WHAT AN IMPACT IT WAS HAVING ON THEIR BUSINESS. I THINK YOU'LL ALL FIND THIS VERY INTERESTING.  JAMES, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME THIS MORNING AT THE BUSINESS PLACES SUMMIT. TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT C. H. ROBINSON AND YOUR ROLE.  WE'RE A GLOBAL LOGISTICS PLATFORM WITH ROUGHLY 200, 000 COMPANIES THAT INTERFACE WITH OUR PLATFORM. I LOOK AFTER OUR TECHNOLOGY AND PROCESSES AND HOW THEY IMPACT OUR CUSTOMER. WE HAVE ABOUT 15, 000 EMPLOYEES AROUND THE WORLD AND WITHIN THAT WE'VE GOT FIVE DIFFERENT OPERATING DIVISIONS THAT ALLOW US TO GO TO MARKET AND BRING THE LARGEST GLOBAL SUITE OF SERVICES. WHAT WERE SOME OF BIG GOALS YOU HAD? MICROSOFT HELPED US TAKE A COUPLE STEPS BACK AND ASSESS WHERE WE ARE TODAY. WITH THAT THEY HELPED US COLLABORATIVELY PUT TOGETHER AN RLI WHICH POINTED TO A HUGE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TRANSFORM OUR PROCESSES, PEOPLE, HOW WE DO THESE THINGS. THEY HAD TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR US OVER A MULTIPLE YEAR STANDPOINT. A YEAR INTO IT WE'VE GOT 3, 000 PEOPLE ON THE TOOL. THE OTHER EXCITING PART IS WE EXPECTED ABOUT A 17-MONTH RETURN TO GET TO THE BLACK AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET THERE IN 11 MONTHS. I KNOW WE'RE IN THE 90 USAGE.  I UNDERSTAND THAT KRFRNLTS H. ROBINSON IS AN ESSENTIAL BUSINESS DURING THIS COVID LOCKDOWN TIME AND YOU GUYS ARE DEVELOPING A BUNCH OF SOLUTIONS TO HELP DEAL WITH THAT. WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED IN ON MAKING SURE WE CAN HELP DELIVER THOSE ESSENTIAL GOODS, WHETHER THAT'S PPE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN REAL TIME AND HELP GET ESSENTIAL THINGS ON THE STORE SHELVES.  WHAT DO YOU SEE FOR C. H. ROBINSON AS YOU LOOK AHEAD? WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OUR INTEGRATION WITH MICROSOFT I THINK IT'S THE BEGINNING. WE'VE LAID AN AWESOME FOUNDATION. OUR ABILITY TO PUT POWER BI PLATFORM AND DASH BOARDS ON TOP OF THE PLATFORM IN 365, WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A HUGE ADVANTAGE OF INTELLIGENCE, NOT JUST DATA ENTRY. WE'RE TURNING THAT TABLE INTO A SALES ENABLEMENT TOOL WHERE OUR SELLERS GET BETTER INTELLIGENCE ON WHAT TO DO NEXT AND HOW TO DO IT AND WE HAVE SOME AWESOME POWER APPS. IT'S THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AS WE TALK ABOUT DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, HELPING OUR ACCOUNT MANAGERS DO THEIR JOB BETTER. WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF THAT AND PUSHING HARD WITH THE HELP OF MICROSOFT TO REINVENT OUR PROCESSES AND TAKE THAT AUTOMATION AS FAR AS WE CAN TO MAKE THE JOB EASIER FOR OUR PEOPLE SO THEY CAN DO A BETTER JOB FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.  WOW. JAMES REALLY HAD SO MUCH GREAT THINGS TO SAY. I LOVE HOW HE TALKED ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN C. H. ROBINSON AND MICROSOFT. DONNA, IT IS TIME NOW FOR YOU TO REVEAL OUR NEXT FAB FIVE APP. SO THE NEXT FIVE FAB APP IS COMING IN AT NUMBER THREE AND I THINK IT'S THE BEST ONE. HERE'S WHY, BECAUSE IT AFFECTS EVERY ONE OF US. IT AFFECTS ME ALL THE TIME. IT IS CALLED WASH IT BY OUR WONDERFUL COMMUNITY MEMBER MARA. SHE CREATED AN APP CALLED WASH IT TO REMEMBER WHAT IS PROPER CLEANING TREATMENT OF HER CLOTHES. UNLIKE -- PROBABLY JUST LIKE ALL OF YOU, SHE CUT THE WASHING TAGS OUT OF HER CLOTHES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SCRATCHY AND ANN ANNOYING. THEN SHE HAD NO CLUE HOW TO WASH EACH ITEM. SHE TAKES EVERYTHING IN HER CLOSET AND THE APP DETECTS WHAT THAT ITEM IS AND SHOWS HER THE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO WASH IT. SHE ALSO TAKES A PICTURE OF ALL THE WASHING TAGS BEFORE SHE TOSSES IT AND IT DETECTS THE SYMBOLS AND WHAT EACH ONE MEANS BECAUSE NO ONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT THAT DO NOT DRY CLEAN SYMBOL IS. WE'RE LIKE, DON'T CHASE ELEPHANTS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. IT MEANS DON'T DRY CLEAN. SHE ADMITS IT'S CRAZY BUT I THINK IT'S GENIUS.  AWESOME. IT'S TIME AGAIN FOR OUR NEXT ROUND OF GIVEAWAYS. WE'VE HANDED OUT FOUR ALREADY. WE ONLY HAVE SIX MORE TO GO BUT THE NEXT TWO GIFT BOXES WERE JUST SNAGGED. CONGRATULATIONS TO DAVID AND NAM D DY. IF YOU WOULD LIKE A CHANCE TO WIN, POST A COMMENT OR CONTENT USING #M #MSBIZAPPSSUMMIT. DAVID'S IN NIGERIA, JUST SAYING. WE'VE GOT THREE $100 GIFT CARDS FROM THE MICROSOFT STORE TO GIVE AWAY IN THE SOCIAL HOUR. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SHARE WITH US THE WORD THAT BEST DESCRIBES WHAT DRIVES YOU AND YOUR WORK. WRITE DOWN YOUR INSPIRINGRD WINDOW -- WORD ON A CARD. SHARE WITH US ON TWITTER WITH THE #MSBIZAPPSSUMMIT. YOU SEE PEOPLE WINNING, YOU WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM. IF YOU MISSED A SESSION AND YOU WANT TO REMEMBER, THEY WILL BE ON DEMAND LATER TODAY. THE LIVE SESSIONS ARE BEGINNING NOW AND WE WILL SEE YOU BACK HERE VERY SOON IN JUST ABOUT 30 MINUTES. I'M SUPER EXCITED MYSELF.  GOOD
