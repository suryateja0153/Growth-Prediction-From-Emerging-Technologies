 [Music] hello everyone and uh thanks for joining us this is episode four of the better products podcast and i'm really excited about this podcast because we decided to try something a little bit different we have an employee of tapecon a long-standing employee dave shoemaker joining us and i'll just give i'll give a quick title intro for dave and then uh dave i'll let you kind of introduce yourself on your own and tell us about yourself but dave schumacher senior manufacturing and r d engineer at tapecon he's been with us for a long time capital l or all capitals on the long long so dave i'll let you say say the big number but uh thanks for being on the podcast dave and trying something new because up to this point you know i've been interviewing some suppliers of our raw materials and i think this is going to be an interesting um episode because it's going to bring a little bit more i'd say internal perspective um from tape account so i'll let you i'll stop talking and just dave tell us about yourself and your role at tapecon you know and thank you steve but um one one fun thing that i look at is every time i look out the front window i was actually born right across on his right and that was in 1960 so i i'm a long founding member of the area so that's kind of a fun thing to play with anyways it was uh 1983 when i started for tape gun we had uh i believe it was 17 employees at the time and uh my capabilities that i brought here was die cutting and i worked in the die cutting department for about three years but i always had a strong passion for all the capabilities that tapecon had and they had a lot even at that time and i think your father sought his passion within me and before too long i found myself dabbling in all the capabilities takedown had to offer and as i learned i became the go-to guy for new opportunities i often find myself at the crossroads of the customer or prospects needs and tape cons capabilities it's my job to figure out how to combine suppliers materials and tape gun manufacturing processes to achieve the desired outcome you know you've been with us for such a long time and and you've seen the evolution kind of through the organization of all the different capabilities coming in and out but you know that when that new opportunity comes in from a brand owner it's like okay um that initial kind of review of it i mean we can't say yes to everything i mean sometimes things come in here and they're just not you know what i mean and so sometimes you know i kind of joke sometimes we have a yes problem at tapecom where we always say yes to a lot of things and we probably don't say no enough but but that whole crossroads of like when do we decide to pursue it when we don't decide to pursue it so i wanted to just kind of like frame this conversation and introduce the concept of manufacturing readiness levels or technology readiness levels however you there's a couple different ways to think of it but that concept has been brought to me um really it you know doing research on it of course it started back in 2005 department of defense brought this in but where it where i started getting proposed to trl mrl like levels was some of our engagement with some of the startup community or some of the universities have started to use uh reference to manufacturing readiness levels i'll say how to how to place the level of maturity of an opportunity in a continuum in saying like okay what do they need what stage are they in and we started to use this terminology in our company and i know that you've started to use the terminology too or at least it's a way to communicate internally and or um with the with the opportunity coming at us on where to place them so i just wanted to kind of frame that and so given that concept of manufacturing readiness level terminology and the fact that you're really like i'll say the front lines of the technical feasibility side of the opportunities and whether we say yes um how do you i guess how do you assess those opportunities when they come in the door well the the best way is just sitting down and having that conversation i mean i like when you know the sales people will set up a a meeting where the customer actually comes here sees their facility and then they have an actual either a sample with them or they have some blueprints or something that they a discussion point if you will um and you know it's really great to get into all the details that i have you know identifying what they're looking for with regards to materials how this is going to be manufactured what the possibility of maybe even packaging we have some to where we have to get packaging involved as well we use outsourcing partners to do that but you know we get it done we we you know we have uh that competency and that availability to uh meet all their needs so yes i like bringing the customer in here and um actually having that sit down upfront conversation with them virtually now we have to do it you know virtually and unfortunately with this epidemic but um in the past i mean it was good to have that face to face that handshake you know of acceptance on all the things that we've done you know i gotta mention that you do lose a lot of the detailed stuff that you can show a customer you know of how how things go through the press or how how this will happen and they really get a better understanding when they're there first hand actually able to see it and you're right sometimes you can't capture that virtually um so yeah it's it's unfortunate but we're getting through it well it's going to be interesting where the technology goes i mean because it's going to accelerate you know the use of whatever you know augmented reality virtual reality like hey i'm going to walk you virtually over here let's take a look how your process is going to run i mean who knows i mean we're obviously exploring a lot of those types of technologies right now and all i can think of is that this pandemic's just going to accelerate them so i'll move on to the next question because obviously i know there's a lot we want to get to but um when you talk about or when when i talked about the continuum like it can be really early really late in that mrl uh readiness levels how early are you have you seen people approach us and up how early in that manufacturing readiness level have people come to us well i would have to say very early because um i remember one project i think it was right around 2004 uh it was a actual walk-in off the street um it was um a gentleman looking for a uh a company that could guide him along he had two plastic housings that he was trying to connect and they had to be connected in a sterilized environment but he didn't want to use a sterile sterile room to do it he wanted the part to be self sterile to be contained um in a sterile environment and it was kind of challenging to listen at so he was searching for a company that can help him advance this his readiness his product readiness level um he was like i said he was looking for us to connect these two plastic housings but still keep that sterilization of the contact points in check um this construction was used for a medical fluid transfer device and it was kind of kind of unique to the industry i had never seen anything like it and um before too long we had the conversation and uh we talked about the material choices that were available for him and we talked about what the functionality was and as he was talking to him drawing pictures and all this stuff and uh before too long we had a proof uh that penis level and uh granted he he he was very um overwhelmed by these uh prototypes and uh he decided to move forward with us and uh we worked through all the uh technology and materials and i'm very happy to say that you know this is a product that we are making quite a few products on a monthly basis every day we're making this product still today i mean yeah when i was looking at like this the manufacturing readiness levels you know an mrl 4 is like that lab laboratory environment proof of concept prototype but then when you get up to an mrl5 we're into more like a production relevant of a component of that material and if you're telling me i'm just listening you tell the story it sounds like it's like a napkin sketch on a piece of paper that's exactly where this thing started which uh obviously it seems like i would put that you know almost mrl3 into mro4 because we haven't even made anything yet other than just it's almost a conceptual idea at that point but i mean he must have at least had he must have conceptualized what that proof of concept should consist of and then from there um it sounds like we just kind of i don't know you know in a lab scale either cutting with scissors on raw materials or whatever be able to manifest itself into that initial proof of concept prototype how how crude was it no actually what he had he had the actual plastic fittings that he was trying to connect and he said that what he wanted to end up with how it was packaged it was shrink wrapped around the housing and he wanted these things these two connections or these two plastic housings to be already connected together with just the ports that come out that connect the hose to it because again it's for fluid transfer but the points of contact had to be kept in check with being sterile at all times so we developed and i can't talk about the process in details but we developed a method that was able to encompass that and he he called it after i sent him the sample he says you um what did you say you made the first portable clean room thank you very much it's like let's move on he says i'm not going anywhere else let's let's get this going and he got pretty excited over it and uh like i said um this just evolved and we finally made it he took it to market and um you know like i said we're still making a lot of product today so let's talk about i guess the persona of the of that i'll say inventor for like a better term who's who's approaching us in their early stage in this readiness level and and the individual that's coming in you know are they're going to have a big wide array of experiences and backgrounds i mean we've had people approach us for projects that are you know straight out of either in university or straight out of university with very little work experience in the real world and therefore you know that's what they bring and other people you know been in the industry or been in manufacturing 20 30 years and they kind of they're much more prepared so how do you um i guess tailor the approach that you take when you take that initial phone call so our sales team has identified this we've evaluated this as an opportunity worth pursuing you're usually tapped on the shoulder when it's time to kind of look into technical feasibility of it but how do you tailor your approach based on i guess who's in front of you and what their level of experience is well it's usually you know the customer is um usually the one that i'm talking to but it really depends on who the customer is and what what um resources they have because many times i like to talk to the you know if they have a engineering team that's helping them develop this i like talking directly to the person that's going to be building this forum because then we get greater details on you know what it's going to take to to end up with a good result and um you know that that brings me back to another project that i was working on where it was a um some college graduates that came to us uh looking for they they developed this chemistry that they were trying to get it out on the market and it what it was used for is if you can get it onto a material it would identify when uh sun worshipers needed to reapply suntan lotion and he they seen a need for it and they did a lot of research in fact they won numerous awards out of canada and the us for this invention of this chemistry the only problem that they struggled with was how do they make it work how do they put it on a material how do they apply it to a person's body so that it can when sun hits it it says hey i need to you need to change your or need to add some suntan lotion and so they came to tape con with us to with that challenge and you know we we talked them through it and we you know found out what this chemistry was all made up of and we used partnerships with other companies that had coding capabilities of putting this uh chemistry onto a piece of material well there was more to it than that they wanted an adverse mint of their you know their product name and and different uh media on this stuff so we were not only able to um make this product so that it was um feasible to put different names on it if he wanted to promote some other technology some suntan lotion company he could sell that right off uh to use that prop to use their product to these companies so we developed a process that was able to not only have that substance coded on the material but then we were able to convert it into a easy to use peel and stick onto skin and they use it now for and they're using it throughout the world i hear you know he tells me different countries that he's uh applying this to and selling it to and it's uh virtually throughout the world so kudos to them on doing a great job with developing this chemistry and uh we were just able to help in their you know their manufacturing process i want to unpack i guess the flow of information like you're describing you know you're telling the story and i'm thinking about what type of information is presented you know that they're coming with presenting you with and sometimes that information i'm sure is incomplete or there's the wrong questions are being asked so what type of information exchange is happening between you and a company like this in the early onset of these of these projects and i guess what can you glean what can you glean from that or what are you providing them to help them along the way if they need help well actually you know i'm looking for you know as i said i we sit down and we have that face-to-face conversation that's all it is just like we're having right now and they're telling me about the details of you know what they're looking for um are they wanting this product to last outside what their environmental conditions might be um are there any regulatory issues that we need to be concerned about uh um there's there's a multitude of different things we have stuff that goes on cars i mean you can you name an industry and we're in it and um you know it's it's kind of difficult to list every every type of situation but because there's so many different questions to ask but i mean how many people are coming with blueprints without blueprints what would be the ideal thing for someone to come with us you know we've talked about detailed design packages and what does that constitute but i guess in a perfect world what are they what are they bringing um to that initial meeting in that face-to-face meeting well what we hope to see is uh blueprints or any conceptual sample that they have um and it could be just a crude scissor cut out on paper type thing just so that we can get a better understanding of what they're looking for and what the end products going to what they're trying to achieve with that um and yes we have you know over the years we have developed an application capture form that you know it it has intentional questions on it that helps us determine uh what the customer needs and where their technology and manufacturing levels are um so it's there's more to it than just that list i mean it depends on what stage they're going through i mean just like you know some customers come through it come to us where there's it's it's a development stage like i said about the suntan lotion guy um the group came to us and um you know we needed to provide provide them with training uh the pros and cons of different materials different adhesives how what what works on skin what can peel off without affecting the uh a young person's skin versus an older person's skin versus a child or a baby's skin and we needed to train them and teach them on that and um you know they needed to fully understand and we needed to fully understand their expectations you know like i said what environment is it going to be exposed to you know heat plays a lot and that uv plays a lot on materials and can really affect the uh quality and the performance of it so you know we need to teach them you know um you know what what actually is going to happen once they give us this order we brought them in here and actually went through step by step what our manufacturing process was going to be and that's why i said it's great to have the customer actually in here because then you can get into a lot more details of where when and how these things are going to happen um that's you know like i said that it's only during the development stage but then you get into there's different stages you know such as the introduction state uh introduction stage um the customer might have a product that's already developed but they just don't understand how to build it and they need to find a facility that can show them or either guide them through um you know either manufacturing themselves or maybe even using other vendors to you know do a team approach on manufacturing their their products then you know you get into the further developed ones where you have the growth stage and that's where we really shine i think uh because uh this is where they're looking for volume requirements they want someone that can provide you know a lot of product in a certain amount of time and get it done and get it on the shelf and um that's where they come to us and we you know we developed that partnership with them and um you know it works out very well um then later on in the in their growth stage they get into a more mature area where a lot of times they're just looking for okay we need to save money we need to cut down costs and uh look for ways and methods of doing that uh but we go beyond that a lot of times sometimes they're looking for a another solution or maybe they need a branding idea that will help set their product apart from others and make people look at theirs in a different light you know um they might even be you know looking for and i've seen it happen to where uh they want someone to manage their overall process their overall product because they need to focus on looking at new products or maybe new or upgrading their their current product and and to develop new opportunities and um you know that's where we like guiding them is to help help grow with the customer we want we want to become part of the customer's team yeah it's like as you're talking about this i'm just thinking about from a product manager standpoint so the people that we're serving you know every product that's being sold has a life cycle like you're you're in a life cycle you're launching it for the first time i'd love to major by the way i'd love to wave a wand and have every opportunity come and be in a growth phase that'd be nice right because all of our problems are like how do we scale this up and sell uh sell massive quantities of these things but then there's growth then there's maturity and then you know maybe they have to retire a project or retire and replace it so i guess listening to you talk i'm just thinking about how you you you kind of have a radar on what stage that product's in which then might change i guess how you how you treat it right questions might change different questions right so it's kind of like adapting to what stage the life cycle or what what stage of the product life cycle's in might depend on it might change the various types of questions that we're asking or handle it differently right oh absolutely absolutely a lot of people seem to be looking for cost downs can you speak more i guess to that cost reduction opportunity where someone's coming in maybe we've been either we've been making it maybe a competitor's making it and for whatever reason they found their way to our doorstep how do you um i'd like to hear more about that in terms of costs down seem to be everyone wants to cut costs so how to how do we approach those types of opportunities that come in where it's i'll say i'd say it's a mature product if i'm going to put it in a life cycle it's mature and they want to milk as much margin out of that product no no future plans for any major redesign of the product but let's just improve margin that's the business objective so let's talk about uh cost reduction how do we handle those situations well in many cases we have to look at the overall product um is there is there any room for or is it conceivable to make changes to let's say materials in a lot of cases many things are sometimes and i i don't know if i should say this but they're overbuilt you get a group of engineers together that over build something they put a dimension and tolerance behind things that are not only uh really odd and unconceivable but it just doesn't really work for that product and you know we'll have a conversation with the customer about those topics and about those issues looking for ways to cut costs um there might be you know dies that are related can we go with a less expensive uh as an i'll talk out solid a solid die versus a a a a mag tool which is a thin thin plate that we use that's a that's a big cost savings right there if we can change that that aspect of the manufacturing process but we also like i said we look into different materials we look at volume structures are they you know willing to and are they capable of taking a larger volume and putting it on shelves for future use because you know everything is based on materials materials have a cost to them and as well as customers have to get from us we have to buy from our suppliers the minimum buys on materials and that's where we you know we have to buy what they call master roles and whatever the case may be uh but there's volumes that we have to uphold to and uh you know we have to have it come out of our pocket we have to purchase these materials so in essence we have to pass that cost on in order to make money and keep and keep everybody profitable the brand owner can be their own worst enemy it's like everyone wants to over you know the default of any engineer is is conservatism especially if the risks that they face is is a product is a you know they're the ones who have to deal with the defect or whatever and i understand that people want repeatability and they want to reduce variation and and and and everyone wants would love you know really tight and high or i should say really high number uh process capability numbers and cpk numbers but how do you have that conversation where where um you know the the tolerances they could become their own worst enemy and so what what can we share or what's that dialogue like to try to open up a tolerance well we ask them you know where is this actually being used and the discussion point gets into you know how critical are those you know for this application a lot of times they're just putting a label on it as a um they're putting their name on the product to to claim fame to owning this pr this product and they'll have a you know they might have a textured area but then they have a smooth area that's recessed in and they want that to fit that label or that part to fit down into that recessed area and it'll give us a tolerance of plus or minus 5 000 so it's like are you kidding me you when you put it on there you can't see those edges of that recessed area it could be a sixteenth off and you'd known a regular consumer would never see the the difference however you know we hold much tighter tolerances than that um our tolerances our baseline tolerances you know ten thousands we hold all day long that's without baton and i um we do hold much tighter uh tolerances than that but um you know it it all depends on the application where these things are going how they're going to be what the performance of them need to be and um you know what's the end product going to look like and how it's going to perform yeah it's like any one of these all these considerations we could head down rabbit holes discussing the details of every single one of them spend four hours talking about this but um so i'll try to i'll try to get this into somewhat of a wrap up but i mean i think i think obviously just the ex the exploration of these new opportunities that come in and um all the considerations or questions that we're asking placing them in a maturity level and then i guess giving our audience kind of a perspective our perspective in terms of being the manufacturer where um what we're thinking about as those are coming through the door so any final uh parting words dave or any um words of wisdom that you want to impart on the audience as far as the conversation that we've had well you know you we we talk about you know incoming new customers and you know it's all part of you know taking care of the customers that we do have because it's not it's not a a smooth flight once they develop and once we develop a relationship with them and we have a product that we're building it it's not a smooth flight all the time uh in fact one of the customers that we currently have um they came to us with an issue one time where they were having some problems with the materials that we were supplying them that they called out it wasn't the material that we suggested to them they called out the material that we were using and they were having some shorting issues that it was an electronic component that it was shielding and the materials that was being used they found out through testing on their behalf that it was a shorting issue of and it was something that i never heard of or never thought that it could even do this but outgassing of the of the material was causing this short and i was like i was intrigued because i this is a new thing for me which i learn every day in this job this is awesome to have something like this but and steve i'm telling you uh we we've did probably 30 40 different samples of these different materials that they brought in and every one of them failed well before too long they said they reached out and they said hey tape con you're and i hear this all the time you guys are the experts you can make you can make something stick the water you know tell us how and um so they reached out to us and asked us if uh we could help them uh find the material well after uh many trials are after many uh conversations that we've had with vendors and uh communication with the customer and testing uh we finally found a solution for them and i'm happy to say that our manufacturing first of services are now firing on mars it's i find that just amazing um you know to talk to somebody about the different applications that we get into i remember when i first started here uh i remember telling people yeah we make bumper stickers that you go in and it's like bumper stickers now are you kidding me uh we make stuff that's going out in space and on different planets um this is like a whole new concept the whole revelation of different things coming to and making tapecon available to that was it's unbelievable i just gotta say that you know it's been a real uh treat to start out where tapecon started and seeing the growth potential that or the growth that actually happened that incurred during my time here and it's just been overwhelming to be on to be honest with you it's been a great experience um i've learned a ton of things and still am learning even though i've been here for 37 years i'll walk out in the floor after this meeting and i'll learn something new today it's it's that it's that's what i find so exciting about this job in this and this place that's awesome dave i appreciate you sharing that because you know you've uh you've been in the role for a while and you've seen a lot of different things but obviously just listening and you talk you got the energy coming out like i'm fired up just listening just listening to your talk so i appreciate you sharing all that and uh thanks for being on the podcast i mean it was uh pretty you know it wasn't really sure where it was gonna go but i'm glad we had a chance to talk about a whole bunch of different things and um so i guess um i guess we'll wrap it up here so thanks again dave for being on the podcast and for everyone listening i hope you enjoyed it and uh stay tuned for the next one so uh that's it signing off thanks everyone hey thank you take care you
