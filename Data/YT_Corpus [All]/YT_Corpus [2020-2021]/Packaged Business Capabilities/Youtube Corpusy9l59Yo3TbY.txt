 [Music] hi i'm mike woods group president of haskell's consumer packaged goods group we're an epc contractor focused on food and beverage beverage alcohol and consumer product space i first met csi when i was seeking out the vendor for pipe type all i needed was somebody to sell me more of the silicone wall discussions and what i found was a company that was capable of so much more it's a culture of tremendous doers reinforced by a poster in the lobby by their founder indicating that they will do what they said they were going to do we've used them to custom build skids and unit operations for us and they do that to machinist precision they're also vendors to many of the components that we use in our cpg projects and we look forward to doing business with them repeatedly due to their customer service and the broad breadth of what they offer they also have installation teams that are ready to go and implement solutions at project sites for customers we're happy that csi's a partner and we look forward to doing more work with them in the future
