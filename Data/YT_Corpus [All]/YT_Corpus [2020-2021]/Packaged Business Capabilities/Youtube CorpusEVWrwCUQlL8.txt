 welcome friends my name is grameet kohindi i go by gg i'm a product manager in google databases product team today i'll be talking about bare metal solutions and how bmw solutions enable all our enterprises to bring all their workloads closer to gcp regardless if the workloads were written for a cloud native environment or not as you know most of our enterprises that we work with are planning to move to a public cloud environment not only that gartner surveyed a lot of these enterprises and they came to a conclusion that 80 percent of these enterprises will move out of their own operated data centers by 2025. a lot of you are already in the journey of moving out of your current infrastructure to a cloud based environment either in a public cloud setting or in a private cloud setting what are the key migration and modernization challenges that most of our enterprise customers face first and foremost owning and operating the infrastructure was a big differentiator for a lot of the enterprises 20 years ago but given the advances that we have in current silicon technology whether it's compute or storage or networking the differentiation owning and operating your infrastructure brings in is fairly low to your business secondly most enterprises want to embrace the mythology of developing applications in cloud whether it would be agile development models whether it would be absorbing new technologies like artificial intelligence and ml at a much much quicker phase or whether it be adapting a very different way a devops different way a driven way of running it but where the complexity comes in is how do you marry these two different concepts and this is where google cloud steps in our goal is to meet you where you are to be a partner in creating a migration strategy that lets you run what you want where you want how you want take your investment in your current assets and gradually roll them out into the best available platform for them in a public cloud our goal here is to reduce your risk reduce your costs at the same time maintaining an agility to bring your mission-critical workloads as close as to google cloud and modernize from there on we believe this to be a three-step journey first all the workflows that you run today which are not written to run in the cloud native environment remove them as is by moving them as is we reduce our risk it takes to come run in near a public cloud environment second we also divert your investment in rather retuning your application your existing applications to run the existing legacy applications to run in a public cloud environment rather taking that investment to modernize those applications to run natively in a public cloud environment third in this approach you we believe not only you can do this at a much reduced cost with a much reduced uh risk but at the same time we can speed up your journey to migration to cloud and each application will have its own unique journey each application has its unique business value to you as a customer and we understand that and we are here to support the unique journey per application some of them will lift and shift from on premises and stay in cloud as is some of them will have to modernize before they can be lift and ship some of them might have to be rewritten in a cloud native format google cloud provides option for all these pads with your business goals being central to or in in our minds let's see how bare metal solutions and uh play a role in solving these problems but before we go there let's define and let's try to characterize what those challenges are first majority of your mission critical applications run on forward on databases that were not natively written for cloud same time they are the pieces of applications that runs the core of your business have a very high impact on how your business runs today second they are really complex in their own requirements they have been written over the years they have a good have a plethora of combinations of off-the-shelf apps and the apps that were within homegrown the apps that have contributions for decades by your engineers and other engineers so migrating such apps or retargeting these and these apps need careful attention and that's where google cloud comes in uh in addition some of these apps also might have very stringent hardware requirements the type of hardware there the particular software vendors will certify and these apps will have to run on those hardware and here also bare metal comes in and solves the problem by providing a certified hardware to run your applications but what's the crux of this uh this this challenge is the interoperability of between your various databases various mid tiers where applications uh have is also a challenge in many cases a lot of our customers don't even have a full view of how intertwined their application estate is with the database estate we cannot modernize just one without also paying careful detailed attention to the other this care kept in mind we develop bare metal solutions which provides you the best platform to migrate all your legacy and complex apps which are difficult to modernize as close as to cloud and then on a step-by-step gradual manner take this applications and migrate them and modernize them in a cloud native environment wherever it's possible let's see what google bay metal solutions offer you the key text of the context of diameter solutions is a ability to offer purpose-built hardware a lot of software vendors and a lot of operating system vendors have restrictions on the kind of hardware their applications can run on the kind of hardware that gives them the best maximum performance for their databases of applications so what we have done is taken the latest and the greatest the silicon industry has to offer marry it what what a certified soft hardware list for these specialized vendors would be and provide you in a setting in which is very close to gcp from a latency standpoint and you have all access to all your gcp services from this purpose-built hardware solution and vice versa so that you can move the data freely between the two at the same time your applications that are running in one way or the other do not see significant network the latency difference between the two as well we wrap this around a google managed billing and support services at the same time you contract with google for all your bare metal needs google is the only party you engage with google in turn in turn procures the latest and the greatest the hardware industry has to offer and provides that in the bare metal solution for you but you might ask what happens to all the investment that you have already made your existing database administrators themes system administrator dreams what happens to all this system integrators you have been working on over the years you can bring them as is to this environment for most power reasons this environment will look like a new hardware refresh to what you're already doing and you can pick and choose the pieces of infrastructure that you need to modernize move to cloud native or keep them in their map as your application needs dictates most techie air tech enthusiasts will say i will only believe this when i see diagram so i wanted to walk you through how the architecture looks like and also open the possibilities of what you can do with this architecture and how you can bring in some of the most complex workflows you run to this architecture two aspects of this on the right side what you see is a region extension this is a dedicated hardware hosting space which is connected with a low latency interconnected google cloud every entity in google cloud is able to access every entity in the region extension with latencies in most cases less than one milliseconds in in some cases less than two milliseconds from an application perspective or from a database perspective of a military perspective this all is exist it sits in one large networking construct and every application have access to every other entity running in this extension the three common design patterns that we see first is in some cases customers wants to run their packaged apps which only runs on certain certified hardware directly on a bare metal server second our customers have bring in their database and keep their applications in gcp and the database comes with their own internal tooling their own internal monitoring their own internal best practices they can bring the internal tooling and the database as is and run on the bare metal servers and connect seamlessly to the applications running in gcp the third design pattern we see the customer just comes with the database in such scenarios we provide an automation toolpak which makes the lifecycle of database managing a database much easier this automated toolpath is an open source contribution from google you can find that at github it's written in ansible it automates tasks like provisioning a database provisioning a backup provisioning a standby database and hence and so forth you can pick and choose the amount of automation you need you can modify this automation if you want some features to be added from us you can request that and we can do that as well net net we have uh the capability to emulate any design pattern that you have today and bring it and run it in region extensions for you one key aspect of any database enviro deployment is storage and we use state-of-the-art tier one storage i'll talk a little bit more about what all we do for storage and operating systems in this one key aspect for any software that runs in region extension is this it follows the bring your own license model you have root access to the servers you have root access to the database you uh google has no visibility on what kind of applications you're running on the bare metal servers but we do make the user's life easier by providing technologies like snapshots so for example today you might be running red hat linux in one of the bare metal server and then you probably have a hundred bare metal servers and you probably want to patch them at some point in time since all these servers are disk class and they all boot from a san all you have to do is take a snapshot of one of the golden images and then roll it across your entire fleet using the same snapshot hence lowering the amount of effort that you have to do spend on managing an operating system patch across your fleet the same model can be applied to applications running on top of these operating systems as well let's talk about what google provides as a service in this model and what's our customer responsibility here so in a high level construct we manage anything that has to do with the hardware so we provide uv facilities we provide the power cooling we provide the physical security we manage the network security we make sure all the break fix and smart hands is handled by us for you at the same time we also tune the storage for best application performance we have worked with industry standard vendors or industry leading vendors we have taken their best practices combined with the best practices of all the specialized software vendors and implemented that in the bare metal solution so when we provision a storage for you it has been auto-tuned for the next performance for that database or the application that you're planning to run on top of it it takes a big chunk of a of work that needed to be do needed to be done when you move from on-premises to the club again on being on the guiding principle here the migration to our service running in cloud our goal is to minimize your effort required to do so so that you can take that extra resources in modernizing those applications everything that runs in their mobile environment have access to all google services and top of that google takes care of support billing and and hardware monitoring tools let's talk about what's your responsibility i touched about the os configuration responsibility earlier the same applies to application installation configuration and management or automation tool pack helps it helps in that area for some database deployments and database management and database backup in dr at the same time we are able to emulate some of the most complex on-premises networks in our written extension which are plugged into the google interconnect so all your services appear as if they're running in a giant network construct and they can be accessed across the interconnect globally second when it comes to management we provide an sla driven service for infrastructure we managed everything that goes on with the infrastructure and anything that goes on with the application is managed by our customers you can work with google marketplace tools to help that experience that experience be more managed at the same time you can use your own system integrators to have this experience more managed for backup and recovery we do provide local storage for your instant restore backups at the same time the customers have full flexibility to have snapshots for their databases and applications as well i'll talk about that in a few minutes before we go discuss the details of what shapes we provide and what storage shape search properties we provide let's talk about what your support experience will be this is a google first party service google is responsible for this support first level support of what happens in the agent extension google is responsible for bare metal hardware your network your interconnect your security whether it be physical or be it network security we take care of facilities we provide you with smart hand support at the same time we have a collaborative support model with some enterprise applications and all operating system vendors in which we help our customers triage operating system issues and application issues at the same time this is a three nines sla infrastructure sla by google and we are accountable for that we also have solution guides that enable database workloads that takes that three nine slas and implement a four nine and a five nine service on top of that in addition to this we also provide consultative support for application debugging for example say your application or database has a particular issue and then you call google uh google support for helping you out with issue a consultative support team will look at the issue and provide you guidance what's the best logs you need to procure what's the best the metrics you need to procure so that you can work actively with your own storage with your own software provider and get to a root cause sooner than later it's a very unique operating model that we have and we have staff some of the brightest support teams when it comes to application support in this regard now let's take a deep look on what kind of bare metal servers we provide what's the storage flavors we offer and how they all work together and where the tuning happens so two basic category two broad category of servers uh small and medium which we think will be very useful for uh single high performance apps at the same time as as dev test systems and at the same time as cluster database systems of large and extra large machines to enable mission critical apps which have that kind of demand from the infrastructure one way we are very unique compared to any other public cloud vendor is we adapt the latest and the greatest silicon technology very soon it's released at the same time we offer full bare metal configurations with the highest memory to core density ratio why i'm talking about memory to code density ratio memory to core density ratio is very important when you talk about databases and applications the higher the ratio the more databases and the more applications you can run on the same server and that has an order of magnitude impact on the software licensing and software support you have to pay for that server not even to talk about the management benefits you get for managing a fewer amount of servers in a large monitor service today we have offered intel cascade link servers which are the latest that intel's office today and we'll keep our cadence as and when the new silicon technologies come on on them on the horizon one very unique offering to bare metal service solution is a four socket hundred and twelve core machines they offer contiguous 3 terabyte memory probably really for the most stringent database or application you have in your enterprise to be run right next to google cloud with all the cloud goodness for applications what really matters for the performance is how well the storage performs how well the storage handles linear scalability how well storage handles bottlenecks and how well storage handles noisy neighbors what we have done here has taken the best practices of our tier one storage vendor and the best practices of most operating systems and application vendors and incorporated them in this deployment model so when you provision and all nvme based storage in our environment it's a linear uh performance model as and then to add more storage you get more guaranteed or a short performance at a very low latency you can do hundreds and thousands of iaps well below one millisecond some things that transactional databases really like and some things that a lot of dba teams struggle and invest a lot to get that right level of tuning in bare metal solutions we take care of that for all of our customers a second thing that's very important for databases and applications is ability to restore your local backups quicker for that we offer in this construct all disk storage which is connected within the region so you do not have to go to an object storage access as you might have to do in other public clouds which you can access really really quickly in case of a disaster or in case of any rollback issues that you might have all these storage offerings are configured with automated snapshots automated snapshots are really helpful for databases and application tests there at the same time they're very helpful for data protection of the environment as well our storage has full connectivity to gcs that's google cloud storage you can move backups from all disks to cold here and near line tier in gcs and take full advantage or cost advantage of a public cloud storage uh platform in that regard you can also connect these database and application servers to applications running or analytics running in google cloud in this case google cloud analytics and google cloud will have direct low latency access to your transactional databases you can run ai ml models on top of your transactional databases in real time to make you to help you make better decisions the possibilities that you have with this architecture are endless we marry the best google cloud has to offer with the best silicon technology that exists there and make provide a very secure low latency offering all backed behind a google sla all these servers that we use here are disk class they all boot from uh network of network mounted storage their operating systems are also hosted in the network market storage there is no data that is persistent on these the servers hence makes the lifecycle management of the server very very efficient at the same time the network between the servers and the storage is configured by us the network between the servers and the gcp is also configured by google the network between the server and the application tier is also configured by uh by google now let's take a how will this architecture actually look in real life and how will your applications use this i'm using a very simplistic construct i'm sure your workloads are much more complex than this and our teams will be happy to simplify that your current architectures and and marry them with our design patterns what i'm showing here is a trusted database running in the region extension which is getting replicated using database native technology to another region extension so within the region extension the cluster database provides you high availability built on databases native capabilities at the same time it uses the google's networking backbone to replicate to the next region to another region and make sure you have the right dr strategy in place as well you can run your right heavy transaction workloads on one region extension and you can run your read heavy workloads on the other region extensions again using all database native technologies in both these constructs you have full access to a tool pack which you can use to manage the storage for the database install the database configure the backup for the database configure replication for the database do things like patching pre-checks for the database using the tool pack or or integrate the tool back in your existing uh tooling as well at the same time the applications running in google cloud they for them the database appears as if it's on the other applications of where it's running indian extension appears as if they're running within the google cloud construct enabling seamless development of new applications along your on top of your business critical data at the same time uh allowing you a chance to modernize your architecture at a piece by piece level and at a pace that makes the most sense for your business while controlling cost and managing risk the next natural question would be hey gg i heard a lot about this technology how can i consume this so today we are ga in five regions globally you we are available in frankfurt and london in europe we are available in los angeles and virginia in the us we are live in sydney and in apac so we have a complete truly global footprint and this footprint is expanding as we speak within this year we will have four more regions turned on one will be in singapore tokyo followed by netherlands and brazil south hollow develop with this with one thing in mind to meet our customers where they are whether it is their migration journey whether it's their modernization journey whether it's an ability to lift and shift their workloads or or whether it be the region which they are most active or most prevalent with that being said thank you for taking the time and listening to your talk it's it's always great to bring the latest innovation that we are creating in gcp and sharing it with our customers so thank you for your time and i'll look forward to talking to you soon
