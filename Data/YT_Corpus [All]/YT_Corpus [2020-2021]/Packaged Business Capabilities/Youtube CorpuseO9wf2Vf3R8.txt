it's been pleasure to be part of a microsoft uh premier ignite conference so thank you with this area my name is mudusudakar i'm the co-founder of isara the topic i want to talk to you is very near and dear to me it's about how we can help employees and users to handle their request in a self-service manner using microsoft teams and that's a topic that i want to share with you and our thoughts and our journey as we try to help customers and partners with this first the foremost the question is why invest in remote working environments how do we help employees right what is the role ai can play if it in a so i think before we started it's always important to understand what are the three reasons that this is going to really improve first you have to look for is a driving business reason is it going to help you increase your revenue or grow your business faster second is this going to help you create new business models or adopt innovative business ideas that will help drive you more revenue growth finally will it help you grow retain adopt and engage more users and consumers and employees in this way the objective has to put in one of these three pillars in my opinion and that's the reason i always tell customers and partners to figure out which of these solutions or problem or the pain points you want to solve with this let's look at also the challenges that remote working environments are posing to all of us right the first with the what happened with the covenant and going to be the new baseline going forward is the lack of self-service employees and users and customers are going to demand self-service for all their applications environment and business systems it's also increasing the number of requests that are going exponentially sometimes the wait times are going much longer right people are making these requests and they want to get the job done and remember all the systems are designed for human consumption most enterprise systems are dependent on humans you have to make these systems consumed by people users and services in a self-service manner using ai and machine learning finally the costs are going up due to lack of hyper automation and ai so these are the some of the challenges that our customers and partners have been talking to us during this networking challenges time with this how can we solve this problem i think the solution to this is by using ai and automation first is if you can leverage those two technologies to solve users able to enable users with virtual assistant that will be great that will empower users they can get their job second is use a an automation to drive automation to the network called hyper automation in terms of user request service requests customer requests and so on so forth finally can you make your help desk service desk customer support service cloud can we make those in autonomous our trading departments are autonomous or cars going to be autonomous is there a way we can make our enterprise operations business operations autonomous from customer service and support right so there are ways to solve it there are very many solutions in the market and i wanted to kind of give you a couple of solutions in the market that's important and share with you one is the new age of solution that are happening in the last 12 to 18 months it's called unsupervised conversion ai carnosine is a new class of technologies that are being just coming to market with gartner just created a category for conversion ai these unsupervised current air solutions they are like national virtual assistant for your solution in microsoft teams slack through email and through wise right so the idea of the unsupervised current ai solution is to apply natural language processing nlu to try to solve interpret the user request understand the meaning and the intent and able to resolve the request there's a second class of solutions called guided flows of supervised guided flows some people refer them as chatbots where you understand predetermine what are some of the common questions are and provide a request response solution and all of us have seen those chatbots with the last four five years those things are still in place there's a place for them but i think the next solution next generation will be the unsupervised country i will will include it will be a superset of what is already offered by chatbot solutions third is the search what is to be enterprise search becoming cognitive search compatibility cognitive ai search where the semantic engines with applying ai will offer an external solution to users finally at any point in the flow what the users are demanding is the user should be able to seamlessly easily able to talk to a live agent if they chose to do so and able to provide that escalation path or that migration path so that a user and a consumer can talk to and support agent is very important so how does this solution works end to end so here i'm showing you a user coming on the left side making a request i call it this is where if you can handle this request as a service that's what i mean by request of service so here is israel taking those requests trying to interpret and actually putting the fulfillment resolving the request now any request that israel is not able to solve here through our ai service code will open up as a ticket and service desk that should be an exception so if i can handle even 70 80 percent of those requests where take the employee user request so resolve them and only a few requests go to service desk that would be a great steady state for enterprises right and then within this environment what will happen is the service agent will be still using will be leveraged to solve the services problems and the tickets that are going to service us some of the sample questions and requests people ask for i want to put in the perspective it's it could be ass employee i need office 365 license or i want to activate my office 365 i want to reset my password i want onedrive access i want my video account to be stopped right i want my candidates to be synced people can run into a lot of questions or other thing that i've seen is people talk about i cannot upload my pictures into one drive or one note into the system or i want to access to microsoft teams all the requests either from microsoft properties or outside of microsoft properties these are sample requests users are making today to get their job done and these requests can happen dynamically then you can't predict what the user is going to ask it's not like you know exactly the request they're going to make in their environment so i want to make it an example of how that request can be automated here i'm showing you a simple example of office 365 housing an employee on the left side issues a series of steps to make a request for office 365 on the right side i'm showing you a corresponding steps of a customer service agent that will follow what the employee request will be to fulfill the office 365 request in this traditional classical it flow of an office 365 provisioning you can see there are many steps employee takes many steps service agent takes typically if you actually see this end to end the statistics that we have seen across the customers is these requests to provision get it done 100 takes around minimum a day or even longer many cases if i were to automate all these requests in less than a minute that's the magic we want to offer and offer it to an employee at any point in time they can do this thing in middle of the night daytime at any point so they're not blocked it's not going there eight to five or nine to six hours when the customer service is available so here's an employee on the left side making the request saying i want office 365 if isa can fulfill that request and give access to it and notify the user you made the user productive he or she is able to do the job best going forward and this is what i mean by commerce a and rpi making a game change these technologies where your content ai through natural language processing and rpa with hyper automation can be merged to offer a solution like this end-to-end let's take another example virtual desktop most common every employees every company offers a desktop or virtual desktop to their employees here i'm showing you a left-sided request for a new employee or an existing employee current employee is asking for a virtual desktop changes here are the requests that a virtual employee or employee would go through for virtual desktop on the right side the series of step is customer service agent would go through to fulfill the request now if you see the steps are anywhere between eight to ten steps by employee and the customer service agent to fulfill this request on there which takes seven to eight days from start to finish if you can do this thing end to end from an employee perspective that's a game changing again and that's what i want to show you here a user and an employee able to request that i need a virtual desktop and eyes are able to understand what they want and provision it and give access to it and if i can do that less than a minute that is where you are actually improving the productivity of the user improving the experience you're also improving the business operations you don't need hundreds of steps to do this thing manually and block for hours and days on this and again back to this to leverage this you need the conversion ai and rpa technology to make this happen the key pieces are there are three four technologies that i'm talking about conversation which is comes from natural language processing ai and rpa now how do we address this as i said first you need the solution to be cloud native solution you want a solution to be fully turnkey offering this end-to-end built in the cloud for the cloud it also should build with ai at its core ai as a first native solution inside it also need to have some kind of a conversation interaction piece to understand what users are asking this is the user facing customer facing technologies so you really need to understand what users are going to ask so you need a solution like unsupervised natural language processing where you're not going to supervise it you're not going to determine what and how it should happen finally you needed robotic process automation to perform the task actions and workflows and that's where the current arpa piece comes in having these four package together and create a complete solution end to end that you solve this problem is what israel is offering for microsoft partners and customers using microsoft teams let's talk about what are the nodes and i call it there are five things you don't need to do here everybody talks about what needs to happen the purpose of this slide is to get started in this bank what you don't need to do it or you should not need to do first i don't want you to repair the data you don't need to do any historical data collection to get started on this project you also need to know and don't need any data scientist or ai experts to hire you don't need to spend lots of time trying to train your algorithms or solutions you don't need a lot of consulting services people to do this it's not going to take six months to make the solution deploy or even two weeks two months finally there's not much data or network required to start the solution the reason i'm putting these five nodes for a solution like iso is the idea is to make it easy for you to make a bet get started with this next generation virtual assistant solution for your employees and for your users so what is a stacked extract looks like what i want to leave the thought is this is a new tech stack due to remote working environment that's going to expire the digital transformation for all the enterprises whether you're a mid-market or an enterprise the stack instead of four layers the bottom layer is pick your favorite vendor of choice for your customer service and customer support at ticketing system it could be servicenow zendesk it could be jira etc similarly for knowledge pick your knowledge could be on your sharepoint it could be an office 365 document it could be in web content it could be confluence etc well it's a channel of communication it can be any channel like domicile it could be email it could be voice it could be microsoft teams it could be slack finally stitching all this together a complete solution to do offer a remote working stack to support customer service support is where the israel comes in with our ai service cloud so these four layers if you can have it working as a tech stack that's a new solution that you want to offer to your employees and your users into it so finally so far i talked about digital transformation and i talked about how the experience and productivity the question is is there any savings is the business going to get any benefit is there a roi for it is this roi immediate is are we going to take 6 months 3 months 90 days what we saw with our customers and partner is there is an immediate roi in the first 90 days first three months a ai service cloud solution can offer savings immediately then savings will come in three different buckets starting from the license cost saving and this could be across your tools from ticketing tools to other tools solutions agent productivity saving across your customer service and support resources finally user productivity saving if you out of this the average saving we have seen for our customers for deploying ai service cloud solution is around seven million dollars and we are able to realize and show these savings in the first 90 days now to do this thing what does it take to do it this is what i call microsoft and iso together bringing it together can happen end to end i'm showing you the left side the users can be in microsoft teams in the middle is where iso is trying to interpret the microsoft request and able to fulfill all the solution from microsoft properties it could be microsoft dynamics 365 it could be microsoft confluence microsoft sharepoint it could be microsoft office documents it could be microsoft active directory it should be microsoft onedrive all of the properties plus non-microsoft properties ideas to provide an end-to-end solution a user can start from microsoft teams and able to fulfill requests and iso is coming to bridge this gap and that's what i mean by iso and microsoft offering a solution end and bringing it together with this i want to thank you for your time and listening to us the next part of the presentation is going to be from my colleague he is the vp of product of israel he will walk you through israel demo and how this can be realized into it thank you thank you muthu hello everyone my name is puru and i run product team at isera first of all thank you for spending time today to get to know isera as a product today i am going to demonstrate product capabilities such as supervise and unsupervised ai through end user demo using microsoft teams and web chat first and foremost i want to introduce to admin user interface which provides unparalleled level of insights into conversations which end users are having with virtual assistant or conversational ai it offers out of the box kpis such as resolution rate customer satisfaction score escalation rate or average duration end user is spending on a conversational user interface now i'm going to switch to an end user demo using microsoft teams first i'm going to engage with isara's virtual agent by saying hello now i am going to walk you through conversational rpa use case conversational rpa uses nlp and nlu to execute tasks on behalf of user first i am going to request an access to office 365 office 365 is most commonly used sas service in enterprises so let me first ask for an office 665 i might say i want access to microsoft word as you can see virtual assistant is able to understand that i am requesting an access to word but organization is using office 365 so i'm going to go and request an approval from my manager in this case rod welch before i click yes and hit submit button i want to show that in admin console of office 365 that i do not have a license for office 365 and this is me and i don't have an access for office districts by license so i'm going to go ahead and actually click yes and submit a button and behind the scene we are connecting to office 65 licensing api to see if this organization has enough licenses and can provide an access to me for an office 365 or intent for a word so now i'm going to go to rod welch who is my manager to see if he got any email for the approval so now you can see that he just got an email and i'm going to click to approve which in turn is going to approve and actually provision an access for me for office 365 so i'm going to go back here in admin console and i'm going to refresh and see if i actually got an access to office testify license now you can see that both the licenser have been consumed and now check box for office 365 business has been enabled if i go back to my microsoft teams you can see i got a notification saying that my request has been approved and provisioned so now i'm going to go to an another example of a conversational rpa most commonly use case is that user requesting either accessing to distribution list or creating a new distribution list in this case i am going to say add me to dl you may notice that that the virtual assistant is able to understand dl is nothing but a distribution list which is a synonym to dl now is asking me to select which group i want to be a part of and i'm going to say i want to be a part of the administrator so that i have super powers to manage my organizations before i click submit button i am going to go quickly to an admin console of active directory here and now you can see here i am puru and i am only part of the domain users group so i'm going to go ahead and actually minimize this window and i'm going to say go ahead and actually submit it my request now behind the scene we are connecting to an on-prem active directory and adding me into an administrator group so that i can have a super powers so i'm going to go back into the admin console and i'm going to double click here and see if i now have become a part of an admin group so now you can see that i am become a part of an admin group so the key takeaway here is that most common tasks can be done without agents help by end user itself and in this case this actually helped me and i'm going to click yes on this one and i'm going to move on to little bit more complex use case here i'm going to demonstrate the power of microsoft teams form and i'm going to say that my network is very slow now let's see what it comes back with so it has come back with saying that you know i can actually create a network policy and now that network policy is for creating is going to walk me through step by step using the microsoft forms capability now he's going to ask me four five questions to create the network policies asking me know should i allow guest wi-fi and i'm going to say no is saying no should i allow http and https access and i'm going to say go ahead and actually do that restrict access only during office hours i'm going to click yes it's asking me whether i should restrict any particular protocol i'm going to say ftp it's going to ask me whether which group should be given an access to office 365 i'm going to say go ahead and actually create a only engineering group it's going to ask me if i should restrict any applications such as youtube which could consume a lot of bandwidth and it's going to ask me one more question about whether i should block p2p application i'm going to say go ahead and block because they might consume a lot of network bandwidth so here is the preview of the bandwidth policy and i'm going to go ahead and say go ahead create this looks good to me and this has actually indeed actually helped me solve my problem so i'm going to click yes and glad that isa assistant is able to help me so now i am going to switch to conversational ai use case so far what we have seen that we have used isara's virtual assistant to address i.t related question but it can also be used for others departments such as hr facilities finance sales operations so i'm going to go and ask a most commonly use questions related to hr which is need help with hr help me with hr now what you are seeing is that is has understood the intent of the user saying that you know he needs some help with related to hr support and he's asking you know what kind of a help is required so is guiding the user in a supervised way to get his questions addressed so i'm going to in this case say i have a question about payroll right and i'm going to hit submit and it's going to ask the user a follow-up question saying that you know what kind of a payroll question you have do you want to know more about when the payroll date is do you know to know about tax information i'm going to say no i want to know more about actually the payroll dates and i'm going to hit the submit and that essentially is going to help user get his answer about a payroll and this is very powerful because you can use this supervised experience for most commonly asked questions if the user is asking more accurate or precise questions such as you know when is a payroll in this case the virtual assistant is directly going to the right section of the article and providing an answer in that case you really don't need a supervised experience you can just give an answer directly to the user so that's essentially the power of what we call unsupervised ai now what i'm going to do is that i'm going to switch from microsoft teams as a channel to a web chat so we have created what we call the 50 cs company called acme and i'm an employee of an acme and i'm on right now their id service portal i have logged in as myself and i'm going to open what we call a web chat so i'm going to ask some basic simple questions saying that you know i need help from working from home so let's say let me try that i need help to work from home so now what you are seeing is that the virtual assistant has come back with the response this response is driven from the structure of the document right in an unsupervised way so let me go to the document itself and let me walk you through this document so the document you can see has multiple sections so isara's conversational ai has a capability for unsupervised ai and nlp which has been used in order to drive the conversation with the user by taking an advantage of the structure of the document and then conversing with the user in this case you know it is saying you know what kind of a help you need to work from home is it related to the security checklist is it related to the cyber security tips or do you need to get help about the sharing the files with your teams to manage your mental health so i'm going to say no i really need some tips around cyber security and now is giving me further more follow-up questions all of those conversation is driven using the structure of the document using unsupervised ai nlp capabilities of isa virtual assistant so i'm going to say no i need help about managing the passwords and i'm going to show you a one more powerful use case about how unsupervised ai nlp capability can be used to give more precise answer by looking at the in this case the content of the table so i'm going to say how much is one password for group and now you can see that the unsupervised ai capability can understand the structure of the document and can extract the value from the cell and can present the precise an answer to the user without asking user to either go through the entire document and trying to figure out where that table exists within the document and trying to get an answer to that that's really powerful now with that i'm going to conclude my demo and i'm going to hand off to asar and asar is going to take from here assad stages viewers thank you thank you puru for bringing everything to life with your demo for all of our attendees please be
