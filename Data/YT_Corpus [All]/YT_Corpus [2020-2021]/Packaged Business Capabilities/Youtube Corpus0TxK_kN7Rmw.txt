 when thoughts from freely ideas interweave when new connections are forged innovation is unleashed the more technologies become interconnected the more possibilities emerge and the more customers expect and when customers expect more faster you need to adapt quicker you need to empower them with personalized experiences across all channels behind-the-scenes api's are the unsung heroes integrating systems unifying data and enabling all the connected experiences we've come to rely on with the combined power of Neil soft and Salesforce customers can connect anything and change everything because when it all comes together in a memorable human experience that's when the future has finally arrived [Music] hello everyone and welcome my name is ELISA baka marketing manager for Australia and New Zealand here at Buell soft thank you so much for taking the time to tune in live we're thrilled to have you and I'm so excited to be able to share how music can help you unleash the full power of Salesforce customer 360 with api's and integration as you would have seen throughout today the world is changing and there's a customer revolution underway and the catalyst of this change is today's customers today's customers expect integrated personalized and truly connected products services and experiences that meet them where they are and span across every channel as a result companies are under greater pressure than ever before to go faster innovate at scale and be more agile and this revolution isn't isolated to just one industry companies across every industry are in the midst of a digital transformation and facing the imperative to deliver and delight their customers or risk getting left behind so a question I post those tuning in online is if the need for connected experiences is so pervasive why as so many of our apps and experiences fragmented and the reality is our data is disconnected it's disconnected from our customers our partners and our employees and all too often trouble with integrating these systems and unlocking data is the number one reason that new initiatives fail in mule selfs recent 20/20 connectivity benchmark report which surveyed 800 IT leaders from across the globe it revealed that while nearly every enterprise is undertaking digital transformation eighty-five percent are slowed down by integration challenges and data silos so how do we solve this how do we break down the barriers to five digital transformation and go faster well the good news is you've come to the right session in the next thirty minutes we're going to show you how mule soft and Salesforce together can help make this hard problem easy or at least a whole lot easier we're going to talk through three main things the first is how we can help you integrate your systems and unlock data with api's to create connected experiences faster than ever before the second is how we can empower everyone in your organization to innovate securely and sustainably and the third is how api's allow you to harness the full power of your ecosystem to take innovation beyond the four walls of your organization so with so please tune in and let's get this show on the road to kick things off I like to welcome to the stage Dan Owen Thank You Alyssa hi my name is Dan Owen and I'm the regional vice president for customer success architecture here at mule soft so I'm really filthy here will Toby imagined over twenty months ago sales force acquired mule soft and I'm really energizing the customer conversations I have day-to-day with the potential that I customers see with mule soft and Salesforce together the customer 360 vision is there for the platform but it's a challenge because it's not connected to our orgonite to organizations applications and systems integration is critical to realize in this solution an integration we hear time and time again from our customers is hard and it is slow we heard in the 2019 connectivity benchmark report that the number one reason that business initiatives are failing is due to integration but why is it so hard first as we heard from ELISA data is disparate across many systems and applications in an organization we know from a garner report that typically a business transaction will touch 35 applications and systems in an organization but that's just one dimension that's just one customer journey in an order zatia second it's just the sheer number of systems an organization has and this is a kind of a multiplication problem the number of systems and the number of journeys on average we understand their customers to have over a thousand systems and worryingly 2/3 of those today are not connected and integrated the third and probably the hardest problem is actually just how to integrate these systems into our organization organizations of course want project to be delivered fast and reliably and so typically we find our customers they they default to right in some small custom code to meet the needs of that immediate integration problem now and try and get a business initiative moving forward it's just because it's easier when we look at it project by project but we find time and time again when I work with customers over the the months that this becomes the actually the enemy of speed and agility in your organization the custom code is actually a bottleneck in your organization and it's brittle it requires developers to constantly come back and maintain that code to make it work each week in each month of the year we have too few of the developers in organizations that understand that integration and so therefore can change it and adapt it to your organization and it all just becomes too hard when we think about it in an enterprise concept to have a truly connected organization and therefore connected customer experiences become just a dream for our customers we can liken the new approached to the API the API is a game changer and what we mean by an API is a piece of integration that's exposed as an API which is a real standard way in an organization to connect and use that integration we can liken it to lego building blocks you buy your Lego set you get instructions and bags of little bricks and you can use those bricks to build the model that you've bought but just like on every brick the nope and the holes are standard to connect each other together so you and your children can build different models that aren't necessarily what you bought you can put them together and just like that API is our building blocks for your organization and so we want to encapsulate unique business capabilities as an API once we do this with API is just like Lego we can reuse each block in each API in your organization so maybe a business capability we developed for one project earlier in the year can be reused in a later project later in the year and so therefore we become assemblers in our organization we take each API and we semble them together to build solutions we may reassemble them to build solutions so api's are correct reuse and we don't have to ignore the legacy many organizations still have legacy mainframes and legacy systems that are integral to the business operation and so we need to unlock that data and application to meet the new digital connected experiences so we wrap the legacy systems with these api's to expose them as a standard component and so with composability and reusability we start to meet the needs of the business which is speed and agility so we quickly move from being builders in an organization to them being composers and assemblers of capabilities we are then more able to quickly and creatively make solutions to innovate for our organization and actually then to create those differentiated customer experiences but how do we do this we at me also truly believe that the meals at any point platform is the world's leading integration platform in market today and that's for a few different reasons any point platform lets us build integrations and expose them as api's and manage them as api's on one single platform that means we can start to unify our data sets that's been exposed as api's into our organizations and api and start to unleash the full power of the Salesforce 360 vision to deliver those connected customer experiences that we so want to deliver once we start exposing all the legacy systems and applications in our businesses api's we can then start to integrate and create that single source of truth of our customer and leverage the true power of the world's number one CRM solution just last year at Dreamforce real soft we're very proud to announce the accelerators for Salesforce these are prepackaged ready to go solutions to integrate that the commerce cloud and service cloud so you can quickly integrate and build them into your eco system we find on our video this reduces the costs for organizations up to 60% so it's delivering your project 60% quicker by using pre-built accelerators but we don't just stop there these accelerators which out-of-the-box and available on any point exchange are also complemented with our rich array of connectors to connect to other systems like s AP or ServiceNow and to really surface that data up into Salesforce these connectors and accelerate is a battle test that are ready to go and used by our customers in production today so now like to pasta Alisa to really talk about now we have the technology components of AP is how we now start to empower people in your organization's to begin to innovate with AP eyes listen thank you Dan hello everyone again I'm excited to share more about how empowering everyone in the organization to innovate with AP eyes but before I do let's spend a moment to discuss why this matters why is it so important that we find a pot that lets us go faster and innovate at scale in a way that's governed but not gated by IT we want to empower everyone to build and innovate in this way we all stuff wants to make it possible for any employee to integrate systems unify data and deliver connected experiences without writing a single line of code because today everyone needs to be empowered with the tools to drive digital transformation for a custom is already taking this ap eyelet approach they've seen a whopping 70 percent increase in productivity as well as huge gains in speed agility and scale and the best part is this is achievable by everyone not just big global companies with vast resources but in order to enable companies to make this leap we need to empower those within IT and outside to be champions of digital transformation companies of all shapes and sizes across all industries need integration trailblazers integration trailblazers can be anyone who wants to apply the power of api's to transform the customer or employee experience we want trailblazers who can think differently about applying api's to help every corner of the organization go faster and do more so how can we help create more integration trailblazers around the world that can drive their companies through this change we're making this possible in two ways the first is product innovations and the second is new learning and enablement first let's dive into product today in flow design a you can use clicks to declaratively build integrations or connect existing integrations into your Salesforce apps and while we'll continue to enrich the mule so of any point platform with the tools that proko does and devs need we're also in a mission to make integration more acceptable to everyone that is why we're so excited to be able to offer integration with clicks nut code using clicks no code you'll be able to leverage the most common integrations out-of-the-box on any point exchange i'll marketplace for api's and integration and the best part is you can accomplish all of this while still ensuring IT can apply governance and monitoring to safeguard those critical assets this is a huge step forward to help make api's and integrations accessible to the entire organization but we can't stop there because great technology alone isn't enough to effect this type of change we need a great technology and we need a new skill set and that is why we're so excited that we're committed to skilling up the world on api's you can go into trailhead today and take the integration Trailblazer trail mix and learn all about the power of api's how to apply them and become an integration trailblazer and for those that want to take the next step get more hands-on build and deploy api's you can become an integration professional and certified on the mule soft product again all available today so I challenge our online viewers which of you will become the next integration trailblazer Oh integration professional lastly to remind everyone about continued commitment to skilling up the weld-on api's last year at Dreamforce mule soft pledged to scale up a hundred thousand integration trailblazers in the next five years because it's all about training up the workforce of the future on this critical skill and we're not alone on this journey our partners have also committed to join us and they're planning on skilling up 10,000 integration Trailblazers and certify 5000 integration professionals again all in the next five years so we're now going to move to chapter 3 we're going to look at how you can use api so not only unlock innovation in your own four walls but you can also enable and empower your ecosystem to innovate right alongside you and to share more about how we're doing that I'm gonna invite back to the stage Dan Owen hello thanks Alyssa so we've heard about how API czar this catalyst for innovation how api's can integrate your systems data and applications to create these connected customer experiences and we've heard from Alyssa how we can start to enable the people an ecosystem in your organization to deliver these api's but demand is far greater than supply trying to meet the demand with your own organization alone may not meet your business needs so we need to be able to both enable greater collaboration internally but also start to leverage broader ecosystems and that's starting to think about developers and consumers outside of your organization we need to dig ma critize access to your data and applications and this is going to require a change of mindset in your organization and fundamentally this is about thinking about api's as products and it's not just simply calling api's products it's about the organizational change that starts to believe the products have their own strategy their own roadmap and life cycle that you need to think about the consumption support of them and think of them as an asset in your organization and once we begin to think about ap Isis products we need to think about who the users of those api's are and those users or customers as there may be our developers and so how do we interact with developers in a in a collaborative fashion and also how internally do you promote the API value to your business stakeholders who may not even consider API is to be an IT asset or even a business asset and of course we need to create those delightful developer still have developer experiences to engage that ecosystem so how do we do this how do we start to think of design with outside thinking and what those API should be we need to think about having open standards for api's the Salesforce cloud information model is one example that's published online too it'll enable collaboration across any industry and lots of developer ecosystems we need to think about a marketplace where can you go and find api's in your organization's or in the suppliers in your ecosystem to see what api they may have that you couldn't leverage to build the connected experience as you want to do of course we've got to think about the customers the developers and onboarding them into your ecosystem securely making sure you know who's got access to these assets and once the developers are in your ecosystem they're going to require support and how do you do that effectively and critically as well as how do you foster collaboration and once you foster collaboration you will accelerate the innovation in your organization so how do we do this it's great to think about the any point community manager that went GA last year at Dreamforce API community manager allows you to build and expose those api's in your organization it builds an ecosystem to share api's and it drives that adoption it also allows you to monitor the activity engagement in that ecosystem to see which api's have been used which developers are active and where you are and if we community manages built on the Salesforce platform it leverages the best of community cloud marketing cloud and service cloud to build that solution and what I'd like to do is take you through an example of how HSBC I've gone on this journey with any point community mansion growing up back in India I used to think her with everything electrical the exposure to computers came and pretty late when my dad asked me the inventory things in his business and we spent three days counting stuff I said why can't we do this better all we're using is a calculator and then I begged my dad to buy a computer so can we get a computer and put everything in there HSBC is an institution we've been around for over 150 years and as the CTO for the company I focus heavily on the experience that we provide our customers our customers expect to use their bank and their banking services anytime of the day whenever they want the bank as we know it traditionally have become a lot more hidden whereas the banking services have become irrelevant api's have democratized banking services so that developers can build amazing applications we are building many many api's and one of the challenges for us was to find the right solution to help build a community around the api's when cell phones and meals have came together the power of meals of api's it could just be unlocked there's one partner that brings us not just the back-office solution but also now the customer facing solution today if I'm a developer I feel like I got access to the entire banking set of services at the flick of a button on my keyboard so today you don't have to apply for an HSBC mortgage on HSBC if I'm a developer at an online real estate search platform and I want to provide a seamless property purchase experience I go into HSBC's open banking portal look for the right api's and once they have access to the API it's easy for them to build journeys that let the customer get a pre-approved amount for mortgages right there on the partners website so it's seamless now so now the customer is at the center of the ecosystem we hope that driving choice just enhances the value of the customers relationship with HSBC so we can be a partner of confidence so that was great to hear about the HSBC experience how they're building integrations and services for API for the external community now I'd like to welcome Bill who's going to take us through that journey with any point community manager thank you Bill hi my name is Bill Hicks I'm a regional manager for solution engineering here at Mill soft and thanks Dan for that introduction and I'm really here today to take you through a demo to show you and really bring to life some of the things that Dan and Alyssa have spoken to you about so far today so firstly if we look back we've we're going to base this demo around our dream move retail platform it's a it's a real estate platform that I can go to it's much like domain real estate comte you but it really gives me a platform to go and try and find my dream home but unfortunately we've we found that there's actually a disconnect to customer experience as part of the platform and so what happens is I can go and I can search for my house but I then need to interact outside of the platform with with a bank to actually understand if I can afford the home that I want to purchase so what I'm actually going to do is break this down we're going to follow Lauren who's a project manager at dream move to understand how she actually goes ahead and fixes this this challenge that we see we're going to break that down into three different areas so those three different areas first of all we're going to see how how Lauren interacts with and explores the API ecosystem secondly we're going to see how developers can leverage those api's and finally we're going to see how the HSBC internal admins can get visibility into how people are interacting with their API ecosystem so Lauren recalls receiving an email from HSBC introducing her to their API ecosystem when she accesses the link she launches an engaging pixel-perfect experience that allows to her to understand the HSBC api's she can see a broad range of products and services HSBC has to offer along with different solutions news and announcements so they're really marketing their api's to their to their end users you can see that the api's have been organized into different groups and she needs to create a new product so she clicks into the product section she is looking for a mortgage API and when she finds it she clicks into it for more detail he then sees dynamic documentation associated with the API that she can interact with scrolling down she can see the methods available to her and by clicking on one she can start to interact with the API to understand more about how it works including mocking data to use as a sample if she needs more help she can go to and browse through some support links she can get direct support from HSBC support team but more importantly she can start to interact with the HSBC developer community ask questions and understand how others in the community are using HSBC api's with the rich information available to her lauren is able to make an informed decision and direct the developers to use the API they come in click through and get access what the developers now have access to is a guided experience all the way from obtaining a sandbox key through to deploying the API into production to develop a confine the API easily but also understand the lifecycle of the API increasing the likely success of their project now let's move away wave a magic wand and move forward in time to when development is being completed and see what outcomes we have so here is the dream move website right results from a search that has been performed we can see the detail of a search as we could before but we can also interact with HSBC to understand if I can afford the home of my dreams so let's recap Dreamforce have been able to rapidly move from concept to implementation fulfil their customer need and open up a new revenue stream most importantly we see the connected customer experience that is now possible this is the power of innovation driven through an API ecosystem now let's take a look at the HSBC admin team's experience this is the API community command center the admin team can quickly get visibility into how their API ecosystem is performing by reviewing core KPIs they can also view and respond to Corrections in the bottom left to engage with the community and continually refine the optimal experience let's click into their total members this results in a view that you should be familiar with you see a funnel on the left and a segmentation on the right and you're used to using this to understand your prospects a customer funnel given that we view API sirs products we now view developers as customers so what you see now is a developer journey funnel on the left and a developer ecosystem segmentation on the right taking the developer all the way from initial visit all the way through to implementation let's examine those that are generating high traffic as we can see a common pattern emerges each one of the partners that are live are generating a high number of transactions per second and then have relatively high engagement scores we can see that lauren from dream move is at the top let's click into our profile now we start to see something really powerful we have gone from an ecosystem of over 30,000 developers and hundreds of partners down right into a single record so that we can understand what that specific partner is doing this allows the HSBC admin team to interact in the best way with their most valuable partners they can drill into Lauren's usage and see what API is remove is actually leveraging we can also see the power of AI being applied to developer ecosystems on the right hand side we can see Einstein is recommending the next best action this is to onboard dream move into the HSBC developers champion program this allows Lauren to be selected and become part of the program and to really promote the brand of dream move it also allows the broader HSBC ecosystem to leverage the knowledge of Lauren as an API Trailblazer there you go the value of an API ecosystem from multiple lenses and who would have thought you get to see sparkles as part of an integration demo your soft only released has then mentioned a cm late late last year an HSBC went went live in November so with any important platform and the customer Salesforce customer 360 HSBC has everything they need to democratize access to banking services and foster innovation imagine the value to your ecosystem when you connect anything and change everything so to complete the keynote I'd like to now hand back to Elissa thank you so much bill so as you've seen here today mules up helps you integrate systems unlock data to create connected experiences faster and light up the entire customer 360 mule soft and Salesforce together can help make the hard work of integrating systems and creating connected experiences a whole lot easier unleashing a new era of innovation HSBC is a great example of how this API LED approach can help you meet the needs of your customers and business excited intrigued here's what you can do next to start your own journey to digital transformation firstly come and visit us in the digital expo today we have experts on hand who can walk you through the mule sock demo and answer any questions you have next get onto trail head and become an integration Trailblazer today and the learning doesn't stop there we're going to bring the power of api's and integrations to mule self connect in Sydney from the 30th of June to 1st of July and most importantly go back to your office and find a high-impact business initiative that requires data and integration and then work with your stakeholders to build that project using api's because everything starts with the first project and we can help you go faster and do more that wraps up our session for today on behalf of everyone at mule soft and Salesforce I wanted to sincerely thank you for your time we are so excited to be on this journey with you and we hope you enjoy the rest of your day thank you
