 hi i'm jamie davidson i run the product team at loker and today i'm going to give you a quick overview of what looker is today and where we're going looker is an enterprise bi tool and data platform we empower our customers to make the smarter use of data on the top you see the diversity of use cases the looker platform can be used to power from modern bi and beyond and i'll talk about that in a moment looker's platform has a couple of key differences relative to the existing market our customers come with their data aggregated from a wide variety of sources into a cloud data warehouse looker has an in database architecture that will leverage the functionality scalability and performance of technologies like bigquery and enable customers to drive real-time data value from we've got a semantic modeling layer on top of that in database architecture where an analyst can come and codify their business metrics and enable an organization to have a single source of truth that that modeling layer is integrated with git and version control and allows for governance looker is a cloud native bi tool and that means that everything you can do inside the application and more is accessible via api that architecture has a couple of key benefits first data governance is is built in from the ground up to because of the modeling layer because of the integration with git our security access and authentication you can have confidence that the metrics that your your users or your business is using are what you think that they mean and that the right people have access that same semantic modeling layer also serves to empower business users you don't have to know the complicated definitions for things like gross margin or lifetime value to be able to still make directional decisions based on that data lookers a cloud native application every url is shareable it means that you have easy repeatable analysis because we are we have an in database architecture we are representing what's live in the database today and then in database architecture allows uh for for operational use of your data because customers are now replicating their full transactional information into a cloud data warehouse you can not just look at the high-level kpis and where they're trending you can actually see the individual transactions that are driving over 50 percent of our customers now are actually using the looker platform beyond api context to give you a couple examples we see customers using us to have embedded dashboards in internal portals so that their knowledge workers can use data to make better decisions we see customers embedding dashboards into sas tools like salesforce so that the sales people can go and have the relevant information while they're making their decisions we see customers integrating us into existing products and even creating completely new products to give value to their customers and at times monetize data and then finally we see customers going so far as to use looker effectively headlessly so not using any of our ui or ux integrating with our apis to provide governed data into custom applications these applications don't look or feel like anything that classic bi would suggest it's beyond reporting and self-serve analytics it's really operational so for example maybe a supply chain management application where the historical inventory levels and pricing is is useful and looker provides a governed view of that into that application so lookers looker's different we have a different architecture too and it gives some benefits we are fast on any size of data we're leveraging bigquery and snowflake and redshift to be able to give you real-time access to their their powerful functionality the semantic model means that there's a single source of truth for for your organization too and it gives the business users trust in in the data that model is integrated with the development workflow too that lets you have uh changes over time and a life cycle and management for for those workflows and finally looker is a cloud native application too which means we've got apis to integrate with uh lots of operational tools we want to be where the the users are are working so that's a quick look at what looker is today i want to tell you about where we're going we talked just just recently about the breadth of experiences that we enable or use cases that we enable we think about the ability to serve those those use cases in three real layers too so the top layer of data experiences this is where the business users are consuming data and taking action on it now below that we've got our application platform too this is what enables our customers to create those data experiences and then finally the the base really here is is lookers foundation this is our our develop life cycle this is our id this is our query execution this is the core of the app so to start on data experiences all right i'm going to talk quickly about our core and you know the core unit of a report for looker is a dashboard i'll talk about how we've completely rebuilt that dashboard stack um and how we're similarly now reimagining that that the core explorer experience that self-serve analysis the expression of the model um as well we'll talk a little bit about how we integrate into existing business workflows and then finally close on how we how we help with content discovery so i mentioned that we've been rebuilding our dashboard we've basically spent the last year and a half completely rebuilding it from the ground up with a bunch of different goals in mind we want it to be a more modern stack we want to be more performant we want to be more customizable we also want to enable fundamentally new interactions and experiences that haven't ever been possible inside api and that's includes things like cross-filtering epidemic scales because we have an in database architecture and we can take advantage of databases like bigquery we now have an interaction mechanism too that lets you get full granularity of your data ask as many questions as you want of the content when we rethought you know the consumption of content we also had to think about the creation of that that content too we want to give our analysts a whole lot more control over the presentation of their data too we want to make it easy for them to create reports that you can easily drive insight from and ultimately take action on and that includes things like fundamental new modes of consumption here you can see a new report type this is closer to a google doc than it is to a dashboard it's still integrated with the looker governance it's still integrated with our security model too you can see it's infused with with data it's got a live look and visualization of metrics too but it's it's presented in context to and imagine you're an executive consuming a weekly pdf report emailed to youtube the analyst needs to construct it in such a way where you can easily derive insight from it too in a way that you'd expect so this can allow that we're also increasing the customization as possible inside dashboards too with with new dashboard extensions where you can take over a tile of a dashboard too with pre-built extensions that are present inside our marketplace as well as custom extensions that you build to to allow you to create custom experiences and workflows to tailor to your data we're really excited about bringing looker uh more broadly to as many people as possible that includes doing work like localization now we now support uh 23 different languages too for our core reporting use cases we are in the process of bringing all of that localization to the full application um similarly we're looking at accessibility as well we want to make it easy to for looker to navigate for all users too so that everyone can can derive value from their data we're looking now at exploration too and lookers explore has always been an incredibly powerful feature it's the manifestation of of that that semantic model it lets you ask lots of questions of your data too we want to make it even easier we want to make it so you have uh smarter starting points so pre-built queries to start the question and answering process we want to make it so that you uh can do on-the-fly calculations and not have to go into the model to create new new metrics or dimensions too that are just transformations on existing ones we also want to take advantage of gcp's best-in-class ai and ml functionality too and integrate some of that into the bi tool so that you'd have things like time series forecasting to integrate it into the explore experience we want to bring data to wherever work is being done at a high level we want to drive more value that requires things like our alerting functionality we've got analytic holders that use data to power workflows we want to make them even smarter we want to use that same ai and ml expertise that gcp has too to do things like outlier detection where a analyst can come in and say this metric is important to me let me know if it changes and maybe tell me why um and we can we can do that and we'll be bringing that we want to make it easy to take action directly from within the bi experience so this is building on our action hub which is tightly integrated with our semantic model and it allows for interaction and integration with third party services so in this case you could have complex analysis inside the pi tool to find uh over-performing campaigns too and then take direct action to change their budgets or change change um you know activity inside the google ads platform we recently released an integration with google sheets we're really excited and customers have have adopted it incredibly quickly because they want to take governed trusted data too into a context sometimes where they want to have some lightweight ad-hoc analysis to customize experience we're excited about this integration we want to bring it forward we want to do a bi-directional integration where google sheets can basically pull looker data in and looker can send data into google sheets we're also excited about integrating with the broader g suite products we've got lots of customers that create you know slide shows that are weekly operational reports where they go through a process of downloading a bunch of images and reconstituting that that slideshow or deck every week we want to make it so that you have live access to governed data in the context where you're working to to enable that data storytelling within slides or similarly within google docs we've got a deep integration with slack where you can send data from looker into slack and request data of looker from slack we want to make that interface of requesting data even easier in that communications context to extending to a natural language interface to that semantic model we're really excited about a new native mobile app experience we've got for ios and android and beta today and we'll be ga over the course of the second half of this year where you can consume your data on the go we also want to expose that natural language interface in this context it's not enough to have your content inside your instance though if you can't find it it's not useful too and we're really excited now that we're part of google the search company too to really invest heavily in that content discovery we're rebuilding our search uh infrastructure for a couple of goals you know better performance better relevance but also with an eye to to help with some of the fundamental problems that bi always has if you don't have a piece of content say you're searching for anal recurring revenue you don't have a piece of content that's relevant we can automatically generate that content too and give you a live look at your total arr inside that search context too the data experiences side we are we are focused on reporting and self-serve uh analysis integrating with your workflow and driving more value from your data i'm going to switch gears now and talk about our application platform this is where customers and partners build those data experiences and we're very focused here on a couple of things we want to help accelerate value for our customers we want to increase both the customizability and power that's possible inside the embedded context and also extend the platform to accelerate value we've released a marketplace that's in beta currently where you can easily find install and manage pre-built pieces of content so these can be applications these can be look-a-mel blocks these can be data sets these can be custom visualizations and they will dramatically accelerate your ability to actually explore one of those contexts and one of those data sets too is google marketing we've had a application and a series of lookable blogs two that are targeted on the marketing use case we're really excited to leverage the expertise in google to to push this really a whole lot further we want to help our customers be able to gather all of their marketing data together to analyze and find insights from it to and ultimately take action on that data too within the bi experience for embedding we think that there's a spectrum actually of need for customization and it sort of goes from you know on one side there's inside the bi tool and there's customization that's possible inside a dashboard experience or inside an embedded dashboard experience where you have themes so that it can feel like the application's embedded in we want to increase the amount of customization that's possible in that context similarly we've got our our apis on the other end of the spectrum too and we want to both increase the customization as possible but also give you more out of the box there too so we want richer apis better sdks for interfacing with those those apis too and then even high level javascript based components too so it's much easier to be able to create bespoke workflows too and customize so as an example here is a dashboard that's been themed so that it can basically fit into an application to and feel native we very literally took our new dashboard code base to and packaged up the new functionality and features two in a javascript component sdk so that customers don't have to recreate filters or visualizations and integrate them with our apis they can instead take our our visualizations and extend them and customize them in any way that might fit their specific workflow we're investing heavily in our apis and sdks too from documentation to you know more robust uh interactions as well and we're also focused on extending what's possible inside the platform we're really excited to talk about the extension framework we've got a bunch of partners and customers that are excited about the potential here the extension framework is is the ability to host custom javascript in a sandboxed environment within your looker instances too and have direct access to lookers api so that you can leverage you know security and governance uh that's a part of the looker platform there are lots of different potential applications i'll give you a couple of examples to sort of uh to show what's possible we've we've released our first extension i'm in our marketplace too in our data dictionary this is uh closely integrated with our our data model apis too which can show uh analysts and developers the data that's present in the definitions behind them uh in a simple easy place we've got a lot of partners and customers that are excited about creating custom ways to explore their data um going beyond the pivot table metaphor of of the explore page there are contexts to where a more tailored experience actually makes sense so in this example the cohort tool it's a very parameterized workflow where you select a measure you select an aggregation place you you select you know the interval that you want to measure cohorts on as opposed to needing the full canvas of a broad pivot table another example is actually a hosted notebook experience where you can leverage the power of python integrated with the local api too and go beyond you know what what a classic explore experience would be really excited about the application platform we're focused on increasing the customization inside the embedded experience increasing the performance there too and accelerating value for our customers i'm going to switch gears and talk about the the foundation or core of looker here we think about things like our software development life cycle and ide for the data developers we think about performance we think about transformations that can power that performance too and how can we leverage the data model looker's always been tightly integrated with a development workflow and we want to continue to push that forward we want to have a full uh quality assurance process too in a single instance that allows for development staging and verification of development and production environments and we want that to be inclusive of your lookout models of your content and even your transformations in database too it's in service of driving some performance and lookers in database architecture gives us the ability to actually uh drive performance in in a layered approach um we can take advantage of best of class functionality of data warehouses too and then also use bi context to help inform queries and drive more performant queries we've got a bunch of customers really excited about aggregate awareness we released it a few months ago where you can create roll-up tables within looker and lookers platform will have the intelligence to be able to dynamically optimize queries based on the questions or the the query uh that's that's coming in so if you're going for a granular piece of information we can go to the full granular table if you're looking for uh a summary we can go to the high level rule and to power that again rs2 we've been investing heavily in our transformations so making them much more robust and more durable uh we're focused on adding new functionality like the ability to actually incrementally load into your aggregate tables and integrating those those transformations we're taking a layered approach to performance and acceleration we want to take advantage of the best-in-class functionality like bigquery's bi engine inside the database it's an in-database cache specifically targeting bi use cases similarly we also have a new in-memory cache as well inside the lookup application layer that eliminates the need to do round trips to the database to when they're when they're not necessary we think about analytics or we think about administration a little bit differently we think about it from an analytics first perspective we want to give you as much information about the usage of your looker platform to help you drive data-driven decisions um and so you can use the actual query performance to help drive performance optimization you can use the actual user engagement to help better better captivate your audience looker's data model uh and is is the key reason why our bi tool is differentiated is that integration with the data mall and understanding of the transformational logic that's present inside we have a bunch of customers now using that transformational logic in other workflows or or use cases outside of worker so we've got a bunch of customers now using stable uh roll-up tables too inside the database to power machine learning workflows where they've got governed definitions of features for their machine learning you know training processes too that are governed by looker but used in other contexts similarly we also want to help further leverage the the looker model too like we're doing inside the the google sheets integration we want to basically let analysts use the the right analytical tools too on top of governed data we think we create more value when you give give governed to trusted access to that data to regardless of the context where it's being consumed looker in gcp firmly believes that customers have the right to choose they have the right to choose the right infrastructure for the right problem we firmly support that too we currently support hosting looker inside gcp inside aws and we're actively working on supporting azure we are also very focused on security it's a large effort inside our engineering and product teams we've already got our soft tubes type 2 we've already got our iso 7 27k and our pci uh skus as well we're actively working on additional security certifications too
