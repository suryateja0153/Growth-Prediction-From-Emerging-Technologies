 Narrator: DISASTER STRIKES. HUMAN LIVES IN IMMINENT DANGER. SOPHISTICATED TOOLS CAN MEAN SALVATION. NOW, "RESCUE EQUIPMENT" ON  MODERN MARVELS. [Captioning sponsored by A&E TELEVISION NETWORKS] Narrator: VICTIMS TRAPPED BY SWIFT WATER. CAUGHT UNAWARE IN A BURNING BUILDING. BURIED UNDER RUBBLE FROM EXPLOSIONS OR EARTHQUAKES. EVERY DAY, IN ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD, UNFORESEEN DISASTERS OCCUR, FROM OKLAHOMA CITY TO LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA. WHEN HIGHLY TRAINED, HIGHLY TECHNICAL RESCUE RESPONSE IS REQUIRED, THE CALL GOES TO THE USAR TEAM.  Charles Butler: THE ACRONYM "USAR" STANDS FOR URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE, AND BASICALLY IT IS A TECHNICAL SIDE OF RESCUE WORK, AND WE DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE STRUCTURE COLLAPSE, AND WE DO TECHNICAL ROPE WORK WHERE WE CAN GO DOWN AND GET PEOPLE. ALSO, IN THE WILD LAND ENVIRONMENT, UP IN THE CANYONS, IF A CAR GOES OVER THE SIDE, WE PERFORM THAT TYPE OF RESCUE. ALSO, VEHICULAR-TYPE INCIDENTS ON THE FREEWAY. PRETTY BROAD CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT WE GET INVOLVED IN.  Narrator: THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IN LOS ANGELES FORMED THEIR SPECIAL USAR UNITS IN 1985. THEY ARE TRAINED FOR TECHNICAL HIGH-RISK MISSIONS AND ARE PROFICIENT IN USING THE MOST UP-TO-DATE RESCUE TECHNOLOGY. BUT SOME OF THE BASIC TOOLS THEY EMPLOY DATE BACK OVER 50 YEARS.  Butler: I KNOW THAT THE DISCIPLINE OF URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE HAS PROBABLY BEEN AROUND AT LEAST SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND PROBABLY HAD ITS ORIGINS OVER IN EUROPE WHERE YOU HAD THE CONSTANT BOMBINGS. THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH COLLAPSED STRUCTURES ON A CONSTANT BASIS.  Narrator: DURING THE LONDON BLITZ IN ENGLAND, CIVIL DEFENSE ENGINEERS DEVISED PLANS FOR STABILIZING BUILDINGS THAT COLLAPSED UNDER THE BARRAGE OF BOMBINGS. THE TOOLS THEY EMPLOYED-- PICKS, SHOVELS, CROWBARS, CHAINS, AND GIN POLES-- WERE USED TO MOVE THE DEBRIS AWAY AND ENABLE THE RESCUERS TO SEARCH FOR VICTIMS BURIED BENEATH THE RUBBLE. TODAY, THE USAR TEAMS STILL IMPLEMENT A SHORING TECHNIQUE FROM WORLD WAR II. THEY USE PLYWOOD PLANKS AND STRUTS TO SECURE THE COLLAPSED OR CAVED-IN WALLS OF BUILDINGS OR EARTHEN TRENCHES.  Ronald Klamecki: SO THE SHORING IS PUT IN PLACE PRIMARILY FOR THE RESCUER 'CAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE ANOTHER VICTIM AND THEN SECONDARY, OBVIOUSLY, IS TO GET THE VICTIM OUT OF THE HOLE IN A SAFE MANNER.  Narrator: SHORING IS JUST ONE STEP IN ANY COLLAPSED STRUCTURE PROCEDURE. IF THE VICTIM HAS FALLEN INTO A SMALL HOLE OR DOWN A NARROW SHAFT, THE RESCUERS HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET TO THEM AND BRING THEM UP TO SAFETY. THESE ARE CALLED CONFINED SPACE RESCUES. IN 1949, FOUR-YEAR-OLD KATHY FISCUS FELL INTO AN ABANDONED OIL WELL IN SAN MARINO, CALIFORNIA, NEAR LOS ANGELES. TELEVISION CAMERAS BROADCAST THE RESCUE EFFORTS, MARKING THE FIRST RESCUE ATTEMPT TO APPEAR LIVE ON THE AIRWAVES. THE NATION WATCHED FOR 27h HOURS AS THE RESCUERS WORKED TO GET KATHY OUT OF THE TINY, DEEP HOLE. THE RESCUERS TOILED FOR TWO DAYS AS THE COUNTRY HELD ITS COLLECTIVE BREATH. BUT WHEN THEY FINALLY GOT DOWN TO WHERE SHE WAS, IT WAS TOO LATE. THE RESCUERS JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO EXTRICATE KATHY FROM THE WELL IN TIME.  Butler: IT APPEARED IN THE FOOTAGE THAT I SAW THAT THEY JUST HAD A LARGE CLAMSHELL EXCAVATOR, AND THEY WERE JUST DIGGING LARGE QUANTITIES OF DIRT OUT FROM THE AREA WHERE SHE WAS ENTRAPPED IN THE WELL. THAT'S VERY TIME-CONSUMING. THE VERY WELL THAT KATHY FISCUS WAS TRAPPED IN, WE CAN GET THAT TYPE OF COMPANY TO ASSIST US BY DRILLING A HOLE LARGE ENOUGH TO PUT A RESCUER IN RIGHT NEXT TO THE WELL, AND THEN WE CAN JUST LOWER A RESCUER DOWN INTO THAT HOLE, AND THEN THEY CAN BREACH THROUGH TO WHERE THE VICTIM IS AND BRING THEM OUT.  Narrator: RESCUERS NOW HAVE A NEW DEVICE CALLED THE SEARCH CAM THAT ASSISTS THEM IN LOCATING VICTIMS TRAPPED IN CONFINED SPACES. THE VIDEO CAMERA IS MOUNTED ON A LONG PROBE. IT CAN BE INSERTED INTO A HOLE AND ROTATED TO GET THE MAXIMUM VISIBILITY. THERE IS A MICROPHONE BUILT INTO THE CAMERA AND A SPEAKER, SO IF THERE IS A VICTIM THAT IS COVERED BY DEBRIS IN A HOLE, HE OR SHE CAN RESPOND TO THE RESCUER'S CALLS. THE SEARCH CAM IS A HIGH-TECH TOOL THAT ENABLES RESCUERS TO GET IN PLACES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE. THE SEARCH CAM WAS FIRST USED IN 1993 TO ASSIST THE NEW YORK CITY FIREFIGHTERS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING. IT'S BEEN USED TO UNCOVER VICTIMS IN THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING AND THE BOMBING OF THE EMBASSIES IN AFRICA.  Butler: PRIOR TO HAVING THOSE DEVICES, WE JUST HAD TO GO INTO EVERY COLLAPSED BUILDING AND DIG THROUGH THE RUBBLE TO CHECK FOR PEOPLE. AND NOW WE CAN SEARCH THESE BUILDINGS WITH A LITTLE LESS OF AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON THE BUILDING. WE CAN CHECK THE BUILDING, SEE IF THERE ARE ANY SURVIVORS AND THEN IF THERE AREN'T, WE CAN MOVE ON TO WHERE WE CAN USE OUR RESOURCES IN A MORE PRUDENT MANNER.  Narrator: IN CASE OF FIRES, THE RESCUE UNITS EMPLOY A NEW DEVICE CALLED THE THERMAL IMAGING CAMERA WHICH DIFFERENTIATES SHAPES IN A SMOKE-FILLED ROOM. UP UNTIL NOW, THE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE SIMPLY HAD TO CRAWL THROUGH THE STRUCTURE AND FEEL FOR ANY VICTIMS. ( sirens wailing ) THE USAR TEAMS ARE ALSO CALLED IN TO CONDUCT SWIFT-WATER RESCUES. THE RESCUE UNITS HOLD WATER SAFETY SEMINARS TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC, BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.  Klamecki: WE TRY TO INITIALLY START OFF WITH PUBLIC AWARENESS, WHICH WOULD BASICALLY ELIMINATE OUR JOB. BUT IF IT DOESN'T WORK, OUR NEXT STEP IS WHAT THEY CALL LAND BASE. WE TRY TO RESCUE THE PERSON FROM LAND-- THROW 'EM A ROPE, THROW 'EM A BUOY, WHATEVER. IF THAT FAILS, IF THE PERSON HAS BEEN IN THE WATER TOO LONG AND THEY'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HANDLE THE ROPE, WE CAN DO A CONTACT RESCUE.  Narrator: A CONTACT RESCUE ENTAILS LOWERING A RESCUER ON A ROPE TO WHERE THE VICTIM IS. ONCE CONTACT HAS BEEN MADE, THE RESCUER HOOKS HIMSELF TO THE VICTIM, AND THE TWO ARE HOISTED BACK TO SAFE GROUND. THIS IS A METHOD THAT DATES BACK TO THE SECOND WORLD WAR. THERE IS EVEN A SPECIAL LIFTING DEVICE FOR LARGE ANIMALS.  Klamecki: THE ANIMAL CONTROL PEOPLE HAVE DEVELOPED A HARNESS SPECIFICALLY FOR HORSES. IT'S MADE OUT OF STEEL WITH NYLON WEBBING, AND WE CAN ATTACH IT TO A HORSE, AND WE'VE SEEN IT IN THE FLOOD CONTROL CHANNELS WHERE THEY GET CAUGHT IN MUD AND ROCK, AND WE'LL ATTACH THIS HARNESS TO THEM. IN THAT CASE, OUT IN THE OPEN, WE'LL USE A HELICOPTER HOIST. COME IN, HOVER OVER THE HORSE, CLIP HIM TO THE HARNESS AND THEN LIFT THE HORSE RIGHT OUT.  Narrator: ONCE THE VICTIMS ARE SAFE, THE NEXT PHASE OF THE RESCUE TAKES PLACE-- ON-SCENE MEDICAL CARE. ALAN COWEN IS THE RETIRED CHIEF OF PARAMEDICS FOR THE L.A. FIRE DEPARTMENT. HE WAS ON THE FORCE FOR 32 YEARS.  Cowen: THE TOOLS OF THE TRADE WHEN I BEGAN MY CAREER IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE-- AND I HESITATE TO CALL IT THAT 'CAUSE REALLY, BACK IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS A VAN WITH A GURNEY AND A STRETCHER, A TANK OF OXYGEN, A FIRST-AID KIT, SOME RUBBER SPLINTS, THAT WAS IT. IN FACT, MANY AMBULANCE COMPANIES WORKED OUT OF MORTUARIES, TO SHOW YOU THE MENTALITY.  Narrator: ALAN LEARNED RESCUE MEDICINE BY BEING ON THE JOB WITH SEASONED PROFESSIONALS.  Cowen: THEY DIDN'T DO THINGS AS WELL AS TODAY. THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO PUT CERVICAL COLLARS ON AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO PUT BACKBOARDS AND BINDERS ON PATIENTS AND GETTING THEM PACKAGED, READY FOR TRANSPORTATION, BUT THEY SURE KNEW A LOT MORE ABOUT BANDAGING THAN MOST PEOPLE DO TODAY.  Narrator: ALAN REMEMBERS HIS FIRST RESCUE ATTEMPT: TRYING TO SAVE A YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD BEEN HIT BY A CAR.  Cowen: AND I REMEMBER I HAD READ ABOUT PUTTING YOUR MOUTH OVER SOMEBODY'S MOUTH AND BLOWING THE BREATH OF LIFE. I HAD READ ABOUT IT IN A BOOK. IT WASN'T BEING DONE IN 1963 TO ANY GREAT EXTENT SO I PUT MY MOUTH ON HERS, I LIFTED THE BACK OF HER HEAD UP, AND I BLEW THE AIR IN, AND I REMEMBER IN THE BACK OF THE AMBULANCE AS I COULD HEAR THE SIREN GOING, SHE LOOKED UP AT ME AND I REMEMBER HER EYES. I STILL REMEMBER IT TODAY.  Narrator: WITH ANY ON-SITE RESPONSE TEAM, TIME IS ALWAYS OF THE ESSENCE. STABILIZING THE VICTIM AND GETTING THEM TO A HOSPITAL IS THE FIRST PRIORITY.  Cowen: THE ONLY DIFFERENCE TODAY IS IT'S VERY ORGANIZED. WE DO THE SAME THINGS. WE TRIAGE, WE TREAT AND WE TRANSPORT. TRIAGE IS TO SORT OUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CRITICALLY HURT FROM THOSE THAT ARE NOT. WE TREAT, WE TRY TO STABILIZE THE PATIENT, AND THEN WE TRANSPORT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID 30, 40 AND 50 YEARS AGO.  Narrator: FOR PARAMEDICS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IS THE PORTABLE DEFIBRILLATOR FOR HEART ATTACK PATIENTS. IN THIS VIDEO, YOU CAN SEE A MAN HAVING A HEART ATTACK IN A CASINO. BUT BECAUSE THE CASINO SECURITY PERSONNEL HAD A PORTABLE DEFIBRILLATOR, THEY WERE ABLE TO SAVE THE MAN'S LIFE.  Cowen: IT READS OUT YOUR EKG. IT TELLS YOU WHEN TO SHOCK. IT TALKS TO YOU. IT SAYS, "GET YOUR HANDS OFF. SHOCK NOW. SHOCK ADVISED." BUT I THINK THERE'LL COME A TIME WHERE WE'LL HAVE A MOBILE OPERATING ROOM THAT GOES OUT TO THE PATIENT RATHER THAN BRING THE PATIENT TO THE HOSPITAL. THERE ARE EXCITING TIMES COMING IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE. HOPE I GET TO SEE 'EM.  Narrator: NEXT: HIGH-TECH RESCUES AT SEA WITH THE COAST GUARD SEARCH AND RESCUE UNIT. "RESCUE EQUIPMENT" WILL RETURN ON MODERN MARVELS. Narrator: WE NOW RETURN TO "RESCUE EQUIPMENT" ON MODERN MARVELS.  FOR OVER 200 YEARS, THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD HAS BEEN PROVIDING RESCUE SERVICES TO MARINERS IN DISTRESS.  Captain Gabe Kinney: WELL, THE COAST GUARD HAS AN OVERALL STRENGTH OF ABOUT 36 TO 37,000 PEOPLE, AND ACTUALLY, EVERYONE IN THE COAST GUARD, IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER, SUPPORTS THE SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSION. EVERY YEAR, THE COAST GUARD SAVES APPROXIMATELY 5,000 LIVES. WE RESPOND TO ABOUT 65,000 SEARCH-AND-RESCUE CALLS. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO, UH, FACILITATE, THROUGH OUR VARIOUS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, RESPONSES BY OTHER COUNTRIES, UH, EITHER IN THE PACIFIC OR-OR THE CARIBBEAN AND SO FORTH.  Narrator: THIS MIGHTY SEAFARING FORCE HAS BEEN EVOLVING SINCE 1790, WHEN ALEXANDER HAMILTON ESTABLISHED THE REVENUE CUTTER SERVICE, WHICH WAS BASICALLY A TAX- COLLECTION AGENCY FOR GOODS LANDING IN THE UNITED STATES ON SHIPS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  Robert Browning: SO, THEY HAD TO HAVE A ARMED PRESENCE OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ENFORCED THOSE TAXES, AND SO THEY ESTABLISHED TEN CUTTERS INITIALLY, TO PATROL THE DIFFERENT, UH, MAJOR COAST OF THE UNITED STATES.  Narrator: FOREIGN IMMIGRATION AND TRADE GREW ALONG WITH THE NATION, AND THEREFORE, SO DID THE NUMBER OF SHIPWRECKS THAT OCCURRED ON AMERICAN SHORES. IN 1848, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEGAN ORGANIZING OFFICIAL RESCUE SHEDS ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD. THESE SHEDS WERE EQUIPPED WITH THE RESCUE EQUIPMENT OF THE DAY-- A FEW BOATS AND AN APPARATUS TO SEND A LINE OUT TO THE VESSEL IN DISTRESS. THE EQUIPMENT WAS CRUDE AND NOT ALWAYS SAFE, AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS FINDING TRAINED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD OVERSEE THE RESCUE. SUMNER INCREASE KIMBALL ADDRESSED THAT PROBLEM IN 1871. KIMBALL WAS THE HEAD OF THE REVENUE CUTTER SERVICE AT THE TIME AND HE BEGAN MANNING THE SHEDS, SOMETIMES WITH A TEAM OF RESCUERS AND SOMETIMES WITH JUST ONE STATION KEEPER, TO MAINTAIN THE EQUIPMENT AND ORGANIZE THE RESCUE TEAMS WHEN NEEDED. BY 1878, KIMBALL ESTABLISHED A SEPARATE BUREAU WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT, APPROPRIATELY CALLED "THE UNITED STATES LIFESAVING SERVICE."  Browning: I CAN'T IMAGINE MODERN PEOPLE DOING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT-THAT THESE PEOPLE DID. I THINK THEY WERE... THEY WERE, UH, UH, IN A LOT OF CASES, JUST FEARLESS IN... IN GOING OUT IN THESE SMALL BOATS IN-IN STORMS THAT HAD WRECKED MUCH LARGER SHIPS, AND TRYING TO SAVE SOMEBODY ELSE, AND IT WAS ALL FOR VERY LITTLE PAY AND THEY HAD NO BENEFITS.  Narrator: DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THE LIFESAVING SERVICE, A MAN NAMED JOHN LYLE CAME UP WITH A BETTER DEVICE FOR SENDING A LINE OUT TO THE BOATS. THE LYLE GUN FIRED A PROJECTILE THAT TOOK A LINE OUT TO THE SINKING VESSEL. THE LINE COULD REACH OUT 600 YARDS.  Browning: ACTUALLY, THE-THE GUN THAT LYLE INVENTED, UH, THEY WERE STILL MAKING RESCUES, UH, BASICALLY 60 YEARS LATER, WITH THIS GUN. UH, IT WAS STILL THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO GET A LINE OUT TO A VESSEL.  Narrator: THE RESCUE PERSONNEL FROM THE LIFESAVING SERVICE WOULD PATROL THE BEACH, LOOKING FOR FLARES FROM SHIPS IN DISTRESS.  Browning: WHEN THEY SPOT A WRECK-- OF COURSE THEY HAVE TO RUN BACK TO THE STATION, WHICH AGAIN IS A MILE OR TWO BACK, POTENTIALLY. THEY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THEN WHETHER TO USE THE LYLE GUN TO TRY TO MAKE THE RESCUE FROM SHORE, OR TO USE SOME KIND OF A BOAT. SO, THE EAST COAST STATIONS HAD WHAT WAS CALLED A SURF BOAT, AND THAT WOULD BE TAKEN TO THE WRECK ON A WAGON, AND EITHER THE MEN PULLED IT BY THEMSELVES, BY LINES, OR THEY HAD HORSES THAT- THAT TOOK IT TO THE BEACH AND TO THE SITE OF THE WRECK.  Narrator: THE RESCUERS WOULD PHYSICALLY GO TO THE FAILING VESSEL OR THEY WOULD SEND UP A LINE AND ATTACH EITHER A LIFE CAR, WHICH WAS HEAVY BUT COULD CARRY SEVERAL PEOPLE AT ONCE, OR A LIGHTER BREECHES BUOY, TO BRING THE VICTIMS ASHORE.  Browning: AND THEY HAVE THE BREECHES BUOY, WHICH IS THE WAY THAT THE PEOPLE GOT FROM THE SHIP TO THE SHORE, WHICH IS... BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE A LIFE PRESERVER WITH CUTOFF PANTS IN IT, WHERE YOU ACTUALLY SIT INTO THIS... INTO THIS DEVICE AND ARE CARRIED FROM THE SHIP TO THE SHORE.  Narrator: IN 1915, SUMNER KIMBALL MERGED THE LIFESAVING SERVICE WITH THE REVENUE CUTTER SERVICE, AND FORMED THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD. IT SEEMED A NATURAL COMBINATION, SINCE BOTH WERE PATROLLING THE COASTLINE AND KIMBALL WANTED TO GET BENEFITS FOR THE HARDWORKING MEN IN HIS BUREAU.  Browning: 'CAUSE THEY WERE LITERALLY SERVING UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST DEAD. THE COAST GUARD'S MOST FAMOUS LIFESAVER, JOSHUA JAMES, SERVED INTO HIS LATE 60s AND HE LITERALLY, AT A BEACH DRILL, JUST DROPPED OVER DEAD ON THE BEACH.  Narrator: IN THE LAST 75 YEARS, THE COAST GUARD HAS ALSO BEEN IN THE LEAD IN DEVELOPING MORE SOPHISTICATED COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS FOR SENDING AND RECEIVING DISTRESS SIGNALS. THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC  PROVIDED THE IMPETUS FOR DEVELOPING A BETTER MEANS OF SIGNALING AT SEA. BESIDES MORSE CODE, THE CREW HAD NO MEANS TO COMMUNICATE WITH VESSELS FAR BEYOND THE LINE OF SIGHT. BECAUSE OF THE TITANIC DISASTER, THE COAST GUARD IMPLEMENTED THE INTERNATIONAL ICE PATROL THAT STILL TRACKS ICEBERGS AS THEY FLOW FROM THE NORTH ATLANTIC INTO THE SHIPPING LANES. AFTER THE 1915 MERGER WITH THE REVENUE CUTTER SERVICE, THE RESCUE TECHNOLOGIES OF THE COAST GUARD BEGAN TO IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY. DURING WORLD WAR II, THE COAST GUARD WAS GIVEN THE TASK OF DEVELOPING THE HELICOPTER AS A RECONNAISSANCE TOOL FOR THE MILITARY.  Browning: THEY WERE LOOKING AT IT TO SPOT SUBMARINES, BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF COAST GUARD OFFICERS, AND ONE IN PARTICULAR, FRANK ERICSON, WHO SAW THE RESCUE POTENTIALS OF THE HELICOPTER, AND HE HAD PUSHED THIS ALL ALONG, AND THE HELICOPTER IN MANY WAYS IS THE NEXT GREAT CHANGE FOR THE LIFE... FOR THE LIFESAVING SERVICE, OR THE... OR THE LIFESAVING CAPABILITIES OF THE COAST GUARD.  Narrator: THE HELICOPTER PROVED TO BE A VITAL TOOL. IN MARCH OF 1990, COAST GUARD RESCUED SIX CREW MEMBERS OF THE ALASKAN MONARCH FROM THE ICY BERING SEA. THE COAST GUARD'S BOAT COULDN'T GET THROUGH THE ICE, BUT AFTER THE MAYDAY WAS TRANSMITTED, THE HELICOPTER ARRIVED ON THE SCENE WITHIN MINUTES.  Kinney: CERTAINLY THE TECHNOLOGY OF AIRCRAFT HAS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE '50s, AND OUR AIRCRAFT OF TODAY, OUR-OUR JAY HAWK HELICOPTERS AND OUR DAUPHINE H65 HELICOPTERS ARE REALLY WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER STATE-OF-THE-ART WHEN IT COMES TO A SEARCH-AND-RESCUE TOOL.  Narrator: THROUGHOUT ITS 200- YEAR HISTORY, THE COAST GUARD HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING BOATS AND CUTTERS THAT PERFORM SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY IN HIGH WINDS AND ROUGH SEA CONDITIONS. THE FIRST SELF-RIGHTING, SELF- BAILING VESSEL DATES BACK TO 19th CENTURY ENGLAND. THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE MOTOR LIFEBOAT IS 47 FEET AND CAN RIGHT ITSELF IN FIVE SECONDS IN HEAVY SEAS. IT IS ENGINEERED WITH SPECIAL BALLAST AND AN IRON KEEL THAT WORK WITH THE FORCE OF GRAVITY TO TURN THE BOAT RIGHT-SIDE UP. AN ONBOARD ENGINE AUTOMATICALLY PUMPS ANY EXCESS WATER OUT OF THE BOAT.  Kinney: THE 47-FOOT MOTOR LIFEBOAT IS THE NEWEST ADDITION TO THE COAST GUARD'S SMALL-BOAT FLEET. IT IS ON THE LEADING EDGE OF SEARCH-AND-RESCUE TECHNOLOGY. IT GIVES US THE CAPABILITY TO GO OUT IN VERY BAD SEAS, AND BRING BOTH THE-THE FOLKS IN DISTRESS AND OUR OWN CREW BACK, UH, IN A SAFE MANNER. IT-IT'S LARGE ENOUGH THAT IT CAN HANDLE VERY SEVERE CONDITIONS, BUT IT ALSO HAS THE-THE STRENGTH AND THE TECHNOLOGY TO REALLY DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF GETTING THROUGH VERY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS IN DOING A RESCUE MISSION.  Narrator: IN THE COAST GUARD SEARCH-AND-RESCUE UNIT, COMMUNICATION IS THE NAME OF THE GAME. THE FASTER THEY MAKE CONTACT WITH THE VESSEL IN DISTRESS, THE QUICKER THEY CAN PINPOINT THEIR LOCATION.  Kinney: COAST GUARD HAS A VERY EXTENSIVE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, BOTH, UH, MEDIUM FREQUENCY, HIGH FREQUENCY, AND ALSO VHF-FM RADIOS, UH, WHICH IS THE-THE MOST COMMON MEANS THAT ARE USED FOR MARINERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE COAST GUARD. IF WE HAVE A GOOD LOCATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL, IF WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE, THROUGH RADIO OR WHATEVER COMMUNICATIONS MEANS THAT WE HAVE, THEN IT ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATES THE SEARCH FROM SEARCH-AND-RESCUE.  Narrator: THE COAST GUARD IS DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ENHANCE THE WORLD OF SEARCH-AND-RESCUE IN THE FUTURE.  Lt. Commander Paul Steward: WE HAVE A VISION 2020, WHICH WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE EARLY 21st CENTURY FOR DEVELOPMENT, AND I MEAN, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT RIGHT NOW DON'T LOOK REALISTIC. UH, VACUUM CLEANERS FROM AIRCRAFT TO PICK PEOPLE UP? THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS, BUT OBVIOUSLY IN THE 1800s, A PIECE OF METAL WITH A ROTARY WING ON TOP, FLAPPING IN THE SKY, PICKING PEOPLE UP OUT OF THE WATER, SEEMED RIDICULOUS, TOO.  Narrator: COMING UP: THEY CAN PULL A CRUMPLED CAR APART IN MINUTES: THE POWERFUL JAWS OF LIFE. "RESCUE EQUIPMENT" WILL RETURN ON MODERN MARVELS.   Narrator: WE NOW RETURN TO "RESCUE EQUIPMENT" ON MODERN MARVELS. WE SEE IT ALL TOO OFTEN. CRUMPLED, MANGLED METAL-- A VEHICLE BEYOND RECOGNITION. FOR RESCUE WORKERS, THE MAIN GOAL IS THE EXTRACT THE DRIVER AND ANY PASSENGERS FROM THE CRUSHED REMAINS OF THE AUTOMOBILE, AND GET THEM MEDICAL CARE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THEY CALL IT HEAVY ENTRAPMENT.  Robert Linster: THE FIRST THING THAT A RESCUER IS TAUGHT WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THE ACCIDENT SCENE IS TRY THE DOOR HANDLE, BECAUSE IT JUST MIGHT OPEN AND IF IT DOES, YOU'RE OFF TO A GOOD START. AND BASICALLY, IF YOU NEED TO BEND METAL, MOVE METAL, THAT'S HEAVY ENTRAPMENT.  Narrator: UP UNTIL THE LATE '60s, RESCUERS HAD A DIFFICULT TIME EXTRICATING VICTIMS FROM A VEHICLE THAT HAD BEEN CRUSHED IN AN ACCIDENT.  Linster: THEY WOULD USE A PORTA POWER, WHICH IS A MANUALLY PUMPED SMALL TOOL THAT IS USED IN THE SHEET METAL BUSINESS. THEY ALSO USED A PRODUCT CALLED A PRY BAR. THEY WOULD USE BRUTE FORCE. THEY WOULD USE HACKSAWS.  Narrator: OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS, A POWERFUL TOOL HAS EVOLVED THAT CAN OPEN UP AN AUTOMOBILE IN MERE MINUTES. BECAUSE OF ITS INCREDIBLE STRENGTH, THEY CALL IT THE JAWS OF LIFE. AND WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TOOL CAME A NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT THE ACCIDENT SCENE.  Larry Anderson: HEAVY ENTRAPMENT IS BASICALLY WHEN THE METAL IS FOLDED UP AROUND THE PERSON AND YOU HAVE TO REDIRECT IT TO GET IT AWAY FROM THEM. WE DON'T TAKE THE PERSON OUT OF THE VEHICLE, WE TAKE THE VEHICLE FROM AROUND THE PERSON. MY PHILOSOPHY IS THE GO-CART PHILOSOPHY. IF I CAN MAKE THAT CAR LOOK LIKE A GO-CART, THERE'S NOTHING AROUND THAT PERSON TO HAMPER REMOVAL AND PACKAGING AND STABILIZING. THE LESS I HAVE TO MANIPULATE THAT PERSON TO PACKAGE HIM, THE LESS CHANCE OF CAUSING MORE AGGRAVATION TO AN INJURY.  Narrator: THE REVOLUTIONARY TOOL THAT COULD CUT AND SPREAD METAL QUICKLY WAS FIRST DEVELOPED BY GEORGE HURST IN THE 1960s. ITS FIRST APPLICATION WAS IN THE WORLD OF PROFESSIONAL CAR RACING.  Linster: THE TOOL WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED THE HURST POWER RESCUE TOOL. GEORGE HURST, WHO IS THE INVENTOR, WAS THE OWNER OF A COMPANY THAT MADE RACING EQUIPMENT, ENGINE CONVERSION KITS AND THAT SORT OF THING FOR AFTER-MARKET RACING, AND ALSO FOR INDY CARS, UM... DAYTONA-TYPE RACING, CIRCLE TRACK CARS. AND GEORGE HAD THIS VISION OF FREEING TRAPPED DRIVERS THAT WOULD GET ENTANGLED IN THE ROLL CAGE OF AN AUTOMOBILE AND GIVE THEM A BETTER CHANCE OF SURVIVAL. SO HE DECIDED TO TAKE HIS INGENUITY THAT HE USED IN OTHER THINGS AND APPLY THEM TO RACING.  Announcer: IN TURN TWO WE HAVE A REPORT OF A PROBLEM...  Announcer 2: ...THE JAWS OF LIFE, THAT'S WHAT THAT SIGNAL INDICATES. THEY'RE GOING TO WANT THOSE JAWS TO TRY AND PRY THE CAR OUT.  Narrator: BY THE LATE 1960s, HURST'S INVENTION BECAME AN INDISPENSABLE PART OF TRACK SAFETY. AND IN THE EARLY 1970s, HE DECIDED TO BRING THE TECHNOLOGY OFF THE RACETRACK AND ONTO THE STREETS. HE WENT ABOUT MAKING A SMALLER, PORTABLE VERSION THAT COULD BE USED IN EVERYDAY TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THE TOOL GOT THE NAME THAT IS ITS TRADEMARK TODAY.  Linster: IT WAS CALLED A HURST POWER RESCUE TOOL, AND DURING ONE OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS SOMEONE HAD SAID, "WOW, THIS TOOL SAVES PEOPLE FROM THE JAWS OF DEATH." AND SUBSEQUENTLY WE STARTED CALLING IT THE JAWS OF LIFE, AND THAT NAME STUCK, AND IT STICKS TO THIS DAY.  Narrator: THE RELEASE OF THE JAWS OF LIFE FOR PUBLIC USE CAME AS A WELCOME AND MUCH-NEEDED ADDITION FOR RESCUE TEAMS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.  Alan Cowen: BACK IN THE '60s WHEN I BEGAN, THERE WERE NO JAWS OF LIFE. THERE WERE... WE USED LARGE CROWBARS TO EXTRICATE PEOPLE FROM VEHICLES. AND MANY OF THEM DIDN'T GET EXTRICATED. THEY WERE IN THERE, AND THEY DIED IN THERE. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE JAWS OF LIFE, YOU CAN PEEL A CAR APART IN MATTER OF A FEW MINUTES. IT CAN JUST POP THE TOPS OFF VEHICLES AND JUST SPLIT A CAR OPEN, REMOVE DOORS... AND RIGHT THROUGH STEEL.  Narrator: AT ITS WIDEST, THE ARMS OF THE JAWS OF LIFE CAN SPREAD UP TO 40 INCHES. THE PRESSURE GENERATED BETWEEN THE ARMS CAN PRODUCE 35,000 POUNDS OF FORCE. THIS FORCE IS PRODUCED BY A GASOLINE ENGINE WITH A RECIPROCATING PUMP.  Linster: WE DEVELOPED A PUMP THAT HAD TWO STAGES-- ONE HIGH FLOW, LOW PRESSURE, WHICH WOULD RUN FROM ZERO TO 600 P.S.I. LINE PRESSURE. AND THEN ONCE IT MET RESISTANCE, IT WOULD SHIFT INTO A LOW FLOW, HIGH PRESSURE THAT WOULD GO FROM 600 P.S.I. UP TO 5,000 P.S.I. AT A HALF GALLON A MINUTE.  Narrator: THE TOOL CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION OF RESCUE WORKERS AROUND THE COUNTRY, BUT THE COST, FROM $6,000 TO $12,000 WAS SOMETIMES PROHIBITIVE.  Linster: OFTENTIMES THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, RESCUE SQUAD, WHATEVER AGENCY IT MIGHT BE THAT'S INTERESTED IN PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT, DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY. SO THEY WOULD DO WHAT THEY NORMALLY DO, AND THAT'S GO INTO FUND-RAISING. THAT CAN VARY FROM ANYWHERE FROM STANDING ON A STREET CORNER WITH BOOTS OR HELMETS EXPECTING PEOPLE TO... TO DEPOSIT SOME COINS OR SOMETHING AT A TRAFFIC SIGNAL, DOWN THROUGH PANCAKE DINNERS, HAMS SUPPERS, SPAGHETTI DINNERS, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE TO TARGET REACHING A GOAL.  Narrator: OVER THE LAST 27 YEARS, HURST HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO REFINING THE JAWS OF LIFE TO FIT MORE OF THE NEEDS OF THE RESCUE COMMUNITY. AT THEIR MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SHELBY, NORTH CAROLINA, THEY RESEARCH AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS EVERY YEAR, AND TEST NEW TECHNIQUES FOR QUICKER, SAFER EXTRICATION.  Anderson: THE TOOL WE USE TO REMOVE THE WINDSHIELD TODAY IS CALLED THE SLICE OF LIFE. IT GIVES US BETTER CONTROL OF GLASS FRAGGING THROUGH THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. YEARS AGO WE USED TO USE AN AXE.  Linster: WE'VE COME OUT WITH A PRODUCT WE CALL THE WARTHOG THAT ALLOWS US TO STABILIZE THE CAR SO IT STAYS PUT. WE HAVE LIFTING PNEUMATIC BAGS THAT CAN LIFT THINGS OFF OF PEOPLE OR MOVE THINGS OUT OF THE WAY THAT NEED TO BE MOVED. WE RECENTLY INTRODUCED THE PYROTECHNIC CUTTER WHICH USES A CARTRIDGE AND IS TOTALLY PORTABLE.  Narrator: EVERY YEAR RESCUE TEAMS SAVE THOUSANDS OF LIVES, ARMED WITH THE POWER OF THE JAWS OF LIFE.  Anderson: MOST FIREFIGHTERS, RESCUE PEOPLE, SOMETIME IN THEIR LIFE, HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY A FIRE, OR THEIR HOUSE, OR A FAMILY RELATIVE HAD A HOUSE BURNED DOWN, OR THE FAMILY MEMBER OR A GOOD FRIEND GOT CAUGHT IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND BADLY INJURED. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT MOTIVATE A LOT OF PEOPLE. THEY WANT TO BE USEFUL AND HELPFUL AND THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN TO ANYBODY ELSE.  Announcer: NEXT: BURIED ALIVE UNDER TONS OF HARD SNOWPACK. THE AWESOME FORCE OF AVALANCHES AND THE RESCUE TECHNOLOGY THAT COMBATS THE DANGER. "RESCUE EQUIPMENT" WILL RETURN ON MODERN MARVELS.   Narrator: WE NOW RETURN TO "RESCUE EQUIPMENT" ON MODERN MARVELS. THE POWERFUL FORCE OF NATURE STRIKES WITHOUT WARNING. AN AVALANCHE CAN BE TRIGGERED BY THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE AND CAN CAUSE THE MOST DEVASTATING DESTRUCTION IN ITS INCREDIBLE WAKE.  Dale Atkins: WHEN THE SLAB AVALANCHE RELEASES, THEY ACCELERATE ALMOST INSTANTLY. THEY'RE RACING DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE AND A MODERATE-SIZED AVALANCHE MIGHT BE ONE THAT FALLS... 800 TO A THOUSAND VERTICAL FEET. IT MIGHT BE 300 FEET ACROSS AND PERHAPS THREE FEET DEEP AND THAT'S GOING TO FALL DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE AT SPEEDS OF 60, 70, 80, 90 MILES AN HOUR.  Narrator: AVALANCHE RESCUE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF RECORDED HISTORY.  Atkins: WE HAVE TO GO BACK OVER 2,000 YEARS AGO TO THE GREEK GEOGRAPHER STRABO, WHO TRAVELED AROUND THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS NEAR THE BLACK SEA, AND HE WRITES OF THE SHEPHERDS CARRYING STAFFS, NOT JUST FOR THEIR SHEEP, BUT IF THEY WERE BURIED IN AN AVALANCHE, THEY COULD STICK THE STAFF UP THROUGH THE SNOW, AND I THINK IT ACTUALLY GOT KIND OF TURNED AROUND A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE BURIED IN THE SNOW, YOU CAN'T MOVE. YOU CAN'T EVEN PUSH ANYTHING THROUGH THE SURFACE, AND I THINK THESE STAFFS WERE USED TO HELP FIND PEOPLE THAT WERE BURIED UNDERNEATH THE SNOW.  Narrator: THE ROMAN POET SILIUS ITALICUS WROTE ABOUT HANNIBAL IN 218 B.C. WHO LOST THOUSANDS OF MEN AND SCORES OF ELEPHANTS IN AVALANCHES WHILE CROSSING THE ALPS. IN APPROXIMATELY 1050 A.D., SAINT BERNARD AND HIS MONKS BEGAN PATROLLING THE ALPS SEARCHING FOR TRAVELERS WHO WERE CAUGHT IN THE ONSLAUGHT OF SNOW. THE MONKS DEPLOYED LARGE DOGS, KNOWN AS "BARRY DOGS," TO ASSIST THEM IN FINDING THOSE TRAVELERS WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE "WHITE DEATH." THESE GENTLE GIANTS HAD AN EXCELLENT SENSE OF DIRECTION AND COULD MANEUVER EASILY THROUGH THE THICK SNOW. NAPOLEON WROTE THAT WHEN HE CROSSED THE ALPS IN 1800, HE DIDN'T LOSE ANY OF HIS 250,000 MEN, THANKS TO THE MONKS AND THEIR DOGS. THE IMAGE OF THE SAINT BERNARD WITH THE BRANDY KEG REACHED MYTHIC PROPORTIONS, EVEN THOUGH THE DOGS NEVER CARRIED ALCOHOL. THE BARRELS WERE USED TO TRANSPORT MILK TO THE MONASTERY FROM THE DAIRY. FOR CENTURIES AVALANCHES CONTINUED TO PLAGUE THE ALPS, AND EVEN PLAYED A DECISIVE ROLE IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR.  Atkins: THE AVALANCHES WERE REALLY A... A POWERFUL WEAPON OF WAR IN WORLD WAR I, KILLING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS AND, DEPENDING WHICH, UH... HISTORIAN WE LOOK AT, UH... WE CAN SAY THAT AS MANY AS 40,000 TO 60,000 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED BY AVALANCHES DURING THE THREE WINTERS OF WORLD WAR I. IN FACT, IN DECEMBER OF 1916, 6,000 TROOPS, AUSTRIAN AND ITALIAN SOLDIERS, WERE KILLED BY AVALANCHES IN A 48-HOUR PERIOD.  Narrator: AFTER WORLD WAR II, MORE PEOPLE WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS FOR RECREATION AND INCREASED THE NEED FOR RESCUE TEAMS AND RESCUE EQUIPMENT. EXPERIENCED CLIMBERS WOULD VOLUNTEER TO GO AND SEARCH FOR THOSE BURIED UNDER THE SNOW, USING THE RUDIMENTARY TOOLS THAT MOUNTAINEERS HAD AT THE TIME.  Atkins: A LOT OF THE EQUIPMENT IN MOUNTAIN RESCUE REALLY HASN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH IN THE LAST 50 YEARS. I LIKE TO SAY THAT REALLY IT'S JUST THE COLORS OF THE EQUIPMENT ARE BRIGHTER, BUT GOING BACK 50 YEARS AGO, THE BASIC TOOLS OF THE MOUNTAIN RESCUER WERE ROPE, SOME BASIC CLIMBING EQUIPMENT, AND A BACKPACK WITH A LITTLE EXTRA CLOTHING AND FOOD, AND IN ESSENCE, THAT'S STILL A LOT OF WHAT THE EQUIPMENT IS THAT'S USED TODAY.  Charley Shimanski: NOWADAYS WE HAVE EQUIPMENT MADE FROM TITANIUM, VERY LIGHTWEIGHT. IN THE EARLY DAYS, EVERYTHING WAS MADE OF STEEL AND VERY HEAVY. THE ROPES WERE VERY HEAVY. NOWADAYS EVERYTHING'S MUCH MORE LIGHTWEIGHT, AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR WHEN YOU'RE CARRYING THIS EQUIPMENT TWO AND THREE MILES INTO THE FIELD TO TO THE SITE OF THE RESCUE.  Narrator: ONE CONSTANT IN THE AVALANCHE RESCUE WORLD IS THE USE OF DOGS TO PICK UP THE SCENT OF THOSE VICTIMS WHO ARE BURIED IN DEEP, PACKED SNOW. A DOG'S NOSE IS HUNDREDS OF TIMES MORE SENSITIVE THAN A HUMAN'S.  Shimanski: IF YOU'VE GOT AN AVALANCHE DEBRIS FIELD THAT'S A HUNDRED BY A HUNDRED METERS AND YOU TAKE 20 RESCUERS INTO THAT AREA, IT CAN TAKE FOUR TO SIX HOURS FOR THEM TO SEARCH THAT AREA THOROUGHLY, WHEREAS A WELL- TRAINED AVALANCHE DOG CAN SEARCH THE SAME AREA IN 25 MINUTES.  Man: SEARCH IT. SEARCH IT.  Cathy Fraser: DOGS ARE PRETTY AMAZING WHEN THEY GET ON A DEBRIS FIELD. WHERE HUMANS CAN'T SEE ANYTHING A DOG WILL DO A SEARCH PATTERN, LIKE ANGEL HAS DONE, THIS ZIGZAG SEARCH PATTERN, IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY WINDS, AND SHE'LL LOCATE THE PERSON OR SHE'LL WORK DOWNWIND AND THE HUMAN SCENT IS EMANATING FROM THE SNOWPACK AND SHE CAN IDENTIFY THE PERSON THEN.  Narrator: WHILE DOGS ARE EXTREMELY USEFUL, A NEW ELECTRONIC TRANSCEIVER HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE ABILITY OF MOUNTAIN RESCUERS TO LOCATE A PERSON BURIED IN THE SNOW.  Shimanski: THE AVALANCHE TRANSCEIVER IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS OF THIS CENTURY IN TERMS OF BACK-COUNTRY USERS. THE TRANSCEIVER IS FAIRLY SIMPLE. IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SONY WALKMAN. I WOULD HAVE ONE, MY SKIING PARTNER WOULD HAVE ONE, AND IF ONE OF US WERE BURIED IN AN AVALANCHE, THE OTHER WOULD TAKE THEIR TRANSCEIVER AND ATTACH TO IT A TINY LITTLE EARPIECE THAT WE WOULD PUT IN THE EAR AND BY CHANGING THE ORIENTATION OF OUR BEACON, WE CAN VIRTUALLY FIND SOMEBODY IN AN AVALANCHE DEBRIS FIELD THAT WE CAN'T SEE A SINGLE TRACE OF WITH THE NAKED EYE.  Narrator: RESCUERS ALSO USE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM UNITS THAT TELL THEM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. 15 YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED WORKING IN SEARCH AND RESCUE, WE HAD TO BE REALLY, REALLY STRONG IN OUR MAP AND COMPASS SKILLS, SO THAT WE COULD IDENTIFY WHERE WE WERE VIRTUALLY ANY TIME OF THE DAY OR NIGHT, AND NOWADAYS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO WHAT WE DO IS THE GPS UNIT, GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM UNIT, WHICH WORKS BY RECEIVING SIGNALS FROM A MULTITUDE OF SATELLITES FLYING OVERHEAD AND TELLS ME WHERE I AM.  Narrator: FORECASTERS ANALYZE TERRAIN, SNOWPACK CONDITIONS AND WEATHER PATTERNS TO PREDICT POTENTIAL AVALANCHE DANGERS, AND WHILE RESCUE METHODS HAVE IMPROVED, SOMETIMES THE BEST WEAPON IS PREVENTION.  Atkins: HIGHWAY DEPARTMENTS AND SKI AREAS USE EXPLOSIVES TO TRIGGER AVALANCHES AND THEY DELIVER THE EXPLOSIVES A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS. THEY CAN USE ARTILLERY WEAPONS THAT ARE MILITARY SURPLUS. WE ALSO USE GAS-PROPELLED TYPE CANNONS THAT WILL LAUNCH AN EXPLOSIVE CHARGE UP ONTO A MOUNTAINSIDE, OR THE THIRD WAY WE DO IT IS WITH HAND CHARGES WHERE SKI PATROLLERS WILL TOSS THE EXPLOSIVE CHARGES OUT ONTO THE AVALANCHE-PRONE SLOPE TO TRIGGER THE AVALANCHE.  Narrator: WITH MORE PEOPLE VISITING THE BACK COUNTRY AND MOUNTAINS FOR SKIING, HIKING AND OTHER RECREATIONAL SPORTS, THE EXPERTS FEEL THAT BECOMING EDUCATED ABOUT AVALANCHE DANGERS IS THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT A DISASTER.  Shimanski: YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE GADGETS IN THE WORLD. UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO SAFELY USE THEM AND WHEN YOU'RE TAKING UNNECESSARY RISK, YOU'RE REALLY NOT A SAFE USER OF THE BACK COUNTRY, SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO PROMOTE EDUCATION AS WELL, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SORT OF TRANSCENDS TECHNOLOGY AND GENERATIONS AND THAT SORT OF THING.  Announcer: COMING UP: SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY GETS INTO THE RESCUE GAME. SOPHISTICATED INSTRUMENTS ACCURATELY PINPOINT LOCATIONS OF PLANE CRASHES AND SHIPWRECKS. "RESCUE EQUIPMENT" WILL RETURN ON MODERN MARVELS. Narrator: WE NOW RETURN TO "RESCUE EQUIPMENT" ON MODERN MARVELS.  IN THE 1980s, THE WORLD OF SEARCH AND RESCUE JOINED THE SPACE AGE THROUGH ITS USE OF SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY.  Ajay Mehta: THE TECHNOLOGY'S ESTABLISHED. THE USE OF IT IS FAIRLY NEW-- JUST SINCE THE '80s. WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THE CAPABILITIES TO TRANSMIT SIGNALS TO A SATELLITE AND PROCESS 'EM, BUT TO TURN AROUND AND USE THOSE SIGNALS AND LOCATE PEOPLE...  Narrator: THE COSPAS-SARSAT PROGRAM IS A COOPERATIVE EFFORT OF FRANCE, THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND RUSSIA. IT IS A SATELLITE-TRACKING SYSTEM THAT PICKS UP AND RELAYS SIGNALS FROM DISTRESS BEACONS AROUND THE WORLD. COSPAS IS AN ACRONYM FOR THE RUSSIAN SATELLITES THAT CARRY THE EQUIPMENT.  Mehta: SARSAT STANDS FOR "SEARCH AND RESCUE SATELLITE AIDED TRACKING," AND IT'S ACTUALLY THE NAME OF THE INSTRUMENT THAT FLIES ON THE NOAA SATELLITES.  Narrator: NOAA-- THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION-- HAS SATELLITES THAT MONITOR WEATHER CONDITIONS FROM SPACE. THE SARSAT INSTRUMENT IS A PAYLOAD ON THESE SATELLITES. RUSSIA JOINED THE PROGRAM TO HELP PROTECT HER LARGE FISHING FLEET.  James Bailey: AND PLUS, THEY HAD JUST FINISHED THE APOLLO-SOYUZ VENTURE WITH NASA, AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR OTHER SPACE PROGRAMS THEY COULD BE COOPERATIVE IN, AND WHEN THEY SAW THE SEARCH AND RESCUE BUSINESS, THEY DECIDED THAT WAS A GOOD ONE FOR THEM TO GET ON BOARD WITH AS WELL.  Narrator: THE CONCEPT IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE. BOATS AND AIRPLANES ARE EQUIPPED WITH ELECTRONIC LOCATING TRANSMITTERS OR BEACONS. IF THE BOAT OR PLANE IS IN DANGER, THE TRANSMITTER IS AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATED AND SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE SATELLITE. THE SATELLITE PROCESSES THE INFORMATION AND RELAYS IT TO THE NEAREST GROUND TERMINAL. THE GROUND STATION TRANSMITS TO A MISSION CONTROL CENTER. MISSION CONTROL DETERMINES WHICH RESCUE COORDINATION CENTER IS THE CLOSEST, AND PASSES ON THE LOCATION INFORMATION.  Officer: COAST GUARD COMMAND CENTER, LIEUTENANT COMMANDER ROBBINS.  Mehta: THE MISSION CONTROL CENTERS ARE LOCATED IN SOUTH AMERICA AND COUNTRIES LIKE CHILE, BRAZIL, PERU. THEY'RE IN EUROPE AND U.K., IN FRANCE, SPAIN. RUSSIA HAS ONE... INDIA, AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND, CHINA, JAPAN.  Narrator: THE NOAA POLAR ORBITING SATELLITES ARE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 458 MILES AND TRAVEL ONCE AROUND THE EARTH EVERY 90 MINUTES. BECAUSE THEY ARE SO FAST, WHEN THEY DETECT A DISTRESS SIGNAL, THEY USE A PHYSICAL PHENOMENON CALLED THE DOPPLER SHIFT TO DETERMINE ITS EXACT LOCATION.  Mehta: WHEN THEY DETECT A SIGNAL, THEY DON'T ACTUALLY DETECT IT AT THE FREQUENCY THAT THE BEACON'S TRANSMITTING, MUCH LIKE A TRAIN WHISTLE. WHEN YOU HEAR A TRAIN WHISTLE, IF IT'S STATIONARY, IT SOUNDS A CERTAIN WAY, BUT IF IT'S COMING TOWARD YOU, THE PITCH CHANGES AND AS IT'S GOING AWAY FROM YOU, THE PITCH CHANGES. THAT'S THE DOPPLER SHIFT, AND THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE USE TO LOCATE SIGNALS.  Narrator: THE SARSAT INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO ABOARD THE "GOES" OR "GEOSTATIONARY OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITES." THESE ARE ALMOST 23,000 MILES UP IN SPACE AND ROTATE WITH THE EARTH. THEY RECEIVE THE LOCATION INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE BEACONS AS LONG AS THE BEACONS ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM.  Mehta: THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN GET A LOCATION IS IF THE BEACON ITSELF TRANSMITS ITS POSITION IN ITS SIGNAL, AND THAT'S POSSIBLE WITH NEWER BEACONS. THEY HAVE... MOST OF THEM HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S CALLED A "GPS RECEIVER" WHICH ACTUALLY GETS ITS POSITION FROM ANOTHER SERIES OF SATELLITES, THE GPS SATELLITES. IT'LL CALCULATE ITS POSITION AND THEN SEND IT AND THE SIGNAL TO OUR SATELLITES, SO THAT WE KNOW RIGHT AWAY WHOSE BEACON IS BEING ACTIVATED AS WELL AS WHERE IT'S BEING ACTIVATED.  Narrator: TODAY'S NEW GPS BEACONS OPERATE ON A SEPARATE DESIGNATED FREQUENCY. THIS DIMINISHES THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE ALARMS THAT HAD BEEN CAUSED BY INADVERTENT SIGNALS FROM GARAGE DOOR OPENERS AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES.  Lieutenant Colonel Mark Perkins: OUT OF A HUNDRED SIGNALS, FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT 97 OF THOSE HUNDRED WOULD BE "NON-DISTRESS ALERTS" IS WHAT WE CALL THEM. THREE OF THEM, THOUGH, ARE DISTRESS, SO WE HAVE TO TREAT THEM ALL LIKE THEY'RE REAL. WE LOOK AT IT AS KIND OF LIKE DETECTIVES, REALLY. WE HAVE A SIGNAL. WE HAVE A MYSTERY. WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE IT. WE HOPE IT'S NOT DISTRESS, BUT WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS.  Narrator: FROM THE FIRST SAVE IN 1982 UNTIL TODAY, THE PROGRAM HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL.  Lieutenant Commander Paul Steward: WE'VE SEEN OVER 12,000 LIVES SAVED SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN THE UNITED STATES, AND IN THE PAST THREE YEARS, WE'VE HAD OVER 1,200 LIVES SAVED USING THE SARSAT SYSTEM. SO THE IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. WE ARE ALLOWING OUR ASSETS TO LAUNCH ON A KNOWN POSITION, SO WE'RE NOT WASTING THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY BY FLYING AROUND SEARCHING.  Narrator: THE BEACONS ARE MANDATED FOR LARGE SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT, BUT ANY MARINER OR AVIATOR CAN BUY ONE FOR BETWEEN $800-$1,200.  Steward: THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY NEED ONE OF THESE BEACONS, BUT IF I WERE IN TROUBLE, I WOULD WANT ONE.  Perkins: WE'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TRACK SIGNALS THAT IN THE PAST WE WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN KNOWN ABOUT. I FEEL IT'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR RESCUE CAPABILITY BY HAVING THE SYSTEM. IT'S ALSO A GREAT THING FOR THE POPULACE TO KNOW THAT, WITH THEIR EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE ONBOARD, THAT THERE'S DEDICATED EQUIPMENT THAT'S ONLY USED FOR THAT PURPOSE-- TO LISTEN FOR IT.  Bailey: THIS PROGRAM IS THE MOST REWARDING PROGRAM I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN, IN THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SAVING LIVES, YOU'RE SAVING MONEY, YOU'RE SAVING PROPERTY, AND IT'S JUST A GREAT HUMANITARIAN PROJECT. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH SEARCH AND RESCUE... I GOT INVOLVED IN IT A LITTLE BIT WHEN I WAS IN THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE, AND, UH, THIS JUST TURNED ME ON EVEN MORE. AND I THINK IT IS THE MOST REWARDING PROGRAM I'VE EVER BEEN AFFILIATED WITH.  Narrator: FROM THE UNSEEN, UNHEARD WORLD OF SATELLITE SYSTEMS TO THE FAMILIAR SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF SIRENS AND TOOLS LIKE THE JAWS OF LIFE, RESCUE TECHNOLOGY IS SAVING OUR MOST PRECIOUS ASSET: HUMAN LIVES.
