 welcome everyone to what is the new gold i've got the team again that they're returning from their uh a repeat engagement from last week because we got so much more to tell i've got my mood lighting going i love my mood lighting but uh and of course we got dan who continues we've now decided that his beard is a sign of good luck and the more it grows the more deals he gets so um it's he's gonna turn into the old man of the sea pretty soon you know if it gets us business then um buy yourself a pair of cheap sunglasses all i gotta say and then we got tom here who just had a root canal so he's feeling great just uh party on excellent dude um all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to share screen get into it so sure enough water is the new gold helping you thrive in the world's only vital scarce and recession-proof market why do we say that there's never really been a recession recession for water why because water does not recede right it only increases with population and furthermore the water industry is so far underperforming in terms of overall responsibility in the world it's only treating you know one-fifth of the water in the world that it's got a lot to catch up and that catching up is all going to happen at what we call the edge which is businesses do their own treatment we'll discuss that some more of course fresh water is scarce and it seems getting scarcer all the time with that i'm going to pop into the safe harbor statement which essentially we're not god we do our very best to tell you what's going to happen again we do not have a time machine and regulation d disclaimer is that any offering i discuss on this program has not been passed on the merits by the securities and exchange commission is a private placement and of course it requires accredited investors investing in securities always involves risk all right so our good friend bob roose who in fact just reinvested we saw his reinvestment come in yesterday in our bank account for which we thank him and um he's got a little statement he's going to make for us so let's let's hear he's got to say especially now with the new uh water investor i am truly excited about doing something for the planet and doing something that is positive in um in taking care of a situation that uh you know cities you know in michigan and flint michigan and uh are just uh in los angeles and numerous other places that have had water problems and i think you're right it is time to do something about it it's time to really be effective and i'd like to be a part of that solution by investing in origin clear and underwater project and i've been amazed at what you guys have done in the past and i'm really really excited about what the future is going to bring because origin clear is probably one of the most innovative and interesting companies that i have ever been involved with and i think the sky's the limit for the future so um yeah and you know it's a way to make money and uh in this time of uncertainty with uh you know the markets going up and going down and everything else and you guys have been steady for the last two years with uh regular payments and so i'm i'm betting on the future i think it's going to be great but that was bob roose giving us his opinion of how things are and i'm also going to run a quick excerpt from a podcast that i was involved with this week and this is an amazing young man terrell sumter who has a program called inspire before we expire oh my gosh you would be amazed at some of the people on this show these are people with real life like for example the one i'm if you go to the podcast right now you'll see the most recent billionaire who had a very hard time a long time ago and of course you know turn it around so this is a really inspirational podcast let's see what he little exchange you had with me all right why do you feel like this is such a much of a big responsibility in getting man like you seem so much passionate about it the water industry is only treating 20 of the sewage in the world the other 80 is going into the rivers and the oceans and into the ground and that is not okay that is a source of disease and that made me step up to the plate and go okay we have got to take responsibility as the water company for the new economy and the new economy is post-coveted and it's horrible and terrible but it's also a time of great future if we can if we can make it happen right so where are you guys at today right now with the with the whole thing as far as clothing going on and stuff like that so what we've been doing is we've been experimenting with how to create these solutions for people and finance them so that a young man or woman can actually start a business who's been put out of work by covid but this great business is out there to start and if we can make it happen then we've made water work for this new economy and that's super exciting that that's a testimony right there man that's something that you know i'm sure about young listeners will love to hear because i'm sure that maybe a big brother or their parents or somebody may just lost work as well this is what we're excited about is is lighting the spark for these new entrepreneurs in water for the first time do you know that the water industry is aging it's going to need 3 million jobs in the u.s alone to be filled in the next few years because people are retiring well let's do this thing you got people out of work in america three million jobs i think we i think we could make it happen right so we'd like to help city water is legal we all know it as well but is it safe to drink the water that we drink is not great and flint is only the worst of it there's situations where it's not as bad as flint for example people don't know that south bend indiana has very very bad water as bad as flint the solution is again do-it-yourself water treatment to make things better over time i'm totally behind you man on your mission man to really solving water treatment cleaning water hopefully everything get better in those cities as you mentioned open flint as we know the water's been all so bad out there and as you said it's been brown water in california i never knew that as well thank you so much man much gratitude to you terrell the inspiration was mine thank you so much it was a great pleasure well that was a 45 minute interview that we cut up very very tight for you so so you'd get the gist of it but it was amazing because tyrell does podcasts to a lot of people who are trying to get a new situation well there's been lots of developments this week and i would like to say that investor water evolves as you recall investor water was born out of really the the fact that that we realized during covid that the water industry has got to step up to the plate as i said on that podcast and we started looking at how we could speed up the funding phase and create a marketplace but we've learned a few things about that marketplace and i'm going to get right to it here what we're learning direct financing of creditworthy customers is very challenging meaning that it's a huge these are trillion dollar funds i mean uh a group like crest capital is is vast and you're not going to compete with those people they're sophisticated mature billions have been put into creating this industry so for people who are competitive we just put them into regular financing this is normal i've i've been doing that since the 80s and we all know how to do that but what is investor water's role that's something that we sharpened up beautifully this week and i was starting to allude to it last week let's see where it went we're getting leads for pool preserver as a business opportunity now these people don't just want a machine this is that machine you saw last week which recycles the pool water so people don't have to drain it and potentially crack it they want training and how to build a business now we have the pro forma the website and more has a pro forma is basically shows how the business looks on paper right that's a pro forma and we have technical training available so that on the ground so that we can get people up to speed but we also want to teach them how to market themselves so now we're putting together this integrated program it has the potential double double to return why because it's packaged in with a bunch of value-added services crest capital or any other wall street company is never going to do this it's not going to happen and so there's a services and hardware bundle and it's literally water as a career whack but water's a career is a new concept but remember these three million people that are retiring from the water industry what's that all about well here it is in water world there's an article silver tsunami a generation of workers retiring from their jobs and taking their institutional knowledge with them and this is a big deal as many as three million workers will need to be replaced over the next decade that's a lot of people and guess what there's a lot of people out of work right now so one third of the national workforce in water is going to be rotating out this is huge so we have an opportunity here to create something special now here's another amazing thing that the guys are on this show are going to be able to talk about is we have a gen 2 pool preserver again you know the the video that that we showed you last week and the website and so forth were really about a machine that does an amazing job we've managed now to double the performance we believe this is a potential because we've now pencil it out done the design and we believe we can get this so we double the throughput at half the price now this was call it a 120 000 machine so now it's 50 or 60 000 and it's twice the machine and each of these pools is a six or eight hundred dollar job you see how it massively improves the turnover right and there's it doesn't use membranes which means no more cleaning costs it is a revolution developed by dan and mark who got their heads together and i greatly appreciate it guys more news to come and now we're going to move to the tom archicello report hi everybody thanks for tuning in today appreciate it so dan and i actually are both here because we're contacting this a little bit today things have been picking up in the operations side as far as making product and getting quotes out the door so what we did see was you know everybody was worried about coronavirus and you know the big question is how's that impact your business and for us the truth was we never really saw any slowdown at all even from the moment of the beginning from february through today instead what we've been witnessing that definitely the last 60 days is an uptick in our business where we're definitely seeing a continued uh new business so our revenues have been on pace to actually uh exceed our expectations we're really growing at a good clip and we've noticed that you know we're getting more uh hits on goal so there's been just literally a flood of inbound quote requests people are looking for all sorts of equipment from you know reverse osmosis edi lift stations pump stations wastewater treatment as well as you know other things that we're doing tankage and so forth and it's been really good and i you know i feel real positive about what the team's doing and we're really trying to turn our way through it right now and you know get to the next spot so we're showing a couple you know kind of factors as to why this is happening so we've actually been asking our people who are making requests saying why is this happening what's going on talk to our own sales people they believe that what's happening is there's a couple of things that came together obviously you know people were a little scared with coronavirus they did hold back on a little bit of budgetary as far as placing their bets so to speak when they did finally decide to go back to work and put the money to work they wanted to buy american so you know sitting here with our texas facility is really great for us because then people are saying well these guys are here in america we're not going to have the supply chain slow down because what we found with some of our competitors they were buying a lot of their equipment overseas they were buying a lot of chinese-made stuff india mexico made stuff and a lot of the supply chains really got bogged down and there was a big hit to some of the orders that some of the folks were making in in the industry because they really couldn't get the parts the way they wanted at least with a group like ours in texas you know we we have all our own stuff on site so you're not going to experience the same problem so i think that's really worked out in our advantage the other thing was we just reached out to a lot of people we said hey we're all here everybody's healthy you know we're still working you know full steam and we had a lot of essential clients that really cared about drinking water systems and wastewater systems and those weren't going to stop during this time if anything the need for disinfection increased so everybody really cared more about making sure that sanitation was taken care of which really plays into the theme that you've been talking about rigs so that's uh that's a good piece of it and you know we've also just been pushing on our own initiatives putting our crms in place we got up onto you know different directories like thomas net dan and and mark wanted us to get into you know different government systems like co-stars which is the pennsylvania you know system for purchasing so we got into that that's made a difference in you know how we work with some of our uh consulting engineer groups so we basically been placing ourselves in the right spots of the supply chain and that's worked into our benefit because as this chain this picture is talking about the big picture is this topic of called onshoring and reshoring so as the threats to international trade have been increasing what you're seeing is the desire to reassure here in the united states make sure the supply chain from beginning to end can be done right here in america and basically you know trust the products that you have as well as the quality and that's an area where we went we always have great quality and we're buying stuff from people we know so i think it's uh it's really working in our favor right now and i really think this will be a trend that's going to continue as a matter of fact because i really see this accelerating for the next couple years you know regardless of how this election goes this is going to be you know here with us for a while well in fact tommy you're responsible for a huge amount of this and i appreciate it the the slide went into the decentralization trend which of course i've got a 2016 article here so that's proof that i was talking about it back then but in addition dan you were doing this stuff 15 years ago in decentralization am i right yes that that is correct ricks i have quite an extensive background started i saw the vision and saw the future 15 20 years ago respect of decentralization just coming from the engineering background and coming up through the ranks like i did early in my professional career decentralized decentralization is the key to the future success of water and wastewater amen as it says on the previous slide here it is now a mega trend people are getting it and we often talk to to consumers who go well wait a minute the central water systems i still get you know water coming through my tap and i flush the toilet and water goes away but what they don't realize is that businesses are being told increasingly to only provide treated water to the municipality because of problems with capacity and so all of a sudden you've got either a lot of waste being trucked away there's a famous case history of a brewery in san francisco area which with the bay area which had for a long time had to truck its waste its brewery waste to the other county and finally they bit the bullet and put in a system themselves to deal with the uptake and the the local municipality just was not going to help them so there's real crises and i think that origen clear with your help to dan is definitely stepping into the breach so that's super exciting well you have dan on for a second craig you kind of i just wanted to tap him because i was about to throw a bow in his way you know one of the things that dan was doing was he was doing the covid 19 time he was doing a lot of web webinars and teleconferences and reaching out to a lot of engineers and consulting engineers which i think was very valuable because they get you know continuing education credit but also at the same time they all got to learn about our product lines and after continued effort a few months of doing that dan what's happened since then like what's what was the effect of that it is the webinars and these uh video conferences that we have done remotely since uh mid-february late february of this year and continued up till even just this past week the impact that we are seeing is we have reached out to 50 to 75 different engineering firms we have touched at least 300 to 350 different specifying engineers all of these folks are decision makers in the in the gestational process of a water project and what we are finding is that as we go very we use this very intimate capability to meet with these people and what is happening is that we are able to much more effectively communicate who we are what what progressive water is what origin clear is the modular water system product lines and we're introducing them to our a fairmont pump station our packaged average skid waste water treatment systems the booster skid product lines and all of that and we're basically pulling back the veil these these firms did not did not know that we had all these capabilities they didn't know that some of these new solutions that we have been promoting for the last two years existed and the result of that is that we have had just a tremendous uptick in inbound requests for uh technical permitting packages and budgetary quotes and we're finding ourselves in basis of design on numerous projects and uh that tom the just the the impact that this has had uh is just been overwhelming uh we are really struggling uh rob letos who's my counterpart as a technical project manager mike jenkins and mark steve to keep up with the inbound requests for information product information technical support and those types of things i am so so very pleased with the response uh the response we get the reception we get and more importantly the adoption that we get by the consulting community as they are working as these consulting engineers are working with their clientele uh that has been the most that has been probably the most rewarding part of this whole process and what does that mean that means that we are now closing deals that started and uh opportunities that came in the pipeline six and eight months ago and there is going to be a very deliberate continued increase in sales activity uh top line revenue sales we're going to see a tremendous increase in that over the next 6 12 18 and 24 months and we're just really really just only touching the tip of the iceberg it's amazing what successes we have had and just what limited time and what just few firms that we've been able to work with cool that's exactly it's like i've been on some of the calls with you too and literally like engineers who are world-class engineers with amazing firms are like wow this is great it's exactly what i'm looking for like it's perfectly like when they say this is exactly what i'm looking for you know you're in a good spot you know so that's a lot of testament to your dancing things no you guys are rock stars and it brings me back to you know the the slide i was just showing off coming back to the screen that we were talking about here this is uh dan where you were talking about a particular rep organization that has become extremely comfortable with us and has given us i believe this is correct about four to five million dollars in current quotes yes yes sir that is correct and then very interesting how tom you really spearheaded the integration uh i recall and at one point we we kept you guys separate because i don't know it was what we thought at the time and you were like oh my gosh i'm overwhelmed you were running around like a madman and then uh really things have calmed down tremendously when you you now have a production facility right it has i haven't been being able to anchor myself with a with our own in-house manufacturing capability with uh with progressive water treatment in mckinney texas that has really stabilized things we're really we have really gelled as an organization over the last six to nine months i'm loving the uh the creativity of the designs i'm seeing some amazing stuff come out just like that gen 2 device on the pool preserver lot product line how far do you think we are away from the pool preserver gen 2 to actually make it a reality so i was on the phone with mark stevens uh earlier today following up hina and he and i've been working proactively and collaboratively for the last i would say the last 30 days on the gen 2 version of the pool preserver and as of today when i asked mark i said mark if we were able to pull the trigger and start fabrication how fast can we turn the unit and have a fuel deployable system ready to go and his response to me was he felt like at 30 to 45 days that we could easily do that and we feel we feel very comfortable uh mark and i do because this of the simplicity the simplicity of the system uh and some of the new technology that we're going to integrate into the gen 2 version so i would say i would dare say that 30 days from now if things continue to click forward that we might be able to show real world photos of a unit the gen 2 unit well that's fantastic you know what i really love is the fact that we've now moved tom you're the one feeling these leads from people who are looking for business opportunities and that it's no longer just a straight equipment sale now it's a little bit more than that they're they're obviously they need equipment obviously to do the basic job because machines change the world you know like it's the old uh you know why dig with the pickaxe when you couldn't have a backhoe right that's the key piece you got to get the machine there but now they're also looking for the business opportunity and i've had a lot of calls actually i'd say more than half of the inquiries have come where it's like hey you know coronavirus really sucks and i lost my job and i'm like yeah then there's a lot of people that had to happen so they're they're looking to re-employ themselves or it's like a father uncle grandfather kind of thing where they're like our family wants to put our nephew or son in business you know with one of these machines and honestly it's a great opportunity i really think it makes perfect sense because the money's there the business is there and they're just looking for the best way to get it done and it's a very viable alternative we talk a lot like this i mean realistically like if we really want to push it it's like the makings of like a franchise business like the the pool version of jiffy lube right our hands right now and we're like going vote you know we're not ready to launch a big you know massive franchise business yet but we think we can at least get some people out there working effectively and making money that that makes me happy well it's the beginning of a great thing that our partners as you notice the beginning of the presentation we have this brand called water fill and through investors and this is a group that has spawned some fascinating successes in a niche just like what we're talking about here so this has tremendous potential and i'm just going to show if their slide in real estate and they really had amazing success in real estate and they have a process which again is this value-added type process where they pick up foreclosed properties they buy these homes in bulk the investor purchases the properties they become the trustee they improve the they add value by improving their their properties they sell them these two families who could not otherwise own properties and i know from having spoken at length with ivan who was on the show a couple weeks ago that he he told us that he was promised many times people said well why don't you go into higher end thai properties and he was wise enough to stick to this and so we're really looking at something like this which is a protected zone where other people cannot step in because frankly they it's too much work but it's a protected zone because so many people in america do not have access to buying a home today it's really a scandal and it's very much the same way now in water with three million jobs up for grabs and we are there to put people in them so again i love this what we call value-add because it gets into you know now it's water as a career very very fun and different i really want to thank you guys because as i was showing in an earlier slide we did not expect the conventional side of the business to take off the way it has been you know we had this early on q1 like oh my gosh what's happening with kovid where's this going and then q2 well okay you know not bad and q1 was actually ahead of 2019 as i showed and then q2 seems to be on trend as well where we have our quarterly filing coming out the 15th so this basically next week well the next webinar is the day before the quarterly fine comes out i'll hopefully i'll be able to give you some guidance then but the numbers continue to improve and now in q3 it's really taking off and this was totally unexpected so i'm really grateful to you guys for being all over it a good management good focus staying on the job implementing things like thomas net and the outbound marketing very happy about it okay grant brandon asks riggs is the private placement still on the drawing board i think what you're referring to grant is the unaccredited investor round because i'll be showing you guys how you can be involved with the regulation d the um accredited round but just so you know we've now refiled the regulation a offering all right and let's take a look right here there is a 1a preliminary offering circular so now this has been re-submitted to the security exchange commission unlike the regulation d offering which is not subject to review this is so now this is in review you can do up to 50 million dollars a year that we're doing roughly 20. in here it really shows what the deal is which is basically a 500 investment what's cool about it is we simplified everything minimum 500 investment you receive a 10 dividend paid monthly automatically and then we can only retire the debt by paying you 150 of your investment which is pretty good now eventually we do intend to list this bond on the stock market and therefore you theoretically be able to sell it but frankly if you're making 10 percent a year and we have to give you 150 back you're pretty much in the cat bird seat so we think this is going to play very well these things are done really mostly online now if we go back to my the presentation i was just giving there you go now the current offering is for credit investors only and it's going to go parallel i think grant that i think i answered your question but if it's about this this one's up and running and it's doing very very well for credit investors it's less cash than the unaccredited but more overall because there's a stock component and also there is a redemption or repayment of principal price at the time later of conversion so there's no real concerns with the stock price outside of the usual stock risk of course i don't want to minimize that there's a such thing as a risk ken bogart military bases still use septic in many locations are they on the radar well uh dan you've got your expeditionary water recovery system ewrs does that job right we do we we have that uh we have that that military capability in fact i have had um i was actually speaking with the u.s some folks with the u.s navy a couple weeks ago they called us to talk to us about our black water and domestic wastewater treatment capabilities containerized treatment capabilities that we promote in market so yes we have that capability in the military the department of defense actually is a preferred customer a preferred client of ours so they are definitely on the radar that's a beautiful thing and we can't discuss it but we're in we're in talks through a partner with another country's armed forces so uh definitely exciting uh to leverage that capability which is that the other partner has all of these government relationships all over the world but we've got the arms and legs to get things done and as you say the design capabilities so it's a good marriage byron asks when will the offering be available to unaccredited investors yes i hadn't answered that the review typically will take 45 50 days might take less because this thing was previously approved the the problem was that that the previous version was immediately convertible into common stock we were concerned and so was the sec that it could be used as a cash machine chi ching chi-ching and hurt the stock so we that's why we pulled it back we did very well in the first month we did 200 000 in just one month in in investments and of course it was online very very efficient so we think it's going to be a wonderful way for us to clean up our balance sheet to get these major projects going create these business opportunity type businesses there's pool preserver there's a new the ponster product line pond monster which handles you know trailer park ponds as well as ordinary retention ponds and real estate as well as animal farms which is a huge market and i think we can get people into that business too our wisconsin partner is is literally making a business himself and that's the kind of thing i think we can do more of so with that i really appreciate everyone i appreciate everyone's stuck with us it's been slightly longer than usual really really happy with the news with how well you guys are doing thank you and tom uh do recover tonight chill out thank you for coming on and then don't cut that beard now you're stuck james for the pool preservation machines how much will it take to build a liver send an email right now to water at originclear.com and before i forget and somebody beats me up i'm going to tell you that you can contact the team this is the 800 number 4404603 ken behringer who's the master of well he and i developed this investor water concept which is starting to take off devon angus who's my assistant and if you want to talk to me talk to him schedule with ken just go to oc dot gold slash ken everyone thank you very much please join us next week we have lots of updates for you have a great weekend thank you again good night [Music] you
