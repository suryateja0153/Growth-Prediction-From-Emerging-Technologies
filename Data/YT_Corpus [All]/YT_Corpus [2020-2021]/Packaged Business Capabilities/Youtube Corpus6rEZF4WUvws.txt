 hey everyone good morning good evening uh good afternoon depending on your time zones welcome to another edition of trailhead live my name is mohit i'm a developer evangelist here at salesforce i welcome you all to this new series that we are starting the series is modern app development on salesforce where we will cover the full spectrum of building applications on salesforce including design build test and debug and this is not only on salesforce platform we will also bring heroku content where we will see how we can uh sort of use uh hiroku in our application architecture so that's why i have holyar hoolion let's complete some housekeeping slides and then i'll let you uh introduce uh to our developer audience here perfect so before i begin there's a four looking statement here please do not make any purchasing decisions based on anything forward looking that we make in this presentation now holi on over to you okay hello you all my name is julian duque i'm a lead developer advocate here at salesforce working mainly on the heroku team if you don't know me i have been doing some live sessions as well here at trevor live focusing mainly on javascript at node.js been working with node since 2011 i'm looking forward to bringing all my javascript and node.js expertise with the full salesforce community and pretty much this is why i'm joining mohit on this uh wonderful trailhead live series so you all learn how to build modern app applications leveraging the full salesforce platform both salesforce and heroku awesome uh julian i cannot wait to explore node.js and how to build node.js web app you know and other micro services and cannot you know sort of uh wait to hear from you around uh you know different techniques that we have for heroku so really excited that you uh that you are with us and thank you so much for being with us oh thank you for the invitation yeah no worries um uh hey everyone so my name is mohad i've been with the salesforce ecosystem for a decade now uh just focusing on building applications using salesforce technology uh i've been working uh you know as a developer as an architect on salesforce platform and uh you know have multiple certifications and also uh you know i've built some app exchange applications so have some experience as an isv as well um so i'll be presenting the salesforce content along with uh my dear friend here uh holi on so let's look at uh our plan here so for today's session we are going to cover developer tools we'll see how much we can cover maybe some of the content will go to the next sessions uh and then we'll also cover data model design we'll look into uh you know front-end application in the next sessions you know we have sessions planned for lighting web components and then also we'll look into uh you know application logic using apex and flows and then uh you know we'll talk about different alm tools that we have we'll also look at uh application packaging and deployments uh for both for uh you know heroku applications salesforce application and we're going to also explore some of our sample gallery apps uh specifically we will look into e-cars app which was launched recently and we will uh try to uncover a lot of the cure that's there in that application now i want to spend some time explaining the object use of this series so in this series our core aim is we want to up skill our sales force developers here we want to teach them the the modern development best practices so we want to uh help them with all the latest and greatest tools that we have developed at salesforce in the last two years and a lot of innovations that we have brought to the developer technologies uh we'll also empower heroku developers so if you're a heroku developer uh you know you'll have uh you'll listen from me around different uh salesforce capabilities um so you'll learn this art of building applications on salesforce as well uh and now if you're a new developer and you are you're just getting started with uh your application development welcome you know we will take you through this journey of design build test and deploy stages of application on our salesforce platform all right so with that um let's first spend some time on our introduction to salesforce for a lot of you it might be a reputation but for those of you who are very new to salesforce i'm sure this will be helpful so the whole idea of salesforce platform is we want to help you to take your idea to the application uh you know in a very fast part or you know in a very smooth and fast path as possible so in order to build any application today an enterprise application you need infrastructure services you need to build your own network services you need to also add application services on top on top of it for example identity and single sign-on password policies you know two-factor authentication you need to think about your data security so with all of these it's a lot of work to build all of these from the ground up and that's why at salesforce we have given you all these services out of box so that you focus only on your application idea and you focus on building the application and live rest of the infrastructure and network and everything to us now we give you not only pro core tools but also low code builder tools for example you know if you want to build a data model on salesforce we give you something called a schema builder and clicks so that you can build your data model with clicks and tools uh we have also integrated security and we provide apis our platform is api first platform that means any functionality that we build most of the times we have apis for them also if you want to add business logic add automation we have lot of capabilities for example we have flows uh you know we provide a language uh called apex which is very similar to java in syntax however it is a cloud-based programming language and then we also encourage event-driven architecture we provide platform events we provide change data capture and we also have declarative way to add artificial intelligence to your apps and also uh you know at salesforce right building user interface is is very fast because uh you know you're not building everything from the ground up we give you tools we give you local tools so that you can build your detail layouts we have app builder from where you can drag and drop components standard components we provide lots of standard components we have app exchange where you can bring in the components pre-built components from other developers into your ui and then you know if you want to customize that there's a whole framework that we have built lining web components which allow you to create your own components with familiar technologies like javascript and html and also we are following the latest web standards in the lightning web component so we we embrace web components and that's one of the things that have me more excited is to be able to see how salesforce is embracing javascript that one of the main languages to develop applications this is why i came in awesome thank you so much uh julian again you know lining web components i'm so excited that uses javascript and you know if you are building a node application right on heroku that also uses javascript so looks like javascript is one of the skill set you know that can be very handy because you know you can not only build your web applications your lighting web components but also you can build your micro services on heroku so over to you uh you hold on for the heroku introduction of course so the same premise and philosophy of salesforce eroku brings you a lot of different tools so you don't need to worry about the infrastructure or maintenance of your applications you just need to focus on creating that application just on the business itself so eroku is a platform as a service for building custom applications using one of our supported open source languages so we officially support uh languages like javascript using the node.js platform ruby java php python we also support go and other sub languages of java like scala and clojure so you will be able to use these open source languages that are available out there to create custom experiences for your users and roku pretty much doesn't need salesforce and salesforce doesn't need a roku those can work independently but when you bring those two platforms together well they are part of the same platform pretty much but when you bring those two technology together you are going to build great enterprise grade applications so the main goal and idea behind this series we are starting today is to show you how can you leverage the power of both eroque and salesforce to create amazing customer experiences so let me explain a little bit uh how eroku is is like architecture in this graph so we are going to see in the in the bottom layer we have the app development layer so we are offering you tools to be able to deploy applications to to the cloud to manage your organization and users and when i say organization this is not the salesforce organization i mean your organization how you are going to manage the different users and things that can interact with the heroku platform will give you a cicd complete solution so you will be able to do continuous integration and continuous deployment on the heroku platform we also focus on security and you will be able to manage all of the different settings for your application on top of the application development layer we have the data services so our application our application needs data data that can live on salesforce and we are going to be able to integrate with data that lives on salesforce using add-ons like error connect or doing api calls directly to salesforce but we also provide databases that are also open source that you can bring into your application so we officially support a postgresql redis and apache kafka that lets you have a real-time enterprise bus for your application so on top of that we have the application management layer we are going to give you tools to monitor your application making sure you are you have access to the logs to do a scaling and we are going to be talking about about the scaling the roku platform because it is a very interesting concept that is key to develop web applications that are going to have a lot of performance for a great number of users eroku is for the hobbyist like the person that can or want to create like a small application a start prototyping something but it's also for big enterprises so this is from the student that wants to deploy their first application to the cloud to companies that have thousands of applications running on eroku so we also have a compliance and trust layer that means that you will be able to have a pretty much a beautiful private cloud for your application that is going to be isolated from the multi-tenant architecture we offer for the standard users and we also have a shield what we call a local shield which is a compliance layer so we support hipaa pci and other different certifications and this is going to be for companies that need uh way more control over data and data that is going to be way more secure stored in our platform it requires for all of the spectrum and it is the same philosophy behind salesforce to get from an idea to production in very easy steps and getting getting there super fast yeah julian you know this is a great intro to uh heroku um now you know for salesforce developers i think uh you know one of the aspects that i'm looking here is at salesforce right one of the things that we have is you know how do we scale right so i saw this concept of scaling uh in in heroku right and that's something at salesforce right we we are a multi-tenant architecture so if you are building any processes right we have to make sure that those processes are within those government limits you know so that's where i think heroku is really different because you know what you can do is you can yourself scale right you can yourself choose uh your resources you know depending on your business requirement you can scale so i think that's a really great added benefit and i think our developers can think about like you know building more microservices on heroku and exposing them so that they can invoke those services for from salesforce we can see and we can see later in the series how this looks like in a more technical way like how how can we scale in the local platform and how easy it is and what are the different scaling techniques that we offer toward to our users so it's it's pretty powerful as you mentioned yeah you know i i see that when we combine both of them you know both salesforce and heroku you know you you have like almost a double power than what you you know have just with salesforce so that's interesting all right so this episode we are going to focus mainly on uh developer tools on salesforce platform so we're going to talk about developer tools we're going to show you some of the developer tools um so let's look at it um so this is our sales for cli tools now as a developer i know that you know the first tool that you look forward is a cli that is a command line too and for salesforce developers i'll be honest the command line tool is something very new because we were just used to uh you know the low code capability of salesforce some of you might have used developer console or you might have used just an ide so you know command line tool is uh you know is widely adopted uh everywhere um so we have a trailhead module where you can learn about these command line tools if you're not familiar with that and you know one of the the prerequisite for working with this command line tools is also a little bit knowledge around you know some of the linux commands uh specifically and i think we also have a trailhead module on that or i'm pretty sure there are a lot of resources on that um so we'll we'll definitely take a look at that but for now right um let's focus on oak cliff so what is oak cliff oak cliff is an open source framework for building command line applications using node and javascript so if you look at hiroco cli and sales for cli all of the commands that you execute follow a very similar pattern and that is because both of them are made from this oak cliff the oak cliff is like a framework to build you know a command line utility so let's say your company has a requirement to build your own command line tools let's say you have an api and you want to build a command line utility to invoke those api right so oh cliff really fits uh as a framework now you can you can use node.js to build it but there are a lot of uh you know repetitive tasks that we have sort of abstracted for you so that it becomes really easy to build uh you know any command line application so oaklef is think of it as a framework right and now we've built heroku cli and also sales for cli uh you know with using the same uh you know framework that is all clips that's why you will see that both of the cli will feel very very similar you know especially the commands you know it will look very very similar it has the same structure and the format um julian you want to talk about hierogly a bit sure before i want to tell a fun fact uh when we were creating the heroku cli we came up with this pattern of creating the command line application and that's why oakleaf was born so pretty much oakleaf is a project that was born internally at roku to create the heroku cli and we saw the potential to have this as an open source tool we release it as an open source tool even there is an oak leaf curve like a conference around these two because it is pretty powerful and it is not only used by herocoin salesforce there are other companies for example twilio that they built their their sdk and the cli using the same framework so it is open source if you need to do something even unrelated with cellphones and heroku you can use this framework to create your cli applications and it's going to be very intuitive to to do so as you were mentioning we have the heroku and the cells for cli they are like pretty similar because they follow the same pattern but i'm going to tell you what you can do from the hero kusi ally so the hero cozy alive allows you first to manage your user in the heroku platform so you will be able to log into the roku platform pretty much you are going to type the heroku login command and it will open a web browser so you can enter your credentials and that command line is going to be authenticated and also allows you to do the application management what does this mean in order to deploy an application to heroku you will need to create an application like you create a application space where you are going to deploy so you can use for example the heroku create command and also allows you to list the different applications you have available the lead application so all of the application management you can also manage the processes the configuration the life cycle of your application so all of these different settings if you want to restart an application if you want to take a look at logs so everything can be done on the cli what else we have a marketplace which is called the elements marketplace where we have not only the officially supported add-ons that we offer for example the postgresql and the radius add-on i went mentioning you earlier but others that are created by third parties similar to app exchange we also have partners that create add-ons that can be used to extend the heroku experience so you will be able to manage those add-ons from the cli as well you can do all of the different user management organization management team managing the security management like managing the permissions who can deploy who can access certain applications you can also do that from the cli and one cool thing since this is also based on oakleaf and open source project you can create your own custom plugins let's say you have your own your own set of tasks that you do with the heroku platform or you created a third-party add-on you can create your own plugin publish this plugin to the npm which is the node.js package registry or the javascript backups registry where all where all of the different libraries and modules for javascript leaves you can publish your plugin and anybody that is using the heroku cli can install the plugin and start interacting with it so it's extensible it is open source and we'll let you manage everything on error awesome uh awesome and similarly we have sales for cli here you know it pretty much does the same jobs like you can authenticate to uh you know to a dev hub i'll talk about what is a dev but you can authenticate basically to any salesforce arc you know you can extract the metadata out of it you can create some data uh you know and later on you know you can bundle your application as a package uh you can also generate your custom plugins um so you can do uh you know a lot of uh you know all those lot of common tasks that you do all through the through the sales for cli now i also want to uh you know talk about text editors and ide um so at salesforce right we prefer using vs code as our preferred editor because we have we have been investing a lot building the salesforce official extension pack for building salesforce apps also vs code has a general good other extensions for other various languages and it is popularly adopted by developers however i want to mention this that we live up to developers to choose ide of their of their choice like for example if you are comfortable with let's say a sublime or any other editor you can use that but all the apis and commands are available you know to the to the cli so that you know you can use the command line terminal to execute them uh but we provide a ui on top of the on top of those commands using uh you know the vs code uh extension pack that we have built uh also i want to mention that both oaklef and uh you know vs code also and also salesforce exchange pack all of these are open source projects so we are embracing uh open source work so you can go to github find all the code that is behind uh you know the salesforce extension pack or uh you know behind this uh oakley framework uh julian i had a question for you is the hero cli also open or is it like closed and in you know i mean that's a good question i i think it's a open source okay i know that salesforce cli is not totally open source i mean we open source a lot of node bundles but i know that we are working towards making it completely open source so that anybody can see all the code all the javascript and you know types occurred behind these tools yeah it is open source you can go to github.com cli and you can find most of the code and commands that lives in there so one thing i love about visual studio code um i've been like building software for a while so i have used mostly editors and ideas um i was not an ide person sorry only only when i was working on java you needed like an ide like eclipse or netbeans i remember that was i was using back in the days yeah but then i switched to working only with beam or bi which is a pretty low level but very powerful ide for the terminal so you can use it like as a common light too and i was very used to it once a visual studio code was released i saw a great opportunity to use it and i fell in love i mean it's extensive mode easy to use and me as a beam user i was able to enable the bim login and use the same like endings that i already memorized my whole life so the developer productivity just increased second it has great support for javascript and node.js mainly because the israelite studio code it is also a node.js application so if you didn't know it it's also built with javascript you can build desktop applications as well using javascript and node.js and it's perfect for web development and the type of development we do so it's highly recommended very extensible they are like a great quantity of uh extensions that are going to improve your developer experience one of those as moji mentioned is the salesforce extension pack that is maintained by salesforce we don't have like eroku we don't have a official visual studio code extension but people in the community have created their own so if you find a local in the in the marketplace for visual studio code when you add extensions you are going to find different options if you want to start like interacting with the roku cli directly from the from the ide it's very very powerful as well awesome um okay so i want to move on to developer hub now this is again very specific to salesforce but developer hub you know is pretty much uh all that you need these days so you can enable this developer hub in your production org or let's say if you're a partner you have a partner business arc where you can enable these developer hubs so from developer hubs what you can do is you can create these scratch arcs so scratch arcs are your developer environments essentially so you can define the shape of the arc like in salesforce application you generally have licenses features and settings so you can also define all of them through a configuration file and i'll walk you through the you know how that configuration file looks it's pretty much a json so you define that and then you create your environments and then what you can do with devops is you can also create packages like for example second generation packages and i will show you you know you can get an arg a developer arc for free uh if you do not know and you can enable developer hub there and then you get like three scratch arcs three active sketchups per day uh you know um so you get scratch art so that you can uh like pretty much try all of our features uh at salesforce and also start building applications uh on salesforce so we'll take a look at that as we move into our activities section so okay so now we move on to activity section and you know i want to mention this that we have designed our activities such a way that you actually try them out uh you will definitely find a lot of value if you watch the recordings or if you try these activities with us uh so that you become really familiar and you are you do a little bit of hands-on with all the tools and technologies okay so our first activity here is to signing up for our developer edition salesforce arc and then i'll pass on to julian who will show you how to sign up for a heroku free account so for developer edition arc there are two ways you can get it so one way is obviously you go to developer.salesforce.com sign up like the one that i'm showing here you provide all these details and then you register for it then you get a developer edition arc where you can enable the dev hub i'll show you how to enable the device now the next uh way and this is one way to get it very popular way you get a an edition for free um now the next way is also through trailhead so if you're new to salesforce you will find a lot of the resources on trailhead.com trailhead.com basically is a free learning site where we make learning fun so you will see that you know we gamify this whole concept of learning so you will really find materials on any content and you know badges and materials on anything that you would like to learn about salesforce or in fact even heroku so we we keep publishing the content now this has an ability to create you a free org where you can enable the dev hub so for example let's say i'm taking a badge when you go to the module you will see that at the bottom you have way to create a playground so for example i can i can click on this button called create playground and this will create you an arc so and your arc will always be here so whenever you log into trailhead and you go to uh your hands-on arc you will see that you know you will have all these arcs here and you can just click on the launch and launch that specific arc so you you're really also this is a way to connect all your arcs where you are sort of building application and uh you know also forget about remembering the passwords etc because uh you know this this manages all of your hands-on arc for you now there's a limit on like connecting 10 arcs but i think that's a that's a really good limit and you should uh definitely find this really helpful now with that right hold on you know i would pass on to you so that you can show our developers how they can sort of sign up for a heroku account of course so can you listen to my screen awesome so first step you are going to go to heroku.com and on edoku.com you will see this big button here that says signup for free so let's click on it and pretty much the same you are going to fill out the information pick up what type of role are you you can be either a hobbyist a professional developer a student it's just to give us some information and that's it that's how you create a free account on a local there are like one step that we ask for you is to enter a credit card we are not going to charge you and you don't need a credit card to create a neroq account but you're going to have an extra benefit let me tell you what if you create an account without a credit card you are going to have only 500 hours a month which is less than the full month for run a full application but if you do it with a credit card you are going to have 1 000 hours a month which is more than the hours in a month which is like 750 something so what does this mean that you will be able to run a full web application on a roku and have some extra hours to run let's say a worker process and later in the series when we are going to get a little bit more technical and real cool you are going to see what a worker process is so it's a good practice if you enter a credit card but it is not needed and you can have like a free account to start like building your applications there is going to be only one main difference between a free account and a paid account is that our applications uh they run on something called a dyno and we will get into that concept later so don't worry about it it sounds cool but it means where you run the application pretty much like the virtual computer when you run the application so for the free account we put those dinos to sleep after your application is not getting traffic for 30 minutes so if nobody is going to your application what we do is like okay process go to sleep and then when a new request comes in we wake up the process that might take a couple of seconds to reply but you know when creating a web application a couple of seconds might be a lot when you want to deliver a great user experience but for a hobby project for a learning project that's a pretty good so you don't need to have a paid account in initial to start learning and building applications but now when you want to go to the next step when you are getting users when you are getting traffic and your application needs to be always awake and responsive that's when you will need to start like upgrading to a paid account and that's how you can create an account perfect thank you so much julian for that um okay so next we gonna talk about uh the activity2 which is essentially i'll show you how to clone a sample application we have e-cars application and the reason why i picked this application is because it has interfaces to hiroku that means you know there are parts of the application that use heroku technology and connect with salesforce data so we want to really show that application and we will uncover that application meaning we'll get into the parts of the application we'll get into the nuts and bolts as we uh you know progress further in the series um so so please join us for all other sessions as well or cancer recordings so uh for this activity right i want to make sure that we clone the e-cars project from github and deploy you know the salesforce components to the scratch art so let's get started on that so let's get started on that so before that i also want to uh spend some time here and talk about how to like install a way to install some of these tools right so first yeah so first thing you need is salesforce cli so you go to google and just type sales for cli and you will see our official website always use our official website to download uh the the salesforce cli so you go to developer.salesforce.com tools slash sfdx cli so in this url based on your operating system choose uh the binary file to download and install so you'll go through the installation steps it should be pretty straight forward now if you have uh you know troubles installing the cli just let us know uh i'll share uh the community you know url uh where you can catch us offline so you can reach out to us or to our twitter handles just reach out to us in case you are finding very difficulty installing any of these tools so you need sales for cli for sure and the next thing you need is vs code ide so again vs code is also open source as i said and they have a website where you can choose your operating system uh and always choose the stable version if you are working just choose the stable version that's very important uh so choose the stable build version and install it so you'll need that that installed other tool you would need is github um sorry the kit right so you need git installed on your local machine and this is for uh you know everything and if you are very new to the git there is a trailhead module i'll share the links uh in our resources section here shortly uh through our slides so you you should be able to get a really good trailhead module where it talks about how to use git uh but git is really essential you know for building applications on heroku or building salesforce application if you're a developer you should really invest some time in exploring git and learning uh the fundamentals of kit so git is again free and open source so basically you choose your operating system version and you can download it they also give you a free online book called pro kit i found it really useful where you can read it online for free if you really want to explore some of the commands so yeah so get us next thing that you need and then so let's let's come back to our terminal here to see um see how we can sort of uh use it so let's come back to our terminal here so on the terminal what i want to mention is once you have installed all of these tools you should be able to verify for example if you type sfdx version you should see the latest sfdx version that you are running so on my machine it is uh you know 7.80 that's the latest but our cli team actually releases every two weeks so it gets updated pretty frequently so make sure you are on the latest and if you are on the oldest version always run this sfdx update command so that it updates your uh you know sfdx cli to the latest version now if you have a git installed you can do git version as well to you know to make sure you have the git installed so as you can see i have the git version 2.24.3 right and uh you know i'm i'm using apple git here uh so yeah you know if you have the kit it will show up there right now the next thing we want to go is go to our ide that we are using that is visual studio code here so i can open the the visual studio code app here for you so again it's built as julian was saying right it's built using uh you know javascript and you know it's it's it uses electron and electron uses node.js essentially um so it's all the same technology so so you know it's it's really interesting that you know same technology that uh we use for building enterprise scale application we are also using to build our own developer tools that's so exciting to me so one of the things i want to mention is you know visual studio code is keyboard friendly um you know friendly ide or editor so you'll you know you'll see that you know it has a lot of cool features and all of them have shortcut commands and you know there's a printable keyboard cheat sheet that you can get it from here that depending on your operating system they have one for mac because it was back it automatically figured out that i'm using mac but you know it has one for uh you know for windows as well and really handy this is really handy you know very valuable resource actually to spend some time and get get familiar with it i've been using visual studio code for a while and i just learned about that link that's wonderful yeah they have a lot of resources actually if you go to this help section right they have a lot of radio resources they also have this introductory videos now um so that's also really useful to you know learn something yeah you need to be paid more attention to the links yeah we always close that that's awesome yeah so again keyboard friendly so you know you like for example on mac i always use command shift p to access uh you know access any of the commands like for example sftx commands i just say sfdx right and then you know other cool features that it has is this whole extension right so you go to this little icon here that i'm showing that has all these extensions that have installed and there are so many extensions there are thousands of extensions but for salesforce right always use official extension that is salesforce extension pack so the extension pack has uh you know um all the things that you need to build a salesforce application for example we have language servers for uh you know for coding apex we have language servers for aura components uh visual force all of these are our technologies essentially also there are there's debuggers uh for debugging the application sales for cli commands all of these commands you will find that there's a handy little convenience uh through the ui layer to the the keyboard right so you can find all of them um in you don't have to install one by one if you just type salesforce extension pack and install it will install everything for you now there's also community contributed extension so feel free to you know sort of explore them and see if they uh really fit your needs right and you know with if you learn node and javascript uh you know it's not hard to actually build one of these extensions you know they use the same technology they use javascript and node so you know if you're familiar with them try building something you know and sharing with the community now once we have this right so the other feature that i want to show you and this is the file explorer view uh this is your github so other other advantages here is it automatically sort of has a connection to the github so you basically get a you know commands to execute all your git commands as well directly right from here it is tightly integrated there's a there's a there's an extension actually that sort of allows you to log into the github and then uh it links itself and it you know it has it it has some integrations with kit so i i find that really useful you know to have uh one centric like have visual studio code and then do all my coding and then when i want to version control it to the git i use uh this right also debugger so this is like the debug error utility where you can actually debug applications right also you know i have some in you know tools installed but depending on what you install you should see a lot of things here now other thing that i want to be sure that you must be aware of is terminal right so for example uh you know you need not actually sort of uh you know have your terminal open visual studio code provides you a terminal right so you can open your terminal and you can open multiple number of them as you can see you know you can create your own terminals like if i click on the other plus icon it created two terminals so you know i can have multiple terminals uh sort of open here and you know by default right i've chosen zsh right as my default shell right but really you can change it you know if if you prefer bash i know i'm a mac user and i typically follow what mac sort of gives me out of box so i'm choosing zed as uh zs head shell right but um uh you know you can you can choose bash or if you want you know basically bring in other terminals as well you can configure them for example i use bash oh you use bash okay that's good you know your days are where you used to yeah but they they work the same they have the same command a unix shell so both for mac or linux you are going to get the same experience even if you are using windows on windows you have the wsl like the windows subsystem linux that also provides you with a terminal or you can use the the latest uh windows terminal which is pretty good uh i'm right now working on a windows computer and i also love that developing experience that you can get on windows so yeah yeah wsn2 i i definitely you know encourage our salesforce developer audience if you have windows and if you if you use windows right uh definitely we support um we support uh the salesforce cli in windows as well so you know if if you have a opportunity to sort of explore wsl 2 i strongly recommend you know wsl 2 really makes it easier and we we do support our cli tools in that wso too as well for uh for for windows um okay so we have all of these holion and you know we are trying to clone the project right now before that i also want to mention one more thing is like you know you can choose your own color themes as well now themes is also a big part of uh you know developer experience so for example i i like to use this theme that uh that is sales was provided this theme itself was provided essentially that i'm using but it's called kodi midnight actually um so there are but you know there are so many themes out there so try it out find your personal preference and use it uh you know with uh the themes of your choice that's that's a wonderful feature i use cody midnight at work and i use dracula at home that's awesome yeah that's that's really nice um so yeah so feel free to do that so here we're going to clone our e-cars application actually so i'm going to quickly move on to our browser so again uh you know we have a lot of sample apps and this is one of the the you know really we have invested a lot uh developer advocates and evangelists here spent a lot of time actually uh trying to refresh all of these apps as uh those salesforce releases happen and all of these are open source meaning you know you can go tear this application really look at how we are built and each of this application also has trailhead modules of course you know we are writing we're still writing for e-cars and that's going to come uh safe harbor you know in some uh you know some months here but as you can see you know we have like for example easy spaces right we have trailhead modules to help you uh deploy the application you know get used to these uh sample application and all of the code right code components and automation that we have done everything is open source like for example e-cars right it's open source so you can actually get onto the uh you know the application code and look at uh and also you can contribute it you know you can contribute to a repos you can raise issues on this uh you can look at our best practices so most of the applications have follow best practices you know and if something is not following feel free to like raise it up and we'll work it out so so yeah so this is the application essentially so we're going to pick up e-cars as i said you know because well yeah this application right the the best thing about this application that i like is its architecture because it uses you know sales force for sure like the standard sales for sales and service but also it uses heroku to power up a lot of things like for example there's a heroku microservice here to create that pdf uh like you know we don't have to write apex because you know generating pdfs is something that you know you're really pushing the limits of apex you know it might not be the right uh technology right but with no right i know that there are a lot of libraries that can really make this uh really easier right so that's a perfect use for node.js yes so that's why we have you know um a lot of the parts of the application sort of sitting on heroku but it's still we connect that you know we connect that um also you know a lot of uh for example the web app here right so and it's a progressive web app right like let's say you have a front-end application that needs to be progressive web app you know it needs to be really slick right heroku is a platform because you know you can easily build there with lighting web components right so this we have built with lighting web components uh so it's the same technology that a lot of salesforce developers use uh so you can use the same technology even on the on the heroku right and then we have this uh you know apache kafka and iot here you know like uh we are using the service cloud for service technician uh profile and uh you know all the signals we have this apache kafka which is which can process all these signals and you know stream data directly into salesforce right so that's that's powerful to me and that's why i think this is a good example application for exploring not only just the salesforce concepts but also uh you know explore some of the integration aspects of salesforce and also how heroku can fit into your entire application architecture as well and we will have a lot of time in the series to go deeper in each of these parts we are going to be exploring the heroku parts and in upcoming series i'm going to be showing you how to deploy a progressive web application or a standard web application using landing web components open source heroku then we are going to discuss like event driven platform we are going to be talking about data so bear with us this is i know this is a lot of information and this is a huge application that disclaimer i was involved in the development of this since january so it has been like quite a quite a journey building this this app for you all but super happy to be able to present this to you and explain what's going on so you have that experience of building modern app applications and pretty much this is a modern app application that relies on both sales for senator awesome thank you so much uh julian so let's clone this right so as a part of the activity we want to clone this application and deploy only sales for specific parts to it right so we want to clone this um so let me clone this application so you just click on that if somebody has not like sort of learned how to clone on git it's very easy you just have git clone and you put the https url into it now before cloning i want to make sure that i'm on the right directory so let's create a directory so i want to make uh i want to go into my desktop and i want to make a directory there so again cd into the desktop i want to create a directory card salesforce modern app okay and then i will cd into this directory hold on is there uh you know resources let's say somebody is not familiar with these kind of commands right make directory cd into the directory uh i think we have resources on trailhead there is there is one resource on trailhead like command line online basic research to say yes i can find find the name meanwhile you show how to clone sure and also we are going to be sharing all of these different resources on a community we are going to be mentioning uh mentioned in july yeah the trailblazer community group yeah so okay so we have this i've seen it into it right i've seen it into this specific directory now before that right we want to make sure also that uh you know we have this dev hub anybody so let me go back and log into an arc so i have it's it's a developer arc again so i showed you how to create a developer arc right so i want to log into this developer hub and show you how to you know sort of enable that developer hub so that you can create scratch arcs now i know that a lot of you might be working in salesforce enterprise companies that already have a production arc so this again is available on the production org as well and a lot of you might not still have adopted uh you know sort of scratch art based development because you might have a lot of metadata and it's a project in itself to you know decompose that metadata and make it make sure that it becomes a part of a scratch arc based model now if you have not right do not worry you can actually use all of these things with developer arc or you know your developer sandboxes as well so we have enabled this functionality called source tracking in the developer second box so once you enable that you know you should be able to use same commands there as well so you basically go to dev hub so go to dev hub in your production org or in your developer org or in your you know partner business org wherever so you will find a setting called developer hub you go and enable the developer hub this allows you to basically create scratch art so that's the the whole idea of developer hub it's a hub arc you can think of it as a parent or from where you generate as many as scratch offs as you want but for if you're using a developer edition arc obviously we have some limits on how many scratch you can have at a time inside i think it's three to five i think it's three uh but it should be you know if you need more arc create more developer edition arcs uh you know there's there's no limit that way uh also as i was saying right if you're using sandboxes make sure to change this to enable so that next time you create a sandbox out of your production org um so so holi on this might be very interesting to you like i'm talking about sandboxes right it might i was going to ask you that question because yeah what does that say yeah for me there is like a a question between what is the scratch work or the difference between a scratch work and a sandbox and i know how that looks so if you can explain that to me uh the people that are watching us yeah yeah so uh julian so what is a sandbox is so till now we didn't have this concept of scratch arts okay it is only in last two years or three years i must say that we came up with this scratch our concept before that we only had the sandboxes so anything that you build you build in sandbox and then you use something called chainset to move that change to production so think of it as a your sandbox is a branch you know it's a good think of it as a git branch okay so our version control itself is uh an arc you know it's it's not like you know all of your code is in the sandbox instead of your source control and that is what you know the change that we are trying to do now is instead of having all the code in the arg and your arg is like uh the center for everything right we are trying to use the version control right so if you look at all of our sample gallery applications all the source is in the github so tomorrow if i want to create an application because i have the source i can easily produce that application right earlier it was not like that so it was like you have a production arc and a lot of the developers just use the production arc to build their functionality you know uh but we give give the sandboxes so you can generate the sandbox build your functionality test it and then move your change to the production from the sandbox to the production okay so you can have different sandboxes like you can have you know hundreds of sandboxes you know and your developers everyone can have their own sandboxes build the functionality ship it up to the production or you can have one more sandbox to do your testing etc right it's not source driven it's mainly argument that's why we call it as like auric driven because we are doing everything in the ark testing development right that's your environment to do everything there's no source control here right you're not pulling up the metadata you're using something called chainsaw so that's sandboxes a lot of developers still use sandboxes because you know they have files of metadata already created a lot of code so what sandboxes allow you to do one thing is let's say i have a production or right and i have all the functionality there now if i create a sandbox i'll have the same functionality you know and same metadata components that's there in the production so for example if you enable settings if you enable licenses if you have features right you get the same thing in the sandbox it's just a replica of your production so that you can build your feature and then you can ship that feature to the production and then when you create a new sandbox out of it it again has all the features there so think of your sandboxes as essentially like a great branch you know but yeah gene staging yeah you can treat it as staging yeah or what we used to call before pre-production or pre-production yeah pre-production you know you can call it as you can have as many as them you can have one for pre-prod you can have one for uat you can one have one for development right so you basically use these sandboxes to to do your functionality uh but now we have you know it it's hard actually to decompose salesforce metadata you know because you might have created like like in this application right we have how much of metadata you know it's it's pretty small right you have these many metadata yeah but like for example i know that in an enterprise application you might have like thousands of classes you know so you know if your application like sort of grows big right and it's all monolith that is another aspect it's all monolith at this point for a lot of our arcs right where it's not decomposed into modules and that's where like scratch arts offer that functionality where you know with all this new packaging technology like 2gp unlock packages you can really build modular application and that's one of the the aim of the series is we also show that aspect of it like how to build you know modular scalable applications where you know building deploying everything is source driven and it's so easier so how to you know sort of engineer applications on salesforce in a modern way right so that's the aim of this series uh anyways so so now that we have understood we have this devops the next step here is to authenticate to the developer okay so to authenticate to the dev hub you basically go so first of all i want to make sure that i'm on the right folder i think i'm on the right right folder right so to authenticate you basically need to clone so let's clone the project um i think we didn't clone the project right so let's clone the project i thought i typed the command did i did yeah i think i think we didn't clone the project okay so let's do git clone and then we go back to our repo ecards repo and we just say code click on this and get clone and then we clone the project there it is it's it's all there in this ecard folder so i'm going to say ecash there it is and then i'm going to say code dot so that i open that specific folder right in the github so as you can see it has this application code now if i actually open the the terminal right command shift so how do i open the terminal new terminal right so not terminal sorry the command palette so when i say command shift p my command palette right when i say sfdx now i get all the sfdx commands right you see all the sfdx commands that a visual studio code provides and it's basically a convenience over the cli commands nothing more than that you know but but there are certain capabilities again in here but let's authenticate so we have this command to authorize the devops that's the first step is to authorize a dev hub you know so that we can create the scratch art so you say authorize dev hub it will open the environment i need to go through the authentication again so i just select this and i just put the password and key in the password here so once i sort of log in so i'm logged in now as you can see successfully logged in right so now i've authorized the devops successfully so i've authorized it right it ran this cli command so essentially it's running the cli commands uh so that i didn't have to type this all lengthy command like sfdx force authwab login so i don't have to type this so you know it did the job for me right now the next step is to create a scratch arc so that we can deploy this source code to our scratcher so let's do that so we go to command palette again sfdx there's a neat little convenience command called create a scratch arc right now before i i execute it right it's gonna ask me for a definition file i'm gonna select that i'm gonna explain it as my scratch org is sort of generating right so let's say i need it only for seven days right so let's explain like what is that scratch definition file right so this is the file that it requires to create the scratch order now in salesforce environments right we have something called as settings right so for example there might be settings for security there might be settings to enable features like for example walkthroughs is one of the features where you know you can create a prompt you know to explain the different features of the application right and there are so many features there are hundreds of features actually and there are thousands of settings you know in in salesforce environment that you can do so uh so your scratch if it requires certain settings and certain features right uh you actually specify through this json file so you say features and then you open this javascript array again and then you specify you keep specifying by comma separated and you specify all the features that you need like for example somebody needs service cloud somebody needs sales cloud somebody is building application for let's say a healthcare and we we call it as health cloud that has all the you know all the objects and other functionality for healthcare professionals right for healthcare vertical similarly we have one for financial services right so we have so many so we support all these verticals as well julian and also we support functionalities like service cloud sales card there is a lot more like for example salesforce revenue cloud which is the new one that got generated so there's so many things that we support you know it's evergreen it's evergreen and it's uh you can say that you know it's continuously growing ecosystem where you know we are creating vertical centric applications as well and all of them are packaged so that you know you can so for to support that right we have this feature so you support you say features you say settings right and then if you need some sample data you can turn this flag on right in this case we have our own sample data in our repo which we want to push that's why it's false so as you can see my scratch is generated i will click on this and you should see uh the scratch art the mtr it doesn't have any code you know it's pretty clean at this point it's an environment which has this some settings that got enabled because we specified that's a clean uh arc right as you can see if i look at the applications here it has only or only the out of box application that comes with it but we want to deploy this e-cart application and see in action right so i go back to my visual studio code here and then what we need here is to push this source to the scratch r right so we need to push the source so that we can see so again command shift p sfdx right and say push you should see that to push to the r right now if you are on terminal you know and you like to type type it as well you know for source push that's all it takes you know push so now this is going to push all the source code that is there so which repository right like which how do i know how do you how does it know which path to actually pull all these components right so that is why we have this uh file called sfdx project dot json so we should have a file called sfpxproject.json and here we define the directories there's a lot more we can do with this file we will actually explore throughout the series but for now it says that our path for the deployment is force app folder so we have all the salesforce components here like for example the objects you know the the classes uh you know the lighting web components that you have built fully on uh all of these are there in this uh in this folder and we say okay push this this is our default right and also the api version that is very important so 50 is our latest api version right uh so we also are versionable right so our scratch are created in this new winter release arc and we are pushing with the source api version 50. generally you select the new version but you know some sometimes you have the the older version as well and you can adjust that so look what happened hold on you know in some time maybe it's less than a minute it pushed all our code you know all all this lining web components all these declarative features that we are done this app and it has pushed to this now you have to assign the permission set before we can see it because we are secure by default that is you know we do not allow access to the app or we do not allow access to uh you know anything else like we do not allow access unless you know you provide the permission and that's why i think the repo has this permission set so we have two permission sets we have one for e-cards i think we have only one permission set while the other permissions that comes out of box it's automatically generated so we have this e-card permission where we have all of these we'll explore what is permission but for now just let's give the permission and i think there's a command for that to give the permission um yeah here is the interesting stuff julian that um this command we do not have a vs code like an alternative you know there's no vs code convenience for this command at this point right but let's try something new today you know let's try exploring what i call it as um task.json and this is my favorite feature actually in vs code that you can actually do you can actually create something called task start json okay and you know julian you're gonna like this for sure um i'm gonna go to my gif so that i can copy some sample boilerplate here so that i can show you something that i really want to show all our developers who you know not only salesforce developers but you know in general any developer right so i'm creating my own build command now right okay so i'm gonna say assign permission set that's my command okay and the default will be shell now the arguments for this right the arguments for this will be my command that i want to execute so for example uh was the command that we were building up here so we were building four so we read this one right assign and this permission right so i'm gonna go here and say this right so this is my command i also have n right now and without without the sftx in that case oh yeah yeah sorry without the sftx correct because sodx is my my command right so assign right now the next thing is n and we know and e let's let's hard code for now but you know you can actually keep this as a variable you know so next time if you want to assign any other permission set you can actually just put the name in the ui so i just want to get to the ui at this point so i think that one is uh lowercase e cars lowercase is it lowercase okay perfectly thanks for correcting it right and i want to make sure that this is part of a group called build so there is a group called build you can create your own and i always want to be on the presentation there right so now look look what happens so when when i say command shift b right we should see this command as well so one second okay one one one six so actually where should that leave you created the file on the sfdx folder no it should live in the vs.vs code folder so we need okay so i just need to make sure that i have the dot vs dot vs code one sec one sec how do i get out of i think it's escape okay so now i need just a dot vs code folder right and then i just need to make sure that i have the task.json inside this task.json move it right now now command shift b right you see this there you go there you go and now what happens look what happens so when i run this it runs this command in the terminal so this is exciting to me you know so it did the job for me right so as a developer if i have to run some node command or let's say if i have to run any of the cli commands that are not there i can build my own again you know it's command shift to be we call it as build task right and you can actually you can create your shell script if you want you can create your nodes node script if you want and you can also you know pretty much run any cli commands using this you know so this is a really cool feature i would definitely request uh developers to actually explore task.json it's also well documented in the in the vs code uh guide right um so yeah so now um hold on let's let's see if we have this application actually we'll also need some data um so so let's actually run the data command as well again if you are if you want to like you know sort of not have to type this every time like this is okay because there's like only one time that we are typing right hold on but let's say you have a command that you're frequently typing it's always good to create a build task like the one that i did you know so now i have the data as well hold on so we should be seeing the now we should be seeing the application no so i'm refreshing this so now we should see the application so let's come back we should see the e-cars application there it is the showroom application right and it has all the metadata components like for example i know that vehicles is one of the objects we have this beautiful inventory page we will we will design this page in one of the sessions right we have this lovely car configurator page hoolion um which uses again lining web components you know uh to sort of build right so so we have got this application and this is how easy it is to actually clone any of our sample gallery applications it's basically you just clone you follow the instructions on the github and you should be pretty much um you should have your application sort of up and run okay so now um let's get back to our slides hold on and wind it up uh we are over the time a bit so so we have the helpful references for you uh we will share this uh you know wheelchairs again it has a github basis it has the command line interface trailer module that we were talking about early on uh it has all their heroku references on how to get started with heroku platform it has the oakley documentation link so there's a lot more here and also uh you know there's a sample gallery application here like for example you can uh you know go to this link and find all our sample gallery apps and this is very important uh you know join us through this url to the trailblazer community where we are going to share all these slides uh and also ask the the references right so also ask the you know ask for questions you know give us feedback what you would like to see in our sessions and hopefully you're liking these sessions uh so thank you so much uh again and catch us for our next session uh and you know keep following trailhead live for some amazing content here uh over to you holi on okay thank you very much and see you on the next one bye bye bye take care thank you everyone
