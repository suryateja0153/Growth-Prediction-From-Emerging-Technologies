 so I think of strategic partnerships often how I think of you know the friends that you sort of bring closely into your network with a strategic partnership you really are looking for quality over quantity and so I would want fewer but more impactful partnerships so that's sort of step one for how I I think about it how I approach it I think the second is always making sure that incentives are aligned so that you're actually you know building on the partnership and driving momentum and then the third is you know just really the importance of partnerships today more than ever and so with the market trends you and I just referenced and sort of the industry being disrupted I think that you know everyone sort of needs to come together but when you come together and you need to think through of you know few and impactful partnerships and so for us you know can ablute a spotlight that have been really exciting on the global front we've had a fantastic partnership and we recently made an investment in info some and so you know if we think about the market trends where first party data activation is more important than ever as regulation increases as you know the cookie goes away and as identity becomes much more pronounced part of brands and agency strategy having info some as a partner that allows us to you know safely onboard first party data and activate it is incredibly important to us at Zander and and another one when we think about the way that audiences have been such demand by brands and agencies we I think of IPG and so everything that they're doing with matter kind strategically investing in data technology and addressable media is completely on brand for zander and it's really exciting to see the look beyond demos to drive results and so I think those are sort you know those are two examples that I think of and I want to just ask you some thoughts about opportunities for the platform and this solution globally yeah I think what's great about the fact that the US has sort of been leading in the trends and the outside of the u.s. that they're following is you get to be a little bit of few steps ahead and so what we're seeing and our kids like a backhand Mia and Latium is that they're expected to become even more powerful and there's going to be more opportunities to grow and so the same you know the same traditional viewership declines that we've seen in the US they're just going to continue to accelerate in those markets as well although there are differences market to market in terms of the way that sort of television is packaged together I think ultimately this notion of more content being consumed over IP and in more fragmented environments and across OTT connected TV digital video are the trends that we're gonna see which uh which creates fragmented audiences and makes it you know more important than ever that you sort of had some advanced TV and digital solutions and so I think that those markets outside the US are catching up I think they're gonna be really large opportunities for those who play and Lauren I wanted to ask you about this notion of convergence what it means to you guys what it means to the industry and perhaps as an extension of that what it means to the TV marketplace and the up fronts which are really quite different of course this year it's really just about reaching and engaging consumers across all channels and so you know for us that means a more relevant message it it means the right forecasting but if you think about it consumers just aren't tuned in into the same one live stream at the same exact time they're consuming in so many different ways and so many different channels which creates a ton of complexities to reach them and so for for the opportunity ahead and so the solution of convergence and what that means in terms of the way that the industry needs to think about it is unifying automating planning activation and measurement and attribution and so all of those audiences that live across those premium environments we need to find the technology and the data to really connect and allow you to plan and forecast across those screens that'll help make up for the loss and scale that you're seeing as traditional TV continues to decline and also allowing for the way that marketers are starting to drive towards specific objectives and specific outcomes but again I think when you think about it there's it's not just connecting and sort of building those tools to allow for that planning and measurements also raising the standards of that as well and so in order to do it it's going to take a ton of collaboration and I think working together across many platforms and many partners and a lot of the ways that we've been working with you know other programmers you know not just one of media you know an AMC and then Disney I think you know it's going to just provide a trusted streamlined platform and opportunity for more marketplaces in doing that and so I'm really excited about convergence because it relates to your question on the upfront I mean I think the up friends obviously and I've heard this many times a lot of your conversations Andy you know the up fronts are experiencing a really different moment but I think there's a lot of elements of the efforts that have been changing over time in the sense that brands and agencies they've wanted for a long time to have more of a portfolio view where the upper ins isn't just about as traditional continues to decline it's not just about mass reach and scale it's also about a lot of other you know parts of the strategy that meets certain objectives and so I think there's there's sort of no better opportunity than what we have as we've come together with more media where we really package and that create that portfolio offering and so I'm really excited about that I think it's meeting marketers where they are and I think the notion of maybe the song and dance of the up-front and the production and that sort of been a part of this this sort of historic process I think that will continue to look different it looks different in in the year 2020 but I think that will continue to be disrupted but I think the notion of marketers still wanting you know the reach and scale of you know that linear TV offers will continue as a part of their objective and I also think the notion of wanting it you know at a discounted rate will continue and so I think there's you know the up friends I think takes a little bit of a beating especially this year but I think there's a a lot of elements of the up fronts that will continue and I think for me it's more just how do you offer brands and agencies more of a portfolio view of offerings so that they can meet those objectives you
