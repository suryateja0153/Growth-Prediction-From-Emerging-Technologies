 [Music] hello everyone from every part of the world i hope that you are safe and sound my name is bernard and i'm the data center software leader from secure power division and i'm responsible for the east asia pacific japan as well as greater indian market and i'm based out in singapore today we're going to talk about why remote it infrastructure management is critical to your business as an i.t solution provider and to the business of your customers let's first start by looking at how much data is generated a day and what this look like as we enter to an even more data-driven future here are some key daily statistics highlighted in the iphone graphic here now if you were to follow me at the bottom left hand corner we are seeing about 294 billion emails are being sent a day there's a lot of tweets being sent out 500 millions of it four petabytes of data are created on facebook so we are very much socially connected today um when we move bottom we are talking about five terabytes of data are created from each connected car so we're saying that more and more consumers are using google maps uh apple carplay when we look at the right hand side 65 billion messages are sent on whatsapp and that is excluding uh platforms like wechat and line 5 billion searches are made and all of these 5 billion 3.5 billion comes from google search so what we are seeing is that by 2025 is estimated that 463 hexabytes of data will be created each day globally now that's the equivalent of about 212 dvds per day now with the increase of remote workforce i believe these numbers would search tremendously today now data is growing in size shape and density so to digest this amount of data we will need to rethink how data will be delivered across different locations in faster speed and in a more resilient state with the new computing ecosystem of today we call this the hybrid i.t the traditional centralized data center is still part of the picture but we see an emergence of regional age and local age now what we see happening is that centralization is around the large cloud and co-law providers and there's a new push towards compute storage closer to the age especially in today's world where there's a huge increase in remote workforce where employees are tasked to continue to work from home as well as communicating with their peers through online collaboration tools like how we are running the virtual forum today right in the edius education sectors teachers are tasked to deliver their training sessions online tasks creating lots of pressure on the need for an age data center so how can we you and i help the it professionals to deal with the new challenges brought by the emergence of hybrid i.t without seizing the opportunities that comes along with it so given the increasing trend towards age it is also clear that partners like you are critical to the i.t professionals success in addressing the challenges caused by age now with the computing power being dispatched everywhere and no additional stuff can be present on site today i.t professionals are turning towards you the i.t consultants and many service providers to provide support now what are the kind of help that they are that they are looking for first they want help in understanding how do they know if they have a problem before it's too late who can help them in ensuring their equipment is always well maintained there are so many alarms out there today how do i know which ones are critical and which one do i need to prioritize first um how do i monitor and maintain this equipment so the focus of this session here is to talk about how ecostruxure it could help partners like you and ultimately your customers to simplify the way each infrastructures that are being complexed are being managed by the platform so what is ecostruxure i.t so ecostructure i.t is schneider electric's next generation infrastructure management platform that simplifies the way it and data center professionals optimizes its infrastructure performance by mitigating risk and providing one visibility insights into the health of your customers monitor infrastructure two flexibility to monitor different brands of iot connected devices in other words we are vendor agnostic three providing analytics based actionable insights that allows partners like you to make the necessary recommendations to your end customers on the best ways to optimize their performance and mitigate potential risk last but not least this is driven by a very flexible subscription model in other words pay as per use so we need to help our customers that rely on a more secure resilient scalable and efficient infrastructure by becoming more than a vendor we need to be a trusted advisor doing so will enable you to better serve your customers while unlocking recurring revenue streams and new business opportunities despite the customer's needs and your opportunity as a partner it may also be surprising for you to learn that based on the recent report from solarwinds and the 21st group only 27 of partners leading with software and services provide power and cooling of critical infrastructure monitoring to their end customers and out of that 27 that we that we highlight here most of them are only monitoring purely for online and offline status now you ask me is this sufficient i think there's a lot more to power and cooling monitoring than just online and offline status which is pretty much basic so since last year where we were just introducing ecostructure i.t to our partners we have seen some interesting ways how our partners has been leveraging the platform to create more value for their customers while making sure that they capture some themselves as well now let's go through these four models and based on the partners trends that we see today majority are on a buy and resale model tomorrow what the partners do envision is to not only resell but manage by providing more value-added services now this is the reason why is that there's a massive push from the end users to as to outsource power and cooling management and monitoring now this adoption model is forming a kind of a gauge from providing value-added services to become full msp through a mixed or business model which includes value-added reselling plus generating value added assessment reports to your end customers so if we look at the msp side of it now in 2019 70 of msps plan to grow managed or recurring revenue services now this is according to a research we have conducted with analytics firms such as analytics and the channel code if we look at the var which is value-added reseller side of it we know that there's a shift going on from var to professional services and now managed services now we observe that with more clients moving some or all of their applications to subscription models in the cloud value-added resellers or vars have had to deal with having fewer products and projects to sell now in addition to some new i.t solutions inherently that requires more management and support some vars are adapting by migrating towards an msp model now what we see is that ecostruxure i.t for partners is being developed for partners like you into transforming into what is the best ways and easiest way to provide additional service to your customers so let's take a look at a couple of real-life examples that we have across the four adoption models here now when we look at the first model the buy and resell now what we do see is that partners resells it license to the customers and the customers manages the environment itself so this model is what we call binary sell customers do it themselves which is a diy approach now how eco structure it for partners could give you insights into allowing you to buy and resell is typically through a portal where it allows you to first of all invite your customers to be part of the community so once the customer signs out and is part of your your portal you will start to be able to understand what are the level of support they are currently on now are they currently on trial if they are it's about time for you to convert them from trial to subscription based model and that's where it allows you to gain more revenue now if your customers are currently on a licensing model that is going to expire soon the good news is that you are there to look for them and recommend them to renew and that's again an additional revenue for your organization now there's also the third category and that means that the customers likes the product and they're using more than what they have paid for and that's what we call exceeding the license card and again this is where you can approach the customers to get them to buy more licenses from us all right and that's what we call the buy and resell model where we do have a portal for partners like you to monitor the progress of your individual customers and here's a use case that we have in the u.s where the solution provider is actually providing support for equipment manufacturer in fact this equipment manufacturer rents out construction equipments to its customers and today the msps or the solution providers are helping them to monitor 100 devices across 20 plus locations and for this particular partner the whole idea here and intention here is just to buy and resell and allow their end customers to monitor buy down by themselves all right and by doing so it allows the partners to get a annual recurring revenue of about 6450 us dollars per year for 100 notes devices all right and if the customer were to like the product they will continue to renew 6450 per year with the partner a year later now the second model here that we talk about is the value-added services and partners uses ecostructure i.t to collect data to provide recommendation back to the customers as a next step all right in this form it allows partners like you while on this journey to capture new revenue streams through assessments and this is how ecostruxure iit could provide partners like you where we have a recommendation tab here inside this tab it allows you to explore possible improvement or opportunities for your customers based on the assessments that we collect inside this report you get to have two categories whether the customers requires to replace its ups or replacements of its batteries and with actionable insights and reasons to reach out to customers with tailored suggestions to modernize their infrastructure now if i would like to pick an example i'm going to deep dive into replacement of ups batteries here you get to see a ups course that represents the overall health of the monitored ups devices so keeping the score high it means that the it optimizes the maintainers and it manages to extend the life of the device now when we look at the low scoring ones are probably the ones that you need to deep dive and look into the reasons on why this particular device is having a very very low score now if you look at this particular ups here we can actually deep dive and identify you know the reason why the batteries need replacement and when we when we click on it and we deep dive into the next level you'll be able to see a report that actually tells you why this particular ups battery needs a replacement first of all the age of the battery is five years old it's very old and one of the possible reasons why the battery needs replacement is because it is running at a very very high temperature of about 30 degrees all right where the recommended range that we're looking at is between 20 to 25 and what are the possible root causes on why the battery wear into such state is because uh 61 is due to the age is pretty old and the remaining 35.5 is due to the battery temperature it's operating at now if you want to look at benchmarking on how this particular device is being used as compared to the rest of the populations that the data lake has collected we have a bench marking here where it gives you an understanding through this particular line to tell you where you are at so for this instance i'm running at 30 degrees whereas the majority of the populations that were collected are running at the range of about 20 to 25 all right likewise for the battery age you're running on a pretty old battery that is at the age of five whereas the rest of the population that we collected on the data lake is running at the range of about four years and below next up is the ups h and that gives you the gauge of the number of users that's using this particular ups in the in the population that we have collected in our system itself and majority of them are running probably a ups of age of about four years and below all right now with this value added services it really gives you a lot of insights and possibilities for you to to provide recommendations to your customers on what is the next action steps that they need to look into so let's look into a partner so this particular solution provider in the u.s is our traditional schneider electric reseller their core focus is to sell schneider's ups and one of the customer that they actually managed to engage is in the healthcare industry where this particular customer has about 750 devices that spread across about 90 locations so for a 750 node device opportunity uh then the amount that they get out of it by selling the the licenses is about 20 000 u.s dollars right so on the year to year to manage 750 devices across 90 location the partner is selling 20 000 a year as a subscription offer now on top of the buy and resell model the partner took an additional step and that is to leverage on the assessment reports that ite could provide and use it as a consultative tool for their end customer and guess what through the assessment report they managed to uncover one million one million dollars worth of hardware opportunities that requires immediate attention all right all of these one million today they have managed to capture about 700k of hardware purchases from the end customers there's top priority that needs to be to be replaced immediately and the remaining 300 000 are being placed as a budget for next year so if you could imagine by just selling a 20k annual recurring revenue license to your customers and by leveraging on the big data that the platform could collect there's a potential upside to grow the business from twenty thousand to one million dollars and that's all by using uh the ecostructure it platform coupled with the assessment reports that you can bundle as a value-added service now the next model that we're looking at is purely about providing managed service provider right and and this is potentially a new business model that partners could could leverage on the out-of-the-box platform and by leveraging autobots platform to build a new business model by offering pre-packaged offers all right for monitoring as well as management and full turnkey of management monitoring and remediation services all right so this is a particular customer or a partner sorry where we are actually looking into where is an msp in new york the whole idea is to focus on on hardware and managing their end customers environment and this particular customer that they managed to to to penetrate into is is in education sector today this particular customer has about 400 plus devices that is connected is across a real distributed environment now by monitoring 400 nodes devices the annual recurring revenue of subscription license for this particular partner is 18 000 us dollars right so remember 18 000 us dollars based on the buy and resale model but what they did is they take this with another step forward now what did they do is that they actually create what we call um managed service offers in a three-tier approach all right so what they did was they created a three-tier packages for the end customers to pick and choose and this is the offer that they provide all right so offer number one uh they provide a very basic offer just purely monitoring of the devices status on and off provide alarm notifications to the end users as well as the monthly reports in terms of the utilization to the end users itself and they're wrapping it around with a 60 per node per device per year pricing and based on the 400 nodes uh that the customer has this is a potential increase of revenue from 18 000 per year to 24 000 all right now the second tier that they're actually offering as part of their offer is to provide a premium support where they allow the customers to give them a call and providing them a help desk phone support all right if there's a problem recommendations will be provided to help address any of the issues that the customers encounter and on top of that what they're providing is a quarterly health check that leads into the health of the devices security of the devices and as well as how well they are utilizing the ups itself and at the same time providing insights into how the system is performing by analyzing the alarms if the device has triggered any all right and with this value added services uh this is an offer that is based on 20 dollars per month per device and if you look at the yearly prices about close to about 240 us dollars all right and if we then multiply this across 400 device there's a potential revenue of about 96 000 based on this scenario that we are discussing right now the last model is premium plus 40 to 50 a month per device and this includes dispatching resources on-site to troubleshoot the particular issue that has been triggered leveraging on the big data pool that the ecostructure it provides to insights into analytics and predictive capability provide mass firmware upgrades and configuration across devices and looking into the security patches for the hardwares that has been monitored now only not wrapping around this the entire offer that the partner came up with the premium tier is about 40 usd to 50 usd per month and if we wrap it up across a year for 400 those there's a potential upside of about 192 000. um so there's a lot of opportunities for managed service providers and for this particular opportunity their partner managed to close it at 96 000 which is getting the customers to sign up the premium offer now at the end of the year if the premium offer is a value that the customer likes the support is good there's a potential opportunity to to upgrade the customer from a premium to a premium plus so able to move a 96 000 uh annual recurring revenue to 192 000 annual recurring revenue and that's a huge substantial jump for the partners itself uh last but not least is to really enhance partners who are already on the msp bandwagon right we do have partners uh in the u.s that are already a mature msp provider today they are using existing third-party remote monitoring and management platform like solarwinds cassaya science logic what they want to do is that they want to actually expand onto their existing managed service provider portfolio so for this particular the in the for this particular partner in the u.s they're actually offering a power as a service offer and they leverage service now that's built around the apc ups solution while providing the executive customer portal to allow their customers to track their environment and the partner sees the value of eco-structure i.t by leveraging on the existing power as a service offer they would like to expand the offer by by using our big data analytics capability and have it interfaced with their customer portal and by doing that it is in the form of using apis that we exposed out and have it integrated to really create the key differentiation and the additional uh value to their end customers and and the whole reason behind it is to create the stickiness for their and customers to them all right so what we want to achieve and that's the whole idea here is to allow you as the partner to become the trusted advisor to your end customers i mean apart from mitigating risk downtime and loss of revenue for your customers we really want you to to leverage on the five key benefits to add these capabilities into the dna of your offer and the first one and the most critical one is allowing you to get full visibility into all the it sites even at the most remote ones all right with the right visibility and insights you can proactively send someone down on site to replace a battery near its end of life so that in the event of a power outage your customers environment still remains safe the second need we saw earlier was to really create and form an ecosystem between us vendors and you the partners where we could actually extend our team of experts across the globe to really provide the necessary troubleshooting mechanism as well as on-site support for your end customers the fourth bit is really to to with the right remote management platform it really gives you the ability to access and manage your customers devices anywhere anytime so that you know which device requires attention before an issue arises and the most important thing is to allow you to proactively plan for hardware and software refreshes which means making additional revenue on top of your license resale model right last but not least is to really complete your current set of reports by adding the power and coding key matrixes and data for complete i.t infrastructure management service for your customers so we want you to be the trusted advisor in helping customers to rely on a more secure resilient scalable and efficient infrastructure now it all starts by understanding that first remote id infrastructure management is more than just monitoring if the power is on and off so let's partner to success together right do get in touch with your schneider electric rep to learn more on how you get started and how do you get your partners and customers on board once again i thank you for your time stay safe and be kind to one another thank you
