platinum account while it still lasts as you know there will be the price increase is coming very soon and the price will be going up but the value of the actual products that you will get the numbers

be awesome so i don't want to go into GrooveVideo today but i want to actually jump in and actu and talk to you about three best ways to promote GrooveFunnels so what a lot of people are doing when they get their hands on the links and i will let me just show you quickly where you can get your links in case you are new to this platform you go into your GrooveFunnels dashboard so there is three options either you click here to the affiliate program you click to learn more and then you scroll down to see this one connecting to GrooveSell it will load in everything that you have to actually promote the promotion tools to promote GrooveFunnels as the product okay so just close this um the next thing that you need to do is actually get your links so you choose between these links what i suggest you to go through all of these just click on them and then right click go to and just see what the difference is between the links there is a slight difference for example GrooveFunnels was this one there is another link for the webinar replay there was a webinar that was done about this software so you can also take this link or there is a landing page that is focused on GrooveSell so you can also sell this one separately not only GrooveFunnels but you can focus on GrooveSell on one product only not only on the package of products so you can see what you actually want to promote you can see there is a direct direct to upgrade page there is a short copy landing page which is some people are saying that it uh it works better than the other ones because immediately when you load it people can see the video and people can see the checkout page and they don't have a lot of information but the information was provided through the video itself so in case you want you can do that one as well so just see what works the best for you test it out and play with it but when you decided actually that you want to start promoting just take a link for example this one and then go out there and share it so you can share it using these promo tools for example you can go to social media and then just click share on facebook and then you click that button and this text over here will be getting shared with your affiliate link already here as you can see your affiliate is already inside here this is how the post will would look like with the the text already in here the your affiliate link is there it is showing up on facebook and this is basically a way one way to do it go to this promo tools you will find a lot of good uh stuff that you can use but for today i want to show you something that i believe is the best ways uh to promote so now you know where to get your link so now you have a product this link is your product you are selling people on to click on your link okay so this link is now your product now this you keep in mind so let me just go into the presentation there is actually actually two ways of getting your audience first or getting your product first or actually getting your audience first or getting the audience to find you so these are the two ways let me just talk about the first way first the first way is you finding your audience and there's a there's a script or there's like a uh it's something that is universal it was it it is uh it is already in sales for a long long time and the easiest way to sell is to find an audience understand their problem not just find out their problem but understand them like deeply understand them okay this is actually making them pain and this is this is making them feel this way and that way so you need to understand the problem and then third find a solution and then sell it to them so you have the audience you know their problem you find a solution and you sell this solution to the audience that have this problem this is the best way to sell and this is that that's why this is the number one way which i usually recommend and using this way you have actually a lot of different ways you know and it's just like the whole wide world is your market um the reason is because you can niche down or niche down why i say niche down is what i mean you find a direct audience for example you find people that need this product as you remember i said your product is your link you have the link to promote GrooveFunnels this is your product now who would actually need your need this product who would actually need access to to GrooveFunnels um let me just see your answers actually put in your best guess who actually needs these kinds of products like GrooveFunnels for for tools with GroovePages GrooveSell GrooveVideo that is out now you who needs these kind of products please put your best guesses in in the comment section let's just see what how you are thinking um i actually touched upon this topic uh in the previous videos but in this one i really want to go deep and explain what niching down means so there's a couple okay facebook user saying everyone i agree with you from the sales point that everybody should just click on my link but not everybody needs this not everybody feels pain uh with their problems and then this product will solve their pain so who actually needs like really really needs this if somebody would would show them for example there's a there's a process called a thinking process called um cancer corollary i believe this is it it's a very complicated word which i don't use but the point is imagine you have the the the product to cure cancer who would need this product well the audience would be everybody that has our cancer or everybody that has a loved one that has cancer so this is a very very bad a very bad example but this is where you see the need you have a solution and you have an audience that has a need and this is the need you are providing a solution the cure for a problem and this is what you need to find this is where you need to niche down and find their problems understand their problems um okay um there is keisha saying people selling selling digital products that is correct um anyone who had who has an online business and wants to be online absolutely very good uh tuan saying uh coaches and course creators work best for me now that is so basically twan is saying that he is already niching down he's selling it to course uh coaches and course creators so that is a correct answer as well everyone i already showed this uh new marketers that is absolutely correct but there is marketers in all kinds of different ways there is marketers doing doing marketing in all kinds of different niches so even if you have marketers even if you have coaches you can still niche down you can still go deeper and deeper and deeper um so that is all correct let me just see other uh answers every business i believe every business nowadays needs a website so that is correct as well people want to create passive income absolutely local businesses local businesses agency owners people trying to dropship including niche stores absolutely anyone looking to save money that is correct so this product now you have a couple of good niches that or or ideas from other users it's not from me um and there is like answers are coming in so from eldon anyone waiting to to to own or run a business uh on or offline absolutely disgruntled wordpress users bam there's a new one this is a very good one people that have multiple subscriptions and are not making much money from them absolutely uh for me speakers and authors absolutely online marketers very good eric seo for affiliate marketers absolutely internet marketers work from home um specific affiliate marketers that are selling on their people's products people who own websites that load super slow very good so okay so this is answering to somebody else but yes now you have some ideas what niching down means finding your audience and offering them a solution and this solution that you have your link your product is a solution to all these now you've seen not me but other people that are actually promoting this you've seen what they think about when they saying niche down and who they would actually um think about when they would promote this product even if they are not promoting it yet this is who they are thinking about would need it so but this is not all let me let me show you something else as somebody or a lot of people were saying um let me just see it local businesses every business local business and and this is very correct and i want to show you something that i will give you so there's a bonus and this is the only bonus in this in this presentation unfortunately but i believe this is a big one and what i did is compiled a huge list for you and it's actually a very long list of niches and look at this one guys um don't be afraid of it but there's look at the pages loading in one of 100 123 so it's 123 pages um alphabetically sorted about different niches so let's just say that you you just take one niche and then you go and focus on antique dealers you find the antique dealer so this is your audience you find your audience you listen to what their problem is oh i cannot find uh buyers i don't know how to promote da da da da you listen to them you understand their problems so um i cannot sell this is not a problem this is just like a tip of the iceberg the the problem is much deeper you need to understand their core problem what is the the thing that is holding their back what is the handbrake in this business why can not there why can this business this niche why they cannot find uh customers believe me every product out there has a customers uh like there's items there is products that i would never buy guys there is like the you probably some of you already own it but there is like this this weight you know that you shake and it looks horrible it looks very awkward and people are actually using it and promoting it and then showing it in youtube videos and things like this um okay so i actually forgot let me just let me just quickly jump out i can see already some people coming on let me just share this link with you so that you can jump in immediately um copy this is for you guys on youtube this is for you guys on facebook so just look into these local niches but what i wanted to say that every product has a buyer and what i mean by this like that shaky thing i didn't like it but people bought it and so many people bought it you if you probably remember it there was a a pet rock actually there was some guy that actually packaged up one rock inside the box and sold it this is your pet and people were buying it and this guy became a millionaire and he's like he's like like these products didn't solve any problem imagine if you actually solve a problem in case you are actually helpful to somebody like this is much more value than a pet rock would would have so find your audience understand their problem and offer them help and the way you can offer them help is niching down and actually actually give them give them a solution that is so simple to understand for example let me just tell you what i would do now i found this this niche of antique dealers so i would now take antique dealers google them go on to google go onto google maps in the local area go on to facebook find groups of these local antique dealers and just see what they're talking about what they're complaining about um go to twitter go to this go to that and basically learn everything that i can this would be my step one step two would be to actually compile an offer for them so i don't want to only promote GrooveFunnels like here you go like it's like throwing a bunch of money to to some poor people and then it's like hoping they they invested properly it's not how it works um and i'm not judging poor people i'm just saying that this way of actually doing something is wrong what you need to do is actually create the full solution create the full product and offer um for example do uh create a website that you can actually give to these antique dealers like here here you go you sign up through my affiliate link once you click on it once you sign up you get this template you can start working with this template you fill out your images fill out your text change up your colors if you need help i'm here here we go there is one product you already promoted this was your affiliate link the second one you can offer help you can offer consultation you can offer do it for you uh things you don't have to but this is if you want to go more in depth so there is another product or actually three products this is done for you which is do it for you i will do the the website for you you can offer consultation you can offer um i don't know do it with you so you don't have to do it for them but you can be there step by step you offer your time you sell your time this is already a couple of products that you can sell and and i didn't even go any deeper than just promoting an affiliate product maybe making a template for them or just use a template from GrooveFunnels just make it uh niche specific let's just dive in quickly into GroovePages i want to show you this one because some people may not understand what i mean by niche specific so when you go and create a new site god i just do this because it's automatic for me already um so let me just go back and do it from beginning so you create a new site and you go into the templates area over here and then for example find womanpreneur business template maybe this one or maybe massage center so let's just choose this massage center template you have this massage center template which is already specific it is specifically for massages but who says that this cannot be an antique dealer website like instead of relax and rejuvenate with massage therapy it will say get the best antique deals or whatever their core offer would be or you could you could help the the business owners created the text as well the copy that they would need but just change the images change over the the the colors change over the icons like everything you can modify this template instead of massage images let's just let's just jump in and and find a free stock for antique you just swap out the images to do something else to antique dealers or antique shop or pawn shop or something like this it is loading in slowly because i am uh i'm live streaming as well but yeah just swap out the the images with some kind of images like these ones for antique shops and you make it me specific and not only antique shops like i gave you i believe 2 200 something local business niches you can just go into auto detailing auto elect electric auto loans let's just go into something like that 44 fertility clinics like you can go so deep like you can niche down and actually give them proper solutions there is businesses at this point that are struggling and still closed because of this corona crisis you can get help to these businesses not focus on money get help to them first and they will give back they will upgrade they will uh give you money for your services later on once you help them already get up and running online this tool that you have on your hands and this link this product that you can promote is much more powerful um and don't think about the money only the money think about how much it can change the lives it has this butterfly effect that uh that uh mike is talking about you help out somebody they can help out more people and more people for example if this is a fertility clinic they can help out a lot of people and and these people can help even more people it's just like you do one good deed and it just multiplies it just becomes a chain reaction so offer something valuable don't spam them just just like here is my link click on it ah you didn't upgrade i haven't i didn't get my money this is a completely wrong thinking and this is why a lot of people fail and if you think about the money you will fail i i absolutely have no doubt you have to think about the money but think about the money as a benefit of you helping don't think about the money oh yeah how much money can i get from this piece person and this person and this person this is very greedy thinking and it is just wrong um so yeah there is a lot that you can do here just find your niche like don't don't think that you will be the only one promoting to for example diamonds retail they have a lot of budgets they have a lot of uh needs for for promoting online now when shops are closed and things like this just go out there find a niche promote it to them help them and offer them products offer them bonuses that nobody else can do this is where you will be the go-to person when they are thinking about online business marketing and things like this and this is where you can go and actually be of help and this is where you can just skyrocket your business focus on niche and maybe later when you when you want to just just get on to more then then then you find another niche then for example digital imaging and then you focus on that one and then focus a different one focus on that there is basically unlimited possibilities you have this tool which is not only one product it is a it is a package of products even if somebody doesn't need a website but they want to sell things online through facebook you can promote GrooveSell to them they get a link they've set up their product in Groove so they get a link you can give them the for example you can set this up for them and sell them the the service for example um they can promote on on instagram they can promote this product on facebook it is just so many possibilities you can do with this one it's just mind-blowing just find a niche and then try to help them as the best as you can okay um yes so i believe there's a lot of comments while i was talking um there is leonard simmons saying some people are afraid of failure or success i understand this leonard and you're completely correct but in case you don't try it's like you know what my thinking is and and if i compare myself to my friends that i went to school with i believe i'm more advanced because i have this thinking when i would be lying in bed on my deathbed in the hospital or wherever i will be dying i didn't plan this out but just thinking about it um will i think back on my life and say why did i just do that why didn't i just do it or i should have taken that risk like even if it was a risk i i want i needed to take it just to see what happens it is like this is what how i think and this is how i i don't know if it's good or bad but this is how i decide the way in the course of my life um when i actually a lot of people don't know this but i was like you guys i purchased with my own money the suite of tools which is called GrooveFunnels back in 2019 when it started promoting and i actually said oh my god this is so buggy and i was actually contacting uh contacting john in support and with communication with him he made me stay and then when i when i got in and actually tested out and tweaked and then reported bugs and requested features and things like this i just decided to help just one day i said okay now i know all this stuff but i want to help out because like there's this corona i don't have better things to do i really want to just go out there and help out these people that are new that are jumping in and they don't know these kind of things that i just discovered myself so when i went in there and i started helping out i didn't have a plan that i will one day become the person that is actually educating you guys and and everybody on how to use this suite of tools i just wanted to to help out just try it out let's see what happens like let's just record one video talk about the hierarchy and paid in GroovePages let's just see what happens and then it was like oh my god David it was so helpful thank you very much can you do a video on this can you do a video on that um i believe if you start out with something like this help one person then you will see how how you feel you will you will receive feedback oh my god this was so helpful thank you very much you just changed my life you these this feedback helps a lot this is why i'm here today because i received this feedback and i felt good and i wanted to do more and more and help more because i saw this helps and this and i saw the people were happy with what i did and there's no better feeling when when somebody when you change somebody's life to better and this is what you can do with this GrooveFunnels and your link it seems very simple and it seems very technical i will share my affiliate link but this small thing that you have in your hands can change a lot of lives believe me if just a small small push just try to help out somebody the way that i just i just showed you you can do a lot of good in the world and this is what i want to see i don't want to see a lot of spamming and then a lot of false promises and videos on you get this and this and this and then you if you signed up just don't just sign up with a new email and you will get this and this is wrong um try to help out it's it's not what you what you give the it's not the stuff that you give it's the help that you give the value this is the most important but yeah i will probably need to read through the the comments later on i seen a couple of uh big questions like about gdpr this is not the topic of today's video so i will not be answering to those but i will be going through at the q a i will go through your questions so in case you have any questions about this topic today please pop them in the in the comment section of the live stream and please just put a little q dash and then the question so that i understand that this is for me let's just go on to the next one the second way as i mentioned one is to find your audience and then the other way is to let audience find you okay people are looking for solutions by searching or recommend searching or recommendations so let's say that you have a problem and for example i have now a new background as you can see here and it is wrinkle it has wrinkles on it so what i did today is i was finding solutions on how to get rid of these wrinkles on there and i find it but i will do it later on i just didn't have time this today um what i did is actually hopped on google because we have somewhere where we can search for answers search for solutions what the other way would be is i call somebody that knows about getting rid of these wrinkles and i look for recommendations from these people so what you can do is actually help out the both ways and you should be the solution to provide uh solution provider day find with recommendations and then when searching as well so let me just explain this the number two so the first way was to actually niche down and now you know what that means number two is do reviews this can be done with video this can be done in articles this can be done in podcasts and there's a lot of different things that you can do um there's a link where you can read more about how to write a comparison post but this is not only about writing the post this is also very uh very useful when you are talking about it in a podcast when you are putting it into your uh into your videos and as well in case you are just mentioning these things this is important so just read through this one i i linked it into youtube and to facebook as well but i want to explain it a little bit more in depth so content is king when i search for something i search for a solution through a to a search engine like google or ping or yahoo or i don't know what others like duckduckgo or some unknown ones you will get either written words audio or video content so these are the three types of contents there is more but most of them are just a mix of these um and this is what you will find and this is why they say content is king when you provide content on something that basically the people are looking for a solution you provide content with giving solutions um they can find you to search engines and they can they can find your content and they can see you as the expert on on helping them with that with their problem so you help them with a small thing then you help them maybe uh you offer them a product so they can purchase a product for you or maybe sign up to your affiliate link let me just show you what other uh let me just go on how can you push a customer in the right direction without scaring them off their answer is unbiased advice when you are actually doing these kind of reviews which i mentioned the x versus y product and this is one of the best ways to do in my opinion is to offer solutions like you are switzerland you are not on the side of one you are not on the side of other so you are actually providing them real help in comparing the products for example there is a lot of different products out there like you can compare hubspot to mailchimp or uber and lyft and renting versus buying and disk marketing or debt marketing or GrooveFunnels or click funnels and other products this is not the only products there's like anything dyson vacuum or i don't know phillips vacuum cleaner which one is the better you have a lot of options and i didn't write out a list like with the niches but you can do a lot with comparing the GrooveFunnels suite of tools to other tools and there's a lot i found this image online and they were comparing different parts of GrooveFunnels to other com competing products for example GroovePages pro in this case was compared to click funnels so let's say you provide content for somebody that is looking for for this answer what's the difference between GroovePages and click funnels so you actually write out the content you talk about this one you actually dive into um one product you dive into the other product and then you show proof you show unbiased advice don't say yeah GroovePages is much better because it does this this this clickfunnels is just it's not true every product has his ups and downs GroovePages has his ups and downs as well but what you can do is actually be switzerland be be not on one of the sides not on the other side but somewhere in the middle where you just say okay so this is good at this program this is good in that program but it's not only click funnels that you can uh you can compare GroovePages with you can compare it to breezy you can compare it with wordpress you can compare it with squarespace you can compare it with um so many other wix and weebly and i don't know what other programs are out there these are just some page builders you can also look into it google the best page builders or list of page builders or list of funnel builders because GroovePages can build funnels and websites so you can compare it to website tools or funnel tools or a lot of other tools um so if you provide content on the comparisons like these this product versus that product people will be looking for those solutions looking for those answer and you can be the one that they find and let me just go into google and then provide you provide you with a short demo of how i'm looking for for systems for example i found out about GroovePages in 2019 and the first thing i did was google them and what i find is most probably the official site but then GroovePages reviews best free funnel builder GroovePages review new new lifetime deal and recent changes it's like a lot of these but what they actually uh can offer as well is when you are comparing it to something look at this one GroovePages versus click funnels this is the second one um the second most searched uh keyword inside google then if you go down a bit GroovePages versus cartra let's see if somebody compared GroovePages versus ah there we go builder all or wordpress maybe wix roof pages uh here we go vixx versus GroovePages versus wordpress vixx versus Groove this is captera um bazaar of marketing okay there is actually not a lot of content except this captera so there is one two three and this is one company so let's say you provide a lot of content on these videos um podcasts or just written words like anybody can do that but what i highly recommend you provide unbiased advice don't say GroovePages is the absolute winner because because then people will know that you are promoting this product it is not helpful in case you are on a side of one product and you are actually talking bad about the other product this is not something that i would like to see myself just think about yourself when you are looking for a product online and you see all these people that are promoting heavily with saying only this product is the best and you should buy this because then everything else is just bad this is not something that you are watching or or reading through because you know that they're on the side of one product and not the other so they will not appreciate your help this is not helping anybody um this is selling this is proper selling and i don't suggest you do that i suggest you to provide extremely valuable information just man if GroovePages has bugs and it has bugs and i i talk openly about that but i know that we are fixing them that's the the reason there's odd other page builders that are having bugs and they are not working on them at all so i would say yes GroovePages has bugs and it it can do this and this and sometimes it is very tricky and i get a bit um annoyed that i have to do again it again and then wix doesn't have these bugs but wix doesn't have this thing so just mention it non-biased don't promote one just provide real actual value to the person that actually is looking for can this product help me if i wanted to purchase wix but there is this other tool can i can i do that instead if everybody is saying yes yes GrooveFunnels GrooveFunnels GroovePages this is not helping anybody people will go there read about everything is positive with it and then they join and then they just will not use it feel bad because they joined it's just like it's it's not a good way to promote anything just be switzerland this is my recommendation but that's just GroovePages you can do it with GrooveSell GrooveSell can compares to other products and GrooveSell is also a couple of different products itself GrooveAffiliate can compare to other affiliate programs so find these platforms find and create these comparison videos create these comparison uh pages or blog posts or something like that you know what i didn't even say this previously but what i suggest you guys be on medium medium is a blog that everybody can do that everybody can join and actually just provide content on it and this gets very high results in google and other search engines because this is a very high high authority website when you provide real valuable content on this and actually people from medium so there is people that come to medium and then look for articles to read and things like this productivity and then you can click on productivity and then look into those articles and find articles and you can do that one as well so you will have people looking through your posts from customers that are using medium and you will also have customers that are coming from search engines medium in my opinion is very big and you should use it in case you are planning to do these kinds of things that are searchable in case you are doing recommendations as i said you can also do recommendations um where was my here we go so search or recommendations you can also do written or video recommendations so you can recommend the product but what i meant by recommendations is is in person or or more of a chat way or on facebook when you're communicating one-on-one recommendations are very powerful i didn't go into facebook promotion of your link because this is just everybody just doing it like taking their link sharing it with other groups and just like yeah but what i'm sharing here is not something a lot of people are doing so i highly suggest you you you go out there recommend these products because these are good products but don't just recommend them this is the best compare it to other products compare it to to click funnels compare it to this compare it to that but be in the middle be this line over here okay we know that we have good products they have good products as well but be the line in the middle and just compare it don't say this one is better that one is better let the customer reading this actually decide for themselves so this is the number two so the keywords that you can use for this name is brand name versus so you actually put in verses okay you can also use vs so as i did here for example click funnels versus vs i don't know not clickfunnels or GrooveFunnels versus clickfunnels um you can also use brand name or so GroovePages or wix or you can use what company does the best service for example you can create content on that one as well and then you this is the title of the article and then you provide the best website building services and then you you put a couple and then you talk about these um and you talk about these comparisons of one product versus the other and so on this is not the um the only ways of actually comparing products you can look to this article which i i linked and i shared the link over there you would probably need to look into this more than just watching this live stream it is very powerful and i highly suggest you go out there in case you need help writing articles there are people outside you can go on to fiverr or upwork or other marketplaces where people are actually selling their products um or sorry selling their services of writing articles so you can just tell them or write for example shoot a short video hey um so i went into GroovePages and here is what i found out i clicked here and then did this and then that and then i can do this and then this so and then i went into click funnels and then i share and i do this and then do this but i cannot do this and then i do this and i do this so basically you give this video to somebody to write this article for you they type it out so you don't have to spend the time on that and you can publish this on medium you can publish this on your blog if you have a blog on on wordpress or or any other uh platform out there and you actually start sharing it so don't just make the post share it out um share it out in groups share it out in to your people that are sharing up helpful information is much more valuable than sharing out your link so for example let me let me just show you what i what i find when i go into GroovePages versus okay um GroovePages versus clickfunnels awesome comparison 2020. i'm not sure if this is one of your sites in case this is your site very very good job so this is ranking the highest and then this is a davidra osar i'm not quite sure if i'm pronouncing it pronouncing it correctly but they go into what is clickfunnels what is GroovePages what is this what is that and then they have links to it so in case you are clicking on one of these links i mean for example you click on this link then you will go to to the person's affiliate link and this way when you share this review it is much more helpful than when you are just sharing out your link so look at this one it is not a long article it is not an in-depth guide as what i'm explaining you to do really dive into going to both platforms in case you're comparing and then you have the knowledge in case somebody asks you a question over here in the comments for example and then you will be the go-to person on hey hey can you tell tell me more about what's the difference between this and this product so this is powerful so you would be basically the go-to person when you are when you are doing this but i believe this is enough about this topic and then the product reviews and tests this is very similar to what i just created but it focuses mostly on the on one product so when you are actually providing a product review a lot of people do this on youtube and youtube is very powerful for that because you can see and it's a visual and it's in its you can actually see what is the different capabilities of GroovePages you can see what is uh what is GrooveSell doing so you can show as these are visual products you need to see them and how to function and when you write an article that's fine but then you still need to provide a lot of screenshots so in my opinion product reviews are best in video so you probably saw a lot of product reviews already in case you are a lady you probably seen these makeup videos where where uh girls go out there purchase a new uh makeup i don't even know what they have like eye shadows and things like this and then they are showing it and then they're doing like this and and it's like it's funny for me but you probably learn a lot about that and then they say like when you're wearing orange around your eyes then it it's much better and things like they give you tips they give you value they give you knowledge that you didn't have previously and this is what you can do with your link with your product as well so you create a product review you go into depth on certain parts it's not like what i'm doing i'm not doing product reviews but you can do like let's just dive in to see what GrooveVideo can do or GroovePages or GrooveSell can do and then you actually dive in and then you answer to your people's uh questions you've as you as i said uh you see what people are looking for in search engines and what uh recommendations people are people want and then on this one you create your videos you create your product reviews and you and create tests so let's just test out what we can do with this let's just test out what we can do with that can we actually create unlimited pages bam this is a great topic i should have done that um can we actually sell unlimited products so you create a couple of hours long video where you are adding in new products to GrooveSell and new products and then you actually test it out really test it out this will be interesting for people to see this will be this will be valuable for people to know i want to know myself because i probably will do a video on that one it will be a very boring and long video but it doesn't matter um but yeah there is a lot of things you can do the creative things be creative you have this link you pop it in the description of these videos or or articles or blog posts where you do these reviews test it out test out the software the best as you can don't just go out there and then into the group and it's like oh my god this is not working or is there a workaround just go out and test it out find the solution and actually record it record the process of it and share it out there will be people looking for it searching for your your solutions and this is where you can actually provide them the solution provide them your link and help them out with something that they have okay so these are the three ways that i usually suggest to start promoting i haven't done any of these but i will and i have a strategy finished and i will start promoting so please start before me because i will be unstoppable if you do any of this and this is what i will be doing i will not be doing anything else and i will be working on this very hard so in case you don't put in the work don't come to me yeah but David but i did it i don't it is who can provide more value who can provide more help and in my opinion using this one you can provide more value the the more so don't focus on the number of words don't focus on uh anything else the ranking high on the page provide the best value possible and you will win this this is the the rule of game of the game and there is no other rule provide the most value and you will win um and actually use the products and documents so in case you are talking about i don't know this was better for the comparison in case you're comparing the products just use the product don't just read a review and then compare it with GroovePages because you've you've probably seen GroovePages but you didn't see these other platforms just sign up just invest for a trial period 14 days trial most of them have this 14-day trial period just see what it can do compare it to our free free option just compare it just provide value the more value you provide the better chances you have to win find ways you can showcase it better this is basically to the to the products and then use as many visuals as possible is when i was talking about youtube videos and or blogs with screenshots the more visual you do it the the better people can uh imagine it the people can envision it and it will be much easier for them to understand the product itself so these are my things that i i will be doing and i will be diving into it and now you know what you need to do either create blogs create videos you create um podcasts on this one i will not start to start with podcast this is uh this is not something i am interested in but i will be cranking out content like crazy so in case you want to compete any if you want to win if you want to to have referral commissions uh coming into your account just use this knowledge step by step you can do all three you can just focus on one and really really really crank out the the value that you can give to people there will be no stopping you this is a business in itself so you can actually hire people to help you promote you can help you can actually hire people to help you spread the word or create the the videos or edit the videos that you create or actually type out the words um for the content this on itself is a business for a lot of people there is a lot of affiliates that are uh creating awesome content like team virdue and uh martin bottaker and it's like they're providing so much value that it is impossible to to keep up with them and you need to give more value to actually get better referrals than than those guys yes so now i believe i am finished with my rent and i think um i believe you have a lot of questions so in case you have any questions please ask them here i will just take a a couple of uh seconds and just run through the question i i have a lot of here of them here so um let me just go through quickly i hope you were putting in the queue before your questions because um it is hard to keep up with everything aha moment for me it's really true thanks David absolutely action leads to happy satisfaction that is that is great and i i believe it i really beli i really believe it you cannot just say yeah i took my link and i shared it in my facebook profile but no i didn't get anything so how can i do more guys please help there is actually the groovejv.com.com sorry this is a facebook group Groove jv is the name of it i just yeah here it is um jv is the the facebook group and in case you are interested in everything about this affiliate programs promoting your your affiliate links this is the group that you need to be in this is a very active community about helping how to pro promote your affiliate link better and i haven't taken these ideas from this group but i believe a lot of people that are in here know about this what i shared with you today in case they don't know now they know but you need to start doing what i what i shared because this is something that not a lot of people are doing so try to find your niche and then actually promote and help help them out or let the audience find you and then help them out that way you can do both i will be doing both so you you should find what works the best for you and then just really focus on it in case both you want both to work for you just focus on both or just get help and focus on both with somebody else it is not something you have to go alone uh at this is all in itself a very very powerful business model let's just see adding value earns trust and respect and ultimately can translate into sales this is very important and kyle wilson is very good because he has a very active youtube channel i saw him uh previously so good to have you here kyle um absolutely and i completely agree with this one um what i think about when i'm doing any kind of business online how like how can i over deliver like hugely over deliver in value and as a bonus get some money so for me the money is not the focus because i would get bored and just stressed out if i would be focusing on money as a priority when you focus on helping people you actually make friends you actually make connections and these are more valuable things in life when you actually um have money and no friends this is look at all these millionaires that for example they win the lottery now they have money when they start spending it and then become greedy and things like this and then at the end some of them not all of them but a big uh big percentage of them they just lose their money very quickly and they don't have friends so they had end up somewhere where they didn't imagine themselves so this is not happening when you're focusing on giving value because you will have very good friends you will get you will have a very good community that is supporting you that is actually paying you money for continuing to do what you are actually doing so this is the way to go and this is what GrooveFunnels and GrooveDigital is focusing on providing as much value as they can because we want to keep you guys as customers we want to keep you guys as friends and community and just we hope you show up on on these live events and then the crews and things like this so we can actually um like shake hands and then dance and then party and then like it it becomes a bond i'm not saying it is a as as russell bronson says uh we create a cult tour so this is a culture that we are we are doing is a it's a more than just a business this is what you need to create with your own business as well this is what you need to focus on not on the money money is a bonus that you get jim's saying um i thought the same thing David i asked for a refund and was talked talked out of it thank goodness i am this was the story of my life literally just got out of zuma call with someone to help out with Groove felt so good to know i helped them absolutely this is the best feeling when you actually know you help somebody and they thank you for it and they feel so appreciate appreciative and you feel good they feel good there is no better feeling uh excellent advice from tracy absolutely let's just see the hardest thing to do getting started once you get started don't keep trying new programs meaning stick to one and master it trying too much will only overwhelm you i agree with this one getting started is really hard but you know what makes it easy feedback so get started with something and try to look for any feedback if they say it's bad don't be like oh no no no i need to change immediately you need to actually tweak and pivot not change to a different platform or change to different business model and change to something like you purchased or if you didn't you should you got this tool on your hands find a way to work with it this is like a shovel you will not try and hit something with the shovel because this is not used for that you will learn how to use the tool you will learn how to use the shovel and at the end you will be able to actually work with it and shovel for hours and not just try to be like a madman and trying things out um it's a tool it's it's something that can help you it depends how you will use it getting started is hard but try to find one of these things it's it's three it's very simple to to to keep track of these um i suggest the niching down is the best way to start because immediately you can get feedback when you write uh an article or or do a youtube video you actually have uh have to wait for that feedback but when you actually go one-on-one and help out somebody in a private chat in a private facebook group or something like that you have immediate feedback and this is why it's the it's on the number one it's the easiest way to start once you get that feedback oh my god you really helped me thank you so much um how can you help me more can i can i get you money to actually do my site can i give you money like i actually am at getting asked was like 15 20 times a month or can i give you money for you to help me out because i provide value and they are so appreciative that they just want to give me that bonus money sometimes i take it sometimes i cannot because of time but this is what is what is going to happen when you focus on value and not on the money awesome i like that unbiased advice absolutely this is this is a big one people are asking if this active now if this operational it is you have the infographic you can check it yourself a GrooveVideo came out today that is operational um share the cons and the pro tell a story what you like uh the prod what you like the product help or or issues you had using the product very good leonard yes leonard you have all the answers there buddy i i really do hope you are doing something with all this knowledge that you have if if you're not that's just big waste of of all the the knowledge that you have really go out there start finding your audience start here you really need to get out there and help people you have all the all the answers as i see you know the theory just put it in practice it's like yeah um okay so there is some communication going in the facebook chat i don't actually know if this was for me um jim is saying i have masters in sos shiny object syndrome GrooveFunnels was the cure i i know jimmy i was helping jimmy out and and i was that way myself i'm big on purchasing these lifetime deals and still but now i have focused on actually purchasing lifetime deals because i want to compare them to GroovePages and GrooveFunnels and um find ideas from other platforms and put it as feature requests and this is why i now focus on purchasing lifetime deals and i will never stop because this is i think an obsession for me um but before i did that i was focusing on okay i will purchase this platform and i can do this with that and oh there's a new platform out there and i will purchase it and then i will i will 100 make money with it and then i was like eh it's fine i will purchase this platform and do on it this is wrong i until i actually sat down focused on one thing and then things started happening for me this is when people started offering me money to actually do things for them um until then and it is not only me i have 50 contacts that have said the exact same thing um stop focusing on everything just choose one just find the one that is most interesting for you and find the one that you you can actually do for a long time and this will be the one that you will find uh easy to focus on David i would like to work with it but i still don't have access please advise um yes i i cannot give you access it's the support only that can get you access if you if you did a ticket already you just need to wait a bit for them to actually go through the tickets we are receiving two three 500 tickets a day sometimes and it's not every day but but we have a great team they are going through these tickets like crazy but there is still a delay so please apollo i apologize for that one if you put a ticket in somebody will be back to you um dave what software are you using for this presentation is it zoom or something else uh

12 minutes and 50 seconds um oh let me just make it stop here um let me copy over this link and i will share it in youtube and also in the facebook group okay not this one but over here um yes so donna mentioned the answer to this question yesterday so i don't want to repeat myself i believe she gave a much nicer uh answer than i ever could so that is that um questions questions leonard saying don lemon let's help each other i'm not happy with my work um message me leonard let's see what what's bothering you um does GrooveFunnels work with any autoresponder no actually it doesn't uh when you are in GrooveFunnels you can go and right click uh sorry and just click on the in the right upper right hand side corner in this hamburger menu and then go to my integrations when you go and actually add an integration you can see all that are available so these are available and zapier zapier connects to everything so if we will not have immediately an integration with something through zapier you can do you can integrate so this is basically almost all the popular platforms in the world connect to zapier so GrooveFunnels connects through zapier to all the popular platforms in the world so the question the answer to your question is kind of yes we'll share the will you share this uh powerpoint notes with us it helped to remind us on a regular basis absolutely morbin uh i will do that immediately after this live stream is done um and this is very true from carrying Groove has enough shiny objects coming over the next few months to satisfy everyone's anyone's shiny object syndrome and that is absolutely true and i'm looking forward to that um yes so you purchase one product but this one product has multiple different products so whenever something new comes out this will be satisfying our needs the people that are uh that like these platforms and software i cannot see any other questions guys so i believe this is it thank you very much for your attention and i believe i gave you all the knowledge to to have the right tools the right uh mindset to go out there and to start promoting your link there is no better way to succeed than through value and making people happy and believe me i tried multiple ways i tried the spammy way i tried the scam way i'm not happy about that but i tried it and i i tried this value and helping way and it absolutely over is it went over anything i have ever done with the with the previous two so this is the way to go believe me and just try to help as many people you can using your links and as a bonus you can earn some money as well um if you do it correctly people will be throwing money at you and looking for the products that you have and then we'll be backing you for the products i have actually a couple of
