 it's 101 how about we give it to 102 hi everybody who's just coming into the zoom room I see the participants coming in we're at 18 or so we're going to get started at 2 after 1 o'clock central all right I'm showing 102 kami are you showing one or two all right okay good afternoon from sunny Chicago and then good morning or good evening to those who are elsewhere on the planet welcome and thank you for joining today's webinar where we're gonna spend a rapid 30 minutes exploring the b2b pivot to selling D to C that is direct-to-consumer and then specifically how b2b companies can launch a viable ecommerce channel in three months or less sounds aggressive we have about 25 minutes of content and then we're going to leave about five minutes at the end for Q&A but if you have questions along the way please go ahead and drop them into the Q&A frame within the zoom all right by way of introduction my name is Paul heckle I'm the vice president of digital experience at Kenan Carta and I'm joined by my esteemed colleague cami Chris the chief operating officer with Kenan Cardo loop kami can you share a little bit about Kenan Carter Luke Tara thanks for having me today fall loop is the commerce specialist inside Kenan Carta I personally have about 15 years ecommerce experience with a good global client base and really excited to share that experience with you today awesome thank you so I'd like to set the stage with one of my favorite quotes and one that I think directly speaks to a b2b organization that is considering going on this direct-to-consumer journey and that quote is from Amelia Earhart and she once said the most difficult thing is the decision to act the rest is merely tenacity the fears are paper tigers so let's dive into a conversation about taking action being tenacious and facing those paper tigers along the way so the b2b direct-to-consumer proposition is not certainly not new to us here in 2020 but in the middle of this crazy Cova 19 pandemic adidas c offering is more relevant now than ever and as consultants we're having conversations about this topic across all segments of b2b industries and that ranges from agriculture to consumer packaged goods to even industrial manufacturing to kami to get us started continue get us started by comparing and contrasting the traditional distribution model with a direct consumer of proposition yes of course yeah this slide here is really a current view of traditional distribution and direct to consumer process just to kind of orient ourselves exploring moving from B to B to D to C is more important now more than ever because of the challenges we're facing with today's climate as you mentioned Paul but you know it might not last forever but what will likely last is the consumers views on purchasing in the future and today is an opportunity for brands and manufacturers to capitalize and explore on moving direct to consumer at pace a b2b business is likely to explore the benefits of moving direct to consumer already but I'd like to spend a little bit of time summarizing some of those benefits as well please so what I think so moving direct to consumer some of the benefits being you know control and brand clarity with going D to C it allows you to really be able to have full control over the brand experience product packaging how your product is really doing the market speed the market as well you can make product changes much quicker when your support when you're supporting and in control of your distribution and then one of the most important things here is really the data and business intelligence that you're going to extrapolate from that D to C process you'll be able to interface more clearly with the consumer you'll be able to get that knowledge not only from the customer but from your data from your online channels and be able to feed that back into your product in real time but but with that you know you you might have faced if you've explored these benefits before you might have faced challenges some of those being fear over cannibalizing current sales channels lack of budget you know your existing channels are your cash cows and probably less risky than going direct consumer and then the the other internal change management battle and I'm sure most of you experienced before this is a big undertaking not to be taken lightly ok cool so I mean at the most basic level we're talking about removing a set of intermediaries from the overall value chain which clearly presents a set of new opportunities and new efficiencies but also alongside a clear set of risks so as a frame of reference can you share any examples or success stories of businesses that have that have done this well today sure that we very handily have two examples here to go through perfect gillette is an example of a company that was reactive to what was going on in the market way back in 2010 Gillette enjoyed very little competition had about 70 percent market share and by 2016-17 you had these awesome kind of new direct to consumer brands including Dollar Shave Club and Harry's and it was eroding Gillette's market share down to about 50 percent their response was to launch Gillette on demand which is a platform that allows you to buy razors and blades online they've done a good job of having a loyalty and rewards based and end a subscription offering so they've done good a good job combating that market share erosion but it's also worth noting here that there's a considerable amount of consolidation with the behemoth buying our direct to consumer friends you know Unilever has purchased Dollar Shave Club and as well it has attempted earlier in the year to buy Harry's but that was blocked by the FTC I have another example here it's a little bit different so you know in the case of Gillette being reactive we've got Trek bikes good friend of ours they were actually proactive in their DBC proposition and one of the first bike manufacturers to go online they actually decided upon launch that their dealer network was very important to them and additionally you know putting a bike together if you're buying that online can be daunting so they made the decision to have a bike shipped directly to their local dealer of the customer's choice and the benefit of that was kind of twofold the dealer would get the ongoing consumer relationship with services based revenue and the consumer could have their bike put together with confidence but if you go to their site today they've actually pivoted very quickly with a shift from the ship to store experience they remained agile in their checkout process and we're ready I'm sure they weren't planning for kovat but they were able to drip out the ship to store option and and allow the consumer in response to those stores not being open to ship directly to their home awesome so when you know when we take a closer look at Trek specifically in their approach is a couple of things that stand out to me and we've grabbed a couple of screenshots from their current comm first they're explicitly attempting to improve the consumer confidence around this new transaction model and they're doing so by making statements like it's easier than you think and providing interactive content that walks customers through a process that may be foreign to them on the product detail page they're offering which is the screenshot on the right there they're often offering optionality in the different calls to action the primary one being shipping the bicycle directly to the customer for free and the secondary one being to find a retailer should the customer prefer that option so this way they're fully supporting this new hybrid business model d2c and the traditional model now I happen to be a truck to her and I remember going through their doctor home experience back in know seven or oh eight I recall it being well organized and had you know solid product detail pages but at the end of the experience I was a little confused when I couldn't complete my purchase online I had to pick up the phone and call a few different local bike shops in Chicago for for inventory so I'm really glad to see that the director consumer option is available today yeah that's a really good point Paul and um you're not alone you know Preet ovid there was about 87 percent of consumers that would prefer the option to buy direct from the manufacturer brand that's given that and I'm assuming you know post coated that that numbers likely to have increased and as a consumer I want to be able to research and purchase in a single flow that's you know that's logical it's what they want yep 100% so we've talked about getting the idea of getting to market in ninety days or less which I said might have sound aggressive aggressive at the top of the hour so how do we actually get started on this on this journey a summary of the approach that we're going to dive into in getting live to 90 days is first assess your readiness then get real product to market which we're calling build early and then finally measure learn and iterate what you do by releasing often so first let's talk about the readiness assessment and at the highest level the assessment should cover three main areas the first is finance and operations the second is people and culture and the third is product market positioning and these are really big meaty questions and these are illustrative questions here on the slide can I mean do you think many organizations would even be in a position to confidently answer yes to to any or all of these ah yeah that's that's interesting Paul I think actually most businesses would likely be saying no to at least one if not all these questions but the key I think it and the opportunist is that you should take those knows in the house so as an organization you need to challenge yourself on how you can move at pace to get a product to market and further on we're going to talk about that together and get into a level of detail with examples and readiness assessments so I as an example I want to talk through a fictitious company let's call it snack IO and that that company sells snacks today through grocery and convenience stores sales are soft promotions aren't working they are having assess their direct-to-consumer options in the past but selling off one selling one off bags and chips and snacks online doesn't really make sense the shipping costs make it you know not an option so they kind of abandon it but with the onset of coded they've actually gone okay let's look at and assess our readiness and see if we can move and make move to market quickly so if you take the product square the snack company did a review their products and found that across three categories they had top-selling products chips nuts and pretzels they also looked at their emergent across those product lines to see what the minimum cart value needed to be to make shifting caustics and potentially operation free shipping and longer-term they actually looked at partnering with other chip companies to create a unique product offering of their own snack market marketplace they could have other companies snack items potentially on their site or on another site moving on to the marketing snack snack company knew that they had a customer base that was enthusiastic about their brand so they created a campaign for consumers to move through social platforms like Facebook Instagram to create and generate content with contents or unlike share win campaigns they performed research and found you know most people would be repeat customers so they pivoted to selling those top items and one off to a monthly subscription box then they looks how they could launch or focus to a distinct customer group and when they actually first started they were best known in the Midwest and their sales are still highest there so it made sense to focus and target on the smaller demographic for pilot moving on to technology they knew they needed to get going at pace and be able to utilize learnings in the long term so they chose to go API first microservice which they could expand upon in the future inventory they had a warehouse in Chicago it took the opportunity to ring-fence that inventory for the pilot within their existing warehouse with a manual process in the first instance customer service was really important and it is an important piece in all of this is you know they have a brand responsive brand promise and responsiveness to that customer was key so they looked at their existing b2b set up and they chose to dedicate a number of representatives from there to the consumer proposition they trained that team to solely focus on b2c and they also made sure that team had a mechanism to understand and capture the feedback that they were getting on the product when they took calls or emails into that call center they I mean yes snacky Oh a super helpful example I do just want to reiterate to the audience that a proper diligent readiness assessment would go much deeper than this and that the snacky Oh example is illustrative only but you will notice that the the sample questions you know beneath each domain are not binary you know can we should we there there how and where and what risks so again it's not the it's not the if we should it's the how we should so after the readiness assessment we move on to building early and we're thinking about any commerce experience there's a million places to start that's probably an exaggeration but many many places to start so kami how do you think about building early what does that look like uh yeah when we kick off discovery or a client engagement that's starting a digital commerce solution the requirements you see here you know from the left it's it's promotions exclusive offers price lists on the right you see loans and warehouses this is a complex vision of what a commerce solution could look like and on day one we hear from our clients you know this is what we want we also here I want to be like Amazon Apple Nike select your favorite brand they'll go check check this out check how they do it we want that well guess what they're not those guys you it takes years if not decades of experience to get to the point to have a feature rich rich Commerce data set that you can utilize proficiently so we really want to push you know starting at the basics which you can quickly iterate upon capitalizing on the opportunity now and go lean so we urge companies to start out with a basic best best practice commerce approach get us out of the gate quickly there's a number of technologies that will allow us to iterate and move that way and we're going to talk more about those technologies and a few slide yeah this is one of the biggest challenges I've seen our clients struggle with not just in the to be or the e-commerce domain really across the entire digital product space and they struggle with what I would call disciplined product management having the confidence and having the courage to go to market with a simple yet viable solution you're putting yourself out there in a brand new way it's a brand new revenue stream there's there's opportunities there's missed opportunities and so it does require a lot of confidence to put something out there that's minimally functionable up functional but it's certainly viable so you talked about you know you showed us the end state you showed us the simple start what would a plan look like that evolves us from that simple start initial pilot moving towards a more enterprise grade solution yeah so as we mentioned um a typical enterprise ecommerce project can take you know a minimum of nine months two years depending on the organization and the requirements but we're able to move faster if we decoupled the process from pilot to future so starting over on the left in the pilot we recommend starting with a base commerce product and there's a few in the market depending on your business and your requirements that we like best of that based product will allow us to get to market quickly and what do I mean there like that commerce platform should at a minimum manage product data inventory ordering systems including checkout from a design perspective we're going to begin with a templated approach to the design and content to get to market quickly and then most important it's very important here that we identify our KPIs and our analytics strategy so we have a clear path to being able to consume information back from not only the site but from our operations as well after a launch of pilot we're gonna take the opportunity to look at that data that we talked about and we're going to further operationalize any feedback that we have received into that near-term we're going to look at standing inventory capabilities we're going to add product details additional product details so more documentation additional imagery maybe some ratings and reviews personalization could come into play and as we move into the future and as we're going through from pilot to near to future we're gonna be gathering that feedback from the organization and we're gonna be able to be building our enterprise grade solution at the same time awesome yeah a couple thing the saqqaq I mean you mentioned analytics and KPIs and I can't stress enough the the importance of doing that the right way some organizations think you know the they've installed they've installed Google tagging on their site sorry I'm just having a cat in bade me they've installed they've been told Google Analytics on their site and they're done but the key is closing the feedback loop and making sure that somebody in the organization is capable of looking at that data understanding and analyzing it and closing the feedback loop with with recommendations on the road map or the backlog can't stress that enough I've seen failures time and time again and so another comment here is by no means is this a hard and fast playbook you as an organization will have to choose the feature sets that you want to go live with minimally and in what sequence so don't take this as you know the Bible of how to get started there's optionality and all this the most important thing is that you get something to market that's functional that's performant and reliable enough for customers to want to come back - all right so first assess readiness then build early and finally release often so on paper that sounds super super simple Kimmy what pitfalls are our organizations encountering when they try to go through this journey or what are they commonly tripping up on yeah I would say there's um three common challenges we see typically businesses want to boil the ocean and get everything 100% correct if we can be focused in disciplines at just getting the product to market and iterating that's really important the second one is replicating legacy ways of working you know this is an opportunity to embrace change management in the organization and not embracing that change and just rebuilding what you already have is you know not it doesn't make sense and the third one is really assessing ROI on the features we're trying to bring to market we should be challenging the organization on every ask on you know how many more things do I sell if we bring this thing into our into our product okay awesome thank you so much I always like to close out these types of conversations with either like a crystal ball or one final takeaway so if you had one recommendation or parting thought parting words of wisdom for the audience what would what would you leave them with yeah don't be afraid to move at pace or even get some of it wrong we understand how to get the basics right we understand how to do Commerce best practice and then you can build around that foundation they'll deliver early continuously improve and take advantage of the lessons learned from performance and market excellent awesome advice and that is a wrap for today's webinar content I hope you all found this informative and have something to take back to your respective organizations now we are right on time it is a minor miracle so we did reserve time for a few questions from the audience I'm going to pull up the panel and see what we have in the queue feel free to add anything even at the last minute we're happy to take those on the the first one is if I'm not yet interested in going direct to consumer and I only want to stand up a digital sales channel from my existing partners and supply-chain does the same approach apply so don't want to go D to C but you know embarking on a new digital sales channel for the existing business model cami does the same approach apply yeah absolutely and you know there are deeper complexities with the business to business model but the same approach and strategy absolutely applies and we have have done that before 90 days is slightly aggressive but if we can be disciplined in our approach and requirements and get a product to market and test and iterate them absolutely okay cool the next one is if I'm interested in only the readiness assessment portion of this approach is this something that can Encarta would offer yep we do readiness assessments a lot we're happy to take that offline and work with you as a as a workshop with a tangible output of steps you need to take as a business to make sure you're ready to embark on your 90-day journey okay cool and we'll have contact info on our last slide here in case you want to follow up whoever asked that question wants to follow up and discuss further there's one more in the queue and that is do you have any advice on whether I should integrate a new commerce experience with my existing web property or create something separately give a view on that cami yeah I think that the end State you should be looking at how to integrate to your existing properties but if we're looking to go at pace and get a pilot to market we should be couple the pilot with any existing legacy system on launch yeah I would agree I think I think that's good advice think in the long term but there's you're gonna create a ton of drag if you mire yourself in all the dependencies and the legacy infrastructure that's already standing there okay that is it for the questions in the Q&A panel so that brings us to a close for today thank you all so much for attending and until next time please stay safe and stay healthy take care thanks Bob
