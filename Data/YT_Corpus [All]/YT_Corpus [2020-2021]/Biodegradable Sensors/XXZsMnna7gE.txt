 Millions of birds die each year by flying into windows. Sometimes they see straight through them or become confused by reflections of glass. Several years ago, a nature enthusiast came up with a way to reduce these fatal collisions. He read that orb-weaver spiders decorate their webs with threads called stabilimenta, which reflect ultraviolet light - something we can't see but birds can. It's thought this clever trick helps prevent birds striking the webs and destroying them. On learning this, he teamed up with a glass manufacturer to develop a window coated in UV reflecting markers. Though almost invisible to us, they hoped the markers would make the glass more visible to birds. They tested the prototype by releasing birds in a tunnel with glass panes at the end, one made of standard glass and the other made of the UV glass. Don't worry - a net was suspended to protect the birds from actually striking the panes. The birds then tried to fly out through one of the perceived openings. More than 1,000 test flights found birds chose the path towards the standard plane, significantly more than the new test glass. The spider inspired windows have since been fitted in several universities, shops and houses across Europe and the US.
