 [Music] you [Music] you hello friends welcome to week number 10 where we are going to talk about probably the most common parameter that you can think about in engineering application that is the temperature and we are going to discuss about different methods of measuring the temperature in fact why only engineering if we just forget engineering or forget science if you just think about our normal day-to-day life or just think about the normal life of any common individual who doesn't have any relation with any kind of technical field still he knows about the concept of temperature or at least he definitely makes use of the concept of temperature in some of his daily activities like you definitely can remember that when you are a kid the your parents may be your father or mother with a very old look is putting up a small plastic below your armpit or below the tongue just to check your body temperature just to ensure whether you have fever or not or say the people who cook in our houses the entire idea of cooking is just to heat the food stop to a particular temperature and maintain that temperature over a particular period of time to ensure that your food is properly cooked things like about a pressure cooker there the entire idea of pressure cooker is to increase the pressure inside the container so that we can maintain a higher saturation temperature inside that as the pressure increases saturation temperature of water also increases like under common atmospheric condition the saturation temperature of water is about 100 degree Celsius whereas when you when you can make the pressure double the temperature saturation temperature is approximately 120 degree Celsius so the entire idea of pressure cooker is to increase the pressure inside so that we can maintain higher temperature and therefore we can boil the foods in a better way so this way we can always make use of temperature or the concept of temperature in every day to day activities of ours and that's why this is probably the most sought after parameter most discussed or most employed parameter in any kind of human active it is or okay I should say this is probably the second most sought-after parameter because time has to be the most sought-after parameter that we have to make use of everyone needs to know about the concept of time for anything he or she wants to do but then comes the temperature and that's why probably intentionally have kept this model towards the later part of this course when you have already finished discussion about topics like pressure or flow or displacement etc mostly because you may already be knowing a few of the ways of measuring temperature but I'm sure I can introduce also several other ways of temperature measurement which will definitely be new and you will definitely find that interesting now the before we start I would like to go for some initial discussion like we have been doing in all the previous modules like in the topic of flow measurement we started with some basic concepts of fluid mechanics develop the analyst equation because that is something that we made use of in the subsequent or discussions in case of force measurement we started with the discussion on the Newton's second law of motion or Newton's laws of motion similarly we have to define the topic pressure before we started pressure measurement so we shall be following the same approach here instead of directly jumping to any kind of instrument and that's why the first question that I would like to ask you is what is temperature you definitely know what the temperature is but can you define it because the most commonly we define temperature is something like this is this feels hotter than the other one and that's why it definitely is at a temperature higher than the other one like suppose if I provide you two sticks one this one another this one and if I ask you which one is at a higher temperature probably we will try to just sense which one is feeling one more than the other if this one is feeling one more than you may be saying that this is at a higher temperature than the other but that is a purely relative way of defining temperature and not a quantity one at all because it may well happen that both may be at the same temperature but one just feels warmer or cooler than the other like you know very common example in a cold winter night if you keep one metal stick and one wooden stick outside throughout the night and then in the morning if you touch them then the metal one definitely feels much cooler compared to other one despite both being at the same temperature both are exposed to the same environment for same duration of time and therefore they must be at the same temperature however the metal has an ability to transfer heat to your body much quicker or I should say in this case absorb heat from your body much quicker compared to the wooden one and that's why that feels much cooler compared to the other despite the being at the same temperature therefore this relative way of defining temperature is not the perfect one we must find a proper technical definition of temperature or at least some kind of scientific base based upon which we can define temperature and that is not possible from any other laws of physics rather we can define it only when we make use of the concept of the zeroth law of thermodynamics I am sure you know about the zeroth law but still I am repeating this one here to clarify the concept of temperature so from the concept of zeroth law we know that suppose I am taking three systems here like shown system a B and C so if our two systems will say a and C are in thermal equilibrium with each other and similarly B and C are also separately in thermal equilibrium with each other then a and B also has to be in thermal equilibrium into each other now what do you mean by thermal equilibrium thermal equilibrium means there is no heat transfer that is taking place between the two systems or if I take just a single system like this so this is your system and outside the system you have the surrounding because you know from thermodynamic point of view anything outside the boundary of a system is surrounding and now if the system and surrounding are at the different temperature let us say the system temperature is tsys the surrounding temperature is T's R now if the system temperature and the surrounding temperature they are not equal then there will be some kind of energy exchange between them and that energy exchange we call the heat transfer because heat is defined as the form of energy which can cross the boundary of a system only because of a temperature difference between system and surrounding now when these two those two temperatures are equal or I should say the system is in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding then there will be no heat transfer at all so the concept of thermal equilibrium is related to whether there is any heat transfer taking place or not there can be some other kind of energy drain energy interaction between system and surrounding or even in terms of this example there may be let us say the system C is the surrounding a system a is the system then if there can be some other kind of energy interaction like work interaction or mass interaction but the there if they are at thermal equilibrium then there will be no heat interaction between them similarly when B and C are in thermal equilibrium then there will be no heat interaction between them now zeroth law says that if a and C are in thermal equilibrium and B and C are also in thermal equilibrium then a and C must be also in thermal equilibrium that is instead of taking a and B separately in contact with C if we take a and B in contact with each other then there will be no heat transfer between them because they are at perfect thermal equilibrium and when that is possible I have already mentioned that is possible only when this system and surrounding or in this case system E and we are at the same temperature so then how we can define temperature temperature is a property which defines whether these two systems are in thermal equilibrium in the or not or in a way you can say that one system a and B are in thermal equilibrium then the property which is equal between a and B is temperature so if the temperature of system a is T a and that of C is T C then they will be in thermal equilibrium only when T a is equal to TC so that there is no heat transfer similarly if the temperature of B is T B then B and C can be in thermal equilibrium only when TB is equal to TC now when yes both T and T B are equal to TC so T and T must be equal to each other that is temperature so temperature is the property which must be equal between two systems or maybe between a system and its surrounding in order to have a thermal equilibrium between them so that there is no heat transfer at all so this is the zeroth law of thermodynamics which defines the concept of temperature now instead of considering three different systems a B and C if we replace this C with it with a device which is separately in thermal equilibrium both with a and B then that provides us a way of measuring the temperature and that is the entire idea of thermometric which is where we have object a or system a and system B and the C is a thermometer which is actually temperature measuring device now here I would like to clarify one term the term thermometer does not refer to only that glass tube that you kept on using from or you kept on seeing from your childhood thermometer refers to any device which can measure temperature so that glass tube that is that mercury filled capillary tube that is only one of the examples of a thermometer which have a specific name and we shall be talking about that later on today but thermometers the term thermometer refers to any temperature measuring instrument now let us replace the system C with the thermometer then if a and C are in thermal equilibrium and separately B and C are also in thermal equilibrium then a and B must be added separate must be at the same temperature now if we know the temperature of this object a ta but you don't know the temperature of T V then what we are going to do if that if we take the thermometer C in contact with temperature a and the reading that we are getting that we are defining as this ta now if we take this in contact with its object B or system B and if we get the same reading then the temperature of this one must be equal to TM so that is the idea where this e acts as the standard or you can say acts as the reference where B is the subject of measurement and thermometer is the measuring tool so the entire idea of the thermometry starts with this zeroth law of thermodynamics now what is the unit of temperature there are several scales of temperature but the SI unit of temperature you know is Kelvin Kelvin is defined as actually this graphics has a little bit of error this should not be small kid has to be capital K because that unit of temperature is called Calvino a seven-way temperature is called Kelvin to honor the great scientist Lord Kelvin and that so this K has to be capital one now the unit for temperature is Kelvin which is defined as the distance between the absolute zero and the triple point of water by 26 273.16 number of equal parts then the division or each subdivision is called one Kelvin that is triple point of water which is an universal constant is given the value of 273 point 1 6 Kelvin and absolute zero is given a value of zero Kelvin and correspondingly whatever you are getting that is 273 point one six Kelvin we shall but this is not the only scale there are several other scales also like the very common one Celsius and Fahrenheit scales the term Celsius scale is based upon the name of its inventor the French technician or this Celsius whereas the Fahrenheit scale is in the name of the German inventor Gabriel Fahrenheit who were the persons to propose this more or less at the same time or around the same decade in early 19th century now both these two temperature scales has something in common in both cases we need to specify two standard reference point that's why they are often called two point temperature scale we need to specify the reference value or some value at two points and the common choice for these two points are one is called the ice point ice point refers to the point at which or the temperature at which under atmospheric nation water starts to condense or in the reverse we can say the steam starts to melt so in Celsius scale ice point or the melting point of water is given a value of zero hores in Fahrenheit scale let's given a value of 32 similarly the second point is called the steam point steam point refers to the temperature at which normal water or or I should say water under atmospheric condition starts to boil or the liquid to vapor phase conversion for water under atmospheric condition starts that temperature is called steam point now in Celsius scale we call the steam point as 100 and in 400 scale we call that 2 1 2 so in Celsius scale the distance between the ice point and steam point is 100 units whereas in Fahrenheit scale the distance is 180 units so what we do in either scale we specify the ice point and the steam point with the corresponding values and then the distance between this two that is 100 unit in case of Celsius scale and 118 is Fahrenheit scale they are given equal divisions we hardly go for calibration at some intermediate temperatures like we hardly take any reading at 20 degree Celsius 40 degree Celsius or maybe 100 degree Fahrenheit we rather just make equal divisions which may always not be true depending upon what kind of scale you are using now one thing you have to remember here the choice of these values are completely based upon us that is the value of hundred specified to the normal boiling point of water or saturation temperature of water and 100 degree Celsius that under atmospheric condition that is our choice we could have easily called that thousand there is nothing to stop us or you can easily define a new temperature scale and give it your name and where you are going to specify the you may specify the ice point to be given a value of 100 and the steam point to be given a value of zero and you are coming in the opposite direction means as the temperature increases the value will decrease in this there is no harm in that this will again be a perfectly therm perfectly correct thermodynamic temperature scale as long as you can make equal division between the two but this all these are two point temperature scale there is also something called the single point temperature scale but I shall be coming back to that later on when the idea of two point temperature scale I repeat is to specify two reference point and the common choice for reference points are the ice point and steam point and in every temperature two point temperature scale these two are given some values and all the intermediate values or all the interim entire intermediate range is divided into equal subdivisions the Celsius scale earlier used to be called the centigrade scale because we are using the value 100 some resembles to that but from 1948 onwards the term centigrade has been dropped and we use only the term Celsius Fahrenheit scale probably you have what is the one we were introduced to entry or introduced for the first time because the medical thermometers which we use commonly for measuring the body temperature are generally given in Fahrenheit scale where the standard ball human body temperature is around ninety eight point four degree Fahrenheit whereas the range is commonly a specified something like 90 to 210 degree for a night or maybe 95 210 degree Fahrenheit generally below 94 95 degree Fahrenheit and above 106 degrees Fahrenheit it may become fertile for human body in Celsius scale as it is shown this degree Celsius is a unit but in case of finite scale it is degree Fahrenheit now how we can develop a relation between them something a very school level stuff as we are taking equal division between them so you can go for a linear interpolation so in case of Celsius scale if any temperature is given as C then C minus the ice point temperature that is 0 divided by steam point temperature 100 minus ice point temperature that will be equal to if the corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit scale - corresponding steam point value or sorry ice point value which is 32 divided by steam point value - 1 2 - ice point value or in the denominator you can also visualize this on 2 of divisions so it becomes c by 100 because there are hundred divisions between the ice point and steam point in Celsius scale is equal to F minus 32 by 180 as there are 180 divisions in case of Fahrenheit scale or if we simplify it becomes C by 5 is equal to F minus 32 by 9 a very well-known relation which you must have used earlier or any value in Fahrenheit scale therefore Celsius being much more common nowadays so if we want to measure any Fahrenheit value then if will be equal to 1.8 times c plus 32 or if our interested in the C value then C will be is equal to 5 by 9 into F - 32 so this way we can convert between either scales but Celsius and finite scales are not the only one there are also absolute temperature scale switcher which can be visualized as extension of these scales only however practically speaking there different temperature scales if we extend this one to include two more skills where we have the Kelvin which can be visualized as an absolute temperature scale absolute temperature extension of Celsius whereas we can have R an kind which is the absolute extension of the for tonight so in case of Celsius scale the as I have mentioned the ice point is 0 and that is 32 in case of Fahrenheit scale that is given as the value of 273 our to be more precise 273 point one five in case of Kelvin and 492 or to be more species it is 491 point six seven in case of rain kind scale and then corresponding the remaining extension we can do in both higher side and lower side so if we want to derive a relation between Kelvin and Celsius scale any reading in Celsius scale will be the corresponding value in Kelvin scale minus 273 point one five or the value in Kelvin scale will be equal to see plus 273 point 1 5 similarly any value in Fahrenheit scale will be equal to our corresponding in value in Rankin scale minus four fifty nine point six seven or the value in Rankin scale will be four value in Fahrenheit scale plus four fifty nine point six seven actually is Kelvin and Rankine scales are called single point temperature scale why they are called that that we shall be discussing shortly but whenever you are talking about in single point temperature scale generally the degree symbol is dropped like two point temperature scales we use the units as degree Celsius and degree Fahrenheit however in case of single point temperature scales or absolute temperature scale we use only K to denote designate Kelvin and only R to designate ran kind so these are the most common temperature scales that we can think of however as I have mentioned you can easily define any two point temperature scale by choosing your own values of ice point and steam point your own values at ice point and steam point and then taking equal number of divisions in between two then subsequently you can extend in either direction that is below the ice point or above the steam point just following the same pattern of the subdivisions now we started with the zeroth law of thermodynamics let us extend a bit more in terms of thermodynamics and let us talk about the first law of thermodynamics now first law of thermodynamics tells that the change in internal energy of any system during a particular process depends on the net introduction will gain system and surrounding if Q is the amount of net heat interaction and W is the amount of network interaction is taking place then corresponding change in internal energy will be will be the summation of these two with the direction being taken into account or in differentially we generally write in differential way we generally write de that is change in energy of the system during an infinitely small process will be equal to Del Q minus del W where del Q is the amount of heat transfer to the system during this interval process and del W is amount of work done by the system that is work transfer from system to our surrounding during the same process and this is during a particular process if you want to analyze a system then we have to do this for an entire system and sum all of them up like think about a particular cycle let us plot that on any property diagram let us say we take a PV diagram so we pick up any standard process let us say our process initially starts with a compression process starting from point one and going to point two which is at a much higher pressure and low volume then we have a constant pressure that is isobaric expansion process journey is pressuring is constant where volume increases to three and then we have another process during which the system's comes back from three to one so now if we want to apply the first law of thermodynamics on this particular process then integrating this particular relation over each of the processes we can write during process one to two we can write e 2 minus e 1 is equal to Q 1 2 minus W 1 2 head Q 1 to the first the amount of heat interaction that is the amount of heat transferred to the system during this process 1 to 2 and W 1 2 the first amount of work done by the system during this process if the direction of heat transfer work transfer are opposite to the one that we are considering then you have to put a minus sign during process two to three you have III minus e 2 is equal to Q 2 3 minus W 2 3 and then during 3 to 1 you have a 1 minus e 3 is equal to Q 3 1 minus W 3 1 now if we add all of them up then you have zero on this side is equal to summation of all these Q's minus summation of w's or you know we generally conventionally write them as cyclic integral del Q is equal to cyclic integral of del W that is net heat transfer to the system over a cycle is equal to net work done by the system over the same cycle as E in that is energy is a property here mind you this e or energy actually is talks about the total energy content of the system we generally has three counterparts two macroscopic part and one microscopic part macroscopic part in the form of change in kinetic energy plus change in potential energy these are the two ways system energy can change from a crucible point of view plus we have the internal energy which is a summation of all possible microscopic forms of energy practical cases these two may be extremely small compared to this one in that case you can replace this de with D u but mind you this is possible only when the changes in kinetic and potential energies are negligibly small compared to the change in internal energy or to be more specific you are talking about a stationary system stationary means there is no change in kinetic and potential energies now in this first law of thermodynamics never talks anything about the temperature it just talks about the heat and work interaction but that gives us one useful relation that we are going to make use of very shortly that is the concept of a heat engine a heat engine talks about a system working over a cycle during one part of the cycle it is drawing Q H amount of heat from a high temperature reserver th during another part it is rejecting QC amount of it to a low temperature reservoir kept at TC here T H is greater than TC and during another part it is producing this work output W such a configuration is called a heat engine when it is taking heat from high temperature reservoir converting a part of that to work output and rejecting the rest to a low temperature reservoir now if we apply the form of the first law of thermodynamics on this cycle then you have just seen that cyclic integral of del Q is equal to cyclic integral of del W now there are two heat interactions shown here so accordingly we can write Q H minus Q C because Q H is added to the system that is positive you see is going away from the system so that is negative as per our sign convention is equal to Del W there is only working one work interaction is shown which is being done by the system so it is positive so that is equal to W now if we want to define an efficiency of this heat engine efficiency is defined as work output divided by amount of heat added to get this work done so using the previous relation from first law it is Q H minus QC upon Q H that is 1 minus QC upon Q H so the efficiency of heat engine can be derived just from the knowledge of these two temperatures without bothering about that I'm sorry just from the knowledge of these two heat interaction qh and QC without bothering about the values of this temperature th and TC this one we can make use of in conjunction with the second law of thermodynamics now second law of thermodynamics and there are several statements possible from this but there are two possible two very popular statement and out of which we are going to take the one that is generally called the more fundamental which is the Clausius statement according to the Clausius statement it is impossible to transfer heat from a high-temperature reserver to a low temperature or sorry as per the Clausius statement it is impossible for a cyclic device to transfer heat from a low temperature reservoir to a high temperature reservoir without any other effect that is without leaving any other mark on the surrounding it is impossible to transfer heat from a low temperature body to a high temperature body over a cycle during a particular process it definitely is possible but when we talk about a cycle it is not possible like shown in this particular case you have two bodies at temperature t1 or maybe we take temperature th just to be consistent in the previous slide every temperature t2 say let us say temperature TC so some amount of heat transfer is taking place and it is always said that if th or rather TC is less th-then the direction of heat transfer will always be from one to two two to the one heat transfer is not possible unless we add some additional effects in the form of a heat pump or refrigerator so the second law of thermodynamics gives you the direction of heat transfer the first law of thermodynamics define sorry the zeroth law of thermodynamics defines the concept of temperature second law of thermodynamics is saying that there will be heat interaction between system and surroundings as long as they're in a different temperature but it doesn't say anything about the direction of temperature which is given by the second law of thermodynamics which says that the heat transfer will always be from the high temperature to the low temperature just like shown in this particular case we don't need to talk about the concept of entropy here but something is that we can add here that in the form of the corollaries of the second law there are several Corolla is possible from the second law but we are interested in only two of them which are more popularly known as the car nose principle there are two Carnot principle the in both the cases we are concerned about one high temperature reservoir another low temperature reservoir so here the high temperature is about is given a temperature th the low temperature one is given a temperature TL and for the moment just forget about this third heat engine here we are involved with only two heat engine one is engine number one which is an irreversible engine and other is any number two which is a reversibility both are working between the same temperature reservoirs then the Carnot principle says that the efficiency of the reversible one will always be higher than the irreversible one or to put in more formal term the efficiency of a reversible heat engine will always be greater than the efficiency of an irreversibility mean while working between the same two temperature reservoir so same two thermal reservoirs so there is a first Carnot principle but here we are concerned about the second counter principle let us remove this one from our system we have now 2 & 3 both are reversible heat engines and both are working within the same two reservoirs then the second Kondo principles is that both of them will be having the same efficiency that is in more formal term the efficiency of any Carnot engine working between two given thermal reservoirs any reversible heat engine or Carnot engine working between two given thermal reservoirs will always be the same now what does that suggest here we are saying that once we are given with these two temperatures th and TL the temperatures of the two reservoirs then whatever may be the nature of your heat engine corresponding efficiency of any reversible heat engine will always be some constant value you cannot change by changing the nature of the reversible cycle it will always be the same as long as the temperatures th and TC are given what does that suggest then this efficiency has to be a function of only these two temperatures and nothing else so this efficiency is definitely a function of th and TL or as per our the notation of an efficiency we know it can be written as 1 minus Q L upon Q H work evil is amount of heat rejected to the reservoir temperature TL + Q H is the amount of heat added that is this is Q H and this is Q L so this has to be a function of T H n TL that means Q L upon Q H has to be some function of this two temperatures th and TL so that is something that we have to make use of to define something called the thermodynamic temperature scale or that single point temperature skin which you roughly mentioned in the previous slides to derive the current expression for this function a like here we know that the efficiency or corresponding ratio of heat interaction is a function of only the two temperatures now we have to identify the nature of this function f so here we consider this particular situation here we have three reserves one at temperature T 1 at T 2 and T 3 he this t1 is greater than t2 greater than T three so there are three engines also a B and C a is working between t1 and t2 taking q1 amount of heat rejecting q2 amount of heat to t2 and for the producing waa amount of work now B is working between t2 and t3 taking the same q2 amount of heat which was reacted by engine a and finally giving q3 amount of heat to raise our t3 and giving WB amount of work and look at C it is working directly between t1 and t3 taking q1 amount of heat and rejecting q3 amount of heat to produce work WC now how we can say that this both of them will be equal to Q 3 because this two two engines together can be replaced by a in common engine in that which is working within the resurface t1 and t3 or in other way we can come we can visualize engine a and B to be working together with each other or coupled with each other in that case this combined cycle or combined engine definitely will be taking the when it is taking q1 amount of heat then definitely rejecting q3 amount of heat because all reversible engines will be having the same efficiency and here a B and C all three are assumed to be reversible engines so both are rejecting both B and C are rejecting q3 amount of heat to the desired temperature t3 now as per the derivation that we have done in the previous slide we know that for the engine number a we have q2 upon q3 or sorry q2 upon t1 that is heat rejection by heat addition has to be a function of the corresponding temperature t2 and t1 the temperature between which this engine is working for engine B similarly heat rejected is q3 heat added is q2 that has to be a function of T 3 and T 2 and for the Indian sea which is working between t1 and t3 then heat rejection which is q3 by heat addition t1 has to be a function of what has to be a function of T 3 and T 1 is not it so if we combine them Q 3 upon Q 1 is equal to Q 3 upon Q 2 into Q 2 upon Q 1 that is functions of T 3 T 1 is equal to functions of Q 3 upon Q 2 is a function of T 3 T 2 into function of T 2 T 1 now look at this expression quite carefully this expression says that the left-hand side is a function of only T 1 and T 3 however the right-hand side we have a product of two functions one is the product of T 3 and T 2 other is a function of T 2 and T 1 but the left-hand side is not a function of T 2 then when that is possible that is possible only if this function f is a firm form something like G of T 3 by G of T 1 is equal to G of T 3 by G of T 2 into G of T 2 by G of T 1 only the F is a function of a function or a formula like this that is the numerator is the sole function of T 3 and et emitter is the sole function of T 1 or in more formal term the numerator is a sole function of the lower temperature and denominator is a sole function of the upper temperature or higher temperature then only this is possible so we know that now if TTT T 1 is equal to G of T 3 by G of T 1 now next question is what is the form of G now there are several functions which can satisfy this and our choice of function is completely arbitrary so we shall be going by what was suggested by Lord Kelvin he said it is a very simple form what is suggested to take this ratio as just T 3 upon t1 which is the simplest possible definition and that is found to be work perfectly for all applications of this principle and therefore is always taken so what we are getting then we are having now the efficiency for a heat engine which is taking qh amount of heat from a reservoir at temperature th and rejecting ql amount of heat to a reservoir temperature TL form them efficiency of this reversible heat engine is given us 1 minus Q L upon Q H and therefore it is 1 minus TL upon T H which is known as the Carnot efficiency but for our purpose of this temperature measurement we are not interested about this we are more interested about this particular situation Q L upon Q H is equal to TL upon T H it is not at all saying that the QL is equal to TL rather it is saying that the ratio of this to heat interactions will be equal to the ratio of the corresponding reservoir temperatures and that provides something known as the thermodynamic temperature scale look at this here we are saying that the temperatures of the two reservoirs are but the ratio of the temperature of the two reserved verse is just equal to the ratio of the corresponding heat transfer now think about the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales they are we specified those 0 or 32 values based upon one physical phenomenon which is the melting of ice under atmospheric condition now if the pressure changes corresponding melting temperature will also change and then we can idea we can't identify that new melting temperature is zero because the condition has changed that means the definition or that of the references in those scales are dependent upon the properties of some fluid which is not the case here here it is it does not matter whether there is some kind of phase change phenomenon going on inside T 1 or inside T 3 or something else we are just directly getting that the ratio of these two heat interactions is equal to the ratio of the corresponding temperatures and that's why it is called the thermodynamic temperature scale it is independent of the behavior of any material and is an absolute relation however we still need one final parameter to define the scales because it is only giving us a ratio of TL and th that's why we generally take the triple point of water in Kelvin scale that triple point of water is given a value of 272 point one six Kelvin and of course the absolute zero is given a value of zero Kelvin and then accordingly we can we can put two seventy three point one six number of deep subdivisions between these two temperatures to get the Kelvin scale working I or you can say this absolute zero actually are a true proper point which is independent of any fluid properties and therefore that should not be mixed with the ice point or steam point but this is also a perfect parameter which does not depend which is definitely the triple point of water but it is again independent of temperatures and pressures so again absolute constant for this so the different temperature scales which are defined based upon this particular principle they are called thermodynamic temperature scales or sometimes called the single point temperature scale because we just need one reference point like this particular one here for Kelvin or unkind scales so with this knowledge let us move on to check out what are the different ways we can measure temperature the first method the most more popular one or very popular one for domestic applications that is the change in physical dimension something like the bimetallic plates or liquid in glass thermometer then change in gas or vapor pressure constant gas constant volume gas thermometer and pressure thermometer which can be gas filled liquid filled or vapor filled then we can talk about the changes in electrical properties there are several very popular options like the resistance temperatures or resistance temperature detector RTD in short thermistors thermocouples probably the most common technique used or common method for technical use semiconductor Junction with sensors then change in immediate thermal radiation thermal and photon sensor total radiation pyrometer optical and two-color pyrometer and infrared sensors or infrared parameters changes in chemical phase it's a much newer use and not that much in industrial scale but more at research scale like fusible indicators liquid crystals temperature sensitive paints etc all can be considered out of all these five kinds of categories the first one that is changes in physical dimensions these are low cost low accuracy applications so for domestic or for crude laboratory applications we can always go for this however more popular one is the unit change in electrical properties like RTD thermocouples are very popular in industries and also signed in scientific research particularly when you are looking for automatic controller remote sensing then we have to go buy something like this or more advanced option and the changes in a BTech thermal radiation that is a non-conducting applications for very high or very low temperature sensing we generally make use of them so today let us check out the first and second kinds in the next lecture we shall be talking about this third kind shall talking about this third kind in the third lectures or the second lecture and in the third lecture we shall be talking more about this particular one but today our focus is on this type a and B which are more smaller discussions control you already know about most of them so the first device that comes into mind is the bimetallic plate which falls under this first category that is changes in physical dimension here the idea is very simple you have two plates two metallic plates having different coefficient of expansion and we couple them just like the one slide shown here they are fixed with along the normal a longer surface but one of the end is also fixed of the one of the end of this combined bar is also fixed and the other end is free now when the temperature changes their time their coefficient of expansion is are different accordingly their modified length also will be different but there is their strike ly or their joined together strictly then it will be not possible for them to expand separately so only way out is to get bend just shown here under room temperature with examples of copper and iron they are joined together they are having exactly same dimensions now E they're not at all connected with each other then copper is expected to have a larger thermal expansion with elevated temperature like this much higher increase in the copper length is expected but when they are bonded with each other then of course copper can't bend or can't increase length without affecting the length of the iron part and therefore what it does is it form a bend like this just look at this one here definitely the red one is having as it is on the outer side it is having a longer length compared to the blue one which is on the inner side and we can also have a clamp type of situation to measure the amount of deflection that has taken place like it is fixed at one end and the other end is free so it is bending and we are measuring the amount of deflection that has taken place and that can really be referred to the modified temperature because under standard temperature calibration temperature it was just perfectly horizontal like this so this angle is a is a measure of the deflection and subsequently a measure of the temperature quite often the radius of curvature of after the bend I mean I am talking about this particular curvature that is given by a relation like this here this T refers to or let us say T a is the thickness of bar a TB is the thickness of Bar B T is the total thickness that is T a plus TB and M is the ratio of the two that is TB upon ta and n is the ratio of the corresponding Young's modulus eb upon e a and t2 minus t1 is the temperature range over for which we are doing this particular calculation and alpha a and alpha b are the corresponding thermal expansion coefficients of material a and b respectively now there are several situations when the thickness of TA and TB are generally taken to be same so in that case M becomes equal to 1 and it is also common design feature to have n plus 1 by n is equal to 2 when happens then this relation for ROA takes a much simpler form then we have Rho equal to 2t upon 3 into alpha minus alpha B into T 2 minus T 1 so this T generally is known because there is a design parameter alpha and alpha B are material properties so they're also known beforehand so we can measure the change in temperature T 2 and T 1 or I should say T 2 minus T 1 so that is how vibrating plates works there is a simple configuration but there can be several possible designs of biometric plate like we can have a spiral type of design where the center of the spiral is fixed and the free end can expand and can accordingly move over this particular scale another possible design can be a helix where we have a bimetallic helix again because of the expansion the because of the thermal expansion the pointer can move over this particular side scale there are several advantages of such bimetallic things like we can have a very low cost simple and portable we can always take them anywhere for measurement purposes generally are quite robust and no power suits required which is a big advantage and physical inspection is quite easy because you are talking about a small device which simple machinery but the problem is they are not the most accurate one they are not suitable for remote sensing also you need to take the scale or thermometer in contact with the surface where you want a temperature measurement cannot give you measurement from some distance time lag is there because the pointer is some time to settle down at a particular location like the expansion or the bending whenever itself may take some time so it is suitable more for static measurement limited temperature range because temperature range is limited by the properties of these two metals finally insensitive to insensitive at low temperatures and not suitable for digitization so while they can still be used for temperature measurement but they are more popularly used for several other normal applications such as switches something known as a thermistor in case of thermostat we have a metallic strip and we have this particular contact we have this particular contact initially it is in contact with the metal strip but if the temperature keeps on increasing the strip will get bend in this direction accordingly disconnecting the contact beyond a certain point and thereby stopping the flow of current through this the application of such kind of bimetallic strip you can find in domestic refrigerators when they keep on following some kind of on up schedule and also sometimes in old grandfather clocks where as temperature fluctuates with time of day or with the season they can provide accurate measurement of the time without changing the or without changing the effective length of the arms the other option very popular one or the most popular one that you know is the conventional thermometer something probably before this lecture you knew as the turn thermometer by the damn thermo meter but this is more specific name of this one is a liquid in glass thermometer where we have a capillary filled cavity or I should say we have a capillary tube through which we have some kind of liquid temperature sensing liquid that can move up and down of the capillary tube the picture that I am showing that is having a horizontal orientation but practical cases generally it is put in a vertical orientation where we can see several components some of them are compulsory where some of them are also optional the first one is a bulb this is a bulb which act as the storage of the fluid that we are using so we generally have a very thin glass wall which should be thin enough so that the fluid inside can sense the temperature of the surface in contact of which you are bringing this one but at the same time it should also be hard enough to sustain minor vibrations or minor shocks the valve bus volume of the ball needs to be carefully designed so that it can house just enough amount of fluid to enough to prove reading over the entire volume of the or provides the entire scale of this without overflowing the scale or without leading to any kind of overflow and the thermal expansion coefficient of the bulb and the corresponding glass tube should also be compatible with that of the liquid then we have the after ball we have the steam the steam generally made of annealed glass depends on and the property of the glass depends very much on the temperature range for which you are using like the scale that you are using for measurement of sub-zero temperature may not be suitable when you are measuring temperature range of 200 or 300 degree Celsius the and also it is important to minimize the effect of thermal expansion because you have to understand that as the temperature of the fluid changes and its volume expands similarly the volume of the glass also wants to glass also is expanding and we somehow have to go for some kind of compromise or the coefficient of expansion for the glass needs to be arranged such that it is effect is minimal on the final reading and that's what it is important to choose the material for the stream depending upon the temperature range of operation and also the portion the void portion like here the dark portion refers to the liquid whichever you are operating with and this empty void portion of the stream which is not contained in liquid at this particular moment they should be pressurized by certain kind of medium so that it can avoid the column separation of the mercury column and also avoid the vaporization of the fluid inside when the temperature increases then we can have an auxilary scale this auxilary scale actually is an optional item and this auxilary scale refers to a scale which is well below the main scale this is the main scale this particular one is a main scale which is the zone of interest or temperature range of interest the auxiliary scale is generally the first way temperature will below the main scale temperature quite often used for calibration purpose like it may refer to the zero degree Celsius in case of Celsius scale which we may not be using on a normal operation purpose but occasionally just to check whether the home heater is working correctly or not we may I would like to check this one with this auxiliary scale the meniscus refers to the separation part of or the liquid filled part and the void part of this then we have this contraction chamber this contraction chamber is again an optional item optional in a sense that it is providing a slightly expanded volume within the capillary tube so that we can manage the total volume of liquid that is going into the main capillary or towards the main scale thereby on somehow controlling the total height of the liquid column this immersion line certain thermometers may also have the immersion line which is this one this refers to the height up to which the thermometer must be immersed to get a proper measurement so if we are using this particular thermometer then starting from this wall up to this line we want it to be immersed into the zone of application and the rest part will be open to the atmosphere and finally we have this expansion chamber which is a compulsory part which is present in any thermometer if there is a sudden rise in the volume of fluid suppose we have used it for a temperature which is higher than this maximum range then thermometer will be expanding beyond the main scale and to address that expansion we provide this expansion chamber so there are several possible liquids that can be used but most popular one definitely you know is a mercury thermometer which can operate over a range of minus 38 to about 350 degree Celsius because mercury starts to feeds around minus 30 degree Celsius and it's boiling temperature is around 30 350 degree Celsius so when the boiling temperature is more or less okay but the freezing temperature is quite high compared to several applications we can lower this freezing temperature a bit if we use a market thallium mixture then it goes to minus 56 degree Celsius which can be sufficient for if you are looking for so with a temperature measurement in the her sister of condition or in the toughest of conditions but if you are looking for certain kind of cryogenic applications etc this is still quite high now mercury thermometer is everywhere or I should say the liquid in glass thermometer and marker a thermometer synonymous because of such widespread application it has but the problem with mercury has several advantages of course but the problem is mercury is it is toxic and that's why several international organizations have nowadays recommended not to use molecule a thermometer actually ASTM has given a recommendation or a restriction that it is not going to calibrate any mercury thermometer from now onwards so it may happen that mercury thermometer may become a stock for the museum in future but may not be very near future just because of its wide availability and applicability and use of use now the option for replacing mercury mercury thallium composition or combination also has the same disadvantages now the option for replacing them is can be a spirit thermometer there can be several organic fluids or they can tell you in alcohol butane they can also be options one problem with them that they are OPIC in nature so it may be difficult to observe their rise that's why they are often colored with certain kind of dye red or blue color Dyer very commonly used spirit thermometer has several disadvantages before we talk about its advantages we should mention the disadvantages like it is definitely less accurate compared to Marjory prone to vaporization because they have lower boiling temperature they can have their surface Station is low and there so you may have discontinuous liquid column thereby giving a wrong reading they can form flame on the capillary while coming down and also there is sensitivity they have a greater sensitivity to changes in step temperatures or I should say this should not be strip temperature should be steam temperature so they have a greater sensitivity to changes in steam temperature because the coefficient of expansion of of the spirits like alcohol and most of the common classes that is used there is not that big difference and that's why they're quite sensitive to the changes in the steam temperature but they have set a certain advantages okay another advantage is the disadvantage I should say the dimensions of the thermo meter will be different compared to the dimensions of the mercury so we properly need to do the calibration and also the calculation of the RAI mentions but the biggest advantage for them is non-toxic that's why that's what this coal over the mercury thermometer they're lower temperature can be much much lower can go up to minus 200 degree Celsius thereby making them eligible for several cryogenic applications there's again another point of this core over mercury and they have been suggested by ASTM because a steam hell is not recommending or calibrating mercury or mercury based materials for thermal applications another advantage that can be mentioned in this or I should say another advantage of this mercury thermometer that their cost can be slightly lower compared to the the spirit based on winter care as cost can be slightly lower compared to the mercury thermometer another possible alternative can be something conventionally known as the low hazard precision thermometers or low hazard precision lig thermometer lig just refers to liquid in glass low hazard precision lig thermometers which can be a replacement of mercury based on meters they generally use some non-toxic biodegradable materials but those materials are proprietary items of the manufacturers not clearly specifying the properties of this but they may have a maybe a future option now another point that we have to be careful while using this liquid in glass thermometer is the level of immersion how much should we immerse this there are three kinds of situations we can have total immersion thermometer where the bulb and the entire liquid column or that should be immersed so the only the meniscus it should be exists lightly above the container or zone where we are measuring the temperature but in terms of the bulb and the liquid column should be exposed to the temperature which we want to measure this is probably the most common or I should say the most advantageous kind of thermo meter most accurate option that we can have but one problem is that how can we know how much should we immerse that will only come from the tip after getting the temperature measurement and maybe going to a few trial and error they are commonly used in constant temperature baths where you want to maintain a constant temperature in some kind of liquid pool or container this can be a good option then partial immersion thermometer where we have a line specified just like shown in the previous slide emotion line this in every situation it is to be must up to this up to this height at least there are several scenario where the length of the thermometer may be more compared to the depth of the container where we are looking for temperature measurements so it is not possible to go for total immersion rather we go for the partial immersion but you have to ensure that the thermometer is immersed up to this emotion line and finally we have the total immersion thermometer in case of total immersion the entire body of the thermometer is immersed it is not a very common application thermometric fluids should have the following properties for making them eligible in ilahi thermometers like linear temperature dimension relationship so that we can have a perfectly linear scale like if we you probably know that the temperature expansion for any fluid Delta L the if instead of writing Delta L if I write suppose Delta V the change in volume of any fluid generally can be given as beta V naught delta T where delta T refers to the corresponding change in temperature V naught is the initial volume correspond to some reference temperature and because the thermal expansion coefficient now these thermal expansion coefficient may not be a constant is a constant a perfect constant you are going to get a perfectly linear scale but itself can vary with temperature and similarly the glass cover also can vary with temperature so the thermometer scale should properly take care of this large coefficient of expansion this is where the spirit thumb adjust a better because their coefficient of expansions are much larger compared to mercury and therefore they can give much larger sensitivity reasonably wide temperature range as liquid this is none of the options that is mercury or spirits are good in this system our Curie has a reasonably high upper limit of around 350 degree Celsius but the low limit is quite high whereas the alcohol-based thermometers can go up to minus 200 degree Celsius but this starts by polarizing in beyond 150 to 200 degree Celsius and therefore they are not usable at higher temperatures peer visibility in the capillary mercury scores over spirit because mercury is OPIC and clearly visible within the capillary however alcohol is transparent and can be used only after it is colored with certain kind of dye and the liquid should not adhere to the capillary wall which is again mark you be bitter is mercury bitter mercury is better compared to spirits so you can see that there are several points at least in terms of this one and this one mercury is definitely better this one mercury is better for higher temperature side alcohol is better in terms of this particular one and that's why mercury thermometer is from more popular compared to the alcohol thermometers but because of this toxic nature you may see them completely out of market in the next 3040 years these are thermal expansion based device we shall quickly be talking about two more devices or another category where we are talking using the changes in gas and vapor pressures and the one that comes here is a constant volume gas thermometer this is something that uses the expansion of gas with temperature here we have a fixed mass of gas maintained in a particular container now this once we come emerge this container into the environment or expose Doosan to the you want to measure the temperature we make we keep the volume constant as the volume remains constant then it's pressure has to increase because from if this gas follows the ideal gas equation of state we know that we have P 1 upon T 1 is equal to P 2 upon T 2 during a constant volume process so temperature will keep on increasing linearly with the pressure or conversely I should say as the temperature increases pressure will keep on increasing linearly with this temperature we generally have a mercury based manometer to provide us a reading of this increased pressure this side is open to the atmosphere and this side is subjected to the pressure inside this container so the difference in this mercury column is going to give you the value of the pressure inside and instead of pressure you can mark this particular scale in terms of greatly in terms of temperature this constant volume gastrin thermometers are actually the ones that gave us the idea of the absolute zero because if we do experiments with different gases you can find for all the gases the x line extrapolating the negative temperature direction converge to a particular point where the volume becomes zero theoretically at least practically all the gaseous continents will below this temperature however theoretically this is the temperature at which the volume of all gases will become zero and that is the one we marked as the absolute temperature now constant volume gas thermometer generally U is used as a reference for calibration purpose but may not be for industrial use because it is generally fragile again you need to keep this one in contact with the body where we want to get the measurement it is quite difficult to use for practical purposes and there so it is restricted only for laboratory purposes by the way I have not mentioned a space separate advantage or disadvantage for the liquid in glass thermometer because those are quite similar to the bimetallic strips so you can just think about the same points that is they need to be brought in contact with their advantage can be their small cheap portable and quite well used but disadvantage can be they can be frazzled and they can they need to be taken in contact with the body so not possible for remote measurement now constant volume gas thermometer has an improvement in the form of pressure thermometer where instead of a con fixed container or a rigid container we are having a chamber in within which we can have certain fluid and as a temperature changes its pressure again changed its pressure and that is sensed by this particular pressure measurement gauge here the container is connected with a long tube the length of this tube can be very very long even in the range of 100 meters thereby providing option of remote measurement that is this particular part can be kept at one location and that team pressure measure learning's or the temperature sensor can be kept at a comic at a distance far away from this facilitating the remote measurement we can have a liquid field option where the in medium is maintained specifically at liquid phase throughout now liquids are more incompressible in nature so as the temperature changes the sensing will come more in terms of a change in volume of liquid we can have gas field where it is maintained completely under gaseous situation and we can also a vapor field where we maintain a liquid vapor mixture thereby the as the temperature changes corresponding saturation pressure also changes and that is sensed to get the measure of the temperature they have generally a very large operating range much larger compared to the earlier ones that we have discussed but for the gas field once particularly we can have very wide range limited only by the condensation of gases at the lower side and possible dissociation of the gases at very high temperatures and there is no elevation effects as well that is they are independent of the effect of gravity generally but the disadvantage can be large bulb size requirement and generally they lead to very small deflection unless there is significant change in temperature so this gas or vapor pressure base thermometers are generally used more standards or calibration purposes in the next class we shall be discussing about the electrical property based temperature measurements which are generally more you technical more used for technical purposes so if we want to summarize what we have done today we discussed about the laws of thermodynamics define the temperature from the context of the zeroth law and the thermodynamic temperature scale from the context of the second law we have discussed about the two point and single point temperature scales then different methods of temperature measurements were summarized then you talked about the expansion based devices two devices basically one is the bimetallic strip and other is the liquid in glass thermometer then we have talked about the gas vapor pressure base thermometers where we mentioned about the constant volume gas thermometer and pressure thermometer so that's it for the day next class we shall be back with the measuring tools like RTD and thermocouples so till then thanks a lot you [Music]
