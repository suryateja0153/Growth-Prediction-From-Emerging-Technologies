 [Music] good morning everyone so previous class we have learned about what are surface properties and what are the different techniques we can use for characterizing those surface properties today we will be learning about the bulk properties so what are the bulk properties so other than the outer surface of a material or other section is bulk section only so for for the material to be used for the implant first that bulk property has to be satisfied so that it has to be mimicking the already existing natural material then only we can go for surface analysis and those things for the making it mol biocompatible so what are the bulk properties they are elastic behavior whether it can be extended based on the application stress and strength tension compression and shear stress fatigue and click bulk property is totally different from surface well it won't have any reaction with the system but it it is majorly for the orthopedic implants where there is a load bearing applications and all are involved so why it is important because if you consider the orthopedic implants once you surgically insert it into the body it has to be there for lifelong and it has to maintain its function all over that period to have that capability we have to characterize that mechanical property of the implants so consider the in vertebral disc which is inserted into the vertebra of human so for each position the load applied on to that in vertebral disc is different as you can see in normal supine position which is lying down it is loaded on the this could be 294 Newton only but if you are standing and walking and all it increases gradually due to the force applied on the weight of that and if you are lifting that load would be further increased so your material has to have that wide range of load bearing capacity so that it can be in the host system for a long period of time because if there is a failure and if you are inserting an implant at the age of 30 around 50 if it fails then you have to go for again surgery which has a higher risk and all so bulk property this plays a major role for the longer patency of the implant and what are the major obstacles in this bulk property sir one is callosum and due to the excessive usage of the implant inside the body the material can break down into smaller smaller pieces which will causes further complication in the biological system okay so the fundamental concepts in the mechanical properties all stress stresses when and forces applied onto the surface that is called stress so the mathematical term is stress equal to force behavior so you are applying a force on a specific cross-sectional of material so that is the stress so based on this stress the material will go and deformation so if there is a dental implant so where you are eating and also that stress would be applied on the dental implant so that has to maintain its integrity so that deformation is called strain so strain is changing the length by original length in CL length so based on these two factors there is a relation called Hookes law which introduces a new parameter called Ang's modulus which is a ratio of stress by strain so this is a important and commonly used parameter in all of the biomaterials for while defining a mechanical property of that material so other properties related to this tensile strength saws elastic modulus yield strength ultimate tensile strength ductility and toughness so these properties I will explain while explaining the stress-strain curve so you know what is stress and what is strain so if you have a relation based on this stress and strain if there is a increase in stress there would be an increase in strain so the in CL proportionate linear increase is called in that linear increase this region is called flat elastic region so in that elastic region what it represents is if a material if it is in the elastic region even if that strength due to the strain if it forms if it deforms into a different structure then it can retain back it back into its original structure it's like a rubber band whether you extend it so if you leave it it can come back into the original shape original length so in that region is called elastic region so there is a particular region well if you extend it further more it will cause breakage of the rubber band so that region is called plasticity region where it cannot come back to its original region so so the Insel region is called a elastic region so up to this the stress and strain would be very linear if the posner then after it's the yield point is there so after this yield point the material cannot go back to its original state okay so if you are having an implant polymer materials used for the vascular grafts catheters and all so if that material if the force applied on the material is going beyond that yield point its shape can change into a different one so that will cause problems while introducing into the biological system so your material has to be below that yield point whatever the force which is naturally occurring it for that material the application based on the application that should be below that yield point so the ultimate strength ultimate strenght is the maximum load that material can which time so now considering a hip cluster phase so if you are introducing into the system the maximum load where that material can withstand even if it deforms that is the ultimate strength so after that if you continue to give the load then that material will break so that is called the test run so this is a typical stress strain curve but for different types of biomaterials the stress-strain curve varies because polymers will have a higher elasticity and everything whether ceramics has no elasticity at all so as you can see the little ceramic aluminum oxides it has a in CLA Ang's modulus then after that if you give a load it will break there is no point of elongation or anything for the ceramics then for little metals like cobalt chromium alloys and titanium for the ductile methods like titanium alloys and all there would be a little bit elongation then after which it breaks no in polymers also there is a thermosetting polymers such as epoxy polymers those kind of polymers it is a very brittle in nature so it cannot have that elastic point so this epoxy polymers and all used for the adhesive surgical glues and adhesives so they will immediately seal up the wounds so that it shouldn't leak anything so those materials would be very brittle so those things don't have any elasticity under then ductile polymers so all other low-density polymers polyethylene then carbohydrate polymers all those materials will have a higher range of elasticity such as PVA Titus on polyethylene so normal plastic polyethylene so if you can extend it can go for the very longer length under so that polymers will have a different inks modulus and different plasticity region so based on this you have to decide and the application you are going to use you have to decide the material and characterize whether these materials has the same property as that of naturally occurring materials so like if you are implant introducing a new vascular grafts and all that vascular grafts has to has the mechanical property said that it can withstand the force of the blood stream passing to that graft and if you are going for the hippest agenda so you have to look for how the loads and all are playing on the region along the hip velocities so that it doesn't break all it doesn't fall above the yield strength okay so how we can find out all these parameters is modulus ultimate strength and fracture and that rupture point under so that can be found using universal testing machine so in this machine you can do variety of tests well each of the tests will give a different parameters so this is how the instrument will look like so instrument the bottom one is called mounted ahead so it is a movable head so the bottom so you can see the two clamps so in between those two clamps only we will fix the sample okay so the top one is a movable head so in that one it will load cell would be there at the top so the load cell will apply the force on the sample so and it will tension will applied onto the sample so that will introduce stress and then the change in length will be calculated by the sensors so which will from that we can calculate the ultimate strength ill-spent and rupture point and ynx modulus and all so for different application different clamps would be available as you can see one is for $0.10 so tension stress is where you elongate a sample so that is the tension stress and compress and compression is where you compress the sample so that the material how much the load it can compress into a smaller in on that material surface then bending where the material would be kept and that would be a bending at a different points under so there is based on the application so if you are having asked loop plates and all in the legs and this plus 30 so that the bending would be different based on that how many screws and nuts you are introducing into the plates so based on that you can go for it three-point bending for point mending to exactly characterize how that will function inside the biological system then tossin and Allah so that it be a twisting curse on the sample so this kind of testing will be done for the ligaments and all so where the ligaments would has to be turned so that it doesn't break all the lectures are doing that torsional stress then in pain steel is mainly for the hip the studies well there would be a metal metal contact there would be a shear stress applied whenever that ball and cub would be moving over the direct plane so that will be find out using the C estate shear stress in planar testing so all this can be done for different size of samples different sample dimension and all the metals polymers ceramics and everything so using this instrument you can find out all the mechanical properties under and can see in that sample dimension it looks like a dog bone shape so it's an important factor that if you are keeping a single length a rectangular sample and all so the breakage would occur at the where you are clamping the sample so that is not the actual tensile stress applied onto that sample so they make a dog bone shape so that the sample at the ends would be thicker so that it would clamp and the breakage would occur at the sample middle only so that will give the exact value of how that stress during observation will be occurring so usually we consider so when a stress is applied the strain will instantaneously produced so that is how our idea was so but it doesn't actually follow that all over the period so consider different parameters such as temperature frequency on time so based on these parameters with the constant stress also it can have a different so in the stress-strain curve if you can see there's applied stress the strain with it so if you increase the strain value but if you applied a constant stress also the strain can vary so that is a dynamical mechanic dynamic mechanical testing under so why this is important so temperature as I said earlier dental implants and all well you can have a change in temperature like valuating ice cream or the hot soup so the temperature changes so the implant should maintain its integrity so to identify whether that affects that mechanical property the same normal room temperature if you are applying a load on to your material that will have a different effect when the temperature is very cold so those things has to be calculated then frequency frequency is how much time a material is being used for that specific application consider the hip plus that is well it has to move while walking how many distance how much distance you are walking and all based on that the frequency way this consider the hot walls and also hot walls has to function lot number of times for the for the minute air it has to beat for 72 along 72 bits so consider for a minute it is like that then for the day how much beats it has to be there and for the years and for the prolonged period of time how much time the walls has to open and close so over those periods what happens is the material is in contact with the nearby surfaces and all so that would be some corrosion there would be some surface searching and the other ocean that will reduce the efficiency of that material so those factors has to be tested before clinically used that hot walls and this materials under so what are these properties change changing based on this frequency and time also time dependent properties saw the some of the does a lot of properties so these are the widely used properties clip of the cavity test relaxation test so creep as a quality test test it is well in creeper the Kazi test the stress should be maintained constant whereas the strain would vary so if you consider that ligament so as you can see in the figure the weight WT has been a load that is the load has been given so when it is given at that time point t they it it won't along it if it is within that linear range of the stress-strain curve after the particular period of time it tends to elongate okay so that is that percentage elongation changing that is what it is changing so how much that time can affect that strain on based on us constant stress so that is creeper recovery test then relaxation test it is exact opposite of the creeper creep test where the strain would be kept constant the elongation would be kept constant but the load will vary so how much load it can vary based to maintain that elongation so these things would be very useful when you are designing a new material and also that the material shouldn't go go to a point where it cannot recover its original state back okay so for those things this time dependent properties will involve and to identify that material prolong the usage we will study these time-dependent properties so you can see dependent properties so frequency dependent properties as I have said the earlier the number of frequency your material is being used like in the hot walls and hip the studies so we haven't tell it is the major problem in orthopedic implants where the material would be in contact with the nearby materials and all so due to the frequency high number of frequency we are using that material inside the biological system the surface will get as ordered and that will lose its functionality lose its efficiency fatigue is again the same thing well you are not in fatigue you are below the yield point only the number of the load we are giving is below the yield point only but due to the over usage of the implants for that application the material will lose its efficiency that is called fatigue it will lose its functionality so this easily happens when the material you are designing it should be almost similar to that natural natural material like the metal implants it should be similar to the bone and bone all the depression if it is above also what happens is that there is a stress shielding effect happen it can happen so stress shielding effect is an effect well if material can have a load of Londe 500 Newton if we make that material into a thousand Newton it can have that much capacity of a Thousand Newton material what happens it it can have that all the load by itself and it won't pass on to the nearby bones under so what happens due to that is the bones surrounding that material will get loose its integrity and it would be weaker compared to the normal bones so that is by this material it is shielding the stress of the nearby natural materials and all that by reducing its integrity so that is one of a major problem in orthopedic implants so those things will come when fatigue is also involved so it can seal the stress of the load and that by reducing the integrity of the bone implants so those are the basic properties and characterization we can do for the bulk properties of the material consider hydrogels and scaffolds so the has different properties rather than these polymers flames and metal implants under so you might have already studied what our hydrogels and scaffolds so hydrogels all gels which can have a water intake higher amount of water intake and scaffolds or the polymeric scaffolds which can be used for the cell tissue degeneration ptosis and all so what are the properties important for these hydrogels and scaffolds some basic properties which defends them so you can do all the surface characterization and bulk characterization for these hydrogels and scuffles also other than those properties these properties also involved velocity swelling degradation kinetics and the thermal behavior Sao Paulo city Sao Paulo city for the scaffold polis T is an important factor because porosity will help in cell attachment in depth of that scaffold and the number of posts will help in transfer of nutrients inside and outside that scaffolds so to identify the Polaski of the material tissue in hang scaffold normal techniques like same time mercury policy meters and the gas pycnometer ii can be used so in Tim and SEM you can visually and visually see the polar structure so as you can see the same image the porous scaffold is seen but this in same image you can see at the surface only so you cannot say it confirm that inside also the pore structure would be the may be the inside it would be a compact bulk structure and the surface would be a porous structure in Tim you can actually say that the material is completely possessed because due to the transmission electrons you can see what's inside the material under so if a material is completely posers inside you can find out using that thing other than these sophisticated techniques you can use Mako deposits meters and gas economically which uses a Archimedes principle awfully good displacement well you have a how the experiment for this finding the porosity goes is that you will have a liquid in Makati polish meter you will insert the polar structures inside so the polish and you apply a vacuum also so the would be sucked out of the system and all the poles inside will be filled by mercury so those by that then you take out the scaffold and wait the amount of scaffold before keeping into into that mercury and after that and based on the volume you can actually calculate the porosity so milk is a percent and gas pycnometer e it involves gas and commonly used another liquid is that ethanol so by ethanol because it can it won't involve in swelling of the materials and all some of most of the materials would be hydrophilic so it can if you are using water and all it can absorb water and it can swell and all it's not actually the polis volume so the volume would be based on the polymer scaffold also so using ethanol will have a better that better than the water the experiment so first a formula is that a final weight minus NC L weight by volume and density of the ethanol use so how much of volume and Athan density of the ethanol you are using so that will give you the porosity of the scaffold okay so swelling study is predominantly used for hydrogels because the uptake of water is majorly influences the kinetics of the molecules loading and releasing from the just so material which can swell faster can mean that the water intake is a higher so that the nutrients or any other the drugs'll molecules which you are incorporating into the hydrogel can be released faster so if spelling is lower then the release would be slower so that defines how the kinetics mostly in drag deliver the application and how this kinetics would be factor it would be affected by this swelling study so for swelling analysis similar to that what you do is you weigh the samples before the keeping it into water then you keep it in water then you again weigh the sample so that will the difference in that weight by the Insel weight final weight is the percentage degree of swelling so is really for hydrogels be for the application vice you can actually use this degree of swelling to understand that the rate of drug release and also if it is a uncross link the polymer hydrogels and all the swelling would be faster and if it is a cross-linked the hydrogel the swelling would be slower so to understand the kinetics of the release profile you can use this swelling uh you can study this swelling so degradation so degradation is an important parameter for both the hydrogels and scaffolds because nowadays most of the implants are coming as a biodegradable implants well when it is implanted into the body instead of having another surgery to remove those implants these things can degrade by itself such as the switches resolvable screws and all value implanted for the metal plates and the sutures for the internal sutures and all so however the pre initially it should function like a normal shoe check whether well it should it should have all the mechanical property and all the physical property of the like the normal suture there then after over the period of time when the wound heals that should be degraded by the biological system in the end it should be washed away from the system so this would be tested with the biological fluids and enzyme so based on the application you are using so the ballot by declaration is calculated by initial rate minus final weight after it is degraded by the final rate will give you the biodegradation so this will help you understand how long material can degrade so based on that you can design them so if you want your material to be degraded within a week all within a month then you have to complete degradation should be the within the month the final value will be around zero so that it should be completely replaced by the natural tissue okay so those are the normal physicochemical properties for the scaffolds and hydrogen's coming into thermal behavior so thermal behaviors like I said for the implants for dental implants and for normal polymeric materials also you have to understand the effect of temperature on the material so that can be found out using a DSC and TJ so this is a commonly used these two are commonly used techniques other than this there are the thermal characterization techniques also so the DAC it involves what it actually finds out is that the material melting point crystallization point then the glass transition temperature then the phase change of the polymers so those things can be found out using differential scanning calorimeter so the instrumentation involves as you can see in the picture the two one is a reference and another this is sample in the sample pan we will keep the our material and in the reference pan it would be a empty pan or you can have a reference compatible materials under so what happens is you will apply a constant temperature on to the both the sample and reference the same thing at the same temperature so what happens is that if your material exert hits like releases heat by exothermic reaction or endothermic reaction it absorbs heat there would be a change in the heat flow so that would be detected so that based on that you can actually plot this DSC thermogram where you can find out the melting point crystallization point and degradation point of the materials so as you can see the first when it polymeric materials if it is amorphous polymers it will go a glass transition change so it can go from brittle nature into your body nature so above glass plants and temperatures the molecule will be arranged randomly so that will have a Isabella nature that is the temperature called glass transition temperature so glass transition temperature after that it will molecules will arrange a orderly fashion where it is you can find out the crystallization temperature so after that molecule tends to melt so that is the melting temperature then if there is a chemical reaction due to the temperature so that is the exothermic behavior you are seeing then finally the degradation occurs where the material is completely degraded due to that temperature so these temperatures and all these temperatures are very essential when you are using a thermo responsive gels and other temperature involving implants and devices it can also be used for characterization Noom biomaterial whether you are having a cross-linked or the mixtures of two materials and there would be a difference in shifting in the temperature in the glass transition temperature and change in melting temperature and all it will lock us because higher the cross-linking the melting temperature will vary so based on that you can identify that your cross-linked has a or the other material properties has changed due to the incorporation of a new molecule into the other samples under so that can be found out using this differential scanning calorimeter the molarity analysis is similar to DAC only the mechanism is similar to DAC only but here the it involves as the name suggests the gramma tree which is a weighing of the material so the instrumentation is almost similar that nowadays the advanced instruments has both DAC and the TGA is available so well in the DSC value can change you can observe the change in temperature due to the material when the heat is supplied here due to the heat is supplied you can actually measure the minor change in the weight so you will use a sample of around 20 mg/l Phi mg only for the each of them so that can be that my new change in temperature can be observed using this thermo gravimetric analysis so this mainly helps us to identify how the degradation occurs for the material and all so typical term exam will looks like that right corner you can see that so around hundred degree Celsius due to the increase in so in DAC and TJ there would be a constant increase in temperature we will be supplying so in CL increase in temperature there would be a volatile compounds like moisture water adsorbed of any solvents present it would get evaporated from that system so that would be you can see that it said decrease in the weight percentage that is the in sale stage then the second stage would be the decrease in the polymer decreasing the weight due to the polymer degradation so that is in the second stage then the final stage where it is completely turned out into an S which is a degraded polymers everything has been completely turned into Coleman okay so the interpretation for this TG analysis it if it is there is your material is not affected by any temperature the line would be a very straight line then in the co2 you can see there is a decreasing sudden decrease and it became stabilized that usually denotes that you have material some moisture or some solvents other than so which is getting evaporated not a degradation of compound of molecule present on the scaffolds that is the curve then encode 3 it's a single stage decomposition so if your material is made up of a single polymer or single material metals or something ceramics and all so there would be a single degradation of that particular molecule only so that can be observed due to the single loss of the weight if your material is having a multiple polymers like inter penetrating networks where you have a couple of polymers or alloys where you use silver titanium alloys and all so those will have a each material will have a different degradation temperature so the lower degradation temperature first step would be the those materials will get degradated then simultaneously based on the degradation temperature it varies in step fiber if it is not a step wise if it is just gradually decreasing it means that you are actually heating it very fast so that is a instrument cannot measure the exact weight of that material as Kapil's person there can be some increase in weight also that happens when you as material is reactive to the atmosphere present inside the system so usually it would be inert atmosphere such as we can use such as nitrogen or argon and all but if you are using a normal atmospheric condition does it be oxidation occurs which can lead to the increase in the weight of the material so the final one is again after decomposition it can those decomposition products can interact with the atmospheric compounds and reactive species so that it can lead to increase in that right so this can also happen in magnetic samples also there would be an increase in weight also so by characterizing these thermal properties you will know that even materials pure or if you whatever you are incorporating into your material can have a any thermal effect on to the final material so those things can be analyzed using these techniques although so understanding this both the bulk properties and the surface properties will have a clear idea of how exactly you want to use that material for the other applications or not so after finishing these two characterization you have to go for the other biological characterization well you can check for the 13 adsorption cell attachment and if you are working on anti bacterial additional biofilm formation to avoid biofilm formation so those things and all come under the biological characterization how effectively it can improve or decrease the attachment of the biological system so before going that you have to understand these parameters and these characterization techniques has to be done for all the materials you are saying [Music]
