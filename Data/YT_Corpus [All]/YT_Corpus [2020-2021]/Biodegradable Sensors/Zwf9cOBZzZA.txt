 A warm welcome to all of you I want to start by congratulating the three editors of the book that is launched today I checked yesterday evening the volume was already downloaded more than 100,000 times in the first four weeks since it was placed on the Internet so apparently the message has gone around and is going around that is a piece of success colleagues we discussed today how planetary health and people's health on the planet can be improved and actually rescued our challenges are bending the curve greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and bending the curve of COVID 19 infections and if we do not bend some other curves such as the one of hunger and biodiversity destruction planetary health will deteriorate and collapse it's this larger context that we need to address colleagues the book draws on a conference and research done thereafter it proposes 12 solutions 12 solutions I just mentioned 2 number one health must be central to policies that stabilize climate change below dangerous levels and conclusion is the rich should not only expeditiously shift to save energy and land use practices but also provide support to the poor for the costs of adapting to climate change let me leave it at that with my introductory remarks I call now His Eminence Cardinal Peter Turkson your eminence we are particularly grateful that you address this conference also in view of your leadership in the commission of the Dicastery and other organizations to address the COVID 19 pandemic your eminence you have the floor please limit your comments to 15 minutes thank you I hope I came in loud and clear so thanks thanks for the invitation and congratulations on the production of this book called to just say a few words by way of opening and introducing the discussion this afternoon I just like to observe the relationship between the health of the planet and the health of people of human beings on the planet and I would like to observe we start off by referring to the fact that in 2014 when the Holy Father visited Korea now on his way back he had an interview in flight and then revealed for the first time his intention his plan to produce a book on ecology and mentioned that he was doing that with the help of the dicastery with that revelation we received a visit the first visit in response to that revelation was from two medical doctors one from Boston the other one from Italy the two doctors were friends and on hearing that there was a project about producing a book on they came and wanted to ensure that the issue of health care was not left out or the production of the project did not miss out on health care so the big emphasis for them was to recognize the role of healthcare when you talk about ecology or the environment and this brings us probably also to the central theme of the Pope's Encyclical itself, the central theme was integral ecology integral ecology brings a lot of things together which Pope Francis himself several times refers to as you know everything is interconnected everything is interrelated but it this which also introduces I suppose the book that we are about to discuss and talk about because integral ecology refers to the fact not just of every turn being interrelated and connected but the fact that when Pope Paul VI in Populorum progressio first invited us to take care of the environment of nature so natural ecology this was quickly followed by Pope John Paul II who said that it's not only nature that has an ecology and environment to be taken care of but a human person also has an environment to be taken care of a human ecology it went on further with the pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI to extend this and take this one step further and talk about social ecology that society itself also requires a certain that you know the certain number of conditions to prevail to make a succeed hand added also an ecology of peace so between the pontificate of Pope Paul the sixth and other Benedict we thought Pope's come and describe ecology of nature ecology of the human person human ecology ecology of society and ecology of peace when you put them all together then you have this integral ecology which is that there's no way one can carry on a conversation about ecology of nature care for nature without being concerned about care for the human person in society and that's how the two of them belong together and so their health care or the the well-being of the earth naturally is related to a well-being of the human person and a topic of the book which you've developed health of heard of people health of the planet and our responsibility is all hid in this sense of integral ecology to see how concerned for the well-being environmental world in the village is related with the environmental well-being of the human person they go very close together it's not my turn to describe the details but otherwise depletion of the environment goes you know affects the health of the people who live on the environment it's just been observed agricultural concern and put the food production and all of that also very close closer related with the healthy well-being of the environment and yes a few days ago when as a result of the copied in our cars and traffic who kind of grounded in New Delhi it was possible for people to see the Himalayas and the ice cap on the Himalayas an asthmatic patient interviewed in China said that he was glad that you who come out and now breathe properly as al as my vision so the relationship between the well-being of the planet and that of the human person you know kind of began against aid and having now to discuss this is a very hot issue especially and this closing days of you know this period of the copied the you know the relationship between the well-being of the eight and the planet now a sense of responsibility however and undergirds all of this because the beginning point of the relationship between the well-being of the planet and of the human person the all grounded according to their biblical tradition in the event of creation but their creation and trusted into the hands of the human person was done with the expression to tell and to keep and that gasps means that we may not tell too much and keep too little but we must keep as much as we tell and a sense of keeping is what I like to in observe a little bit by way of kind of completely my small introductory remarks the Hebrew expression which is you see in the Old Testament asking the human person to keep their garden or the garden whom the God is prepared and created for it is the same word which is used about the relationship between brothers when for example Cain killed Abel and God asking where your brother is your brother Kay's response was am I my brother's keeper the same verb law which was used about KS responsibility to us his brother whom he had killed is the same word which was used by God to entrust the garden into the care of the human person to also to keep this law therefore the relationship between the human person and his garden who the environment creation is presented in kinship terms as if human beings related in all the eight eyes this as a Kim you know they in a kinship term to the human person this of course we know will be amply developed by st. Francis of Assisi who refers to all elements of nature in terms of a brother a sister a mother and all of that so the invitation then which describes our responsibility is the relationship of needing to keep the head as if it was a cane as it was a member of the human family and this is what they are cyclical louder to see on the penis so Pope Francis an encyclical laudato si invites us to consider ourselves as human beings not as the Otto referential center of creation making use of everything at will but to consider ourselves as part of the Creator system we belong to the Creator structure because our bodies are drawn from the material of the earth and our lives are sustained by the products of the earth so we saw very much a part of the created in attitude create a reality that we cannot just abuse it or use it as we please so our sense of responsibility is then related in this and in this regard la-da-da C does not so might talk about stewardship towards creation it uses the more emotional if you want expression care for creation stewardship is used only twice and this encyclical every other way that the Pope presents and talks about the relationship between the human person and creation of the earth is in terms of care okay as if it's a personal relationship that we have towards creation and the depth and that describe the sense of that type of responsibility that we need to show it's as if we keep my brother it's as if we shall care response before a brother or a sister or something or somebody we relate away you know so intimately and personally and so bringing my small comments to a close we were just invited at the beginning so others can speak as if I just want to relate and to you know route the discussion health of the people health of the planet in this sense of integral and ecology natural ecology been as valid as human ecology and the impossibility of describing one without the other so our conversation about nature implies our conversation about a human person so poor Benedict for example would have said that we're not dealing with two books of nature it's only one single book in Pope Francis will say that we're not dealing with two crises we deal with their single crisis and invite her to listen to the cry of the poor as much as we listened crime of the earth so it is the relationship with the relatedness of this in in you know integral ecology that I like to draw attention to and refer to their biblical expression of keeping as as as a basis and a form of the responsibility that we need to exercise to us all of creation and with this again want to conclude and thank you for having invited me to keynote this conversation thank you thank you so much yeah I mean it's for introducing the integral ecology concept and the need to achieve it to pursue it with responsibilities as keepers you were briefly introducing so let me call on a Governor Brown without having alerted you beforehand I'm sure you carefully the Cardinal do you have a one-minute reaction at this point yes the the fundamental point of relatedness that's what's missing as I see it speaking from the political sphere the nationalisms the collective egit isms that we see in the world today the thrust whether it's by the United States or by China or by Russia or by many of the other countries is missing the point that we are mutually vulnerable we all are subject to the plague or subject to the mistake the pain of some nuclear blunder that could easily happen or to climate change or the Kovach or to other diseases or to the scourge of poverty so what's needed today in politics is a transcendence of the low state of public affairs rhetoric and consciousness so I would hope that the integral ecology which is spoken at a theological level can somehow be translated to mundane political give-and-take which constitutes the essence Thanks thank you very much and eminent Cardinal Turkson thank you again marvelous introductions I hope you can join us for a little longer like now to turn to the three editors in Chancellor Marcelo Sanchez sorondo the Marcelo you have the floor yeah I think that this book is prophetic book I use this geological world but because anticipate times in the sense that the message of the book needs to say that we are not responsibility in our ste were filtered cabinet with with our habitat they habitat compact came to us in a and we don't know what could be this kind of reaction well we know someone of the reaction but also we don't know what could be the reaction of the animals of the wheels and all those things so the relation between the climate and the human being is absolutely and I want to remark that what is the reason that as religious the boom the majesty of the Pope the last of our cabinet are interesting this question because many people can say but this is not the subject of the majesty of the Pope but in the country in the idea of the last ball but especially Pope Francis we need to defend our habitats because he's in some sense part of our life with our life of human and we need to be together to defend this all the religious people that consider that human being are in some sense in many years of God and the abbot that is part of the life of the human being so in this question in relation to the human dignity I mean relation today to the planet we need all work together all the religions another givers of religion and we suppose this was the message also there were this meeting and also was the message of that first meeting that we have with Pope Francis here with all the Lydia be left that the Pope say this message so for this reason I think this book that also put together religious leaders to consider the problem of sour responsibility with the planet is very important and is perfectly because if for the first time I think we we put this connection between the people and the claim and the health of the people and the clients and I want to add something that is implicit in the consideration of the cabinet what is important of science in the edges and what is important to have an attorney new sign for the food because it's clear that to be steward of the creation comes from the Bible but to understand what is the situation of the planet we need facts so we need to put together science and religion faith and reason and this is our task and this is for the first time made in baseball so for this oldest reason I shall say that this book is a beginning of many other that we need to world English thank you very much q thank you very much it turned to you ramadasa professor rothman our son is a professor of atmospheric and climate science at the University of California San Diego and an academician of past he is one of the spiritus vectors for this whole book and research track which brings us together today rom you have the floor thank you uro came for the generous introduction good morning and good afternoon friends first of all the book is available in hard copy 2 in case you want to buy it the world now as we know is in the midst of a public health crises due to the pandemic the pandemic inadvertently has made us all aware of a dominant issue of our time which is social justice including racial justice social justice is also a major issue for climate change so let me give you just one example more than 50% of the climate pollution is from the richest 1 billion people the poorest 3 billion whose contribution to the pollution is barely 5% are gonna suffer the most louder to see as His Eminence Cardinal Turkson and chance and Mercer already said was prophetic about social justice for Francis said in his encyclical we are faced not with two separate crises one environmental and the other socio but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental basically environmental and social problems are inextricably linked I became aware and educated on the social justice issue because of my affiliation with path point difficulty Academy of Science beginning 15 years ago Andean brought me to work with experts like fauna Foreman and social justice and my two daughters Nara Tara and nithya who are working on providing clean cooking all of these are authors of the book our book thanks to a stellar group of authors discuss is not only good in social and environmental crisis it does a deep dive into the interconnectedness of the social environment problems the book begins with the Declaration which summarizes the problem moneyless 20 solutions I'm going to summarize the entire book in two sentences just from this declaration the first big unchecked air pollution and climate change the very fabric of life includes human health is a grave risk the solution requires a societal transformation that transformation has to enable a fundamental change in our attitude towards nature and towards each other as human beings the book proposes 12 solutions as our president yo Kim said the I let me read the twelfth solution it says promote an alliance of scientists policymakers political leaders health care providers faith and spiritual leaders communities and foundations to foster the societal transformation in fact the authors of the book on this gathering consists of such an alliance the book was almost 8 years in the making and under Pope Benedict we had the Pontifical Academy of Science organized a workshop on mountain glaciers this sin led to a historic meeting in 2014 hiragana is jointly by Pontifical Academy of Science and particular Karim a social science now under Pope Francis and that meeting was sustainable humanity sustainable nature our responsibility about a year after the publication of that book from this 2014 meeting our Academy got too interested on the health effects of climate change and in part because of numerous term is organized by w-h-o behind the leader here Maria Neera under Lancet Commission Andy Haines surfing is part of the authorship he was responsible personally but there was also one major development in climate science which linked climate change intricately because that is the fact that meteorologists were coming to the conclusion that most of the extremes we experience heat waves droughts floods fires they're because the planet was warming and these extremes over the last 20 years that cost 600,000 deaths and displays four billion people so clearly there was a compelling reason so Chancellor Marcelo a professor Dasgupta from matific Academy of social science and myself we organized this meeting in 2017 the title of that meeting was health of people health the planet our responsibility the environment speaker said that meeting of the authors of the book the papers presented essentially became chapters of the book the uniqueness of the book is that it discusses climate change on air pollution in the larger context and if it starts off at the forward and Anthropocene and the first set of chapters discuss the following topics evolution of living organisms and their dependent on the environment biodiversity and the ongoing march towards biological extinction models of economic growth linkages between human health and planetary health and so on and so forth the book them does a deep dive into the nature scale and magnitude of air pollution and health effects it talks about also food and water security the one that caught my attention is the mental health impacts so to quote the lead author Lisa Van Susteren it says the psychological impacts of global overheating will carry the biggest burden and be the most difficult to remedy imagine that mental disease so several chapters focus on vulnerable population and social justice is possible mass migration the book also gives lists of host of solutions which include all the traditional solutions decarbonisation cuts the super pollutants extracting the carbon I want to highlight here two of the most urgently needed solutions from my perspective the first they have to provide clean cooking and clean heating solutions to the poorest 3 billion people whom we have left still to rely on primitive 19th century technologies they just can't cope the climate change when it hits us soon in the developed nations in the u.s. particularly roughly 68 percent of African Americans live the 230 miles of coal-fired power plants likewise with other polluting industries we need to accelerate efforts for clean air clean soil and clean water for these disadvantaged communities they number in millions so let me I want to conclude with the last part my most favorite part written by faith leaders policymakers and healthcare professionals so I'm gonna code three Reverend Leith Anderson right humans are responsible to God for the preservation protection and thriving of all God has created including the air land water Reverend Mitch hathcock's CEO of the Evangel Network says climate change is the Creator just a moral challenge of our child generation so puts it in moral terms and Bishop Alistair Redfern he rides the potential power of mobilizing believers and faith communities to practice and support appropriate action for climate change in proper approaches to health is enormous I think this is what our community has to use going to alliance with faith leaders to get the type of public support we need the whole spirit of the Academy effort is captured in chapter 29 by our California Governor Jerry Brown who's here he writes so the power here is prophecy the power here is fake and that is what PA is more typical Academy of Science is all about so let us be about it the it is the technical the scientific the political but never let us forget our challenges transformation transformation in the profoundest way possible we agree with you gonna Brown so just in a few minutes to conclude I think of Coby 19 is the dress rehearsal for what we are likely to face with climate change you know what 10 years when we think of climate change we are thinking thought 30 40 years I want to remind you the crises is going to start in 10 years that's when the planetary warming is likely to exceed or degree and a half that's 50% amplification of the warming we have experienced so far so what it employs is the light leg of weather extremes such as heat waves droughts storms and floods well also could also increase by 50% what does that mean climate change will move into everyone's living room like what covered 19 has done to all of us it's in my living room all the time as we are learning from this dress rehearsal solutions to climate change will require global collaboration and generous sharing of scientific knowledge and technological measures across national cultural ethnic and racial borders the sort of Alliance the Pontifical Academy formed in bringing out this book will help enable such collaborations lastly just in 30 seconds I want to thank you see who were secondly for me up in sheer public health moral Health Organization me regular foundation University of Bonn and Max Max Planck Institute first not financial support today more typically Academy event and the book that resulted from it thank you you okay Thank You Rahm thank you for your speech and for your leadership our next speaker is Professor a delay me at university California San Diego he is a an epidemiologist with a medical background well you have the floor thank you thank everyone and for giving me this opportunity and I have the task of trying to summarize the 400 pages book in about five minutes so let's see if we can do that basically this background of the book is becoming its it's becoming a benchmark it's really an amazing work that has everyone has something for everyone in society I checked last night it was 103 thousand downloads and just now in a few hours after its 105,000 so it's increasing and I checked with the with the publisher and this is a record for this book because the average of downloads from environmental books from Springer nature is twenty six thousand and twenty six thousand over the life of a book while this is only now one month and it is already a hundred and five thousand so clearly we have put something that is of interest and as Chancellor Marcelo said is prophetic the book as described has all people from different backgrounds psychologists physicians health care providers and climate scientists faith leaders health sciences air pollution scientists politicians biologists and so on and so forth and that's really what makes it unique and that's why we have this interest and so many people are interested in it but the main thing that we wanted to do is have health as the focus throughout because there are many other books out there that discuss this in a way that doesn't include health so so as this figure which is kind of already summarized by Bram about the content but I wanted to put it in a visual I'm a visual person and so I I I like to do that but the central theme of the book is the human health and I put the content and the chapters and the authors because don't have time to learn to acknowledge all of illustrious authors and contributors but you can see it on the upper left corner are the titles so with the first section we begin with the things that are related to our environment the planet the ecology living organisms and species extinction and how that will impact the human health as well as the economy and wealth and how we have to take in consideration a different perspective of wealth and taking consideration the tax on the planet and how that can impact the health for the generations to come then that section goes into the climate and air pollution as the key factors that are impacting the human health in the view of the Anthropocene and the planetary health so that gives the kind of intro and the connection to the planet then we shift into air pollution as a focus in terms of its burden the mechanisms that are causing the health impact the environmental policy context as well as how we can reverse them through the policies and through the burden of the mortality reduction and then we go into a vulnerable population and the Middle East and North Africa is going to be the epicenter of the health impacts of this climate change and it has a lot of contributing factors in addition to political instability in terms of scarcity of water and and the heat and so in that same section we have an very important aspects of water scarcity means hunger and that also is related to agricultural practice and food insecurity and how that can impact the health as well as the connection between the Amazon forests and the wildfires in relation to air pollution they all linked back to human health so that gives the perspective of the different aspects that are related to human health out there then we go and get this unique perspective from physicians we're going to hear later on today from that and it's already been discussed but the physicians perspective on climate change is rather new and not included in previous books and then the most relevant today is a social justice and this is discussed in terms of the immigration and in terms of examples from low resource Latin America where these success stories of climate solutions and social justice all improving human health and it's very relevant today in the protests that are going around the world and how that also impacts and related to climate and of course another component of human health is the faith and that's where we have the faith leaders discuss how the climate and health aspect is part of the holy scripture as part of the morals and the ethics that it is a requirement and they also provide examples of how to do it so all this book has actions it's not just theory that's what's unique also about the book and those are the issues there and then we shift into the solutions and these solutions are many as you saw and upper corner but it includes mini-grids and energy alternatives using sensors and technology to try and limit the exposure of people to harmful biomass fuel and how mitigation co-benefits will help focus the health co-benefits of mitigation as well as policies and then we're going to hear later on Jeremy Ferrara about how nongovernmental organizations can take high risk interventions and then finally the we have the examples from Governor Brown and how state standards led to saving lives and led to the change at the national level by this leadership of one state the politics of engaging societies are discussed by Congressman Peters and that we need to engage new stakeholders as well as the sustainable divorce by Saks describing the context in a perspective of sustainability and finally how healthcare providers can be and must be advocates for all of this so this is giving you the sense of what the book looks like and you are welcome to go read it further I want to say that we are planning for the next steps there were discussions of what is next and that is going to be that's something that myself Fona Foreman as well as ROM are planning a virtual meeting that in November and the the the aim is that we take this book and the actions and implemented into policies these implementations leading to change in behavior and impacting the short-term and long-term health outcomes as well as using the momentum that is happening in society to make all these happen through organized actions education and grassroots efforts and to eventually change the social norm so we want this book to be a reference and a benchmark for this effort so that it doesn't stay in the shelves or as a theory but actually become alive and actionable and the initiative we named is protection of public health from climate you'll hear more about this and you will be all invited to this so in summary of the health effects that many of you are aware of but we are having an increase in heat waves almost 2,300 percent increase in deaths from heat waves around the world and almost 3.5 billion will be exposed or impacted by that the human habitat habitability is going to be compromised in many countries that people cannot be outside for most of the year the the spread of diseases because of insects and that thrive in warmer temperature and wildfires the drought that has increased almost a hundred almost a thousand percent as well as the hurricanes and flooding and seven million deaths per year attributed to indoor air pollution all these are serious aspects that we need to kind of prepare for what we learn from komova 19 is that Kobe 19 United us as a global community it is when those people who realize that we are all in this together that no one is immune and we saw there is an unprecedented level of cooperation across regions and countries and that is because it's about health it's about life and death it's not about just the environment and that's where we think people can maybe listen and change their perspective about climate change the other aspect of injustice towards vulnerable populations and here in the US we saw the tragic death of a vulnerable population representative represented by George Floyd and that created a movement against injustice united people and humans about the compassion and it feel the suffering not just for people in the US but all around the world and these are the same people who are going to breathe the polluted air we're going to suffer from the heat waves and we'll lose the most from income as a result of climate change so we a moment in history to make this difference because both the Kobe 19 and the in justices are all targets of climate change that we will you know we can impact by taking this advantage of this to focus people about the climate change is going to be much much more than Kobe 19 the injustice is not going to be just for the minority and the vulnerable but everybody will be affected and with that I close thank you thank you for this skillful synthesis of the book and literally five six minutes it was brilliant this graph has helped all of us remember how we got to the synthesis before moving on 20 you Jeffrey Sachs if you will recall that we were sitting with Rahm and well and a few others until long after midnight to identify that in the end it was 12 main conclusions of this played an instrument role in operations do you have two minutes reflection on what needs to be done from here on thank you very much and it's good to be with everybody and I hope everybody is staying well and safe the the the urgency and troubles of our planet are even much greater than we might have imagined a couple of years ago and this virus itself a reflection of human interactions with nature is a dramatic reminder of that and a very dramatic reminder of how difficult it is in our current institutional arrangement Sarkar politics and find adequate solutions we have almost 500 thousand deaths worldwide from copepod right now and in many countries including my own had to say absolutely no common spirit approach problem solving or even ideology of life that moves us in the right direction United States under very false understandings misunderstandings and moral misunderstandings hitted this virus as a case of economy versus worst versus life and we had evangelical preachers as saying that it's the duty of the old people to to die to save the economy for young people nothing less than that it's quite shocking what happens when a society falls apart which is what has happened in the United States but it's happened in Brazil it's happening in many countries around the world right now so I think the work that we have been doing together to combine basic moral discussion with basic practical science is essential and very much desperately needed because we lack even the insight right now to stay alive it's not even America first as nasty and stupid as that is it's not even America anywhere because we're falling apart so I want to thank the editors for this volume and to emphasize how much basic work we have to do even helping other faiths understand better that it's not a matter of life versus economy or climate versus economy we will have neither our nature nor ourselves if we don't understand the integral connections both in a physical sense and in a moral sense and that's why the merger of these efforts the moral guidance the philosophical and theological guidance and the scientific leadership is so essential to combine so thank you very very much and congratulations on this volume thank you let's get back into our planned program we are still good on schedule thank you to our speakers while next week the Marion IRA a Spanish physician who serves as a director of public health environment and social determinants of health it's a World Health Organization or Pontifical Academy is very much in support of whu-oh Maria you have the floor thank you very much and thanks for this and I swore to support wo we we are really very happy and I'm coming from the Vatican group he has an even stronger meaning for us he says the kind of blessing which is even more valuable I'm very happy to be with all of you and to see you healthy and still full of energy and committed to what we have in front of us which is really very very challenging I would like to congratulate all of you for this achievement resulting from this very pleasant and a strategic meeting in the in Rome I think we all remember and keep very precious souvenirs of that meeting there reaches nests of the intellectual power convened there in the good spirit and on proposing something that hopefully will have a positive impact on humanity I will like to congratulate the editor for the word but not only for for on his visual presentation putting human health at the center I think this is the most powerful argument we have that was this course very much in wrong we all agree that we use the health argument that can be a very strong argument this can be an incredible motivation to the people who want to mobilize and it's something that will keep the momentum and give very good emphasis to those who think that what we are talking here about that is just about protecting the planet of protecting environment well know is about protecting human health and I think Kobuk 19 what a shock what a earthquake that has been moving all of us it proof that we have very strong witnesses we have weaknesses in terms of how we are prepared for responding to two epidemics of infectious diseases went wrong on that but something went wrong as well in terms of access to versa again one of the things that for for health is fundamental is assisted he has proved that there are still a lot of differences among our population in equities those who are lucky that live in countries where they have free access to universal health coverage and they can be assured that they can be treated and receive the best of what our society can offer to them but in many other countries this has been again a demonstration of the incredible inequities in social and economic capacity and how many many citizens are still very very little protected by all of us and hopefully we will change that and I think the third weaknesses that the Covenant 19 has obviously demonstrated is the issue of the bad a relationship with nature with with the ecosystems with what is the sort of human health and how bad we are in terms of pollution in terms of all of those environmental determinants of health how much we are vulnerable because most of those pandemics most of them more than 60% of dinner so nautical origin in their brief we don't have a better interaction with human health health and in our ecosystems nature's health we will not get the benefits that we are now extracting on such an aggressive way from from the name so in all of that the world decided to go into a confinement that the planet decided to stop economic activities at one point more than the half of the planet question massive locked with all day they cannot make in social consequences that this is having and we have which will be in traumatic all of these work done in the name of health in the name of human fear because no politician will be able to propose any lockdown if he was not convinced that they citizens the population was behind that measure as long as a popular pressure telling us you need to do something exceptional you need to do something dramatic and you need to even if he said the price of analyzing the economy so he said it's an incredible lesson and he tell us something that we knew but probably we were not understanding enough that when people feel vulnerable when they feel that their health is at risk they can really move very strong way so what now everybody we need to take our citizens out of this terrible situation we need to ensure that that will be a recovery yeah healthy and green recovery if possible we need to take advantage of what they did they the people when during their confinement what they saw in terms of clean air and some blue sky in terms of clean water in the cities less noise the city able to do for you to circulate and then be the center of the city the humans again they saw that and they loved it don't nobody want attended they log down of course but they did there were some games of wedding would be the future if you do the things right and if you have access to clean energy and do you reduce your consumption and you reduce traffic you could see a lot of benefit and I more than anything we don't want to go back to the pollution levels that we were before that the question how it's hard to it because the last thing that population needs that our citizens need international global citizens in our societies need is yet bad news again so you are still trying to recover from a terrible dramatic health crisis political crisis and economic crisis and social crisis and be prepared because this is nothing compared i'ma change and evolution and all of these terrible crises that are coming will be much more romantic that inchoate 19 so we need to use we have the responsibility to use a narrative that will be very positive with very engaging will be very inspiring in terms of telling telling the citizens we are taking you out of this crisis we will be together go to our recovery and then a healthy and we will cover and at the same time this will be the best way to protect your health so they did the language than ever that we need to use now for climate change is saying if you want to reduce health we want to make sure that we protect health we will promote health and will make you less vulnerable the best way to do it one of the ways to do it will be tackled a process of climate change because the causes of climate change will be heritable for human health for the reasons we saw this morning for all of those very strong arguments for which we have an incredible amount of scientific evidence the moment economy is trying to recover we saw already the levels of pollution going up and that's why it wo me just have three seconds to introduce we call it a manifesto manifesto for our healthy green recovery where we are proposing six prescriptions health prescriptions the first time prescription is about we cover you relationship with nature make sure that you you protect nature because that will be your first meeting wall to protect your health make sure that you have a better interaction with your ecosystems and with nature that is the one that will be the main source of second provide basic services to your population access to save water and energy and then the basic services other ways there is no pandemic epidemic outbreak that will be protected from because if you don't have that the basic services you will be extremely vulnerable for third number three will be make sure that you use other energies make sure that you use clean energy stand back the fossil fuels to the place where they should be and make sure that you stop and your country top of this horrible pollution that is responsible for seven million deaths every year for sustainable food systems from the beginning to the end 5 liable cities places where we can work where we can breathe clean air where we can have a sustainable public transport system and six stop paying subsidies for fossil fuels this is a very political thing but WTO has very openly endorse that stop subsidizing fossil fuels that are killing us and with that and again congratulating all of you and thanking you for this opportunity to present here over to you thank you very much thank you very much Maria these six points are pretty much in integral ecology as introduced by the Cardinal earlier our next speaker is Sir Jeremy Farrar the director of Wellcome Trust he was previously a professor of Tropical Medicine at University of Oxford Jeremy you have the floor thanks very much and it's a great pleasure to be back with you again it seems a long time ago that we were together at the Vatican and the last few months have been very difficult for everybody in the world and pay tribute to the role of wh o Bria in what whi was done in this and tried to bring the world together despite a lot of great tensions but I'm sure I speak for everybody in offering you all of the support from all of us on this line and beyond in very difficult times and how the world has changed over the last few months who who would have thought even in November and December of last year that the world would go through already now six months of a quite remarkable truly unprecedented in anybody's living life time of such something that has affected the whole world within about a hundred and twenty days of the emergence of a new issue and we have a very long way to go yet I'm speaking now from an infectious disease background this infection is now with us to stay it is not suddenly going to come to an end this is not SARS one this is starts to and science too is a very different infection and will not be disappearing any time soon and of course as others have said and it's difficult to not pull out lessons from the current crisis because I think some of them are very relevant to the issue of the climate change that we face during the 21st century at the heart of the Kovach pandemic has been a changing relationship between mankind and and the planet in this case with ecology changing environments changing relationships between humans and animals changing patterns of behavior of those animals and of course mass urbanization and connectivity but also of an inequality as well said earlier yes we are have been all in this together and there have been some positive signs of people working together around the world and as I say pay tribute to the WTO in trying to bring us together but the truth is this doesn't affect everybody equally it does affect marginalized people it does affect people in informal camps it does affect people of different ethnic groups differently and it doesn't affect everyone equally as no crisis ever does and the most vulnerable and the most marginalized in society have been the most affected and that will be true of the crisis that we're likely to face in the 21st century the way I coming from an emerging infectious disease background in my own professional career I've always fade frame these in four overlapping circles which I think are also very relevant directly analogous to the ones we face with climate change in the first circle at the middle is the direct health impacts of the infection or indeed of climate change of Kovach 19 or climate change the next circle is the indirect consequences not directly related to the infection but the fact that with the pandemic you cannot access normal healthcare you cannot get access to maternal child health vaccinations tuberculosis control or indeed cancer therapy or diabetic therapy so there is a very very significant impact on the rest of health as there will be with climate change the third one though in some ways it's the most troubling and Jeff Sachs mentioned this in some ways but just to build further on that and that is the impact on society as a whole yes on economies and on the generation of wealth and the sharing of that wealth but also trust between the governed and the governing when societies are put under this level of stress there are questions raised between the way that countries are governed the way that societies has respect for and is willing to follow the governments of the day it also raises the fault lines that are existing in society anyway the fragmented societies lid is lifted on them and the tensions which we often do cover up and don't wish to talk about are exposed in ways that they wouldn't otherwise necessarily be and of course the inequalities of the impact so that crisis breeds fear and it then feeds into politics and the fourth circle is those international relations and in national politics and some of the language of the last six months of calling it this virus or that virus putting one country before another and the rising concerns of vaccine nationalism where one country may put its own citizens first above all else and not be willing to share what is a global public good I think is of real concern as well as the pressure on international agencies including the whu-oh as a results of the geopolitics of our time and climate change and health will have similar impacts on climate change in health I think for me the strongest elements of this book and most critical of all was that we have as I said at the Vatican often portray climate change is something which will happen gradually over the coming decades I think the key message of this book is that actually it's here now it is not something to talk about in the decades time or two decades time because there has to be the urgency of now as we see whether it be through covert and the emergence of new infections or whether it be on the direct impacts of trauma itself and that is going to need the whole of society and as we come through kovat and we start to think about how we're going to deal with the greatest challenge of the 21st century which is the one we're discussing today as we come out of the Cova crisis we will face a choice as humanity has always faced two choices when it comes out of such crises and the choices will be whether we revert to a more polarized world of choices between this or that polarized world or we and we retreat to nationalism and the insularity and look after ourselves and look after people that look like ourselves or are we going to take a different path are we going to move to a more multilateral world where actually the common public good and the protection of all of us wherever we live and whatever our income is at the heart of the of the future and we will face such a choice and with the geopolitics and tensions at the moment and exaggerated through the covert crisis at the moment I would be very concerned that we may choose the more nationalistic approach as we did at one point in the 20th century and that clearly led on to crisis just a few years later in the middle of the 20th century and our generation and all of those around at the moment will be leaders in making deciding which of those choices we face and so the lessons for me of kovat is almost a harbinger of what is going to come with climate change and we will face those choices and this book is I think an attempt to put out there that a it's not going to wait ten years and that be if we don't work on this together with a sense of common purpose and common good then we will go back to a more nationalistic world which i think would be very dangerous so if we learn those lessons I think the other thing that I would pick up from the book and watch it was such a pleasure to be part of it's that we have to put research at the heart of it because actually research in whichever way you define it from social science through to biomedical and everything engineering and everything else is going to be part of the solution but we must make that research relevant and available and accessible to all the communities in the world not just those that can afford to pay for it and finally to finish I think the book also offers some solutions and offers a sense of hope and at the moment with the current crisis and the crisis that we're likely to have to face in 21st century that message of hope I think is crucially important back to you thank you very much very much for being on a message of hope and emphasizing the choices before us which we definitely as scientists can pursue and for raising the issue of inequality and poverty inequality of the first crisis and of climate change I turn now to dr. Arum Ania Guarneri who specializes in cardiovascular diseases as she is a specialist in integrative medicine I mean here you have the floor thank you and thank you for the opportunity to be here and to all the editors Monsignor Serrano and of course our beloved Pope Francis who I truly believe is a beacon of light during what feels to me like a time of darkness I never thought as a cardiologist I would be presenting to such an esteemed group about a next essential crisis as it relates to the healthcare system now of course climate change ozone depletion and everything that discusses from biodiversity to air and water pollution toxins persistent organic pollutants is in my exam room every day as a cardiovascular specialist and dr. Neeraj just talked about air pollution claiming 7 million lives many of that being through cardiovascular and respiratory illness I live in a very affluent area of La Jolla and even in this affluent area we are seeing diseases that in medical school I never thought I would see such as chikungunya West Nile virus and the likes all of which are the result of the tropics moving north as we all well know I believe that dr. Van Susteren discussion on the mental impacts of climate change are critically important even with COBIT 19 right now what I am seeing in my practice is the request for antidepressants sleeping pills and the like as well as the abuse of substances like alcohol and food in order to comfort people's anxiety and fear indigenous communities a long time ago taught us about the web of life the relationship between the individual communities and our ecological health and it's already been said that human health and environmental policies are not two separate issues 90% of health is not accounted for by what happens in hospitals it's not about hospitals it's about social and environmental factors and at least in the United States I hope that we awakening to the limitations of our current biomedical approach and this is the focus we've taken in our section of the book Jamie Harbor and I to talk about how this biomedical is not serving us anymore and that how we need to move toward a more integrative holistic model that really focuses on the root cause of health challenges and looks at all the global traditions in this model you truly shift our focus if you might from siloed medicine ill to the pill thinking treating people after they get sick to a holistic model of health that embraces who we are in our social environments and the intimate relationship between people and planets in short as clinicians we have to respect and recognize that what we do to the planet we certainly do to ourselves the global burden of chronic disease has precipitated a financial crisis in the healthcare sector and this is very visible right now in the United States Cobin 19 has overwhelmed some of our best health care systems New York City known for some of the greatest health care in the world revealed its fragility its inability to function more importantly on some levels covin 19 woke us up and highlighted health care disparities I really believe that this mechanistic model of health care is on the brink of collapse and I think we are at a full-blown opportunity so look at how we can not only shift our thinking around climate change but around our entire health care model the healthcare sector we have to remember and we discussed this has a sizable carbon footprint we don't often think about that but the UK for example National Health Service says that approximately 35% of all public sector emissions comes from health care and of that 21% is a pharmaceutical industry so if we have a health care system that focuses on just treating disease after it occurs we just keep feeding this pharmaceutical system which in turn continues to produce greenhouse gas emissions and to lead to illness and we're not focusing on health we've already discussed health care just charities and they are prevalent across the globe whether it's maternity maternal mortality infant mortality the poorest communities are suffering and I would go as far as to say that inequality and disparities are probably the largest influence we have today on the health of individuals communities and the planet I believe that Cova 19 has taught us that our actions or our in actions are truly going to determine future human existence and I hope when this question gets called to the table that we're answering it from a global and not a nationalistic perspective preventing the effects of climate change and the mex pandemic go hand in hand the more vulnerable a population is the more illah population is the more vulnerable it is to diseases such as Koba 19 so the preparation for pandemics is about keeping people healthy at baseline something which in the United States I'm sorry to say we've been unable to do and that's across the world as well as a global burden of disease tells us individuals with chronic diseases such as diabetes hypertension low-income communities people of color are disproportionately affected by Koba 19 as they are disproportionately affected by climate change we are less healthy at a huge huge cost so as a physician I began to think about what is a new model of healthcare potentially look like and how can we align ourselves and ground ourselves in climate justice principles and I truly believe that the answer really lies on what the World Health Organization is calling for a model of health care that focuses on traditional medicine strategies a model of health care that focuses on disease prevention and health creation as opposed to treating diseases after they occur I really believe we need to catalyze a global shift to a plant-based diets and that we read to retrain our entire healthcare force we cannot keep teaching clinicians ill to the pill medicine we need a whole system's approach that focuses on health creation we need to encourage every Hospital across the globe to adapt climate neutrality goals and principles or adopt the 2020 health care global challenge we need to take clinicians and organizations and encourage them to participate in movements like the Medical Society consortium on climate in health and clinicians need to stand behind politics spiritual leaders all behind equitable access to green spaces advocate for affordable public transportation restructure communities as you've heard from dr. narrow for walking for biking practice good purchasing models the job zero wastes principles as we've done in small communities in India and we need to just phase out things that are bad for our health things styrofoam single-use plastics and so on so the current crisis is teaching us that we need to collaborate if we become siloed we will not be successful we need to collaborate scientifically as global citizens and we need to collaborate in communities actually we need to take healthcare out of hospitals and bring it into communities and look at our entire health Commons and we must harness our collective wisdom I believe that we are at a great time of change and we have a great opportunity with crisis comes opportunity and the opportunity for us certainly here in the United States is to change the way we practice and do healthcare and the opportunity for the world is to wake up and to bend the curve and health is the common denominator kovin 19 has taught us that it doesn't matter how much money you have in your bank account you are vulnerable you're a couple of years ago when Ebola hit I heard people in La Jolla say that's not about that's about Africa well kovin 19 is teaching us that this is all about us and we are all part of the web of life so thank you for the opportunity to represent clinicians and talk about how climate change is right here in our waiting rooms thank you thank you very much last not least in our speaker series before our discussion session I call on dr. Conrado I stole his policy leader from Argentina neurologist dr. Conrado you have the floor good morning from Buenos Aires from Argentina and thank you to president from Browns most senior RAM for the invitation to share the perspective from Latin America we have discussed a lot about social justice already and that has all to do with what happens and how pandemics affect Latin America let me give you a brief view of what the common 19mm ik is now here since our numbers are driving the whole numbers in the world those hundred thousand new infected people per day are mostly from here India and Russia also but Mexico Brazil Peru are contributing with many in Brazil the problem with 1 million people now effective and almost 50,000 deaths the problem as you know of a lack of leadership actually the favelas which are slums where you have 13 million people that cannot respect distance that cannot avoid being concentrated that cannot avoid close contact the crucial things to avoid contagiousness and they also have a lot of mining and deforestation which moves the virus from big series three interior of Brazil in in Peru the problem is one out of two homes have a fridge and one out of three homes have running water so despite macroeconomics look good that the people are really under poverty and now you can see that with the rounding numbers they are showing Ecuador one city why yes why yes has five times the number of days of the normal time week that's consistent with a war or famine so only surpassed by Bergamo in Italy that had six time to death and Chile our neighbor they are pretty different actually in Latin America in many aspects however they have large numbers of people affected infected and dead and president Vieira said we failed to isolate those infected and we failed to track the contacts so what happened in Argentina in Argentina we do very low testing and testing is crucial so we're really the number of people that are contained infected that we see is probably five ten times less and we actually have the same for the dead we are only counting those with a positive test so probably those numbers don't reflect on the problem ease low testing the lowest for the region we do five thousand tests per million when Chile is doing forty thousand tests per million isolation the longer is good it was started early in Latin America we had a warning a few weeks in advance compared to the northern hemisphere and our lockdown was on March 19th however now we are going into the longest quarantine in the world because the other things you should do to control the pandemic were not done number one the testing the mask was proposed by independent physician but not the ones that were advising the government so the masks came a little late and I know that they have a major effect and these all reflects that we do not have the logistics in place our health system is not saturated yet it's a 50 percent but we don't have the logistics to organize what had to be done to control the pandemic and that's why we are increasing the number of infected people every day and we don't reach the peak even though we are on day 19 of the lockdown and I want to remind you that Wuhan did it in 76 days so one of the questions that were sent is how should we prepare for the health crisis related to climate in 2030 what do we learn one thing we learn is that what he brings we all get wet and we are all in this together as was said before however a pandemic exacerbates the vulnerability of societies like ours and we do have a co pandemic because now we have covered 19 and remember that a 60 year old person in Latin America is biologically equivalent to a 75 or 80 year old person in the northern hemisphere because the load the burden of disease of non communicable diseases diabetes hypertension obesity are much much higher that's why 85% of all vastra disease occurs in emerging regions so the cop endemic on covered 19 and vascular disease is making that the toll in the southern hemisphere especially in emerging regions is much higher than the northern hemisphere now so for the future and thinking of climate change that the decisions the plans the strategies should not be done country by country we should do something together the idea the spirit of this book something together for all countries to follow like guidelines that are used to treat diseases based on evidence-based medicine we should do the same thing for this and then each country will adapt those guidelines of worldwide guidelines to the possibilities that the country has I think that could be the best idea another question was what are the lessons of corvid that the main lesson I remember that Italian man for liberty who was asked what would you do if this started again all over again well I will obey I will I will do what they told me to do and what we should plan in advance we have to plan in advance but planning in advance in an emerging country or region is very difficult because you can plan in advance and the plan be successful when you have a stable government when you have strong institutions when you have low poverty when you have a growing economy when you have low corruption and unfortunately those are not our strengths here but I hope could be private public partnership that hasn't been explored for issues like this is not an explore for copy 19 now are independent efforts but we should try and consider private public partnerships and again the lesson of copy 19 is we all depend on each other it was clear with the masks if I wear a mask I am sick I am NOT disseminating the virus to others if I decarbonize I am taking care of air pollution and decreasing air pollution and the most important lesson for Latin America for emerging regions is we have to strengthen our health system I think in some countries we cannot even call it a system they are very weak and we are seeing that now the mortality rates are higher than in the northern hemisphere because our icy use and the training of our physicians is not adequate in general the basics for Latin America and our countries is that we don't act like a unit we cannot be considered as a unit we are more than 20 countries in Latin America but the ideologies the governments are very different Venezuela Brazil Qi liquid or Argentina very different ideologies ideologies difficult to see them acting as a unit difficult sometimes to have one strategy in one country sometimes even that is difficult to achieve and in most Chile may be an exception uy maybe but in most climate change is not an issue yet so there is a reason why because poverty so is so rampant mentioned before that it cannibalizes the rest of the problems so we don't have the time or the capacity to look at that an example is the miracle sewer Mercosur is the union of Brazil Argentina Paraguay a new white and he's been having conversations with the European Union for trading but those conversations ended in 2019 after 20 years of negotiations it took us 20 years to get together with others that could help us and the problem is that the agreement barely acknowledges climate change in fact many of the trade arrangements are contrary to climate change I will not help it but we need the money so we don't have the strength to to do what we should do in that sense so there was a reason last week there was an article in England Journal of Medicine by an independent group of particulate matter reviewers that were questioning the epi' standards of 12th micrograms per cubic meter of 2.5 particles as the level to avoid disease so I'm mentioning these as the idea of all working together in the United States you have this independent group saying that there is clear evidence that 12 micrograms is wrong it should be 8 to 10 maybe or even low if you want to protect the general population and the groups at risks especially so again the message is if you are not together nothing is going to happen especially in our regions we can in general not not to listen we know we all know this TED talk by Bill Gates five years ago warning about a pandemic President Obama also said something like that and we didn't listen those thoughts were listen more now during the pandemic than when they were given a long time ago phone I remember emphasizes in the book that injustice is not misfortune is a political act so my hope is that I have confidence in that this book will will raise awareness on the important problem of climate change and health of the people and maybe in the midst of this pandemic even more so thank you thank you very much dr. Conrado I stole for this important passionate plea my colleagues we have scheduled up to 30 minutes of discussion time there were a few people who have volunteered himself to take the floor during discussion time and I would like to call on them in the in a moment before I do that I would like to be particularly encouraging so the basic scientists the academics who are doing science basic science that could help us move forward with an agenda of planetary Harris and heresy people I believe that basic science in Harris and in public health and basic science related to climate and ecology need to move closer together being an Academy colleagues Academy of Science forgive me that I want to give the debate at the beginning this twist towards science and then come back to the policy actions we got excellent suggestions from many of our speakers on policy actions needed but also ask ourselves was what science action can we contribute I would like to call in a moment on Andy Haines who had volunteered himself the talk about a new initiative in our field may I encourage us you professor other Jonah's to take the floor in a moment and maybe others if you want to speak I have a few people on the speaker's list write your name simply in the commentary in the so called chat box then I see you and we'll give you the floor keep your interventions breathe so Andy which it takes a floor oh thank you very much and thanks again for giving me the opportunity to be involved in this landmark folk I think to me represents a book very much for the Apple team and you know we have grown up in the Holocene epoch the Holocene epoch of 11 a half thousand years when humanity transformed from being subsistence farmers agriculturists and now urban dwellers and we still think like Coliseum dwellers I think and yet we're moving in we're now in this new epoch as we've heard which poses completely different challenges to the past and one of the great challenges of course is how to ensure the equitable health of the world's population in the within these finite planetary boundaries I think we also now understand that we can't just talk about threats and catastrophes that doesn't necessarily motivate people we need to develop solutions and I think as you send your introduction those solutions cannot come from a single discipline they can't come from science alone so in reframing science and health for the Anthropy we need to step away from our traditional narrow perspectives respecting different disciplinary different faith perspectives and work together towards common solutions I think we've got an opportunity as well as a threat from COBIT so we can build back better from COBIT as some earlier speakers have said we do have this brief opportunity to implement zero-carbon and other more sustainable policies and we also see how a range of professions including the health professions are becoming mobilized on a global scale so unprecedented step the representatives of 40 million in health professionals wrote to the heads of governments of the g20 nations and asked them to ensure that when we emerged from Kobe was on a low-carbon and sustainable trajectory whether those heads of state listened to that I don't know but it's very important that the health professionals were standing together and making that statement in a way I don't think they would have done even a few years ago and that's thanks to w-h-o and some of the other leaders of the health professions so we need to build on this new insights this transdisciplinary collaboration in order to create solutions and very briefly I just wanted to mention this new initiative this new commission that we hope to launch over coming months with the support of the world from trust building on some of the work we did for the planetary health Commission a few years ago and what this commission is going to do is very much to focus on solutions learning from each other and it isn't just about theoretical solutions it's also about people implementing new ways of doing things around the world decarbonizing energy systems moving towards more sustainable food systems increased plant food diets less dependence on animal products sustainable cities which can are both more resilient to environmental change but also have lower environmental footprints transport systems which promote active travel and reduce air pollution and in health care systems which as we've already heard do not contribute to ill health but reduce their environmental footprint of provide more care in the community and depend less on high-tech hospital care where that's not appropriate so the idea of this initiative is very much to harness the insights and the understanding from a range of different disciplines populations as indigenous communities around the world to try to tap their best thinking about potential solutions that will help us on a pathway through the Anthropocene that will sustain the health of humanity within these planetary boundaries so our task now is to ensure that this book is really a catalyst for transformative change and I think we all have role to play in that thank you very much well thank you very much let turn to two colleagues who had a signal early before the meeting actually that they would like to speak congressman Scott Peters who we're at the conference in the Vatican and please take the floor and tell us what should next happen in in the domain we are addressing here well thank you very much such a pleasure and honor to be part of this whole project and I'm just humbled to be in the company of such great scientists motivated for such good things two observations one is we're trying to use the pandemic to explain that the warning about climate change is real and what we saw in the pandemic was scientist warning that this would happen and indeed it did happen that it was did not respect international boundaries was something that happened worldwide and we also learned that it would have been much cheaper to deal with it upfront than waiting to deal with it in reaction those are all lessons that we can apply to climate change and to sort of to get policymakers to take it more seriously now in the midst of all these crises that take up our attention in the moment second I would just offer a little bit of optimism about the country in the United States we're in a middle of a political crisis as well as health crisis and in that economic crisis but I think across the board the public has been expressing their concern about climate change at the ballot box but the first time in 2018 since the conference we saw that voters in Republican districts were expressing and concern about this it's somewhat generational but it's also been picked up by members of Congress and even the most skeptical and recalcitrant folks have tried to pick up some portfolio about climate so I think that we have a lot of work to do but I think there is progress and I would just say that the policy has to be driven by science and I hope as you see policy developed it could be part of a feedback loop about what works best and what is what fundamentally has to happen because we'll need your you're good and your encouragement along the way but again congratulations to everyone thank you very much for including me dr. Ron and Governor Brown very good to see you both and I will yield back with great thanks thank you so much encouraging that you continue to engage with us and please do so also in the future was a Pontifical Academy of Science that in fields of science policy and environmental and people sustainability let me call on turbid Seca please thank you likewise I'm very pleased to be here and to be part of this book we've heard that that climate and health are the greatest moral challenge we know also the climate represents the greatest market failure in the history of the world and we should know that the failure to solve climate change will represent the biggest risk to social justice especially if we fail to solve climate change in time speed must become one of our newest metrics the need for speed we understand that we have between zero and ten years before the feedback systems in the climate takeover climate and the earth will warm itself we'll start passing tipping points that lead to irreparable harm that we will never recover from now we know that we can move fast with the super pollutants that's the topic of the chapter I did with some Ramanathan and others and the super pollutants which congressman Peters also focuses on with his legislation are the air pollutants black carbon tropospheric ozone methane plus the HFC refrigerants and we know that we have the technology and often the legal systems that will allow us to reduce these pollutants fast and if we do that we can cut the rate of global warming in half and the rate of Arctic warming which is critical by two-thirds and we've read about the Siberian heatwave right now very frightening to see what's going on in that part of the world so the super pollutants we can think about as the fastest runners in a relay race they can keep us in this race until we get to carbon neutrality at 2050 and listening to the presentations today and having read pieces of the book what the book is doing I think it's helping us learn how to talk about climate in a much more effective way to help make this into a kitchen table issue that families can sit around the table and talk about and understand they can understand the health risks and the health risks are leading us to the climate risk and the health risks with climate and this is leading to a deeper understanding and two feelings that accelerate and build our intensity the kind of intensity that we need to act that's ultimately what this book is doing it's inspiring us to act and giving us a roadmap in many cases as well so the inspiration to actives in politics as congressman Peter mentioned in commerce in our own behavior and it's helping us strengthen our core morality something that we need to sustain the action to ultimately solve the climate climate crisis thank you thank you very much professor others or not may I call on you for a moment we can of course decline my request but you are into basic science antibiotics give us perspective from from your side if you unmute yourself we are eager to listen to you afternoon to to decline yourself you are the boss thanks for inviting me it was really very happy to hear some Bible here in the beginning not only science not only human human health and human existing also God came enable so different mr. I I'm a scientist but I don't change even in the Bible they were big stones and show you all headed about that head to to to Fleck he's on the enemies and was found at the end of day top of a mountain couldn't even go down and still the water will disappear of the well down anyway so this I wanted to say directly or indirectly they Soames and changes in climate changes have been I don't know if magnitude that is now I have nothing to compare to now there are lots of measurements and some of them are very convincing but it's not my my field so I want to escape climate change and separate it from a very important issue which is keeping our a weight clean and clean I mean clean for all points of view not only dirt off but also a stopping polluting and for this point of view I have very little to say and this is the resistance to antibiotics so antibiotics when they came into use in the middle of last century they made a revolution people died before this at the age of 50 50 60 was considered very old and people died from simple infections let's just talk about one person mo Chou he died 36 years old from an infection and many others Shoebill CAFTA and many many many many others I'm not going to say all the names now where antibiotics came they they could get rid of infections and infections some of them are very very powerful now everybody talks about coffee 19 Tory 19 will disappear a infections we unfortunately stay a viruses are smaller than their name bacteria bacteria cause infections there are not smaller and in my opinion much more clever but they don't they don't last very long where is they they bacteria the infectious the pathogens they exist from hundreds of heroes and if you just wanted to hear what the hell recently this is the biggest problem that we have now in in medicine even bigger than cancer diseases like this because at least fair of the people that have concept that are most realized for concern at end iPhone and infection disease which is simple like pneumonia and in the United States there were 13 million deaths in the last three years from in fact diseases in Europe which it yields 50 33,000 yes and I don't talk about long long diseases and the reason is that this very powerful materials the antibiotics it became much less useful because the bacteria developed resistance to them and I'm sure we all know about it I don't have to tell you that resistance is difficult it's a big problem and so on but from the scientific point of view I may I'm afraid Nick thing we it won't be so simple to to get rid of timeout to overcome I'm doing on my best to throw it that's my biggest thing so tribution to science now but companies do nothing nothing at all oh I don't want to say nothing at all very little because because there will be resistance and because they they developing time is very long and they have to attract investors that want to say fast income so this is a problem and from the from the point of view of pollution most of the antibiotics that are being used in our days and sometimes overuse but I don't I don't want to blame anybody let's say babe use most of them a contain a little piece a little cone that is not degradable not biodegradable so even if there is not other overuse just taking their antibiotics s as they its prescribed and even recovering the paste make the co day component that was not biodegradable but it was nothing and I just believe he's coming out to the sewage and because it's not biodegradable it goes with the sewage and because so slowly most of the purification systems don't see them not catch them so they go back to the irrigation system and then we get them back when we eat they fought all day on the cows it's the glass and we get the milk so we get back these pieces to us but not only to us the way is much more polluted so this is a problem that they disturbs at least me I hope at least I hope many more so there will be more activity around it but there's experts we are trying to do to produce antibiotics the kind of specific about this but I want to tell you that the World Health Association the European community the American government and consequently a Japanese I think also the German as a government but the truth is part of the European community and of the g20 they all came out now is a lot of money or what they call a lot of money maybe not enough for research on antibiotics but so far these governments in these big organizations could not convince the companies and I think that we are we are at the edge here this is my biggest problem and thank you for telling it letting me thank you so much colleagues we have about eight minutes left there are six people who have mentioned that they could speak sorry no no don't it was great to listen to you Ada it was great to listen to you so I ask you to speak in sound bites and look for the next opportunity when we meet again in Casina Pio IV. Mohamed Hassan we need a perspective from Africa and science unmute yourself your microphone is muted while you're looking for it Vanderlei Bagnato Hello can you hear me now? good afternoon Joachim and thank you very much you wanted me to say something about the reflections from the from the from the African side on these issues as we all know Africa is the continent with the least capacity to adapt to climate change to combat air pollution and diseases but at the same time Africa has the least capacity in science technology and innovation that it badly needs to address problems related to these issues but as we all know if you want to build capacities to a level that will enable you to address and solve problems you need to invest in in science technology and innovation and this is really the core of the problems because there is very little money that African countries spend in research and development and one can ask whether these countries are poor and they can't find the money to do that but this is not altogether true because if you look at government expenditure in all sectors and you try to see how African governments spend their money you find a very disturbing picture and this is something recent that I have been looking at Africa spends a lot of money in the military and in the security as a percentage of GDP as a percentage of GDP if you look at the investment in the military across the entire world you will find that the top 15 countries I'm talking about expenditure as a percentage of GDP the top 15 countries are developing countries and among these 15 countries eight of them are in Africa and what really disturbed us most here in Sudan is that the top of the list is my country Sudan and that was the data two years ago so when we presented this data to the government they were absolutely astonished and shocked so fortunately just a few months ago the government decided to substantially reduce its expenditure in the military and to invest more in health and in education so I think one would like to see this being applied across the continent but it is an issue that I think all of us should really bring to the notice of governments everywhere we look at that the last problem I think we are faced with at the moment is the impact of Covid-19 on quality education as whether we like it or not Covid-19 is going to transform the way education is carried out or is delivered this is really going to be a complete transformation and it is going to be based on using online platforms using information technologies digitization and so on and for this Africa really needs to builds these capacities in communication and in digitization technologies to enable it to address these issues of education otherwise I need to stop you here thank you very much, it's difficult to ask scientists to talk in sound bites I know I have Vanderlei you have fascinating science can you do a sound bite? well first of all I want to congratulate to the Academy to again post itself as a one of the important players on this issue of climate change and health care in general and I was in this meeting as an observer and I I think we talked that we had a huge problem of climate change that we are sure now we have another huge problem that we knew existed but we were not paying attention which are the microbiological control they both very important I believe it that this pandemic will pass but I'm not sure that we will be able to control the climate change problem so this is even a big issue in Brazil von Brown this pandemic as I already was putting the numbers I'm not going to repeat for the lack of time one thing is positive science is responding very well we are producing equipments that we never thought we were able to, we are producing medication that we never thought we would be able to and of course people say well in Brazil is a big problem everywhere is a big problem nobody was prepared for this situation right and the science is responding well my laboratory did not stop we are fully developing techniques for treating people with respiratory disease as a consequence or as a cause of the Covid and things are going well we are doing many devices in controlling microbiological in the environment to avoid infection many companies are involved in the project we have now approved of 26 companies that are producing things that are necessary for helping with the situation so to be brief I I think our colleague from Argentina Conrado is right Latin America has some political problems but the science in Latin America is responding very well trying to do everything we can to help this traumatic situation and again I want to congratulate for this piece of reference on climate change and I'm sure that all the libraries and everybody will help to defuse the large quantity of information we have there thank you very much thank you thank you Helena Valez thank thank very quickly for my end it's not about science but I'm just gonna speak. Im just going to again congratulate you and offer a platform which is the climate and clean air coalition where we have now 70 countries involved and they would love to hear from you because we are a science-based coalition trying to address the issue of speed as Durwood mentioned to address the super pollutants the short-lived Climate Pollutants but in a very integrated way so number one we want to offer this platform and see how the findings and the 12 solutions can reach the decision makers and the second point I wanted to mention is what I also think could be added maybe for a next iteration of this is looking at how we value this building back better and to achieve this not only based on economic growth because I think it's an issue that is too little spoken about and it's not about science only obviously but it's very much a value a value proposition that many people in between South and North and also within individual countries it not is not sufficiently worked upon. On the last third point I wanted to pick up on Africa because we are right now working on a regional integrated assessment on air pollution for Africa and I would like to offer any of the authors in this book if you're interested to join this very big effort to share with more African scientists how this type of reflection could be brought like from a bottom-up perspective in Africa so those three points and I really look forward to to see what we can do with this and how we can get the speed and finance flowing to this kind of urgency issues together so thank you thank you Fonna Forman - speak up, your too low voice louder there we go is it okay okay as much of a soundbite as I can as we talk about mobilizing urgent solutions right now and you know the health narrative is essential to that to creating kitchen-table conversations as durwood said we also need to be thinking about adaptation urgently in the meantime so you know there's a you know the impacts on the poor are part of an injustice not a misfortune and so part of our global responsibility is to mobilize resources as quickly as we can to help the bottom of the deck so solutions are not just top down right now they need to be mobilized from the bottom up and hopefully this book can play a role in communicating that thank you wonderful thank you Richard Miller and if not there I ask Peter Peter Raven and thereafter I will ask you Ram to say a few closing words before I close close Peter um basically I wanted to state that background indicates that only the kind of love charity and social justice Pope Francis preaches so effectively will allow any of this to happen we live in a world where we're destroying our ecosystems and driving our species to extinction that are making those ecosystems function the rich countries of the world contain are using basically three to four times what they produce and global footprint network points out very clearly the differences between nations in this respect and demonstrates very little real desire or willingness to share in people in the world control as much wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest people in the world well 1 billion people are living deprived lives of hunger overcoming that in some way making the rich nations care instead of sweeping wealth out of all the poorer ones in a finite world again the see global footprint Network is the only thing that will allow us to survive over the long run Pope Francis is exactly right we don't have enough love charity and appreciation for one another to make any of this work it can never work in individual countries or by individuals our historical selfishness will overcome it please find it in your hearts to spread the gospel of Pope Francis and figure out broader ways to bring nations together for the solution of these incredibly important problems thank you Ram our meeting would you like to take the floor before I close Ram thank you okay it's honor to add to what has been said already I'm going to be working with my colleagues in the Pontifical Academy of Science particularly our president Joachim and Marcelo and where do we go next how can the Pontifical Academy help in this existential threat so if you have any ideas of what you would like to see of what you would like to discuss and what how we can help this global issue please feel free to email me and share with me with your ideas I want to thank Marcelo and Joachim for putting on this fantastic event thank you thank you let me close with three points a lot more needs to be done my first point is science in health and climate and ecology science need to move closer together on the way forward that's what we as scientists can do my second point is this is the moment to see the poor as Pope Francis says is the moment to see the poor the moment defined from the climate threat and from the pandemic threat and from the ecology threats so it's not generalities but to focus on the poor and on inequality which needs to move us forward in the policy agenda I'm very pleased that you congressman Peters are still with us here and I know that this is also in line with your thinking and it was emphasized by Cardinal Turkson the moment we see the poor and the inequality issues third and last cooperation our cooperation has to be global transnational not national not national transnational the conclusion which you Ram read at the outset in your speech the conclusion number 12 of our Commandments from that book was to promote an alliance with society that brings together scientists policymakers healthcare providers faith and spiritual leaders communities and foundations to fosters a societal transformation necessary to achieve our goals in the spirit of Pope Francis' encyclical laudato si' so the Alliance building which we as scientists need to be part of maybe we can also be drivers of it I would like to close by thanking His Eminence Cardinal Peter Turkson who kicked us off on integral ecology and which was the red thread running through our dialogue today In ending I would like to ask you Marcelo if you would like to have a closing thought Marcelo you will close this meeting I want to thank all the people who participated very actively and a very wisdom and intelligent contributions and God bless you and your work just to follow these ideas that are very essential for the safe of the people work thank you very much thank you President and also for your chairmanship that was very good thank you all
