 okay good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us today for the research against coded 19 call to action webinar my name is Jason I am the Associate Director of the nanoscience initiative and the a.src since it can't so few rules to start with this session will be recorded please keep your microphone muted the entire time the chatbox is disabled currently but it will be enabled during the Q&A session those to submit your question please type your name organization and your question if we can't address all of the questions today we will follow up with you offline so a brief overview of the program today first we'll hear from the a.src leadership then we'll hear three-minute pitches from five different researchers within startups and academia will continue to the Q&A session for about 20 minutes and at 3 p.m. we'll end the program so next is this Bank pleasure to introduce dr. Ryan line the director of the nanoscience initiative and the ESRC sensor cap oh thank you very much gyah am i muted am I am I good okay I'm there exit Oh welcome everybody we are very excited to see that so many of you could find time to join us for this call to action webinar today and the the purpose is here is to we try and see what we can do to address the kovat 19 crisis through science and see what we can do in our own small way to help with this so what we hope to achieve today is to help connect immobilize you a community of scientists and entrepreneurs with wide-ranging skills that can potentially be repurposed for Kovach 19 we have heard a lot about time-sensitive issues around testing PPE ventilators hard rock and our drug candidates vaccine development and today we will focus especially on technology that could be developed or accelerated within the next three to six months so orbit the idea is really to look at what we can do now to address the needs of New York and the world Post Co vid so it's very impressive and I think I'm not alone there to see how quickly people can move in a time of such great need my many of my colleagues have noted that across the scientific realm competition is on the back burner with collaborations thriving locally nationally internationally which is amazing and it's something that hopefully we can capitalize on and not just in the in the biomedical field so today we will hear from five inventors and their technologies that are at different stages of development but they all have great potential to be repurposed and thereby contribute to solving the current crisis examples that will be shared today are three different sensing technologies that are being repurposed for coronavirus detection the development of smart surface coatings that prevent viruses from sticking and surviving and even rethinking PPE materials in anticipation of the enormous waste crisis that will follow from the huge additional usage of plastic materials by medical workers so today we would like to learn about other inventions of this type and explore how we can help to develop and co-fund them and to contribute to the needs for pulse cough in New York so thank you everybody for filling out the pre webinar questionnaire as a result we have a pretty good idea of who you you are recurrently represent I think a lot of people have dialed in we've got 22 institutions represented and 15 companies so that's really wonderful you also give us any idea what you already know about us some of you work in the SOC some of you have been to the SOC for events and all those don't know anything about it so we felt that this was an opportunity to briefly explain who we are what we do and then also explain what they sent the the sensor cat is so the the center for advanced technology that can help fund some of these projects so the SOC I have to say I genuinely missed this building not being able to go in every day and and and work with the people there is tough for all of us it's a fantastic state-of-the-art research facilities located in Harlem as you can see on the the picture you're looking down toward Central Park in Midtown I'm clearly biased but I really believe there's no better place to do interdisciplinary science anywhere we're actually currently in the middle of celebrating our five-year anniversary at the SRC and we're doing this through a series of events and workshops and the next big one was actually planned for May but we are working hard to move this one online cuz we can't do this in person but please watch this space and join us for celebratory events coming up over the next few months so during these five years we've got the building up and running we've recruited fantastic people and are hitting good metrics as you can see on the slide the building is an experiment in its own right into disability we were working in that the 20 labs in the building have completely different focus areas and range from fundamental to applied research that ranges from nanoscience photonic structure biology to neuroscience and environmental science and this is a combination that you don't really find anywhere else so it gives us unique opportunities we also have 15 high end core facilities ranging from nano fabrication life cell imaging surface analysis as well as the dedicated next-generation sensor lab and others and importantly we're open to all at CUNY but also to external researchers from academia and Industry so these facilities have already have collectively already thousands of users and facilities so then what is the sensor cats so we were lucky enough I guess New York State recognized the uniqueness of our opportunity here and we were awarded a research center this 15 of these throughout New York State they all have different focus areas and ours is specifically focused on sensor technologies Tavis is the business director of the sensor Kathryn we'll give you more detail about exactly how it works and how you get I can get funded from this but just to briefly give you an idea at the SOC we are exceptionally well place to innovate and biomedical and environmental sensing for example by combining new concepts in deployable environmental sensors ultra sensitive sensing genetically encoded sensors and new nanoscale sensing modalities so gee I see I have to stop some I'm just going to say in the light of the current Corbett crisis it is clear that sensor technology is critical we need we need to know where the virus is whether it's takes two objects recharge how to remove them how to monitor patients and ourselves and importantly how saw also how to prevent and protect ourselves in the future so in conclusion they also seen the cat are ready to work with you were committed to exploring what can be done to support an advanced govind research GI after you Enki right so next we'll introduce dr. Nina great the executive director at the SRC you know Thank You Gia and Thank You Ryan and Tavis for organizing this when I join you and also thanking everybody else for being here today to talk about this very important and urgent topic and what I wanted to say fir to start off with is that it's part of the ASR C's vision and mission to apply interdisciplinary research and science to tackle the problems that are most important to society and today it's very clear that that problem is Kovach 19 and we've already started to do in our own small way so far a few things to try to help with these efforts I think everybody is trying to make some small difference so while we were in the process of ramping down our normal research operations our labs and our core facilities set aside gloves masks face shields gowns whatever they could find that would be considered vital personal protective equipment and we donated those to the nearby Harlem Hospital which is part of New York City Health and Hospitals public health care system we also donated our 3d printers to an organization called hack Manhattan and a group called New York City makes PPE in order to help them increase their ability to generate new face shields and other PPE for the four nursing homes for hospitals for EMTs throughout the New York City area so far they've been able to deliver nearly six thousand face shields for example across four of the five boroughs and if you look at the top picture on the left that is their first delivery of face shields which went to Elmhurst Hospital in Queens and while it's wonderful to be able to contribute in these ways we really feel like the a.src has a lot more to offer and can contribute in a much bigger way by leveraging its resources and its facility to spur new research that's related to covin 19 towards things like detection mitigation protection and vaccination I also want to point out though part of being socially responsible in pursuing this research is that we balance the risks versus the possible rewards and that we continue to protect the health of our essential personnel through social distancing while seeking to activate the most promising research on Kovan 19 and I think that's what why we're all here today is to try to find that balance and move the research forward I also want to point out that you know there are a number of funding opportunities available out there from the NSF NIH DoD other federal and non-federal agencies and if any of you out there are interested in applying for those and think that the a.src might be a good fit to partner with for those applications that I encourage you to reach out to me to discuss those opportunities before you apply and I think what we're all here for now our next speaker will start to address how the sensor cat is going to be one of those funding agencies as well for this effort so thank you all Thank You Nina so next we have have this itself the Business Development Director for the S or C sensor cat Travis Thank You Gia and thank you Nina for that in reduction and your leadership in the actions being taken by the a.src to support those hero medical workers that are on the frontlines of this crisis so in addition to the PPE that Nina just mentioned the topic of ventilators is certainly one that we have all been hearing about in the news that I want to start today by asking for your efforts in addition to those of the a.src sensor cat in considering to help us search online and within your personal networks for a critical component that we are now looking for that is critical to ventilator function and that is pressure sensors so as you see illustrated in the slide New York State together with the US federal government is in search of a specific kind of sensor manufactured by Honeywell which is now part of the new ventilator design which has started to be manufactured rapidly at scale Honeywell of course is as a manufacturer is trying to make as many of these as possible but the reason we're coming out to you and why they've accessed us to promote this is that there are many of these sensors circulating on the market that have been used for years and potentially with your help we could locate stockpiles of those sensors which might be accessed and or repurposed we will send out further details about this in the follow up to the webinar the city and federal government is looking for an estimated 30,000 of these but of course they will take what they can get now that I mentioned that I just want to go ahead and jump into specifically what the sensor cat is doing in regards to support for and around this call to action as Ryan mentioned at the beginning of this hour our goal is to mobilize facilitate and quickly increase the impact of efforts you as the scientific industrial and entrepreneurial community are making to think about and tackle problems related to kovat 19 so the sensor cat together with our counterparts at the New York state level are looking for : related projects that can quickly be put into action with the potential producing well defined results in a three to five month time period so the a.src leadership together with Nina and Ryan and our staff together with the cat and New York State are already taking necessary steps to move towards allowing restricted safe access to instrumentation and labs in order to facilitate company projects like you'll hear from today although short-term projects and results are certainly what we are all hoping for however as the cat we understand and we want to make clear that funding is open to longer-term projects as well I think we all understand that the likelihood of this virus or another returning is high and long-term efforts to mitigate the current crisis and prevent future outbreaks and needless loss of human life are just as important so now I want to focus a little bit more on the mechanisms that the cat can employ to respect to focus on these kovat projects so as you look at the current slide on the screen the diagram at the bottom I want to just reiterate the function of our cat which is funded by New York State is to support entrepreneurial development of new sensor related technology with collaborative partnerships between New York companies and CUNY scientists so therefore as you see let's say for instance a New York company connects with me as the cat director with a project that requires use of ASRC facilities we work together on a budget on a budget defined for a scope of work on a specific timeline then the cat decides based on this information as well as the amount and availability of company funding for investment how much matching funds should be awarded to the project in support of this effort if the company is not already partnered with a CUNY researcher with expertise either in this field of focus or use of the instrumentation at a SRC that's required we pair them together so cat matching funds are then awarded to this partnership within CUNY and their use dictated by the already defined scope of work as well as overseen by myself as the business director so quickly what do typical projects consist of and cat companies look like so typically companies are looking to design build and test new product prototypes these companies tend to be small startups to medium-sized companies however many researchers at CUNY are also partnered with major large corporations that we can support as well however I will say larger matching funds funding opportunities of let's say around 50% matching funds are dedicated to those companies that require the most economic support and demonstrate highly viable projects so if a company has a funding issue I also want to make clear that the cat is also here to play a role in support of firing finding and acquiring funding so just like Nita mentioned there opportunities out there at the state and federal levels that the cat will work with you together in support of gaining that funding in order to use so one question we know that is on every company's mind is also that about company IP protection this is the most valuable asset to a company and I want to stress here that you as a company owned your IP and we will take measures to legally protect the company in the process of forming our partnership so this does not become an issue again the idea here with the cat is to support the growth of business and New York State so I've talked about how the cat itself functions and can support New York companies but I also want to highlight quickly just how the cat is at the center of a network of organizations working together to support commercialization of new technology so quickly you see at the beginning of this slide cat is within an institution of organizations of course not all of which could be listed here but organizations working to organically build startups within the CUNY network now as you see coming out from that we're also involved with New York State funding programs as well as other institutions in the New York City and regional area if you have any specific questions further about how this cat network could be identified and or utilized I'm happy to answer those in the panel discussion as well so how do you get in touch with a cat what we you will find if you don't already have it is our contact information which will provided to you following this meeting so we'd encourage you to go ahead and send us an email with an overview of a project related to code the night team including sensor technology that might be viable based on what I've just told you if you don't have a New York company partner we will work to match you with one so don't feel like that is a limiting factor here after that process we will review these with our internal cat review committee and look forward to creating partnerships out of these viable projects so next I want to give a brief example of how the cat and a.src again as where I mentioned the beginning are uniquely positioned to work on sensor related technology projects G if you don't mind going to the next slide so unfortunately today I just want to go ahead and say that our colleague dr. Ricardo Toledo CRO is actually been afflicted with the covert virus he tells us that he is safely recovering at home so I don't want to go into too much detail specifically about his sensor lab which he is building up on the fifth floor of the environmental science initiative at a SRC but what I do want to stay is basically Ricardo has been building up a lab where we can together with the cat projects work on building low-cost sensors so he has the means to do fabrication as you see on this slide as well as build electronics and also software firm firmware for those sensor prototypes I just want to also point out based on what Nina just said there you see that Ricardo did have 3d printing capabilities and those have also been donated in the project which Gina mentioned so at this point in time I want to hand it back to gia and move on to the next part of this webinar which is our company pitches thank you Thank You Travis so now we'll hear from our five researchers from startups and Industry on what they're doing to answer this urgent call for research against Cove in nineteen so we're gonna start with that dr. Jacob Trevino from chameleon Thank You gia and thank you Tavis and Ryan and everyone else who was involved in putting this together it's really important and very helpful to put everyone in the same space and have a conversation so my name is Jacob Trevino I'm the principal scientist at a startup company in Brooklyn called chameleon we have a developed of platform technology that is used to do point-of-care detection for molecular diagnosis so we pick a particular target analyte that we're interested in and then we take this platform technology and adapt it for that so our technology has two components one is a highly selective alekhya receptor the other is a nano photonic colorimetric platfor sensor and so the way we integrate those two is kind of where our IP lies and it's a very unique way and gives us some advantages over other technologies with mainly speed and ease of use and we've been using this technology for a couple different applications so we started as a date-rape drug detection company called drink savvy we've we've recently moved more into the biomedical space which is where the rebranding of chameleon came in and so more recently we've been working on the detection of cerebral spinal fluid for people coming in to the IDI with traumatic brain injuries coming from an accident and then also for neurosurgeons in the middle of surgery they can find if there's been indeed a a leak it protruded the spinal sac until air leaking fluid so it's a way for them to know that there's a problem you can see an example here of our technology final design and the colors that you see are actually real colors that are sensors generate so there's a positive and a negative example here and the idea is this in for our Srila spinal fluid once the solution is added the sample whether it's blood you're in you know saliva whatever the transition happens in under a minute so it's very rapid in response so for Koba 19 specifically as I said our platform technology is very easily adapted for other molecules and so in this case we're looking at the SARS Cove to anti antigens specifically the in protein and the S protein and so we're in the middle of adapting that technology and so the idea here is to have a very cheap very easy to use sensor that everyone can have in their home and everyone can get tested regarding how you can help and what we need we really need access to nano fabrication facilities for the colorimetric part characterization facilities of how the binding works we'd be happy to collaborate with people who have expertise in the structure and behavior of the virus itself and anyone who has experience in molecular acceptors so we in particular are currently working with after more technologies but are also interested in peptides and other technologies and Thank You Jacob so next we have Professor Alan Lyons from College of Staten Island thanks very much so Alexander Greer and I have been working together for almost 10 years now studying the generation of singlet oxygen in the gas phase from solid surfaces and been able to make quite a bit of progress over these years and understanding that mechanism and have recently come up with a device that can be used to treat various bacterial based diseases based on that technology we formed a company single oxygen singlet o2 therapeutics LLC which was awarded phase one based to NIH SBIR grants and when currently in the process of demonstrated that the device is very effective at treating bacterial biofilms such as those that caused paragon Titus and singled oxygen is a great way to treat this type of endemic disease that affects perhaps 10% of the worldwide population and causes billions of dollars of damage because it doesn't require the use of antibiotics the oxygen gas is excited state through the contact with the sensitizer and presence of light and in very locally will inactivate the bacteria now so we're in the process of working with Harvard Medical School and miniaturizing the device in and using animal models to evaluate its effectiveness in in a rat model so because we received this the company received this SBIR award we've had a in the process of putting a civil war into the CUNY and take advantage of the of the sensor cat to be able to perform the research here at CUNY and use the matching funds from the sensor Kent to enhance the product development and be able to understand exactly how to how the device works and how to optimize its performance but in light of the scars Coby to virus realized that there's an opportunity for our new product that we're working on a product that could inactivate the virus and and we hope to be able to redirect the funds from the sensor cat to be able to start work on this this new product that would be capable of an activating the virus and within 30 seconds and we've started a project with Sebastian PO J to help us understand the using just the active virus part of the for the the the the spike protein to be able to quantify how much time it's required and be able to take advantage of the facilities of the cat of the a.src to be able to speed up and implement the development of the device and hopefully apply for additional funding to support product development so looking forward to any any feedback in any input that we can get from from other people on this call thank you Thank You Alan next we have Chris Pelham model from beyond hostak hey gia can you hear me yes excellent great thank you so much hi everybody thanks so much for having me joined today I'm really excited to be here I wanted to tell you about our project called beyond plastic so Nina was talking about all of the PPE that has been graciously and wonderfully donated by the a.src to help our health care workers of course we are facing supply shortages a lot of doctors and nurses and health care workers are being asked to reuse the PPE that they already have another problem they're facing is that the raw material for the PPE most PPE is actually made from woven plastic or nonwoven plastic and that is causing an issue most of it as fossil fuel derived so we also know that that is causing will have a big environmental impact not to mention the shortages and so this solution basically takes a look at both of those problems the shortage of the raw material used to create the PPE and also the environmental impact of PPE because it's made from fossil fuel-based plastic and looks at a brand-new solution that actually grows on demand a molecule that is biodegradable from a renewable resource and actually can be used with the same machinery to create PPE so a company that creates nonwoven fabric or creates PPE as a whole doesn't have to retool their machinery in order to be able to use this molecule it is very very similar to polypropylene which is the type of plastic that we actually use for our yogurt containers you find it all over our grocery store it's the exact same molecule this molecule would actually replace polypropylene and be biodegradable and come from a renewable resource so the science is actually coming from a postdoc who we're hoping that will join the a.src right now he's out in Berkeley and he has been working very hard on this research and then the idea is to be able to take that scientific research and be able to commercialize it to help create PPE on demand that all so doesn't harm the environment the other issue that of course we face from fossil fuel based plastics is that fossil fuel and the plastic that's derived from it causes climate change and there's a lot of research out there showing that as climate change gets worse it creates a better and better environment for viruses like open 19 so the idea with this type of PPE would be to get ahead of it and not compound the problem that would make future pandemics even worse Thank You Krista sure thank you next we'll hear from professor Adam branch food from the ASRC everybody I'm speaking on behalf of a company that spun out of work from my lab and what we do is here we develop molecular receptors that bind sugars so sensors have two elements they have the sensing element and they have the propagation of the signal so for example Jacob was talking about his technology for looking at binding events here we've developed molecules that bind carbohydrates in particular and carbohydrates are prevalent on the surfaces of viruses biofilms etc and we reason that if you could build a molecule that binds the sugars that are prevalent on the surfaces of viruses you could detect the viruses without needing to rely on antibody tests or rt-pcr assays antibody tests are problematic because your body only develops antibodies at late stages of the disease once you've already mounted a response rt-pcr is problematic because um you need a laboratory it's slow so we're looking at developing point-of-care Diagnostics that don't detect secondary products of the disease of the virus rather they bind the virus itself with these images on your right are showing you is our receptors binding directly to the sugars on the surfaces of the virus and that's a very unique space that nobody else is working and this company started just before the pandemic occurred and what we're working on right now is develop a group of concept to show that we can indeed use these molecules as binders or recognition elements so what we're doing right now is we're leveraging the CUNY a.src cleanroom matching funding from the cat to build the proof-of-concept sensors and what's important here is that this is the recognition element and what's binding occurs this recognition element can be mounted onto any detection signal propagation platform whether you want to use a photonic platform field effect platform but what we're doing is directly binding the virus rather than looking at secondary products either mounted as defense by the body which can lead to false negatives or nucleotide fragments that may be present in low concentration and require expensive laboratory equipment so that's our approach and it's driven by technology licensed out of CUNY and funded in part by the cat Thank You Adam next we'll hear from after shows from IR incorporated James jane schultz and i'm here representing buyer ink buyers an early-stage startup that has been developing a low-cost optical infrared camera our proprietary thin film coating is a stack of near critical angle spatial filters that have been configured into an integrated photonic device this device enables sensitive detection of changes in the refractive index of the top layer which can be structured or functionalized to respond to numerous applications our device is primarily composed of an internal light source a substrate with a thin film coating and a detector our thin film coating stock creates a useful device by first spatially filtering internal light using wave interference and strong refraction so that the light that propagates through the coating is highly spatially structured secondly the coating has a functionalized top layer that acts as a variable mirror modifying the reflection and transmission ratio proportional to induce changes in the surface refractive index if there is no externally induced refractive index change on the top layer the internal light is completely reflected to the detector but when an externally induced refractive index change takes place on the top layer the internal light is partially transmitted through the top surface and scattered with the remaining light being reflected to the detector we believe that this technology can be repurposed and applied as a clinical antibody base assay for the direct detection of Kovach 19 virus has been shown that by mobilizing antibody use of indirect detection of antigen boxes water at the surface the coating and using a surface refractive index change typically on the order of 10 to the minus 6 our technology has a capability to accurately and inexpensively detect this change this technique for virus detection is well-established but has struggled with virtualization due complexity and cost of the optical readout methods Fyers technology is a relatively simple nano fabrication process with basic supporting electronics it can be developed in numerous applications and as an integrated photonics sensor that is low-cost and scalable and it's 9y of factoring we are continuing to explore the development of this device with our partners at the a.src nano fabrication laboratory iSpy really collaborated with the sensor cats made of different ground which would significantly aid in this effort we're working to submit an expedited funding request with the NSF and DOD we encourage anyone who's interested in collaboration on this project to contact me thank you thank you James okay so that concludes our pictures from the researchers and now we can begin our Q&A session featuring our infectious disease specialist dr. Norman Savio and Ryan and Tavis whom you've heard from before but first we'd love to hear some from dr. Savio joining us from Texas today on his outlook of the Cova 19 pandemic doctor good afternoon really send their well wishes tall it's nice to be here I hope you are all well being the safe it is a certainly an honor to be invited and to participate in this webinar I always feel smarter when I'm around smart people so thank you thank you director Ryan director Tavis and uh yeah I'm clinician but I have worked in research for a brief period of time when I was uh doing my fellowship at the SUNY Stony Brook I have done a handful of clinical trials mostly phase 3 and phase 4 and have not done any compassionate trials like what they're doing now with this hydroxychloroquine and other drugs for Kobe 19 covered 19 is so evolving and we are all learning not just every day but probably every time we hear about it or every time we think about it it's a moving target and we are at war so we need to fight and we need to fight now and I do appreciate all your efforts to try to and if I be active about this this call to action I'm with you guys but I will not guess and and speculate I think I will leave that up to the experts with their models and their up-to-date facts I will talk mostly about what I know as an internist and that's the infectious disease I am a practicing physician for about 35 years 25 years as internist and intern and infectious disease I'm also involved in hospital infection control and prevention as well as community emergency and disaster management as I perceive this virus it is an enemy and truly we're trying to struggle right now to fight it but we cannot attack what we cannot see we do not know where it's at we do not know what it is we did not know the mechanism of action we're still learning more about the virus so I do appreciate all the year now fidgets about the effort to try to identify them provide some biodegradable protective gear and that's pretty innovative but I can focus more on the prevention and hopefully increase our defense mechanisms and I don't need to tell you what you already know about trying to enhance your immune system which is basically what we need right now to survive this but we can create barriers and we already have those barriers washed wipe and avoid I see this this defensive barriers as something that can be layered from a distance we avoid people we wash our hands and maybe in the area where they penetrate the penetration of the virus right now as we know is through the Airways through the nose and the mouth it may be through the eyes because the eyes the tears drains towards the needs of pharynx so creating a barrier something that pre probably can create just before the penetration of the virus if identified how to identify the virus from a distance I'm not concerned about the patient I'm not concerned about the results of the viral science the the monitor results but I'm concerned about how the patient responds and we don't have to wait to that the virus as we understand stays for three to four days in the nasopharynx and then on the fifth day on the average they will have fever that's when the virus starts a penetrate and wreak havoc and gets into the circulation so during that time that treat the first three to four days we have an opportunity to hopefully identify how to destroy the virus whether it's in the nose or in the mouth maybe some barrier we can create we do have some defense mechanisms protease is enzymes in the mouth that that destroys bacteria but it's still not enough we do have a lot of bacteria in the mouth and we do have viruses now this coronavirus we know has a very thin envelope as had been described by one of the presenters and it does hurt it does not survive alpha over soap but I don't think we can completely have alcohol or soap in her mouth or in her throat or in the nasal pharynx for a long period of time unless somebody can design something that's digestible tolerable and safe which can destroy the envelope some people have looked at eucalyptus oil cinnamon oil I spoke with a dentist we a week or so ago and he mentioned about core hexa diene povidone-iodine so I was kind of interested about this a periodontist our prevention by what the presenters but then again we're not successful right now and trying to kill the virus successfully with all our efforts right now so I do up trade your innovation your your desire to discover something urgently and and I'm with you on that I will present the clinical aspect I'm from the receiving end obviously I've been called to action as well and I've been mobilized so I probably will not be able to talk about where I am and what I'm actually doing right now but as a clinician in my previous life as a reserve officer I can tell you what my experience was in the clinic's how patients respond operators who had and what we actually need so it's nice to bridge what do scientists do and what you can offer and what I think could be helpful from us they receive again and to give you some feedback of where you need to continue to focus your efforts so I do appreciate being part of this er a great team that you've started thank you again for having me thank you so much for joining us dr. saario okay so now we will start to take questions from the audience so the chatbox is enabled now so please type your name organization and your question in case we can't address all the questions today and we will follow up with you offline so this question the first one I have is was from the registration form so this is from dr. Sean Murtagh Montgomery to dr. sabio how could studies using wearable devices like MOT bit that continuously measure body temperature PPG heart rate respiration and skin conductance helped to better build epidemiological models and treatment decision trees after sabio it's a very interesting concept but I think that's been done for quite some time now astronauts do that you can tell them when they're getting excited but they're sleepy with winter having some temperature changes oxygen levels yes the technologies available I'm not sure that it's gonna be for public use I think it's for research purposes when we have those monitors to identify how our vaccine volunteers are responding I think it's a good way to explore that possibility if it can be made affordable and for maybe wider use it's a very good concept I'm not too familiar about the technology that's more for the detection early diagnosis and maybe monitoring and following up of cases so I think it's a good concept good idea but right now when we do not know what this virus can actually do it probably will mutate and have a much more potent capability or maybe a weak ape ability so right now monitoring what we have I think it's a good idea thank you thank you dr. Savio so the next question is from Missha Vincent from Queens University and the question is for Christa so Christa aside from PPE what other potential technology uses are there for your material oh sure and actually anything that's made from plastic related to this conversation if you think about how much plastic we have in healthcare and in hospitals right so IV bags all of the tubing ventilators really there's plastic all over our modern healthcare system and it's actually the whole reason that we can have a modern modern healthcare system is because of plastic so it clastic absolutely has helped us live happier healthier longer lives the problem is it has such a huge environmental impact so this molecule actually behaves very similarly to plastic and can be used not only for PPE but could really be used for lots of other plastic uses whether they're consumer and it could be our grocery stores and the packaging of our food which is now also very important and the the sanitation issues that were experiencing I'm related to the to the food supply that we have and it could be used really for plastic for tubing for IV bags anything that's in a hospital all the protective gear that our healthcare workers are using on the frontlines it can be used in any of those reasons it's just the beads really look almost exactly the same as the polypropylene that's used and they're used for the same machinery so it could absolutely has definitely has commercial legs even far beyond the PPE but of course the PPE is that what we're looking at is the immediate need thank you please further questions thank you so the next question was from the registration form so this is from Philip well to Ryan having in mind that the disease should be tackled from an interdisciplinary approach what is a criteria for making a project or proposal addressing Cove in nineteen crisis a priority and funding right yeah Thank You Bell very nice that you would join us she realized that you would be able to call so welcome so what we've been doing is set up a number of criteria in terms of urgency technological feasibility cost-effectiveness and I just fit with the the whole crisis and then another criterion is also that because we're using New York State money that company of that is a New York State's company so what we do into the fast-tracking is short proposals reviewed by two committees one specifically one feasibility committee and a me look at you know whether social distancing can be observed in the labs when these these experiments take place and then and then we we try to fund thank you right so the next question is from Antonio Morelli is there anyone working on surfactants acting on surfactant maybe the key to save those patients that are dying even if they are assisted with ventilation when the alveoli collapse ventilation isn't effective so who could answer the question of a surfactant maybe Ryan do you want to point yeah I can I mean it's a great a great idea and I would say that that's the thank you dr. Savio fall so bringing that up because I think there's a lot of we think you need actually a lot of knowledge about colloids and surfactants and interfaces so I think there are a number of people who could get together and think about you know biodegradable surfactants for this purpose I don't know of anyone who is specifically looking at it now but it's certainly a conversation we're gonna have to have so thank you for that so one more question from the registration form this is from Homero Ferrari what are the types of partnerships expected what are the funding options and the timelines Tavis can you take this question sure I'd be happy to GS so O'Meara thank you for that question so I think Ryan kind of touched on it there and maybe I didn't stress it enough but of course this being a New York state funded Center for advanced technology they are looking to support New York state companies that being said partnerships could look like a lot of different things and and I didn't really have the time necessarily to cover all those different aspects but whether you are a researcher coming from other universities Columbia University or internal community itself if you have some partnership or a relationship with a New York State company and or wants us to make that partnership that would be typically how this would look we would manage that funding through you know through the avenues within the ASR seeking CUNY and the company itself would have access to how that is used so I think the other part of that question was what are the funding options and timelines so that's really varying I mean of course with the code that 19 crisis the state is looking for you know projects that can be immediately viable like I mentioned before I think scientists here we also understand that it takes time in order to address some of these problems and/or nest out and analyze new technology so there's a lot of flexibility here and also when it comes to funding so you know smaller to mid-sized companies the cat has the ability to match upwards of 50 percent of company cash that's invested into a project with the cat or a SRC but New York State is giving us flexibility given this crisis and be happy to chat about it further Thank You Dallas so the next question is from Caleb Carr from University of Pittsburgh question for genes which are infrared camera technology be able to detect the virus quantitatively or just its presence or absence if not any plans to develop a quantitative assay James yeah so the repurposed infrared camera technology could potentially be used for quantitative measurements but we're still looking into it we're very early stage in this application because our focus has been primarily on developing a low-cost thermal camera up until this point and that's still yes because thermal cameras have been used in outbreaks in the past to be able to identify people with low-grade fevers and can be used as early detection of people who are feeling ill our technology isn't ready for that application yet but we are looking into the detection of the virus and hopefully a quantitative assay thank you James the next question is from Tamra Schneider is there a link or something that the office of research could advertise in its weekly lab meeting which goes out to tens of thousands of CUNY stakeholders Ryan do you wanna answer that Sam thank you very much for that question I think it relates to what's next and I mean we're excited about what we're doing today I'm very excited to have I can see now we have over a hundred people joining in here it suggests there is an appetite I think the discussion is going well so we want to make sure that there are ways to keep people informed you haven't really thought beyond today too much but we will do that and I think this is an excellent suggestion so we will make sure that there are ways to advertise opportunities because I'm sure I'm not alone in that I've already learned a bunch of things today that I hadn't thought about before that could be relevant so you know having these conversations is going to be important so we will be in touch Tamra thank you for that point thank you right so the next question was from the registration form as well and this is from Maya Maya Nair are there any companies interested in making antifouling materials to study their structural properties I think Alan could take this question so so viruses are really small they're there on the order of 40 nanometers so most of the antifouling so one of the surfaces were working at is is making an active antifouling surface that jet that would generate the single oxygen that could actively attack and oxidize the surface since one approach that we're taking the but nano textured surfaces are of great interest but oftentimes the no texture is is more coarse than the size of the virus and so extremely tiny surface structures would have to be developed to prevent the virus from adhering interesting area for research it's very interesting Thank You Alan so next question is from Nina for at this question is for Adam Broderick how much of the virus do you think will be needed to be detectable does your detector fit with Jacobs reporter system oh she's playing matchmaker here yeah Jacob and I have had some loose discussions there's a few things that contribute to sensitivity there is the inherent association between the receptor and the virus there's something called multi valency which we can design into our platform so and then there's the sensitivity of the device so it's a weakest link issue you can tune the binding of the receptor and then there is the sensitivity of the device so whichever is lower of the two is going to be your limit but what we've seen is that our molecules can detect in the sub nano molar concentration range so it's really not our molecules that are going to be the limiting factor Y is a factor is I'm selectivity more than sensitivity so you have a lot of things floating around in blood and in the body so how do you discriminate one from the other and we have a solution to that with our molecules but that's a little too detailed for right now thank you welcome so one more question is we're actually finishing up so if you have any questions in the audience so time to type them out I have some more from the registration form we'll go through so what what are the current efforts of a SRC to work with stakeholders at the community state and federal level would this be something Nina could answer that's a great question so we have been working with city officials in terms of donating our PPE and we are and I think maybe Tamra's on the line so she could speak to the larger efforts from CUNY research but we are also working with other city officials in trying to get this up and running okay and then we have one more question from this is from Ryan from the question is for dr. Savio dr. Savio do you have any advice on how we can better engage the end user or the medical committee right now we're giving you feedbacks about the outcome of this encounter the virus is not winning at this time because we have put in a whole lot of efforts the treatment trials the vaccination trials the efforts that we're doing they called mitigation the things that we do we're all involved with this we're trying to defend ourselves or fighting so it's not just the medical it's the public this is a public health nightmare and they're realizing that there's a whole are lessons learned and we make all this information available the problem I see is that we sometimes cannot filter out the real from the fake news the anecdotes the record the trials big Don the story's being propagated and the more you hear about them the more they sound like they probably true for in fact we need to get a good source of information right now all the medical information that we that we have has to be filtered in just a whole lot of trials across the u.s. across the world different kinds of reports coming from halfway around the world in Europe I've been monitoring them so I've been seeing a whole lot of difference in approach one thing is a unified them right now that the virus is still gaining ground but we're trying to defend ourselves so what we do and what you guys are doing I think it's very admirable that you're also helping out trying to come up with ways to help everybody else the feedback that you can be getting from the medical community is what you see every day there's there's transparency with me I'm going to report everything to be that we have but hopefully the report that we get the report we give will get to the right people and put them together and this is what they called the model the the assumption that we make is based upon the reports and I think our government specifically the task force is doing an awesome job I'm trying to incorporate all those information not just from the US but globally as well so we will continue to work with you and we look forward that in continue to help us thank you for the very good question thank you dr. Savio I think that's a perfect timing to end our webinar today so I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for the call and I like to thank all of the speakers for making time out of their busy schedule to join us today and prepare for this webinar on such a short notice from the audience if you guys have any more questions please feel free to contact either Ryan Travis or myself and I like to say a big big thank you to Jasmine Savio and Camille scientist Devon for putting together this webinar on such a short notice and getting everyone together coordinated okay and if you'd like to sign up for our newsletter please see the link below here also it's in the chat box so you can copy and paste it and we hope to see all of you again in our may event coming soon so this will be a more general launch event about the cat and we'll explain more in details about how we can sponsor your fund we your industry partnered academic research so thank you everyone for a great webinar and please contact us for any more questions thank you thank you
