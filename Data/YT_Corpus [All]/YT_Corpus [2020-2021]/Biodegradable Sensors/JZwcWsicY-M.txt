biomass production production of atmospheric oxygen soil formation nutrient and water cycling surface runoff that part of rainfall passing out of an area into the drainage system suspended solids SS solid particles suspended in water used as an indicator of water quality sustainability the Brundtland definition is sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs sustainability covenant under Section 49 of the Environment Protection Act 1970 a billet II covenant is an agreement which a personal body undertakes to increase the resource use efficiency and or reduce ecological impacts of activities products services and production processors parties can voluntarily enter into such agreements with EPA or could be required to if they are declared by governor in Council on the recommendation of EPA to have potential for significant impact on the environment sustainability science the multidisciplinary scientific study of sustainability focusing especially on the quantitative dynamic interactions between nature and society its objective is a deeper and more fundamental understanding of the rapidly growing interdependence of the nature society system and the intention to make this sustainable it critically examines the tools used by sustainability accounting and the methods of sustainability governance sustainability triangle a graphic indication of the action needed to stabilize co2 levels below about 500 ppm it shows stabilization wedges indicating savings made per year by the use of a particular strategy sustainable consumption sustainable resource use a change to society's historical patterns of consumption and behavior that enables consumers to satisfy their needs with better performing products or services that use fewer resources cause less pollution and contribute to social progress worldwide sustainable development see sustainability Swale an open channel transporting surface runoff to a drainage system usually grasped a swale promotes infiltration the filtration of sediment by plants and ornamental interest system a set of parts organized into a whole usually processing a flow of energy you topic t take back a concept commonly associated with product stewardship placing responsibility on brand owners retailers manufacturers or other supply chain partners to accept products returned by consumers once they have reached the end of the useful life products may then be recycled treated or sent to landfill Technosphere synthetic and composite components and materials for made by human activity true Technosphere materials like plastics are not biodegradable temperate with moderate temperatures weather or climate neither hot nor cold mean annual temperature between zero to twenty desi thermal mass architecture any mass that can absorb and store heat and can therefore be used to buffer temperature change concrete bricks and tiles need a lot of heat energy to change the temperature and therefore have high thermal mass timber has low thermal mass third pipe system a third pipe in addition to the standard water supply pipe and sewer disposal pipe which carries recycled water for irrigation purposes threshold ecology a point that when cross can bring rapid and sometimes unpredictable change in a trend an example would be the sudden altering of ocean currents due to the melting of ice at the poles top soil mostly fertile surface soil moved or introduced to top dress gardens road banks lawns etc total energy use as applied in this book is the total of combined direct and indirect energy use total fertility rate the number of children that on average a woman would have in her lifetime at present age specific

genetic material has been transferred by genetic engineering triple bottom line a form of sustainability accounting going beyond the financial bottom line to consider the social and environmental as well as economic consequences of an organization's activity generally included with economic accounts term coined by John Elkington in 1994 tropical occurring in the tropics the region on either side of the equator hot and humid with a mean annual temperature greater than 20 degrees Celsius turbine a machine for converting the heat energy in steam or high-temperature gas into mechanical energy in a turbine a high velocity flow of steam or gas passes through successive rows of radial blades fastened to a central shaft topic you United Nations an international organization based in New York conformed to promote international peace security and cooperation under a charter signed by 51 founding countries in San Francisco in 1945 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biological Diversity CBD were established at the 1992 UN conference on Environment and development in Rio de Janeiro Brazil the Kyoto Protocol was then formulated by the UNFCCC and set specific timelines and timetables for reducing industrialized nations GHG emissions and allow some international trading in carbon credits for more information visit upstream those processes necessary before a particular activity is completed eg for a manufactured product this would be the extraction transport of materials etc needed prior to the process of manufacture CF downstream urban heat island the tendency for urban areas to have warmer air temperatures than the surrounding rural landscape due to the low albedo of streets sidewalks parking lots and buildings these surfaces absorb solar radiation during the day and release it at night resulting in higher night temperatures urban metabolism the functional flow of materials and energy required by cities you

proportions of other elements such as hydrogen oxygen fluorine and chlorine with sunlight and heat they form ground-level ozone vault the unit of potential difference between two points is the vault V commonly called voltage 1,000 volts equals one kilovolt kV topic W waste any material liquid solid or gaseous that is produced by domestic households and commercial institutional municipal or industrial organizations and which cannot be collected and recycled in any way for further use for solid waste this involves materials that currently go to landfills even though some of the material is potentially recyclable waste analysis the quantifying of different waste streams recording and detailing of it is a proportion of the total waste stream determining its destination and recording details of waste practices waste assessment observing measuring and recording data and collecting and analyzing waste samples some practitioners consider an assessment to be one where observations are carried out visually without sorting and measuring individual streams see visual waste audit waste audits see waste assessment waste avoidance primary pillar of the waste hierarchy avoidance works on the principle that the greatest gains result from efficiency centered actions that remove or reduce the need to consume materials in the first place but deliver the same outcome waste factors used in roundwood calculations give the ratio of one cubic meter of round wood use per cubic meter or ton of product waste generation generation of unwanted materials including recyclables as well as garbage waste generation equals materials recycle plus waste to landfill waste hierarchy waste management hierarchy a concept promoting waste avoidance ahead of recycling and disposal often refer to in community education campaigns as reduce reuse recycle the waste hierarchy is recognized in the Environment Protection Act 1974 motive management of wastes in the order of preference avoidance reuse recycling recovery of energy treatment containment disposal waste management practices and procedures that relate to how the waste is dealt with waste minimization techniques to keep waste generation at a minimum level in order to divert materials from landfill and thereby reduce the requirement for waste collection handling and disposal to landfill cycling and other efforts made to reduce the amount of waste going into the waste stream waste reduction measures to reduce the amount of waste generated by an individual household or organization waste stream waste materials that are either of a particular type eg timber waste stream or produced a particular source eg C&I waste stream waste treatment where some additional processing is undertaken of a particular waste this may be done to reduce its toxicity or increase its degrade ability or compost ability waste water used water generally not suitable for drinking water consumption in water accounting distributed water use plus self
