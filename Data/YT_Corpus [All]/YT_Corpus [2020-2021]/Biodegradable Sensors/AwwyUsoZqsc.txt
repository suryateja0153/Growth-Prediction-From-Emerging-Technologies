 welcome to the virtual presentation of e-seed an interactive interface that self-drills i am delhi i will be representing our team for multimedia lab at carnegie mellon university e-seed is designed to connect and resonate between the underground and our surrounding environment think about how humans currently deploy sensors outdoors it is usually a manual process covers a limited area and difficult to carry out in hard to reach mounted regions to monitor natural activities with iot technology we need to consider the depths of deployment the exact locations of deploy sensors costs and also energy efficiency to target a low-cost massive deployment of sensors in remote areas we leverage the planned intelligence as our source of inspiration for example a cucumber grows its tendril germinating from the ground that tries to grab any support and grow taller a wheat ear which carries the seed inside has two arms that open and close alternatively as it falls on the ground and tries to bury the seed erodium a genus of plant that has this coiled on on its seed twists its own and self-drills into the ground upon the absorption of water this special mechanism inspired e-seed we carefully studied the structures of this natural actuator that self-anchors into a certain depth and derived a series of processes to craft e-seed a replica of erodium chromium in size and also the self-drilling mechanism as you can see this e-seed starts to twist its body as it absorbs water from the rain when it dries out the twisting occurs in the opposite direction the cycle can be repeated many times until e-seed successfully establishes itself into the ground on top of a naked e-seed we derive a series of functionalities that can be incorporated into the design space of e-seed an e-seed can be a display we can apply fluorescent or reflective paint on the surface to bounce light signals or attach leds to display light signals it can also bear miniature sensing devices such as moisture sensors to monitor soil condition rfid tags to identify and track objects range sensors to detect proximities sensors can also be analog such as ph or chemically responsive dye that changes color when exposed to hazard all these functions rely on the successful anchoring of e-seed which is an inherent function derived from nature as its actuation mechanism with modified single e-seed we can then build a network of e-seeds that are connected to a central hub which offloads the computational unit and power source to achieve multi-functional field monitoring we implement a design software in rhinoceros using the grasshopper the design tool provides us with a basic outline of e-seed and we can customize this add-on padding area by changing its shape and size to afford additional functionality we present three examples to showcase the application of e-seed first we dial them with fluorescent paint in three colors that mark two tip sections and the body under uv illumination the fluorescent colors can be clearly captured by camera on the uv light we can identify the location and burial percentage of each e-seed to help us track and recycle them second we imagine an interactive garden labeled with e-seeds carrying battery-free tether-free and writable rfid tags after a tagged ecd is anchored you can interact with the rfid by using any nfc reader such as one on the mobile phone we envisioned this application can be broadened into interactive setups in algorithms or museums to trigger reactions from the garden lastly we present multiple e-seeds functioned in synergy four e-seats with customized light intensity sensors are spread and wired to a mother ship carrying the control board and power source each e-seat has a sensing capability to cover a certain area when something invades this covered area it triggers the mothership to emit light and sound to drive out the threat we would like to acknowledge generous support from accenture labs and cmu manufacturing future initiative and all our collaborators who contributed along the way thank you
