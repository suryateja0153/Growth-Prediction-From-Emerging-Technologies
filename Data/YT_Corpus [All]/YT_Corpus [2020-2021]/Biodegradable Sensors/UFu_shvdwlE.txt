wonderful snapshots these are the nature and the science covers so Venter did science and Collins in the NIH genome project did nature both published on the same day right it's kind of the truce that got arranged between the two sides and there they are competing with each other and then there's Collins on his Harley and Venter on one of his wild racing yachts that venture is only interested in sailing if it's dangerous as best I can figures so and then there's this classic picture of Venter in the business suit and wearing a lab coat you know this is all about the counter addictions and the Model A's trying to pursue that fundamental Solara contradictions so these are just a few that's Francis Collins who's currently head of NIH who's also a blues singer too by the way so put these folks here a little idea they're both terrific talents they're remarkable talents we've talked at length about Ventura I think for the purposes here what I want to say is that I put Venter in here as an example of someone who ran into all the counter addictions in the life science innovation model right the fact that it was very hard for NIH to look outside of biology it was all biologists all the time Venter of course was trained as a as a biologist but began moving into this computer territory based upon some advances that Leroy who had made before him and building on HUDs work and doing a lot of innovations like the genome shotgun approach that we talked about two weeks ago he ran into all of the series of these institutional problems at NIH as an innovation organization that it became very hard for him to stand up a completely different pathway to technology advanced and science advanced that the system was locked into a different route and they were very unaccepting in fact ostracized him as he moved in a different kind of direction so he ultimately leaves and then we run into this change agent kind of idea he becomes a competitor and forces change in the institution in which he left as it tries to keep pace with him so as not to be embarrassed right hence the NIH genome initiative and you know it's just an illustration in a very personal kind of way which is why I put it in here of some of the larger institutional challenges that we've been talking about before so let me leave the Venter model here and go into the chapter chapter 7 in our textbook so it's not simply NIH but it's the health care delivery system itself that has these legacy sector features and as we talked about earlier on in class the u.s. is pretty good at standing up new technologies in open fields it runs into real trouble trying to stand up technologies in these kind of established sectors so in the life science territory we did pretty well by creating this completely new biotech model which was a we were able to get a lot of advance out of but when it comes back to fixing the whole healthcare delivery system that's proven far more problematic and you know that's been a major thorny political issue for three administrations in a row now and they each had rocky results trying to pursue that question of how we're gonna organize healthcare delivery systems so there's lots of legacy sector characteristics in healthcare delivery perverse prices and price structures established infrastructure and institutional structures like NIH very powerful vested interests we can see some of those in NIH but we can certainly see them in other parts of the healthcare delivery system they're sustained by public habits right so it's very hard to tell Medicare patients that their full cost repayment system with no patient stake doesn't make a lot of economic sense they're not going to be enthusiastic about the alternatives so these are structured and sustained by public habits stuff you know Medicare is a full cost reimbursement system and it was organized for medicine as we as you know we knew it 30 or 40 years ago right it was a professional delivery system and you would pay for the cost of the service whatever that was right you would not pay for results because the results in the medical system were too uncertain it was very hard to figure out how to estimate a pay for results kind of outcomes oriented repayment system for these medical systems so as a result it became a fee-for-service full payment system for the medical profession and then he created a huge incentive to run up costs for which the federal government would provide you full reimbursement regardless of what the outcomes were right so trying to shift those economic signals has proven you know very problematic you know Obamacare attempted to change some of those not without controversy within the medical professions it's averse to change in innovation the established knowledge base tends to get locked in for the professions that are participants here there's a real problem with collective actions in other words it's scattered amongst thousands of institutions and getting them to act collectively and a different kind of organizational model is not simple and there are serious governmental and institutional problems here so I won't go through the whole litany but you begin to get a sense of how you can take the legacy sector analytical framework and apply it to a big economic sector that service based right like health care it's not just technology-based like say energy is service based but that analytical framework will work to a surprising extent for both kinds of sectors there's and let me go into the let me go ahead and get this one on the table as well the PCAST propelling innovation and drug discovery it was a very important critique of the system that came out in 2012 PCAST is the President's Council of Advisors on science and technology they advise the President on science and tech policy we had a very strong PCAST under Eric Lander and during the Obama administration a lot did a lot of breakthrough reports I think frankly this is one of the most significant they really took a hard look at the healthcare innovation system and identified a lot of trouble some lot of which we've been talking about today but this really spelled a fair amount of it out so the NIH budget doubled between 98 and 2003 and hasn't kept up with the inflation cost since then but in parallel we've had rising costs of clinical trials which we've now actually reached according this report 1.8 billion per drug there's a new patent cliff that's looming for pharmaceutical companies so you may have noticed that farmers are busy merging and divesting themselves of their R&D operations it looks like a problematic trend so why is this it's largely because of this upcoming patent cliff drugs with annual sales of 200 billion dollars will go off patent between 2010 and I think it's 2015 actually so this has already been happening and this is forced to restructuring and them in the amongst the historic pharmaceuticals replacement revenues are not readily available so hence this whole set of merger activities and they've been card the pharmaceuticals have been cooked curtailing their R&D as a result venture capital at the time this was written was in general decline for all sectors including biopharma now frankly that's insignificant part recovered now that's now better than it was this tends to be a cyclical kind of pattern for biotechs in in the in the health care area but at this particular time first time VC deals for biotechs were down really quite significantly and the so that's always an issue that we're gonna have to front and confront though it's biotechs only work at the venture capital system is willing to be quite supportive so ups and downs in the venture capital sector can have a pretty strong effect as to whether we get the drugs emerging into the marketplace that we need despite R&D growth and past decades drug output was flat and productivity was declining and this report invented and invented a concept called Ohm's law which is the opposite of Moore's law the cost of drug development doubles every nine years and the results decline right so it's the opposite of Moore's law martín present as four so VC is function on the seven-year time cycle for an exit so no no but what they will do is they will go with different levels of funding you know a round be round C round which they'll tie though benchmark often to the clinical trial process so they'll be able to manage their risk in moving from one stage to another and again no other sector is thought of this right they haven't figured out an alternative model the failure rate for new drugs and clinical trials is increasing so as a 2003 that was 91% fail imagine trying to construct a profit model around a 91% failure it's not simple it can still be done because the rewards can be so big through the blockbuster model and the guarantee of monopoly rents through the patents that you get for it more stringent or the disease is getting harder I think it's you know what am I to say right and I don't think these are their easy answers here on this max I think that we've done the low-hanging fruit and the problem is getting much more complicated Chris you're nodding your head does that seem like a good answer to you yeah I think definitely because like the next frontier seems to be like personalized medicine which is a huge kind of new moving problem because a lot of the difficulties of kind of commercializing that and kind of making that viable although there's a lot of hype around it which is great right don't get too much data I mean it could be that you know maybe start doing something yeah well maybe now we're doing like way more right or like it's very easy that's true you know they say the worst lies of statistics yes that's true and all these could be lies but it's just a wonder one way looking at the problem right and this is a way of showcasing it but I would want to see the whole data to see wire behind yeah I mean generally speaking this report was well received in other words the experts in the community thought that this PCAST report was onto something that they had identified some pretty critical problems so tying to market for drugs has also been growing so eight years to market was 50 years ago it's 14 years to market now and the longer it takes the more you eat up your monopoly rent period which means you've got to make higher profits sooner which means the short term charges for the drugs get higher and them and you driven more and more towards the blockbuster of recovery models so this is this is problematic and you know it particularly affects small companies and biotechs that can't really manage that long-term risk period and there's a gap between research and product development as well and the whole advances in science are requiring different kind of models here so now there's much more focus on we'll talk about convergence in a little bit but much more focus on multidisciplinary teams rather than solo individual investigator ROI type results you tend to have to cross over a series of fields now to get your medical advance out and that's more problematic so ideas they propose and cats they cited the translational medicine entity at NIH that frankly has had trouble getting enough funding to really scale up to do what it needs to do a DARPA type model FDA exploring something called predictive toxicology and predictive toxin toxicity with a lab-on-a-chip kind of approach in other words there's new technologies that could be breakthroughs here and trying to solve kinds of problems so let me let's get through these I think we can just touch very briefly on craig Venter and then kind of dig into the legacy sector reading the end of the PCAST report just a quick question on Venter I assume you got him yeah I think my name is justice curry is one of the closes - mal ethical problems and just now we had a decision about how we wanna see speed-up of all the research or any pallets so we asked like how do we balance this raising concern by rising concerns of the public all this felt related research and the need to set the need for better drugs and better discoveries in the sense that yes like when I mentioned the role of media in in her sister that it said without the media pushing his results pushing his discoveries he's his team and his his work wouldn't be approved by this tyrant organization and the kind of discussion raised in public kind of gave him enough support to continue this attack process so I would say like what are the other ways to kind of balance this raising concerns and this need for better growth it's a very interesting point you know the fact that Venter was able to mobilize media support get them to understand the potential importance of these projects and what the possibilities were in effect help drive support for this whole genome initiative whether it was Venters or whether it was NIH --is it was a very powerful input and we saw there saw him and Collins on the cover of Time magazine that was just one example of the kind of media attention on this great scientific race information everyone was concerned and how how can this I mean the future will probably be more conscious if there any possible place of addresses sorry sending like change the structure so that somebody who is a good idea doesn't have to like completely go and fight is the current structure for it alongside a holiday we inform the public of this the potential benefits that it brings but also they're sure that these things are all good or actually work yeah I mean I think a lot about like the cold fusion scandal or is like they said they had it to the public so that they would get attention for it but like the science wasn't super like sure and so like there is a huge danger especially in the scientific community where you need to make sure something actually works has been tested by your peers before you go public especially if it's a dramatic discovery which I think the genomics project was and so that is a very hard position to be in at the same time though I think he leveraged a good amount of that like he he was I think it's more about being political or slightly Machiavelli and understanding the structure and like who can kill you in terms of like credibility or other stuff so he did a good job of actually making sure the science was good kind of having some stakeholders just approve his stuff but going to the meat and saying yo this is why they're gonna mess up and it's why we're doing pretty well and we're kind of David versus Goliath check it out was pretty interesting we don't usually talk about the role of media in innovation and science policy but we are you're right to point us in this direction because this was a highly public competition I mean as I say here it creates that competition could be viewed as just duplicate 'iv right why are private and public resources in effect duplicating each other in this race but on the other hand it was incredibly creative and it spurred both sides to greatly accelerate and focus on the problems so I think did the duplicate of research thesis really doesn't work here but the other dimension you add here is is you know how can innovators use public attention in helping to drive towards their goal and we watched in the Boyar in Swanson case how Swanson was able to mobilize media coverage and hold you know major press conferences when he had major announcements to make he and he and Boyer had major announcements make and their team so it's it's a dimension that I don't think anybody has really spent a lot of time looking at in an organized kind of way but it's a very interesting one how does public support affect your ability to drive an innovation project biology medicine are important they're like no Apollo 13 disaster was when suddenly everyone caring about space but only to get people who are about to die it was exciting so maybe some sort of response to the science communication problem would be getting information out there about the value of preventing the grabbing it doesn't look as cool yeah science fiction yeah that's kind of the role of science fiction yeah there's a like a utility principle on that I see I took of course on bioethics that semester I'm it was a part of something called which centers for public writing at Wellesley and this woman I guess who is coming in to speak with us about the role of media and establishing bioethics and specifically in genetic engineering and one of the points that she made on television that I can ask was precisely that science fiction plays an enormous role in helping the public become comfortable with scientific advances far before the time that those scientific advances are even technically feasible and so maybe as the scientific community or rather the scientific community should do a better job of involving themselves in the narrative storytelling process about what science is and has the potential to be in order to sort of set the stage for those scientific advancements when time comes and there's I think a huge market you know thinking about Marteen sort of business for comedy in say children's books about science fiction and the ways in which you know we as maybe someday parents right could be right reading these stories to our children at night having them think about the future and that aspect of science communication and especially science communication to the younger generations which will inherit you know the kinds of innovation that we create today are immensely important but there's not a lot of storytellers who are equipped with the technical knowledge in order to communicate that adequately in a way that's palatable to children and it's also palatable to their parents and to a you know the broader American market so I think it's really important to think about the sort of storytelling dimensions of science communication not just in the sense of you know what's in the news or what's going to be in the newspapers right but what how we're orienting ourselves to make this an issue I care about socially yeah yeah I like the idea of it preparing the stage so that people are receptive to advancements when they happen and not just the scientist makes a discovery and then suddenly is trying to drum up some work for something that they have to explain a why it's important first of all and then be what they discover it is so that's a pretty good example because one Braun was having a lot of difficulty getting funding for the Rockets originally so he didn't he stand up he wrote a letter to Disney because he was a foreigner I think he was from German so like no one wanted him to like actually do it and they're kind of stifling him and they put him in a reason to so anyway it wasn't really doing anything they wrote Disney Disney does a whole thing on the space but I think it's an important aspect in terms of really who are your stakeholders of the scientists you don't have unless you're like a billionaire and even if you aren't a billionaire you don't have the power to manipulate you're not like the president so you have to be able to figure out how you're going to persuade people and how are you going to use those different stakeholders in a very interesting war in a very sort of pseudo Machiavellian but smart way right so maybe there's an amendment to the legacy sector book that we've been using as our textbook right which is part of the role of change agents is to use the media right and to do storytelling because this was a great story this was an amazing story which people in the United States and the world followed for a significant period of time this great rivalry and you know Venter is almost made for me tea is a wonderful maverick you know fascinating character and Collins's as well so there was a powerful story to be told here and a great competition and a great race that made it a very powerful kind of media story for an extended period of time so Louie I had not anticipated this ask this tangent of the course but thanks for pulling us into it so let me go on to the next couple of readings so our textbook who's got that Chloe all yours but I think he gave an interesting lesson as it relates could really tell care he was talking about the problem he was dealing with which was using robotics as an organizational tool in warehouses and Superman interesting to me at first that he made the problem pretty interesting after a while but wait he framed dealing with his promises that he practiced having the mindset of evaluating the problem at zero and infinity as I said which basically translated to removing all constraints were pre-existing on the system and then seeing you know if he had infinite space or infinite money or infinite labour but he could accomplish the never what with his engineering solutions of C and it was a really good way to sort of brainstorm an optimal solution to the problems so I think it would be interesting to take the same approach to the inherent problems in healthcare delivery is a legacy sector if we could like you made an appointment when you were recapping this chapter that our system is currently designed to suit medicine as it existed I guess 30 or 40 years ago but not as it is moving into this exciting breaking ball today so if we could wipe the slate clean and not have any of the residual costs or like everyone started out healthily today no one had any illness and we didn't have any reason to a cost anything going perfect ideal world what and we had to redesign healthcare system from the ground up and this is a massive question but I'm just interested what you guys think that might look like like what would our innovation in that area we had no she I mean obviously you'd have tons of you'd have a bunch of the pharmaceutical companies would be producing it like infant drugs is the day of tons of light but from there I think you'd have a seem to be a bottleneck in terms of the FDA so you'd have to expend that significantly I don't necessarily mean like like they have the infinite resource it's just like if we started a completely perfect system for this time in like it I mean you want me to get an answer about of structured like how to say what the process just I guess elements of what what it might look like only think of more like the ones in what Chris was talking about with in der vielen striking about the personalized medicine component that's kind of how they're touting right it's the fundamental reorganization of health care delivery and one of the ways in which their I guess my English in isn't the sector is corporation that happen is through additive manufacturing so the 3d printing on Paris I was justice it's 3d printing useful in a lot of health areas so there's a new manufacturing Institute that's organized around regenerative medicine and tissue engineering for example using 3d printing as one of the technologies they're looking at combining that with synthetic biology and that's a very interesting potentially very promising territory as we'll get into in the next reading that's not biology right that's a whole series of new engineering strands that are starting to enter an IT strands that are starting to enter this territory and how does a system how does a system that's not organized around that change to accommodate those strands so they they sort of are they're starting to develop is to gauge what pill needs to look like for an individual to adjust it and also for it and they can't do that in my sort of commercialization process and the scaling potential right so the traditional production system for you know medicines is a batch processing system you know huge you build a huge batch and you refine it so it has the perfect composition spread evenly throughout and then you produce that but that's frankly not a man at modern manufacturing technology so a continuous manufacturing process is much more flexible potentially much more modular and adaptive to different you know components in that system ie different elements and different molecular structures and different components within a particular drug or a pill so and 3d printing is a very interesting adaptive approach so DARPA has been funding desktop pharmaceutical manufacturing with exactly that in mind right that we're gonna have to move to personalized medicine the military is gonna have to have it right for its own huge healthcare system which is funded to the tune of about 50 billion dollars a year a major medical system well it's a very large medical system and they're having to deal with changes and reforms in their own systems so they're moving on developing all new set of production technologies and on that one they've been working with an MIT team that's really quite interesting so but that again NIH doesn't do this right that's not an NIH is territory it happened that the military was interested in this this new DARPA biological technologies office happens to be intrigued with those set of possibilities but that's kind of outside the box of the existing system good phrasing yes I don't know I think I think we're going to focus on like the new section technologies focus more on the structure say I have to use the technology that we have now I would think about how I restructure the organization what are the like the problems and hardly caused by the incentives so I think this healthcare crisis isn't a problem of technology or even people or even doctors I think it's a it's an issue of acceptance when I say I'm Tiffany whatever you do so I'm like oh well let's tack it on and more toppings and like I end up having a huge bill and then also where as a generation now we have a huge kind of I don't yeah we have a lot more elders and young people and so we have to pay for these baby boomers so it ignores that context so we'd also might want to focus on probably like most of our costs we're gonna go to the two elders not young people because young people are fine now we have a huge portion of elders so what are their diseases how do they work order than being positive those diseases and how do I create my organization around that or maybe I just let me create a whole new medical system focus on this segment because I know that they're gonna be huge you know cost and I can get a you know laws of economics by having such a large segment that's probably the whole system's personalized for them and they have different needs than somebody who's yeah yeah one for then you probably have to have somebody go directly to them to how they're doing check constant levels so it's um it's very different and I think that could cut costs down or you can send somebody out to go or use an IT system reuse for robotics right those are all part of the menu that we're starting to think about Chloe a closing thought about this reading on legacy sectors yeah I think I think for me it was really eye-opening to see the part of the reading where you just listed you know five or six specific characteristics of how health care deliveries its draws parallels to like some sectors and I think those are probably the areas where any sort of reformers or animators would really have Coenen on and focus on building those restrictions - okay let's go to the PCAST report we're going to some research the drug development we were just talking about how do we incentivize from to take on more responsibly developing some drug that targets minority groups or that doesn't have such a big market and I want to introduce this model that Singapore has in insulin device they're small and medium-sized firms - to university 90 and trainings what they do is you can get a tax return or you can get a certain amount of fund as long as you are investing in your employ you know employees are in any forms of training that can improve your productivity and improves your research in any form and I think Singapore was able to do that because they are of a really like small small scale and they also count on their small medium-sized businesses to thrive as the economy but I want to know that if this kind of model can be a good reference to develop the health care risk sector in the US so yes so the models that we use is using them is to give an incentive to companies that are making significant investments in the training of their employees and their research teams to kind of significantly upgrade their skill sets as long as you can justify this amount of spending were able to that's what you have to show you have to chew to show some kind of increased performance yeah coming out of that what I thought about this kind of approach that can kind of encourage so that's interesting so that's like a roamer technology talent approach into a discussion we've been having on institutional innovation organization so it's an again you bring us an interesting piece of the puzzle I like it so let's go back to basics is there a talent need in the sector is there a talent shortage as there in talent enthusiasm issue here that we ought to be addressing as well it seems like there's a shortage it seems like there's a lot of enthusiasm around the field and like he's like as it's been a continuing theme to this class our good old American spirit and our entrepreneurial drive toward packing up and moving out of West or in this case West is genetic engineering all that good stuff so I don't know if Drive is really the problem I guess I think about I like to think about analogies and often in urban planning you know people compare you know the Scandinavian countries to the rest of the world and say well why can't we be like that right and there's various factors that we don't take into consideration the homogeneity of relation to their productive capacity the resources they have accessible to them the scale which they're operating but maybe their colonial history and the ways in which they were able to start to take advantage of some opportunities that we might not be able to as a country etc and so in this instance I'd like to sort of invoke that and cross apply that argument to sort of Leo's point about Singapore and then to really utilize that to chalked what max just said because I feel like we are situated in a very unique and you know incredible location for this kind of conversation but where I'm from in Texas right kinds of university systems and research system that exists that these kinds of conversations probably don't happen to that extent and the enthusiasm for commercialization is probably not to the same level and so I think I would come back with Maxie saying specifically by saying that perhaps we to then bring something you know a usual socialist ways to say that perhaps it is the kinds of talent that is missing or rather people for marginalized groups we have a decidedly public good approach to research and so they might not want to commercialize in the same ways that people who are being trained in institutions like MIT and Stanford are and it is perhaps that it is precisely those people who the government should be funding not major research universities that exist within a commercialization framework because those individuals aren't less likely to want to take the bigger piece of the pie and may potentially want to benefit and serve their communities much more which could prove to be much more disruptive ultimate who wants to take on Steph's economic model one you directly challenge me you mean well I mean it's nice and idealistic I love thinking that okay everyone's just gonna work for free oh we don't think they're gonna work for free nights and not the insinuation the insinuations that the profit sharing is going to the profit sharing model is going to be much different they don't care about making big fish blockbuster drugs so they'll make like the drugs that are like so they can't make the big fish blockbuster drugs they just don't want to profit to that extent which ends up being good for everyone okay so they're not profiting a good for whoa but the thing is you could take the other the other side the company's profiting means they can put that research know of that money toward new drugs as opposed to just develop one drug and you like basically go get breakeven and then they're just like what do I do I think they focus on drugs maybe also kind of limited like that gets we still want more drugs like that's fine but I think they have drugs that are targeted towards like maybe if I guess we talked about like a disease portfolio that they look at and it's very narrow and so there's two things here so I wonder if except suppose it might help like expand that disease portfolio so you have people who care about more diseases and are able to do more research in sort of different areas and then to I wonder if those who actually subscribe to this sort of let's say Big Pharma but kind of look like we're in this HIV a drug an incremental advanced type system do they actually care to the extent that I was trying to get at but do are they actually interested kind of solving this incremental advance problem or like are they in this or are they due to have a vested interest in what they're doing because they care about these sort of bigger fish like kind of cure-all dreads but they don't have the funding opportunities and kind of the means to kind of get out that we do institutions that were specifically excited by they convergence reading I think kind of keep him or really prove sort of ground coming from they cited Harvard University of Texas at Austin Carnegie Mellon Georgia Tech u Chicago and Tufts obviously you know without saying MIT because most of the people on that Commission or had some relationship to MIT researchers and graduated from MIT a four professors at MIT or a prominent you know political stakeholders in MIT so you know it occurs to me that there if it is that we you know really Revere people like craig Venter then and if it is that the convergence reading which we'll be talking about student Ozma's is putting a lot of weight on the potential of community colleges and of local institutions to train the workforce and the life sciences why is it that we don't give them the same access to funding opportunities that we're giving you know the sort of blockbuster research universities see that me I think the big thing is like so it seems like a lot this is like a easy mental model for most people or what they do is they think about it being linearly so the thing is like MIT Harvard and like cert institutions just have a huge collaboration of people so they're exponentially much better at solving certain problems and getting that and they have the credibility to go and get funding from outside sources whether it be government whether it be VC so it is this huge you know very unproportional nature of the Institute's and the way the system works but there are some good things to that what I worry more is like how do you create a new system to make all these smaller drugs and working on them more viable so I think that's an interesting place for a startup if you can figure out you know 3d printing of drugs or if you can figure out what it is like what is your kind of your competitive advantage in this problem and what is the current structure for the company to focus on the big pharma and how do you optimize for that so order so it's pretty much like art of war it's like okay they they already have a strategy they're big they have to focus on doing this in this and there's also called the innovators dilemma which is like they have to make you know five million in revenue off of this time I don't need to mix up in the revenue I'm big I'm smaller fish so like how do I create my system so that I can make these kind of drugs and make it big company based on focusing on those smaller drugs that are important to society that'd be like the the enterprise version you can probably come up with some parallel using government funding and government support and maybe it might be that FDA approval being more relaxed Ritu ping in the drug I'd have to figure out which ones are the best ones to go after in the beginning when I do I don't think Sen making the argument that oh how do we you know I don't see democratize but why can't everybody you like be in the pool it's especially when it's like there's two little impacts Wimmers and like in suits that I mean they're probably really good high school swimmers but like it just won't you won't get as much run through of the same so much lip service to the great groups model and the great group model itself says that the drive for profit is not the greatest motivator to innovation and if we are to consider that as true or to take that at face value in the ways in which the author's have presented their argument in the previous week's I don't know that the commercialization model for the life sciences isn't necessarily conducive to innovations in the ways in which we would hope that they would exist so step you're driving us towards you know so obviously some truly big-picture issues look we have de Sun we have taken a pretty radical capitalist model to solving this problem of innovation in the life science right it's pretty amazing that we have focused on you know a high risk high reward system that's completely dependent upon you know monopoly rents and major returns as the way in which we're gonna do innovation in the life science territory it's absolutely fascinating how did we stumble into this right that wasn't what remember and when we talked about Boyer and the conflicts he had with other UCSF faculty when he went off to create invent the biotech model with Swanson he got a lot of flack for this that was a radical departure he was leaving a university based research system but let's think back to the reasons why he was doing that because he wanted his technologies to scale up and be available and that was the option that he saw for being able to do that so he teams up with Swanson I don't think we're gonna resolve these questions today but it is a radical capitalist model and as we've discussed at length today their gaps in that model right there's only some things that that model is going to be able to address given the structural limits that are coming into it particularly the long term approval process that the FDA has to provide so you know drug companies hate the FDA because they have to spend 7 years and 1.8 billion getting through their hurdles but they also love FDA because they certified it certifies their products and guarantees a market for them so it's this odd love-hate relationship in some ways that's symptomatic of what we've got over this whole system and it's it is a system under stress at this point Lou yeah why don't you give us a closing point on this and then we'll go right into what I think the next part of the story is on convergence because I think it fits nicely with this I really do focus on a lot of how to incentivize innovation in drug development but I I do think that you know we still have this got a problem with rising demand and limited supply why don't we also divert a little bit for focus on developing a healthy population can any form of drug development and kind of research that advanced this process so that we can reduce the unnecessary demand for certain type of health care so that we can free a bit of our funding and resources so that we can focus on the render research process and look your point earlier you know which we debated about is there a talent problem here you know roamers prospector theory would tell us you're gonna get a lot more innovation if you put more well-trained prospectors on the problem right so I don't want us to kind of leave that point I think there's an interesting underlying point you made in in that area as well alright let's go on to the convergence study the report is called the third revolution the convergence of life physical and engineering sciences and it came out of MIT in 2011 you know my office the MIT Washington office helped work on this the project was led by Phil sharp and Bob Langer somebody from engineering somebody from biology obviously two of MIT all-time greats and you know the report tries to tell a story that the picture of the next advanced wave we're lacking a picture of the next wave advance the great thing the the genomes piece gave us and we talked about Venter in the competition with Collins and the NIH it gave us a story it give us a picture of what we're gonna get for this massive investment in NIH right it enabled the public to see a story and be told a story and understand what the results were gonna yield right we don't have a story for the life sciences that's out there now that has nearly the kind of power as that genomic story we haven't figured out how to tell the next story and that's part of the reason well we've got funding stagnation for NIH and the life sciences in general so the doubling was led by the genomics revolution NIH needs a new picture so what are these different revolutions so what what this report argued was that really the kind of first revolution in recent recent time was the molecular biology revolution and that was really the merger of physics and biology so Max Tobruk comes out of the amazing pre-war German physics community he he works with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen as part of that amazing community that you know we're living in in Bohr's house being trained by him he more produces this amazing talent team and this is the second generation this is you know Bohr and Einstein er an earlier generation and recur II and so forth this is the next generation out how are they going to find their project what's their project going to be and Bohr kind of urges Dell Brooke I just look at biology we're coming a lot up with a lot of physics here is there a way of applying that to biology and dill Brooke does this and then cyan and has to come the United States he has to flee Germany on the eve of the war and in turn salvador luria he is working with Enrico Fermi at the University of Rome he's a medical doctor right he's trained in medicine and he is fascinated with physics so he goes to work for Fermi working on particle physics issues so these are two people that actually lead this whole molecular biology revolution in part because they're doing this crossover thing that we've talked about before right they're taking physics and moving it into this new biology territory with a whole new raft of ideas that help mature and create all kinds of new thinking in biology and it really leads to molecular biology right you know the second revolution is really genome sequencing we've talked a lot about that already but essentially that's another one of these crossovers right that's taking advances in computing and certain other kind of physical science areas and then bringing them into biology and creating a whole new set of applications in the biology field that are in turn transformative so that's a that's a second crossover the third revolution here by the way are some of them earlier revolution leaders so that's Salvador Luria one of mi t--'s greats Nobel Prize winner that's Lori and dole Brooke teamed up together in the back porch of I think some Long Island Beach Resort Lori works in Cold Spring Harbor and but that's you know that's an amazing talent team and they really do create the intellectual and underpinnings from molecular biology that's Leroy hood inventor who you're familiar with that's Eric Lander they're leaders in the second revolution the great genomic revolution another crossover approach and then we've got this whole new community I've featured the MIT parts of it but this revolution is happening at many other schools but this is just the community that we're used to so Phil sharp and a left and Bob Langer who are the leaders on this particular report Tyler Jack's who leads the Koch Institute here Paul a Hammond who you know is chairman of the biochemistry department know chemi chemical engineering department but is doing an enormous amount of research in the life science side Susan Hockfield who's president and Sangeeta Bhatia who's doing amazing work on cancer you know it's it's an incredible it's an incredible community of talent again from a whole series of different kind of fields it's another crossover right it's engineering and physical sciences and computational sciences entering into the life science space with a whole new set of disciplinary perspectives a whole new set of systems perspectives a whole new way of thinking about how to organize research and so this is the MIT community you could duplicate this at other schools as well but it's a set of engineering tools are going to come here but also a whole concept of engineering design comes here right so life science systems tends to look at at complexity they tend to look at complex systems and attempt to understand the elements and complex systems that's the kind of weight the frame that biologists work from engineering works in a very different kind of way it attempts to organize in a very hierarchical fashion and set priorities right engineering design is a very different way of looking in the world so these two fundamental different perspectives are now have the opportunity of coming together here for what becomes actually a very different kind of research models so there will be [Music] new knowledge bases here that come about as a result of this just as genomics gave us a whole new knowledge base just as molecular biology gave us a whole new knowledge base the convergence of these different fields is going to create a new knowledge base but convergence is somewhat different because it's also particularly through the engineering side it could lead us to a whole new set of therapeutic advances so new technology shift over from engineering in areas like imaging sensors nanotechnology simulation modeling probability these are all kind of engineering lead sides of things that can now walk into the biology space so this reported MIT kind of laid a lot of the groundwork and frankly Susan Hockfield saw the promise of what these folks were writing about and created you know just up to just up the road from us created the Koch Institute so that we were you know walking the walk at the same time we were talking the talk here so the Koch instead was underway before this report was even finished because it was just so clear that this was an incredibly promising set of new research opportunities that were gonna create a lot of real breakthrough spaces in the in the life sciences so it's a there's a whole series of strands that we had already seen that you could call convergence like strands so synthetic biology and nano biology and systems biology bio and from a informatics computational biology tissue engineering these were all kind of strands at MIT and and in life sciences generally and the idea of convergence was ah these things are doing similar things we can understand us in a larger kind of way and take more creative advantage of it so will convergence play a role in the medical cost problems that we've been talking about we talked about the lack of incentives for cost control in the system so far we've been thinking about health care as a fan like rearranging the kind of financial plumbing right could we create different kinds of cost structures and cost incentives and so forth there is another potential answer here and it's back to the prospector theory in a way that you were suggesting maybe their innovation answers here too right in other words if you get a whole series of innovation based advances that can tackle a lot of these problems so for example you know NIH working away in supporting life science research really enabled huge progress against heart disease which you know it's breathtaking and really moved heart disease down a notch from you know a nightmare killer to a much more manageable health problem and that's you know that's occurred in the last 25 years you do that in a number of areas you can really start to affect the whole kind of cost structure and particularly could you have healthier aging so one one part of the dilemma for the current demographics challenge that's gonna be upon you is keeping my generation in the workforce longer with returns that are going into society right can you make me and my generation work longer generating returns that get distributed to all right that would solve a lot of problems that helps us rather than walking off a cliff that helps it manage you a much more of a curve so if we could do that that would be powerful and maybe that some of these convergence based technologies can really be significant enablers in ways that we kind of never saw before so that's an innovation based policy approach to a profound kind of societal challenge so there's a whole series of policy steps that the report argues need to be taken we need to have get across NIH stovepipes NIH which is all biology all the time on most days needs to be encouraged to be able to look at in fund other fields it's hard for NIH to do it because it's composed of biologists if it analyzes proposals that involve complex engineering how does it do the analysis right how does it have multidisciplinary peer review systems is it able to encourage ARRA once that have multiple pis not soul single pis that represent a series of different fields and disciplines it's how do we do education and convergence right so we still have stove-piped disciplinary fields but and they're producing a lot of talent but how do they get educated in these other fields so they can take advantage of it right do we need a new kind of approach in life science education and what is going to be no question about it this is a dilemma and look this has been a dilemma for a while for bio engineering departments I think we're getting out of that phase I think those are starting to really kind of take off in part because this model is taking off but we don't have clear pathways so I mean the model is going to continue to be that you're gonna you know be a biologist could can you get access to a series of other fields right maybe you're an engineer but you get significant access to a series of medical related fields as well can we adjust our training system and modify it so that there was a talented staffer in my office who said look we're gonna need a new language here in the life science innovation we're gonna need kind of our convergence creole a mix of different languages from different fields so that people are going to be able to speak across these disciplinary lines and understand things across these disciplinary lines you know that could be that could be pretty important you know that's the heart of this port MIT subsequently went on in a much broader based report that went across many institutions and this past year did it a report looking at what could we get from convergence in other words what are the promising convergence areas and what might be obtained from them in an attempt to get a much more strategic approach to convergence not just say convergence is neat which is kind of what this report did but really get a strategy together I'm partly guilty but actually get a strategy together around what territories and convergence might be particularly promising so I urge you to look take a look at that more recent report and that was much more widely shared across institutions Lu Yao some questions for us I think one of the most relevant discussion of the house would be what are the possible features that we can expect University level that will be probably encouraging this kind of governance I mean we have we go to a liberal arts college it's essentially the liberal arts for science and engineering model but what was why is it currently not like since they're proposing this covenants of researches so why is it not happening like with all this students with multi disciplinary backgrounds why are they not kind of currently working together across disciplines I would say and you know particular reference to our institution at Wellesley I work a lot with multi disciplinary stakeholders for facilitating currently and a big concern that faculty members have is that they won by the administration or not facilitated to do collaborations and to that they that a lot of people feel like having a an entrepreneurship a sort of innovation for the purpose of commercialization model goes against the spirit of the liberal arts education so I feel like in that sense you know research universities are very much well designed to sort of adopt more the liberal arts model than I think liberal arts colleges are designed to a dr. merliss stem model but you know perhaps somewhere in there is a model that can arise about multi disciplinary coordination but it would require facilitation by the administration to the extent to which I think I my team does a really great job of facilitating that at the institutional level the rise of kind of these collaborative projects particularly culminating in your senior year so I think capstone privates are a great opportunity to start encouraging these collaborative efforts I think course to does is pretty well the therapy alone I'm kind of product design course but the piece that I would take from that is at the beginning of the semester that have you that lists all of your skills and except break you about based on kind of backgrounds and then form teams that are like inherently collaborative so you don't have sort of lumpiness and all the students that are interested or have particular backgrounds in you know product design they're not all the same team you kind of spread it out and then I think if but be an interesting exercise at MIT do sort of a school engineering capstone project so they like to do a course where you have people that are interested into engineering but they come from the biology department the chemical engineering department the ion engineering department and then work together to for Alexis in my impression there's kind of two models either we train more multitudes for incidents like for me like I take three minds my major is like philosophy politics any comics but I'm not actually either so then the other option is is to have like a lot of very focused UDON's and bring them together to work as a team which model do you think would be more exactly being addressing our health no give you one person who kind of gets it for every single one of the issues but then you need somebody Jack you need some you know I read every single book I read two three books outside this course you know I know this in this just like like know so much that like it just like you hit them with like any any word into their like inspired so like you want like yeah but you definitely need something who knows it understands have a weed really well because really great engineers tend to not be able to communicate greatly so you have to be able to figure out and ask for what questions to ask that they won't tell you or figure out what they're not telling you especially when hitting deadlines and then another big part with the groups with these kind of groups is to like figure out where each person stands so there's like oh I don't think you're doing a great job or I know you have this deadline you might not make it I know you're stressed don't be stressed I'll check in at the 70 percent mark how are you I know I think someone's missing from the research in the Media Lab kind of does that but I nothing's been done for a very very hard research what I would consider like super luxe like it's all these problems are now at hand right as we start to seriously pursue this convergence model exactly how we're gonna cope with this Susan Hockfield used to talk about and other people have talked about it too t-shaped people in other words people with a deep disciplinary dive but capable of operating across fields as well and that may well be a pretty key feature here and then combining that community so it's able to communicate with each other but you draw on a series of different fields so what the organizational model is going to be is really critical here because again as we've talked about two classes ago innovation you know happens with people it's not these institutional organizational models and how do you optimize the opportunities for people to be creative so that's upon this model right Koch Institute is spending a lot of time thinking about this but actually Koch Institute is only one part of the convergence going on at MIT some like 130 engineers are now working a significant amount of their time at MIT in a life science side so and that's not unique that's going on at a lot of institutions now and NIH is a problem here because it hasn't caught up to be able to manage that kind of transition and embrace these different fields so that's the big funder and how do we how do we bring that institution along I think like having oh academics like yeah we're getting T people but let's define T is like somebody who is like a grad student or undergrad at MIT like I don't know if the best answer is to have a great group of T's question marks because also like this the like the background right it's like is the difference between oh I'm giving a really good like Bistro sandwich versus I need make a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand and I need to have just all the stuff we love McDonald's right so ideally I wouldn't want somebody who's already been in the field like somebody who has practical experience cuz I might start to build out a certain way but they have just seen phenomena right I'm like a great example is originally G when they were putting out the electrical lines but it's guy named Steinman this punchbag immigrant that couldn't even speak English when we got to the country and didn't really have a great game sentence on there I know any cookie did but yeah but he was just like this very very kind of somebody who'd never even be at MIT or like the Wright brothers right that it was just they had the practical experience that oh I think I can do this and trying it out also like just because of as an academics there's always a flawed ending organization and you have to figure out that's what you mean business you look at oh how can I expose their flaw and they're never gonna be able to go here because of the way this is their blind spot and so like you can definitely have a link what happened with the Wright brothers where it's like I can't work on this problem because there's no perfect theory and it's too much of a risk and I'm already you know 50 years old and I'm not trying to risk you know my reputation and make my friends make fun of me because that's too uncomfortable and I've already kind of all I've done my way and there might be some use like yo this is pretty crazy but I'm gonna try it and see what happens and I think in the paper there is a quote where it's like what's the point of research if you already know it's gonna happen but the way the system is sometimes it did incentivize you to just do like oh I know this is kinda bad I don't know who's gonna be perfect but I know it's pretty much gonna work out and I think that's a very that's okay as like so do you like likes capitalism I think that's a huge opportunity because like you know just make your company look at all the blind spots but I think that's gonna be one of the reasons why these models don't succeed and it'll be big failures doing if they fail right because of you like you said you spend all this money you got all these smart people and that can be a huge philia there so let's close i tempted to put the convergence reading last because it's basically a positive right in other words there are huge innovation opportunities that are at and that we're starting to move on so despite all the problems in the innovation system in this sector and all of its organizational gaps something really interesting is starting to happen so let me close with a comment from Elias Zerhouni was the director of NIH before Francis Collins he writes as science grows more complex it is also converging on a set of unifying principles that link apparently disparate diseases through common biological pathways and therapeutic approaches today NIH research needs to reflect this new reality so I think that's our innovation organization task here I think some lies nicely in a couple of sentences from Zerhouni a closing thought who yell but I don't think this meeting send a very positive message that this will need to search for and like holistic organization then kind of get our resources and so I I also feel like we are not addressing the problem of kind of instead of tackling all these diseases why don't we prepare like kind of educate this population to be more healthy like the way of to encourage them to have a healthier life right without preventive the stock and rather than just repair jobs and the Orang incentives in the system particularly to do that either which is problematic you
