 [Applause] [Music] my students are big fans of science fiction movies that self-healing ironman super stretchy spider-man were reconstructed terminator now materials we design can realize a lot of the things in the movie concept more than 10 years ago the robots did not have any sensors to allow them to have sense of touch when I discovered that the need in the robotic field putting sensors onto robots to enable human touch that inspired me to start developing flexible electronics that could mimic a sense of touch why can't we make the materials themselves to be like our skin chemistry can really make a difference in terms of making new materials enable new properties but to take the materials further we needed to put them into practice to test them in the environment we intend these materials for we're working on the next generation of robot hands touch is important for anything that moves and lives in the world this is a good example of the current state of the art for robotic tackle sensing underneath this orange skin is an array of little pressure sensors so it can feel pressure when it's grasping an object the next generation of robot hands will be a stretchy material like this but it will also have conductive traces in it sensors embedded as well as communications capabilities so it'll be like an electronic skin in my group we are using human skin as the inspiration to think about how we design the electronic materials for the future stretchable flexible can self heal even biodegradable just like our skin the molecular design requirements for stretch ability and conductivity are conflict with each other that becomes exciting a scientific problem right now we are trying to understand the molecular design rules for one property at a time there are a lot of strategies to make materials stretchable we work closely with polymers a polymer is a chain of monomers that are connected in series what makes something stretchable is amorphous soft content what makes something electronically conducting in the polymer is rigid and close packing understanding the interplay between those two and controlling it through different types of chemistry is how we are able to make stretchable electronics the material that I've developed is a conductive stretchable hydrogel hydrogel is a material that consists of polymers but also has a high content of water and because of that is able to largely mimic the mechanical properties of soft biological tissue we start by making hydrogels out of pita PSS a very commonly used conducting polymer at a very low concentration that serves as a conductive framework where we can then introduce other chemistry's and other types of polymer systems that can make the material extremely stretchable extremely soft extremely tough all of which are really needed for interfacing with soft human tissue the self-healing property came from the incorporation of dynamic valence sir for example hydrogen bonding in many biological systems hydrogen bonding exists we incorporate hydrogen bonding sites that can break if we stretch the material use force but this breakage is highly controlled so the material will not form crack and they can continue to elongate but then if we stretch it too much or there are cracks forming these hydrogen bonding they can reform even at room temperature then these polymers so we'll be able to self repair when the bonds are broken [Music] most of my conducting polymers consists of a chain of alternating single and double bonds so the electron can travel through this network we're interested in introducing a bond that imparts the electronic activity to the semiconductor without breaking the conjugation so instead of a carbon-carbon double bond we use a carbon nitrogen double bond and this is known as the amine bond when you add acid in addition to water to a polymer with this bond it will break the amine bond apart this chemistry is very important to design biodegradable electronic polymers in terms of applications of electronic scheme we look for places where they can play a unique role we work with collaborators in medical school to develop a solution where our electronic skin can solve the problems for the page fox collaboration we were able to develop a wireless device and have it do grade naturally we were looking for some way to consistently monitor the anastomosis after surgery we really wanted a biodegradable sensor because then we never have to go back in and take it out to simulate that anastomosis we've dissect out a single artery and then we take the flexible sensor and wrap it around there and secure it in place with two micro sutures we wanted it to be small flexible tunable not perfect product that not only is biodegradable but fire degrades away at a certain rate all of those demands go into the chemistry of the unique polymer that wraps around the sensor ultimately as we understand the molecular building blocks for property ABCD some of the design may overlap with each other then we can start to have combinations of multiple properties in one material chemistry is the enabling science to allow us to design better materials materials with the desirable functionalities with our chemistry we want to be able to manipulate the properties of such materials I have been inspired by a number of chemists who went beyond just designing beautiful molecules they really think about molecules which enable new properties or can change the world [Music] [Laughter] you
