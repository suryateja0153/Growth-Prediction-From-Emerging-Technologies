 My name is Don Yu I'm the product director of IEI Integration Corporation this is my honor to being here to give you a very brief introduction about our demo and our exhibition today this year okay, so please come with me to take a look into our presenting demo so as you will know AI becomes a big booming market so that's the main reason why IEI co-works with Intel staffs from last year to develop different kinds of AI accelerator based on Intel OpenVINO toolkit so first highlight I want to specially introduce here is our whole series about the IEI Mustang series AI accelerator card you can see here we have divided it into two product lines one is based on VPU which means it's powered by Intel Movidius Myriad X VPU and another one is FPGA card for accelerator and this is based on Intel Arria 10 FPGA so let's talk about VPU as you will know VPU is ASIC design so it can only consume very low power consumption like 2.5 watt but it still can generate very high AI inference performance so in this point of view we totally have several models to fulfill customer different demands from the low end one to the high end one first starting from the M.2 A/E key this small tiny module contains with one VPU and in M.2 we provide the B/M key as well and this one with two VPU Myriad X then we have another one for Mini PCIe interface for the general embedded systems that still have a mini PCI Express still can use this module Mustang to enhance their AI inference in the existing system so besides of that we also supply 4-VPU version and also 8-VPU version so from one, two, four, eight depending on customers' demands they can choose different kinds of inference performance to implement into their existing systems or their building systems so another part in here we want to specially highlight is this IEI Mustang-V100 this is the world first one-FPGA AI accelerator card powered by Intel OpenVINO toolkit so you can expect this one has much better performance compared to the previous different solutions IEI this year's demo most of the solutions will be implemented AI element into it it's all based on those VPU and FPGA AI accelerator cards, IEI Mustang series and also powered by the Intel OpenVINO Hello everyone welcome to Embedded World 2019 and I am product manager Brian from IEI today I will introduce our factory automation solution in the beginning I will talk about the OpenVINO because all our edge computing devices are developed based on OpenVINO toolkit and it is an Intel developed toolkit it includes all accelerators like CPU, GPU, FPGA and VPU and use just one API to develop your application and you can deploy your application in a way you want to run your application and we have two demonstrations here one is a LCD panel inspection the other one is PCB inspection system this demo we are talking about is AI work load consolidation because we have appp in the accelerator card inside so we can run two different applications in the same time and the left side is a LCD panel inspection and we run this application in our Mustang-V100-MX8 card It has 8 cores of Movidius Myriad X chip because we run this application in the VPU card so we can run the other application in the CPU here is the human detection system It can detect human passing and staying time and also their gender and the retail store can use those data to analyze and decide where to put their products so here is our LCD solution and then this is the PCB solution and we are happy to invite our software partner LEADERG software and we invite their founder - Min Da to introduce their product Thank you, Brian this is a PCP inspection demo there are two defects on the PCP boards as you can see we capture the image by using this USB camera and we use the AI algorithm to find this NG is a short NG and another defect is component missing in this demo it's an AI demo so we need very powerful AI accelerator so we use this one this one is the new product from IEI it integrates 8 cores of Movidius Myriad X VPU it's very powerful low profile and low power consumption it's very suitable for the vehicle applications for example we can put it to the bus to the transportation car and of course we can put it into the railway train in the demo we use this VPU and we put it into this IEI FLEX IPC and this IPC is an AI computer and if we need to use this VGA card of course we need a software library and software drivers for example Intel they provide the OpenVINO toolkit it integrates many functions and features for AI and there is a very efficient inference engine so we can use Intel CPU Intel GPU Intel FPGA and Intel VPU for our AI application but this OpenVINO toolkit is for software engineer only so it's not convenient for our customers of our retail reseller to use that we provide a new web interface to integrate the OpenVINO into the web interface to make our customers and resellers to be much more convenient to use the OpenVINO library and as you can see the interface is very easy so we can use the file open and choose different solutions for the data analysis and for the image analysis so we have many solutions inside this web interface and this web interface is very easy to use we have many libraries and there are many function blocks so we can just simply drop this function block into this flow if we need to have four loops here it's very easy and then we just press "run" then we can use the AI inference functions from OpenVINO it's very easy and of course we have many powerful editor functions so we can choose for example we can set a confidence very short by using mouse it's very easy and this is the architecture for this web interface this web interface the name is OpenR8 it integrates many popular AI frameworks for example Caffee, Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch and of course OpenVINO and we have integrated many AI algorithms for image analysis and of course data analysis for the image analysis we support image classification object detection and image segmentation and for the data analysis we support LSTM and Regression Forests and Convolution 1D and there are many other AI algorithms and of course for the AI hardware we support Intel CPU, GPU and Movidius VPU NVIDIA GPU AMD GPU and Raspberry Pi and other Arm-based devices so for our customers it is very easy to use our web interface to do the AI training and the inference and of course we have several application stories we provide this web interface to the wafer factory to do the wafer inspection and we provide this web interface to the IC packaging factory to do IC inspection and so on okay we provide this web interface to many industries okay thank you for the introduction from LEADERG and all of people are talking about VPU we have four series of VPU products and here we can see the PCIE interface VPU card and we also have mini small form factor products like M.2 and mini-PCIE because embedded box deployed to the factory they have very compact size box PC so we can use our small form factor products it can be deployed through the embedded box to do the AI algorithm to accelerate your applications and also we have a FPGA accelerator card and we cooperate with Intel to develop our products so another part we want to specially highlight in here is our transportation application so in our transposition application we demonstrate two different kinds of platforms one is based on Intel x86 another one is based on the arm-based which is a Rockchip so let's see the Rockchip first so this is the latest application we build based on Rockchip RK3399 which is big.LITTLE structure two Cortex A72 and four Cortex A53 so this is an 8-inch all-in-one panel PC designed for the vehicle users purpose so allow me to specially introduce our partner which is Cyberlink they offer their FaceMe app allow us to implement it into IEI AFOKAR then we can use that to do something like face recognition to do the check-in and check-out to check your status if the driver is drunk or you feel tired you want to sleep or something else in the meantime in this PC we have a secondary display so you can use the HDMI to connect with the second display you can put some advertisements something like a signage from here so this is very powerful and it also can adopt AI element into this one the last stop allow me to introduce our latest products so this is a very exciting product we want to introduce it to everyone in here especially in Embedded World so this is PEMUX it contains with the Xeon W CPU that is one so we specially design that it can deliver up to 50 PCI Express Gen 3 lanes from the golden finger to the backplane so in this structure it's more easier to allow customer to customize backplane only to fulfill their different demand in the PCI Express configuration in their AI application and another two this is a chassis our new chassis is called BRICK series and this is our FLEX I just introduced so FLEX is a very special design as a modularized panel PC design so this is the core system we also offer different kinds of the LCD panel kit so we offer from 15-inch to 24-inch so customer can choose different kinds of size of the LCD panel kit to fit into the FLEX-200 series and as I mentioned we have a very special tiny very special ruggedized and tiny design by the IOT gateway so this is our new product called ITG-100 Apollo Lake very small size tiny but if you have more expansion demands we can allow customer to add on another stack to enhance or expand the I/O or functions so this is another modularized design I want to introduce to the customer another one is our DRPC-130 this is also based on Apollo Lake but we are adopting industrial Apollo Lake which is 8-core 3930 then this product can support very harsh environment like outdoor it can support -20 to 70 degree Celsius operating temperature this is the one and also our TANK and our Thunderbolt expansion box this one is our new product line called industrial switch so we are offering industrial switch as well and the last one is our AFL3 panel PCs starting from this year our new generation AFL panel PC will have a very special design which is all of them will be supporting the PoE so this one is supporting the 15-inch wide and also based on the PoE standard so we can support that and also in here our subsidiary company QNAP brings their latest AI application they called this is OpenVINO workload consolidation tool you can directly upload your AI model into the NAS then the OpenVINO workload consolidation tool can directly identify the solution and the last stop we want to introduce in here it is of course the industrial motherboards all are still our mainstream products in this year we bring the latest technology from Intel which is NANO-ULT5-R10 this one is based on the Intel Whiskey Lake platform so Whiskey Lake we will launch in Q2 of this year so we bring our secret weapon and demonstrate it in the Embedded World show in 2019 these four boards are based on the Intel Coffee Lake as you will know we're gonna to have the Coffee Lake refresh first very fast very near so Coffee Lake refresh actually the key improvement about that is they are upgrading from six cores to 8 cores which means starting from these boards this year you can have 8-core CPU application based on IEI Q370 series products and another one is we have HYPER Apollo Lake it's PICO-ITX very tiny small but we try to implement all of the functions on this very tiny small board and these two are our another 2 PoE cards so we have 2-port and also 4-port both of those cards are supporting the 802.3at af PoE standards so above is my rough introduction briefing about the IEI at Embedded World 2019 and I hope you stay tuned our colleague will give you more detailed presentation in each demonstration in here thank you
