 okay I think we'll get started my name is John May I'm the director of the EM DES program here but also the area head of the history and philosophy of design and Media Group which we are co-hosting this event with GSD women in design and I want to thank women design for co-hosting Rosie and for hosting her for the event this morning I'm honored to welcome Rosie bow Brad o T to the GSD it's no exaggeration to describe Rosie as one of the most important living philosophers and a central international figure in feminist and posthumanist thought her intellectual project sits at the convergence of some of the most difficult conditions of our time asking questions that cut across all of lived life questions of gender and sexuality of Technology and materiality of politics power and marginalization and increasingly of ethics and the earth the past year has been an emotional one in the design fields perhaps nowhere more so than at the GSD and as we reckon with a troubling history of institutionalized gender discrimination and frequent misogyny we are also dealing with an equally troubling persistence of those realities in the present when this reckoning began I felt it could be meaningful to place these issues in a broader intellectual framework to ask of their relationship to the history of Western humanism and to enlightenment liberalism more generally these long unfolding cultural projects that have produced both good and evil in our time Rossi's was the first name that came to mind when i tried to imagine who was best able to help us in this project at a moment when our political culture is completely defined by kind of deepening anti-intellectualism it seems important now to reaffirm the basic principle that complex social realities require an intellectual engagement commensurate with those complexities that engagement takes hard work and patience and commitment and energy these are qualities that have defined Rosie's life rossi braduti is distinguished University professor at Utrecht University founding director of the Center for Humanities at Utrecht she was the founding professor of the Women's Studies Program at Utrecht established the first official ph.d program in Women's and Gender Studies and for 17 years directed the utrecht linden studies center a center whose enrolled student cohort now numbers in the hundreds she helped establish and later directed for 10 years the athena network an extensive community of European scholars and activists committed to women's studies that included at its height over 130 member instant institutions all over the EU and in 2010 Athena was awarded with the erasmus prize for its outstanding contributions to fostering social inclusion through education rosie was born in italy and grew up in australia where she received first class honours degree from the Australian National University in Canberra in 1977 and was awarded the University medal in philosophy she then moved on to do her doctoral work at the Sorbonne where she received her degree in philosophy in 1981 her publications have consistently been placed in continental philosophy at the intersection with social and political theory cultural politics gender feminist theory and ethnicity studies throughout her work she asserts and demonstrates the importance of combining theoretical concerns with a serious commitment to producing socially and politically relevant scholarship that contributes to making a difference in the world so please join me in welcoming Rosie Brett Doty [Applause] thank you so much dear John for that exhausting introduction very lovely great pleasure a great honor to be here and enormous pleasure to see some of my old friends some of the oldest friends I have Alastair Dean and I were graduate school together in the days when everybody was in Paris and lovely to see verinha currently one of the pioneers of Delors studies in the days when people didn't know anything about new materialism well I only had 50 minutes to solve the problems of the human post human condition so I'll try to use the slice to my best advantage there are many issues of method and meta methodology that are left totally unexplored and as to why I do philosophy as cartography so I just want to annotate that and say I'm not going to say anything about it but I'm very happy to return to this as the opening question if you wish what I would like to do is simultaneously evoke a number of critical conditions and around the state of what counts as the human and how that affects the practice of the academic and humanities and then immediately be very affirmative and very optimistic about the future of the field insofar as the critical post humanities are up and running really new fields of knowledge productions that should make us dream and hope for the future but let's start with a couple of critical remarks thinking about the human and what counts as the human is not something that humanists do humanists talk about the humans as polities as cultural entities as as political organizations and we are very very happy to actually leave the detail discussions as to what defines the human to anthropologist biologists and all of those people there are the specialists of life and a paradox built into humanity who prefer to take the human for granted and define it by what it is not and so the human is men and men is not woman is not animal is not nature it is not and it is definition by negation begs the question of what actually is our consensus and about being human and what counts as the point of reference the basic unit by which we would define the human amuse yourselves to go and have a look at how many festivals of the human and festivals of the humanities are taking place you're the designers and the architects in the cities of the world from Dubai Melbourne London and being human and entire cities going out of the way to try to festival eyes an idea that we actually have no conceptual rigour about being humans now a situation that I call the posthuman convergence which I'm going to go and try to define for you in the next slide forces us to actually confront the aporia's and a little sort of forms of avoidance that we have developed as humanists around the notion of the human and of course if you come from the radical epistemologies my political families feminism and anti racism anti-fascism you would have an open quarrel with and the human and I will return to that in the course of the talk as well and and if you come from the critical traditions then you will know that the human is anything but a neutral term and that man is defined as much by what he includes in his definition of his humanity is by what he excludes and then not only is it not universe so it is highly culture specific and and it is a term really the human that indexes access to power to be human enough or not human enough and is an indication of power and anything but neutral the condition that I define as the posterman condition brings all of this to the fore ever saw that I could just buzz this and it will happen here it is I described the predicament that we are in as a convergence so if you do Google posthuman or do a series library search on the posthuman you will find everything and the opposite of everything so let's proceed in order and describe it as a convergence phenomenon between critiques of the humanistic tradition and critiques of anthropocentrism now depending which theoretical political ethical tradition you are emerging from you may think that one follows necessarily from the others and Derrida argues that if you critique humanism necessarily anthropocentrism would have to come to the fore and if you look at the empirical reality of the scholarship that does not bear and to the evidence and a very strong tradition of critiques of humanism that really begins at the 18th century and we had an intern Universal Declaration of Human Rights with a French Revolution 1792 almost immediately a woman with the name of a lamp de Guiche notices that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights only applies to free man and rights the alternative a universal declaration of women's rights does anybody know what happens to a lamp de guiche anybody knows that heroine shield her grave is up in the 16th arrondissement of Paris she sent to the guillotine immediately because life is short and we got a revolution to run Thank You brothers 1792 to sell new vector in the middle of the French Revolution Universal Declaration of Human Rights he says well that's this applied to the slaves and the humans to surge any truth will have the same speech in the 19th century but in 1793 for to send over to triggers the haiti revolution liberates all the slaves establishes a free democratic and republic on the basis of the principles of the french revolution what happens to to stand up after the french imperial army goes in squashes the whole thing and he dies in captivity Thank You brothers it is the critique of humanism is actually simultaneous with and absolutely coextensive with humanism itself a point that Edward Said was to make later in the second half of the twentieth century as one of the reasons for the great longevity of humanism that it produces its own modes of critique so you don't have to wait for this crazy French postmodern is to come in with critiques of the universal it's always already been there and and it is I repeat the strength as well as and the weakness of the humanism so you can do all of that and at no point interrogate what past anthropocentrism puts on the agenda that is to say species supremacy and the idea over species anthropos that has granted themselves the right to access every body every organism that lives regardless of all the sociological variables class ethnicity race religion or the mantra of the variables anthropocentrism the two things run parallel but do not necessarily intertwine until we get to the convergence that we are in and a convergence is a set of cross over it's a set of interrelations it's not a linear phenomenon it's a very rise or make a thousand plateaus nomadic phenomena says zigzagging patterns of resonating causes and issues carried by the two fundamental events that structure historicity the fourth Industrial Revolution the knowledge economy also known as cognitive capitalism Arvid and on the other hand the sixth extinction and the dying of the species the dying of this planet these two events are happening simultaneously it's not as if we have climate change on Monday and an AI and synthetic biology of Tuesday it's happening at the same time how to think the simultaneity of boom and bust on this scale on this scale multiscale or mighty dimensional is the first human challenge you can say maybe this has happened before I do not know it certainly is causing a great deal of panic on the one hand as we will see in a minute and an incredible excitement on the other these are really the best of times and the worst of times and but how to think such dissonance such incredibly opposite almost event demands skills of endurance of imagination and of transversal connectivity trans versality is really the key term here you need to draw a line across and events that are not at all and similar or parallel even at runs the future is in the trans versality of almost everything so the argument I want to make we now need to look at this two phenomena look at the chain of theoretical social and political effects that they are causing and sort of try to steer a course that would allow us to actually have something productive affirmative propositional to offer but in saying we I will be honoring my French teachers and I'm a proper French person from the Sorbonne so don't accuse me being it's an American French theorist and European and we the category we like all category is not unitary and we is not one we need to be put carefully in inverted commas grounded accorded to the politics of eminence which my great teacher and favorite philosopher Jill dealers talked us very carefully grounded and feminism politics of location speak from somewhere and anti-racism anti-fascism be grounded be accountable for a specific location indigenous epistemology perspectives all of these and are the ways in which you can ground your statements which allow us to do a critique of universalism without falling into relativism the opposite of universalism is not relativism the universalism is perspectivism multiple grounded perspectives and so we is not one and the same but we are in the posthuman convergence together and it is a hell of a headache because we need to be able to think this the coming of lovely robust I love the kids under fantastic look at them cute and that will do amazing work for us will take a great deal of of our work and away and the drudgery of it they will look as kind of clean as caring as possible but we also have to think this and and I refer to the work of Jennifer Gabe Ruiz on digital garbage and you will even have trouble finding images of digital garbage on on the nets and because Apple and the other giant make sure that the only images of rubbish you see is organic rubbish an electronic a particularly branded one a dirty old Apple computer being dismembered by the same people that made them cheaply in some faraway land with the lithium batteries exposed with other toxic elements and pouring out you're not going to find many of those so jennifer Gabrus goldsmith on digital garbage we need to think I think I can go back right amazing when those machines work this and this and this and while we reach out for the first gin and tonic of the day keep thinking how am I going to make sense of all of this I will have a lot of these pauses because they're you know to be tiring so another quick run then you reach out for the gin and tonic and you have your meditative pose so crucial thing then perspectivism to enter this convergence you need to do your own cartography your own analysis of your point of entry people are working in design I mean it's almost ideal you've got the earth you've got the structures you've got the the three colleges that fellows guattari spoke so eloquently about the environmental the social the psychic you have a market to deal with you have and all of this and so your point of entry at least at the level of discourse and is pretty much framed and ready to go how one enters it ethically effectively epistemic Lee is quite another and meta people can go into total euphoria about the great perspective of this particularly the Silicon Valley type of people and other thing into profound posthuman melancholia thinking and the Disgaea is falling that it is all over and if you look again at the scholarship learning to die in the Anthropocene is the light motif there was a great deal of scholarship of the lament circulating about the sky falling and and the sort of the proximity of something that looks like extinction so let's get rid immediately of this Anthropocene shall we first of all for your applications don't use it it has no scientific value it has been discarded so you use climate change science that's what gets you the grants Anthropocene went back and forth but basically the geological society has not been convinced we don't have enough traces in the substructure of a planet over earth that is the different strata over over of planetary rocks there's not enough human presence to justify the change of our geological era to Anthropocene and beside the Anthropocene has become an entrepreneur I'll let you read it because it's as clear as look again the farofa did it totality of my presentation look at the day's look how recent and all of this stuff is it has entered a spin and and entering a spin is a form of epistemic acceleration ISM that I analyzed with the philosophy of dollars in Watari in terms of territorial ization x' and D territorial ization you take an idea a really good idea a minute later it goes wild capitalist interpreter and this is a very partial list people keep sending me new ones so please if you find more send them I collect them and because this I'm very interested in the speeds why by which this spins and take over so for me the Anthropocene is very vital because if you can have this amount of epistemological energy you are onto something good but also to fluid and in many respect it misses the crucial point of the convergence effect and that we really need to be looking at something that is not only an ending not just an extinction but also of course an incredible period of growth and an amazing scientific revolution let's face it with all of the consequences that it entails swinging moods is definitely an element of the anthropogenic landscape and the imaginary of disaster that the Hollywood machine pumps out there is really money in extinction there's money in catastrophes you know that and and it's always the same story white man dog rifle pickup truck and then planet is dead and it's always about men with a dog and a picker trap looking for the one remaining girl think of the second Blade Runner what a tragedy but but it's kind of like something like a format it's a template and that really codes the social imaginary or disaster and it prevents us to look further to look at all the other elements of a complex affective landscape and D I prefer being a scholar to draw your attention to the serious scholarship of anxiety quite quite a bit of that and if you know some of my previous work on the posthumous posthuman glossary you will know I've commented on this Fukuyama and posthuman future isn't it funny the guy who didn't want to regulate anything now he wants to regulate human nature a bit late but ordinary Habermas and after he converted to Catholicism the future of human nature his conversation with Cardinal Ratzinger oh my god what is happening to human nature Stroh denied Peter slaughtered I agree writing Heidegger's letter and humanism with this thing of the human Zoo and His Holiness Pope Francis and will find very sympathy k-- wonderful in cyclic a letter on caring for our common home watch out for Francis for as long as we have him how long he lasts but he is very much a climate change person actually is a capitalist in person blaming capitalism for it when he ran his seminar Acastus and over condole fur on the Anthropocene he chose his own keynote speaker and of course all the Cardinals at their classical people and you may know who Francis invited to the Vatican to brief him on the climate change of course he invited Naomi Klein who else would Pope Francis invite you should sit is worth looking at the faces of the Cardinals interesting you can take a couple of pages of that inside Foucault lesser I do that as a teaching exercise take off the name of the author and then I project him and I ask my students who has written this and year almost two thirds of the classes Felix Guattari because it's very very close it is it is continental naturalism but of course in the case of Pope Francis we have the whole sort of fabric there of natural philosophy and in the case of guattari we have spin noses vitalism two very different things okay so we can't do much with the Anthropocene but we take note of the the moods the anxiety the fear the melancholia let's face it depression and if it is true that we have 12 years to irreversibility of climate change well you know what's the point you may remember early 1970s when it was still possible to mention Woody Allen is a famous film where he shows a little kid saying if the universe is expanding why do I have to study now if if the end is coming why bother the why bother part and I think it's very much part and it hangs over the future of the Millennials like a particularly heavy generational question mark and so to kind of lift the spirits a bit and make things thinkable instead of making them so intrinsically opaque and oppressive and I would like to propose that we enter the discussion through a critique of the Negro political just cheerful character of cognitive capitalism and let me just give you the image and the consumption of commodities and the sell ability of everything this is the Vitruvian don't have to tell design and architecture people what the Vitruvian image is completely commodified into a system and we're actually planned obsolescence and design that kills time is part of what we do part of the game capitalizing at top speed on all that lives codes algorithmic codes biogenetic codes codes that are quantified capitalized formed for every bit of information that they can give us and data mining as the true capital and I don't want to you know talk about Piketty and the great great concentration of wealth or the great tech firms that run our universe but you do know that we are in a period of capitalism where the concentration of wealth is higher than it was when Charles Dickens first denounced the first capitalism and we have a concentration of wealth that is just abhorrent and with the twelve riches whatever people on earth owning and as much as half of the the rest of the population and this concentration of wealth at a time like this with the great disparities create enormous problems but let's not be simplistically Marxist Leninist and that is an ideology of the previous century that didn't produce great results and let's take stock of the contradictions of the sixth in dust or the fourteenth of the Revolution and the sixth extinction let's try to be what's the term and sentimental and a little bit lucid about it and partly because as people of science as scholars as particularly you people are in the best university in the world we really owe it to our intelligence to also rejoice in what we have produced as a most extraordinary scientific technological apparatus this is extraordinary and let's and that's where the next gin and tonic comes and synthetic meat how many vegans we have of course there's always a little bit of stem cells even a synthetic meat but a first syntactic Amburg are made in the netherlands the AEA in 2013 the first one cost three hundred twenty-five thousand dollars and few years later the price prices dropped to 11 bucks per synthetic hamburger we should be dancing with joy if we can may synthetic meat think of what this could do in terms of completely reorganizing the cattle industry the hoof what we used to call agriculture what he would do to the planet would be enormous and sort of becoming vegan of the planet and and yet every time I showed these images there is a slight sense of discomfort and I can see your faces but very often I get this utterly disgusted feted we go like like they look normal but they're not so can you hold the frame there for a minute what do you miss when meat becomes de materialized and when we are extracting the meat and or it could be the tomato and from its organic roots this is called eco nostalgia and I do think it's a far more widespread sentiment then we have had the opportunity to look about and it's one that we should definitely hold on to because it shows to what an extent anthropocentrism in our own belonging to a species how deeply it goes and while it remains actually unthought critically and kind of sitting in our system and oh yes actually yeah mmm synthetic meat yeah then you may not even particularly like meat yourself ok cognitive capitalism read with the layers in Watari they are the people to read a thousand plateaus capitalism schizophrenia on a system that absolutely capitalizes on all that lives that has no teleological system to cut a long story short why am i quoting the lesson Watari because they are bringing a Spinoza's ontology to bear on our understanding of capitalism in contrast to the dominant Marxist Leninist reading and of advanced capitalist it's really Spinoza versus Hegel in a famous book summarized by Pierre mashrae a book that was written in 1979 and was translated into English in 2011 - back with the dollars the explosion of interest in the laws if people had read pierre mechain between Hagen and Spinoza in the mid of the great the radiant deconstructive wave we would have saved ourselves a lot of trouble because we would have understood that the turn was from a direct dialectical system of a position to an actually monastic system of variations within a common meta-cognitive capitalism is something that capitalizes on living system natural cultural making money out of everything without any possible and way of containing it the biopiracy remark of and Anna Shiva very important if we are all part of a system that capitalizes on all that lives we remember position differently in different perspectives and need to work from within to make differences that actual matter and among the natural political aspects of a system that profits from life the world machinery as a private industry without humans in sight and the fleet of drones that China and the United States are building a most extraordinary advanced and systems and hardly any human in insight I have an alliance in the Netherlands with the Military Academy I work with them and they are very very worried about drones for two reasons they are suppressed in the jobs of soldiers or more job suppressions because of automation and secondly soldiers are humans they have a code of conduct for how to kill and there is no sense and a clear sense of what exactly is the code of conduct of drone firing so look at the war machinery the natural political governance is something that really belongs to the conversation about life - to say capitalism is a system that the commodifies and profits from life includes death includes the necro political includes various sectors of the population and there are simply infrahuman non-human and that we label refugees because we need to deprive them of the last vestiges of their humanness so the necro political is very much part of this this is at lecture on its own so I need to move on so I got two totally depressed I'm really happy because now I've got you in the middle of all of this wonderful things are happening and the posthuman convergence is a kind of way of framing this oscillating and yes but elements and which could also be described as where critical thinking is going in an era where theory is completely at a picture and the stems and life sciences are so central to the wealth and the power and the influence and of our countries of our of our culture and people would say of our civilization so the posture man is an indicator of our historicity and it is also a navigational tool the lens would say a conceptual persona that helps us illuminate what's happening to us where are we at and this is how I kind of fell upon it when I started reading it but ten years ago I thought let me see the fucose question what kind of subjects are we becoming what is happening to us I do this as excursions into the scholarship and what are the discourses are ongoing about our common humanity and I started coming across not what just one but multiple forms of post humanism like multiples and I let you read this and if you I will give you in a minute the slide or the posthuman glossary last year I put out a posthuman glossary for Bloomsbury you will find all of this defined in great details and if you look at that but the posthuman manifestos 2003 already so it's been going on for quite a while and and and and the differences between them which are try to illuminate later in a slide lays around are less relevant really than the commonalities these are all discourses that come out from you that still call themselves the humanities they come out of complete massively and of what used to be cultural studies media studies and please notice the studies because I'm going to come back to them they come back they emerge from areas that call themselves studies to a very large extent I have to mention my own political family out of loyalty I would say feminist theory feminism together with afrofuturism together with forms of anti racism or the theories that pioneer a sense of exiting from the human and what has the human ever done for me and why should I be loyal to a category that has only ever described innate 'add against me if you look at and Octavia Octavia Butler is an example but any elements of politicized science fiction you get this I think hilarious Alliance Tim Morton would call it weird I think it is a perfectly reasonable alliance of all the marginals the excluded and the downtrodden the disqualified and women abilities trans migrants tada the animals the machines all united against the Empire of white men that takes care of almost the totality of science fiction and in the 50s and 60s and very strong enough for futures get me out of here why would I be loyal to this category I think it would be very interesting to see how this mode of weirdness and evolves and and changes in the Anthropocene moment we're actually out of what out of what could we possibly go as the planet dies under our very eyes how the the post anthropocentric twist really changes and the dates they the frame that conversation here it is wonderful I can't say much about it was two years of work and worth every minute and and very useful hundred and two different entries giving you a sense why am I saying all of this to give you an idea of the scale and the quantity of the work being done in the posthuman converges to call it a crisis doesn't even approximate and the quantity and quality of the work being done this is no crisis this is a completely new start this is a change of paradigm I know you don't believe me so let's go to the institution's let's start from not just any universe it is up there with you people Oxford transhumanists a Nick Bostrom that I show you in the other slide and Oxford transhumanism this is Oxford so we don't have time to waste the Institute is called digital for the future of humanity you know nothing less than incredibly interesting google it go and have a look at it and a full posthumanist strand and yes it is the Silicon Valley ideology of transhumanism but this is oxfords we've got big brains here very cleverly reformatted in a language that gives you what I think is the axiom of cognitive capitalism and so when you do your applications you do what the Oxford Center does and the axiom is as follows analytically you are posthumanist you do know I mean you're you do know that we have a fourth Industrial Revolution a sixth extinction we have AI and we have a problem with climate change we have synthetic biology and we have droughts and bush fires so analytically you're a posthumanist normatively you're a neo humanist you better make that very clear and that's exactly what buster is where he gets all the money in other words he presents did the post German evolution as the accomplishment of the Enlightenment enlightenment after all was a rationalist project of the perfect ability of humanity through science and society and technology and so now we have a humanity that is failing under the weight of the incredibly intelligent computational systems that we have created our brain how your yo-yo is much slower than the computational system we have created mark Hanson is edited a lot of the people of Media Studies are onto it support are we going to do we are going to enhance the human and accelerate our brain human enhancement and that is the core the arcs for transhumanist the project is called super intelligence and it is extremely well-funded and you would do well to go and spend some time there Cambridge is trying to ram it it and they cute they always do this and the end of Agartha they obviously to Cambridge as a center for the study of existential risk and run by a data genius Martin Rees an astronomer royal strawberry guy and they assess the risks of this which are not nothing considering that we are talking about human enhancement and it's a all feminist and anti-racist I would like to know who gets chosen for enlight for the enhancement and who actually doesn't even qualify for the selection but ok in your app a little bit more diversified Sweden has been up there the post humanities hub it's been running for over 10 years go and have a look at it very well-funded and there they do bring in both the critique of humanism and the critique of anthropocentrism they do the race they do the feminism they do the migration they do all the variables as well as looking seriously at the environment god bless the Social Democrats of the north the Germans millions over 50 million euros for the Anthropocene program that the deutsche museum has could have the world Rachel Carson Institute in Munich and followed by the Technosphere project which is still ongoing now design media trying to come to terms with the big convergence very interesting here the role of design media museums non academic institutions you will find this a feature of past human scholarship their big impact of non-academic venues for knowledge production but that is one of the features of cognitive capitalism that knowledge is not longer the monopoly or the prerogative of institutions like the University which for centuries have been the producers of knowledge now knowledge is now commenced coextensive with the social field as a whole and there's so much knowledge may be produced outside the academic institutions and with the post human condition it's it becomes almost painful I would say the good side of it is that we need the creator's the designers the artists the engineers of the imagination we need all of those people to help us but the question of what the universities itself can do and how the academic disciplines will interact with this is as my rector says a very good question look at Canada Brock and just outside Toronto a whole posthumanist Research Network very well funded by the federal research council and the people of our house in Denmark with and at seeing is a permanent visitor again Danish Research Council money journals up and running and stopover on dates and they're older roads seem to lead to Korea but they editorial boards are of course international so we have a very well-established emergent field emergent but actually institutionalizing very fast and notice the capital coming in the money going in these two grants and it's not outside the flow of capital far from it okay academic response and probably I'm going to run out of money how is the posthuman convergence registered within the academic world with the explosion of fields that are the critical post humanities they call themselves ecological environmental and sustainable organic greater exactly cetera have will come but this is just the first taste of it and I'll come back to them in more details in a moment what is crucial about this field is that they called themselves the you manatees and and I'll give you an example of how else this could have gone if you look at how generations of critical studies since the seventies addressed similar questions you can look at the what I call the first generation of critical studies gender feminist queer race post-colonial subaltern cultural film and television actually I remember theater studies and I'm that old television and media is and performance that studies I think what we have here is this mushrooming infrastructural effect which was the evolution of the studies discourses that really promoted interdisciplinarity connection to the real world a radical thinking theory and for decades and some of it are still there not all but some of them are still there I see the first generation of critical studies as event basically taking on humanism taking on the limitations of a certain idea of men and what most of them do particularly the race post-colonial the feminist is they expose the compatibility of rationality and violence a reason an exclusion and they do so in a manner that makes the voices of the excluded not only audible jirobo visible but it makes them productive of knowledge it's a way of showing the knowledge that is being produced at what we used to call the margin a second generation of studies emerges more recently the 90s where we have non-human object of studies animal studies and eco criticism would be almost emblematic of this but we then media theory that I will give you a special slider because Media is again the indicator of this the shift from critiques of representation to code to analyzing code and those shifts and where representational shoes are left behind and you're looking at the material structure of the discourses this this is also known as new materialism or a turn to more object-oriented way of looking at the object of studies which is very very recent in relation to the more critical tradition here it's man and his others here it's known humans keep coming in and very big time and my favorite for the moment is critical planned studies but that is also going to evolve and so if you find anything else and please tell me notice how critical comes up my favorite is critical management studies and I would love to know what is critical about that one but you get more object and oriented way of giving of giving an object of inquiry near media remember when we had new media and my favorite lemon is post node and studies but that's also it's also evolving and what used to be necro political is now breaking down to a number of other areas where the inhumane aspects of the present conditions are in unfocus death studies enormous because of the appalling statistics of so young sort of beautiful suicide and general burnout look at the University of Bristol and bath in the UK death study is a growing area there'll be jobs there Martin I don't mean this cynically and very interesting forms of transdisciplinarity so all of this we have always had but the critical post humanity is a qualitative leap it's a different ballgame and and and it's a very recent one and it's this I'm repeating the first slide that you already seen I'm adding another one Medical Humanities and remember the days when the Medical Humanities basically did death studies it was about accompanying people in a therapeutic manner through the ending of their diseases now it's a whole lot of things and neural evolution humanities criminal resilient money public humanities civic humanities and you will not be surprised to know that the meta discourses are also following that there are multiple discourse that the matter Pat earning is already happening and and I wish I had written the one about nomadic humanities but it didn't even occur to me and it's Kate Stimson they did it but all of these are very recent publication I think Kate Hale with the digital humanities has to be given her dues here so the question here is what is happening to post human knowledge production to go from this reliance on critical discourses disgusted at a critical of humanism or critical of anthropocentrism to a different ballgame which is actually coming up with his new humanities of which every major university is richly endowed I think the center for environmental humanities environmental history at Harvey is one of the pioneers of this and digital humanities and Duke pioneers but by now every research university has its environmental manager digital management it's like the new mantra so what is involved in this and this is the subjectively new book human knowledge coming out great and order it terrific but I will give you the quick and version of this critical post humanities no longer assume that the subject of knowledge is hormone a merciless and or anthropos they are assuming a transverse so knowledge production and entity transversality and more complex embodied embedded nonunitary relation and effective transversal semi-nomadic subjects is an example of these but people are doing complex assemblages with all kind of other philosophies you will find a lot of Whitehead you will find a lot of Vidkun Stein you will find a massive return of the American pragmatists varied complex process ontology is coming in to give us a transverse or subject position but that transversality being able to sustain the effort to think the human convergence and and I think the in terms of the work ethics linked to a collaborative mmm a collaborative morality and the collaborative morality is the ethics that we get from Spinoza and contemporary reading of Spinoza and I was interviewed by one of your people on the but I think it's on the website of your school so if you want to know more about the affirmative part of the story please look at that text because I can't go into it right now so neither another universal nor anthropocentric a collective assemblage I think you will find the term assemblage in a lot of the meta discourse certainly in Katherine Hale in the London in my work as a way of positing a trans type of subject that can hold in there in a process of metastability and in in order to cope with the challenges and try to make sense of what is happening to us of what can we make of this particular political economy of knowledge production in terms of attempting a critique one thing is obvious and clear that the missing people are missing and the usual suspects are not actually being capitalized and not being territorial eyes to the same extent and I haven't seen non nationally indexed humanities in the literature feminist queer humanities I haven't seen any institutionalization of that black humanities migrant diaspora humanity poor trailer-park humanities I owe this to Richard Rorty in his 1998 masterpiece I think accomplishing our country and in that incredible analysis of where America is going and he's talking about poor trailer-park humanities nobody's looking at the poor decolonial humanities haven't seen the child's humanities otherwise able or disabled humanities you will find the scholarship but not the institutional reality so do we have a situation here where the people that have been the usual suspects of exclusions and marginalization are once again being left out of the picture or are there science that actually there is a convergence there between the socially excluded and the new discourses of the humanities pathological optimist that I am I couldn't leave you of course and with something negative so yes there are strong and evidence now of planetary differential post humanities as I call them indigenous environmental and digital humanities quite a movement led by graduate students budding and emerging but very strong online and web sites networks but the indigenous perspective land rights perspective meet the Anthropocene meets the legal issues meets the representational issues meets the cognitive issues producing a different way of doing the post humanities post-colonial Green pretty establishing complete transnational environmental literary studies queer new humanism Zinn in a variety of ways but very much at the center of the discussion because of their perspective estrade indigenous knowledge and cosmologists and we just put out an edited collection called posthuman Ecology's where the issues of land rights indigenous philosophies and post human thought is debated afrotheria not at all you know harmonious synthesis an area contestation but incredibly alive that does not forget that for so many populations under the sun population that have been depleted by colonial violence extinction is a sad reality and that they are the engineers of survival as well as the oldest shepherds of the earth so the whole discussion of what used to be post-colonial theory being reshaped in a very material manner through the encounter with indigenous epistemologies but for me then the issue more than ever is how can we as people who are committed to think way through this posthuman convergence how can we who are in this together but are not one and the same develop a set of values of attributes of terminologies whereby we can think differentially but together but the challenges the contradictions the exhilaration and the exhaustion of the fourth Industrial Revolution and the six extinction together in a materially embedded way becoming in and with the world because guys we only have one of those thank you very much [Applause] so we have some time for questions I'm gonna start with one and then we can there's some microphones we can pass around Rosi I'm just curious one of the issues I think that has arisen at the GSD and I'm sure in many other institutions is what to do with the Canon I mean that's not really a new question in a lot of ways but I wonder if you could just give a few of your thoughts because you're quite open in your own work about the debt that your work pays to to the philosophical traditions that were that in certain ways may have been exclusionary of or carry many of the exclusion 'el kind of aspects that you've described tonight and so I guess how do you take on this kind of double-edged sword of of the Canon in your own teaching and we're dealing with it here the GSD not only in terms of the textual Canon but also the the architectural Canon and and how we might restructure certain kinds of courses to simultaneously open those up but at the same time retain what was good and what we what can be retained of the of the tradition of humanism one of the easy questions thank you thank you very much so then I have of course like many people in my generation a double disciplinary origin and very much part of the continental philosophical tradition and very much part of radical feminism radical anti-fascism and radical anti racism so multiple genealogies and I would say that is true of most critical thinkers and that you of course you rely on a Canon and you grew up in a can and you indulge in a Canon but you are fed by multiple other sources and and I think that's crucial because I would not want any disciplinary purity innocence I don't even believe that researcher thing is a Canon but there are disciplinary ecologists of belonging and I noticed a morning if anybody's in philosophy out there that as one girl grows older your original discipline becomes back and texts that you used to read 20 haunt you back in 10 I can't believe I'm rereading this one again so a discipline is an incredible passion and philosophy is a hell of a discipline but are the radical epistemologies that led to the critical work on this so how I do this is again by complexify in the issues and Spinoza's diligence is that is the Neo spinosus because it brings in a continuum nature culture and we are all part of the same matter there is one nature and we are part of it we are variation within the same matter now if you are in neurosciences and think of DiMaggio or if you are in genetics to say we're all part of the same meta is a banality if you say that in the humanities particularly with the history of Vital materialism being complicit us with fascism and with colonialism and if you're in this within the humanities we say you know we are in a continuum with nature and people get really strappy and you'll get yourself in real difficult and situations so in relation to this particular problem which methodologically translates into the fact that our dominant hegemonic methodologies social constructivism one is not born one becomes and if that is still they did early 20th century method then we indeed we can't think a nature culture continuum in relation to that then I do a de leurs in the sense that I say you know what within our own tradition within our Canon we have texts that allow us to think this Spinoza allows us to think a nature culture continuum that's what he does and that's why Hegel was so irritated with him and that's why the Marxist but you G's are so irritated with neo Spinoza's to which de leurs is the most eminent but of course Negri of course and bali-ba Marty Horvath it's a long list in fact what people known as post-modernism was simply post Marxism it was the switch to Spinoza and that's what went on there but de leurs is at the core of this and didn't quite get translated as quickly and his impact on the anglo-american world was not as large as Derrida and the more linguistic oriented so this fundamental point some hot and was delayed but we do have this in our tradition I think it's safer also for youngest researchers to go back to the past and say we have the Stoics stoicism is learning to die Marcus are aliens and Montaigne Seneca these are incredible thinkers who prepare us for to die so don't get into a fit of Anthropocene anxiety or it's and Seneca do some stoicism and then maybe we can have this conversation without completely falling out of the discussion last point and all of this plays in relation to the spatial archive of the discipline but the loss is also helpful in another level is about the temporality of this and the Burke Sounion turn that de leurs activates in his thinking allows us to in a brittle but is I did it in the Tanners at Yale and also is very strong in them in the next book the present the present is not one block of either anxiety or of excitement it's not one thing it's a thousand plateaus of temporal complexities in fact the formula that they offer is the present is both the record of what we are ceasing to be and the seed of what we are in the process of becoming simultaneously and the actual and the virtual so you can do the present like the record of what we are seizing to be and we are ceasing to be men you see if I care we are ceasing to be anthropods but we're in the process of becoming a thousand other things as some of them wore me sort of a little bit and if we are looking at this list of what is missing and what is being proposed well things can happen in here some of them you think of him but we are in the process of becoming something so it's dissimilarity of temporality that is also important the crucial thing is to get activated to think through and not cave in thinking this is the unthinkable and why would a convergence however multi scalar and complex be unthinkable and what is the regime of think ability that we are applying to the analysis of this work and part of my contributions to try to make this very thinkable in chunks that are possibly and to go I'm also very cautious in relation to the starting researchers don't fall out of the Canon we want you to go on get your PhD become professors around the world run Harvard so don't drop out drop in then do the work and revive within the tradition and other sources in a dialogue with multiple other sources that come from other cultures and other traditions and hard work but hey we can we can do it I'm not sharing so and enough Thank You professor for the excellent speech Janice from East Asian Studies civilizations so as an area studies scholar my question is if post humanism can truly offer a point of entry for scholars like us what area studies were you know that's the all the studies that you present is that areas that this is missing so where do I engage with the posthuman era thank you fantastic yes this is one thing I'm so glad because this allows me to make my method methodological point one thing about cartography is like this survey you're the designers an architect this is a way of surveying the field it comes from my perspective so it is limited and it is very partial that partiality does not make it and invalid it makes it objective within very limited parameters there's a whole discussion about this in feminist epistemology the work of Sandra Harding on the privilege of partial perspectives and I couldn't possibly be all comprehensive and couldn't and I wouldn't want to and I think the idea of cartographic renderings of a field of research is very important because then the dialogue would consist in comparing cartography and and and and I think that's how Foucault actually was thinking and then it was too young and and and I think that that cartographic method is a way of daring to take on the present and and I always take on the present as more what were in the process of becoming then what we're seizing to be but many of my colleagues are focusing more on what we are seizing to be if you look at biopolitical scholarship it's all about death and destruction and what we're seizing to be extremely valid extremely important and the bio political and bio power is very very alive but it's not what I do I terms of what we should do with the station studies you just given yourself a task but what I do know is that the the Asian region is a whole as married into transhumanism massively really up Korea I mean the two journals that I showed you come out of Seoul in the both the transhumanism and the posthuman studies eternals and up and running did you owe me to show you two slides again Korea is producing some of the most cutting-edge work on this Singapore as well but very much within the Silicon Valley ideology not not this is a short term for the transhuman that we would simply download whatever there are consciousness into the computer that dead Saddam's sort of summarizing a much more complex story and there's much less critical post humanism there's a lot of interest particularly emerging from Buddhist circles or critical Buddhism reaching into Spinoza Zhan Spinoza and Taoism work really well together a lot of work in pockets in China but I think you have to go to Korea bits of Japan Singapore to see this happening I think I think the other place where this is playing is of course in the East Asian empires and notably the Chinese Empire in Africa where the Chinese are building universities at a speed that is breathtaking and they've simply phased out the humanities is it's its own stem and engineering and and the humanities is not something although they did the People's Republic of China's has built humanities in China that with this talk of two thousand you humanities faculties but in in in the new empire that is Africa this is not happening so you have already a model that that has phased out the humanities so I think it's a fully absolutely lively and airy I see East Asia as an imperial power colonial power as well as as local and and with vast repercussions and I would I was if I could my work is translated in Korean Chinese in all those languages and people say yes we need the critical humanism bring in the body is the perspectives and not just the algorithms and so I'm very hopeful but I am a pathological optimist sir I think thank you for your presentations it's very engaging my question is in the context of cognitive capitalism as you said the institutions are very advanced to rethink those you would say insufficiencies of the previous humanities are the ones that get that needs to get fund in other words they are where the capital the capitals in the academia converges so how do you think of this paradise it's precisely who who is at the height of this hierarchy of capitalism of or of this of inequality that's rethinking about it and would you think that would produce some sort of in part partiality or would you think that would be a acceptable phenomenon enshrined into the second half of your question but the role of the universities in this is capital literally and its central and the university is us and I happen to be profoundly in love with the university as an institution and and I'm not saying that to be slimy because this is an Harvard I would say it in any other university you know universities are centuries years old and Bologna the oldest we have in Europe is nine hundred years old and Coimbra is seven hundred years old my little Utrecht is three hundred sixty-five years old we've been there for a long time and we've been training partially with difficulties business with exclusion but we've been training young people through massive crisis and we survived the introduction of the of the printed press we survived it do you know the emancipation of women and we survived decolonization we almost survived internet it's a brilliant institution it's a brilliant institution why should an institution with such pedigree with such energy with such nobility in the heart take as its model the corporation a fraudulent bankrupt dishonest very recent institutional structure that actually has gotten one thing right certainly not since 2008 why should that be the model and not us we've been training training decent discerning creative critical citizens for centuries now give us a break we are the model and we need to remain the model for a 21st century democracy of cognitive critical capitalising citizens who can make a difference that's our job and if you look at the charter of the great university Edinburgh but Harvard also essentially we are charities with big endowments on the stock exchange but we're a public good we're here to do things for the love of the world that has to stay our central function and I think that's what it critical the critical thinking cannot just be negative and scoring points and spreading nihilism cynicism and depression and you know just gin and tonic is good but let's not go overboard we need to energize we need to give people a sense of the possible we need to put the DD active back into activism and thinking is really about dreaming possible scenarios and only the University can do that you guys your intelligence I don't even want to know the scale of your intelligence you can go through Harvard with a pinking playing ping-pong with the other hand and and or even noticed that this is happening we are under employing your resources massively not because we don't know how to do it but just because the means of cognitive access that you're disposed are enormous and imagine that we actually activated everything that you're capable of doing and thinking imagine being penalized being potentiated to the nth power of what you're capable of doing just imagine not in the Silicon Valley merging with the Machine going singular and running the globe but in the sense of opening up to the possibilities that the world is giving you Spinoza's definition of the ethical life as the opening up taking in the world taking it on taking this convergent shaping it in the direction of general positi solidarity fun as well as profit and how about saying capitalism is a really bad interpretation of the market economy there are different forms of market economy that we could do Commons oriented and more shareable and that's really in the hearts of the Millennials everything you stand for is sharing and not leaving anybody with different forms of the market economy why couldn't we use a university not just to apply the banality of what already is the case and is already ceasing to be but also the university is dreaming up what we in the process of becoming we've done it so well in the past now more than ever I think so universities let's let's end on that I just also want to announce for anyone who's interested in continuing the conversation we have a session with Rossi tomorrow from 3 to 5 p.m. here in gondhal in the Stubbins room which is rich if you can't find it ask a tired architect who's walking around the building because I don't know the number but it's called the Stubbins room it's adjacent to the cafe from 3 to 5 p.m. tomorrow and that's just an open forum to continue this conversation thanks very much to Rosie
