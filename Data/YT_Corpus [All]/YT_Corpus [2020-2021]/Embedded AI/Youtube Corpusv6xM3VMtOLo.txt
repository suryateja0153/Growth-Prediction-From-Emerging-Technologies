 (futuristic funky music) - My name is Jacob Lassen. I'm product marketing manager for MCU products in Microchip. I'm in Nuremberg for Embedded World. We're here to show you a lot of new products that we have and a lot of new features that we have for the Microchip microcontrollers. So what we have here is a demo showing how you can use the AVR Atmega4809 ADC. So it has a lot of new features that really can help you work with environments where you have a lot of noise. So what we have here is the explain board and on this side we have a signal generator which can also be used as a noise generator. On the board here, on the tablet, we have two different signals. One is a raw signal from a signal generator, and the other one is the signal that is actually measured by the ADC. Down here on the control panel we can control the different types of signals that we are generating and what sort of noise that we would apply. So if we start by switching on a random noise source you can see on the signals here both the raw signal and what is measured by the ADC that really have issues picking up the sound wave that we wanna measure, but what we can do is that we can enable filtering. So we do that by enable the over sampling and by turning that up gradually you can see how the signal is cleaned up. Another noise source that you could experience would be periodic noise. So what you can use is you can change the sampling frequency a little bit or rather you change the sampling period, and by turning that up you can actually take out the periodic noise out of your signal.
