  I'm Gabriel Pascualy, and I'm the lead instructor for embedded security and hardware hacking. In today's distributed computing environment, the ability to update software after it has been shipped to the user is critical. Medical devices, consumer electronics, and self-driving cars are only a few examples of systems that require the ability for companies to remotely fix bugs, add new functionality, and patch security vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, remote software updating doesn't solve everything, and even creates its own set of security concerns because of added complexity. Bad actors may try to read the updates in order to steal or reverse engineer precious intellectual property, modify the updates to insert malicious code, which could cause the device to malfunction, or use the update system to install old versions of the software that have known vulnerabilities. In beaver work summer Institute's embedded security and hardware hacking course students are put through an exercise of designing and implementing a secure software update system, and then learning from their mistakes. After completing their systems, each team does a security evaluation on each other team system in an attempt to identify and exploit both traditional cyber vulnerabilities, as well as vulnerabilities that require physical or proximal access to the device. I hope you are looking forward to the student presentations as much as I am.
