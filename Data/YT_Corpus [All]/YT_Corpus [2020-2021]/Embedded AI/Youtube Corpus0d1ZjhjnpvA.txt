 To embed a Forms Quiz in a Class Team. First, make sure you have crafted a quiz in Forms. You can add an embedded Form to a Team from Teams directly, but it will not be a quiz (with self-grading features). Open the Assignments tab in the main Team. When you click on the Create button, you will have the option to create an Assignment or a Quiz. Choose Quiz. Now you will see the quizzes you have already crafted in Forms and are available to add to the Team. Once you've added the Quiz to the Assignment, you will be able to personalize the assignment. You can choose whether to save this Assignment for later or Assign it now by using the buttons in the upper right hand corner. Now we will look at the student view of the embedded Quiz Assignment. When they open their Teams, the quiz will show up along the other Assignments. When they open the assignment, they will be able to click directly on the Form to open the quiz. The quiz opens embedded in the Teams interface and the student will complete it right there. There is no extra window or tab that opens. Their answers will feed back to Forms when they are self-graded, or wait for the teacher to grade them (for text-based answers). Once quizzes are turned in, students can see the completed quiz with other completed assignments in Teams. Once the student has submitted the quiz, the teacher will see the submission in Teams Assignment view. Teachers can view and interact with student results from Teams, Forms, or export results to Excel, The teacher now has the option to view each quiz individually. Once you open a student's quiz, Teams takes you to Forms to review the work and offer feedback to students. Self-graded questions will be marked automatically, and you can add comments to any text-based questions at this stage. Questions that require teacher review will have a "Needs review" next to the points field.
