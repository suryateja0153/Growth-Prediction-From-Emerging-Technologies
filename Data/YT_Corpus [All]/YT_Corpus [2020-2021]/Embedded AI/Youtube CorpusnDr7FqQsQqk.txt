 connectors in military and defense applications have to be reliable they have to work in harsh environments Nicomatic has a number of products that fit this criteria and here to talk about them is Sebastien Charbonnel general manager Germany for Nicomatic Sebastien yes hello thank you for coming and having very interest in our products so as exactly as you said there are harsh environments in this world different types with different requirements for which you need to have a perfect solution there are different ways of doing it there are different market players and Nicomatic is a family-owned business about 350 people 48 million euro turnover and we are pretty successful with a lot of growth within the last few years so why is that why are people coming to us I would say there are many reason not just one but if we speak about miniaturization in-harsh environment that's where we are a good company a good name and one of examples is typically with AMM type of connectors which is a one millimeter pitch connector system for harsh environments what's important about it is that we are delivering this type of component within 24 hours to our customers in five different connector configurations with different pin arrangements and this is typically a much application military of the shelf because one of the applications that is in harsh environment is also military so we can do a lot of different possibilities in radar systems iff in civil avionics in military avionics in ground equipments there are a lot of different challenges facing customers and designers so in electronics we can do the smallest compact part with the best possible signal integrity and performance and I guess within a military and aerospace as you say it's compact I mean weight is an issue for these designers yep saving space is critical so when you are facing a design of your equipment and you need to have a stacking distance between components when you say you need it in six millimeter no problem come to us we can do it maybe other standards are higher and then it means that you need also to use different components saving less space another another subject is also saving weight because if it's a flying equipment it's a drawn the plane missile or whatever you have a lot of space constraints so in that sense we are also having the right solution and could these products be used in applications other than military and aerospace yes of course so we mentioned harsh environments and most of them are in military in avionics and in space but you have so many over problematics today let's pick about some new applications in immobility let's pick about some application you know maybe you heard about that as well it's about flying taxis there are new of very very new challenges facing us and you have to go outside of the standards so it's a custom-made solution or it's a specific solution based on standard processes we are a fully integrated company and that allows us to deliver parts within a few days so I could come to you with the design and let's say you know flying taxis for instance I could come with you to my thoughts on the design bring it to your design team and they could begin to design a product and then you manufacturing in a reasonably short space of time as well first of all we need to talk so yes we have to define together and what you're challenging what your challenges are and what you are facing because we are here in engineer to engineer a relationship so we are talking together on things we know about and we have a bigger racks we have about 60 to 70 special custom-made project each year it has up to 20% of our total turnover on an impact so it shows that we are very innovating as well because maybe after two years one of the products we've finalized for typical customer we think it may be helpful for many other users in this world and we can innovate and do something completely crazy for the next generation so yeah we are there for to support different types of problematics and custom-made one is one of them okay Sebastian thank you very much
