 hi this is Mike Elliot of electronics specifier at embedded world I'm with Maurizio Gavardoni of Maxim integrated who launched yesterday a series of lidar ICS which will enable autonomous cars to drive faster without risk of collision Maurizio can you talk us through some of the characteristics of these devices yes first of all I like to say that these devices are for the lidar signal chain we are talking about a transimpedance amplifier family which connects directly to a photodiode and along with the photodiode converts the optical energy from the lidar laser pulses into electrical signals and then we have a comparator high-speed comparator down the stream that is used to detect precisely where the what the time and flight measurement is so the unique characteristic of this two device is the transimpedance amplifier in particular and the high-speed comparator is that we have we offered the highest bandwidth single bandwidth available which is unmatch of anything existing today in the industry in particular if you look at the transient Peterson amplifier we're talking about a 2x higher bandwidth that anything available today so with that enables is for the lighter system allows allows the system to be to have a higher resolution of the measurement being able to you know determine objects in front of a car that might be as far as 200 meters away from the car itself with the resolution down to a few centimeters okay in turns that enables the autonomous driving system to make decision quicker and therefore to drive the higher speed we estimated additional driving speed to be about 10 miles per hour okay and I think alongside the devices they're also some reference boards and evaluation kits as well yes that is correct we have we have had a partnership where of an optical sensor company that makes photodiode arrays this company is called first sensor and we develop this this evaluation kit with them which basically includes there are photodiode arrays okay in our transimpedance amplifier and along with our high-speed comparator so we developed a full signal chain for the receiving side of the lighter along with this company okay Maurizio thank you very much indeed hi this is Mike Elliott from electronics specifier at embedded world and I'm on the maxim integrated stand yesterday Kris Ardis the executive director of the microcontroller group started a presentation with the motto ruining hackers lives and to do this Maxim has launched a physically and cloneable function to an arm microcontroller so Kris could you talked us through some of the features and characteristics of this launch yeah absolutely so we've got a long history doing secure microcontrollers especially for the payment terminal space and what we wanted to do is bring that same very very high level of security to the broader market especially for the IOT where we see a need for physically protecting devices that are going to be out in the field for five years ten years who knows how long they're gonna be on the field and we found this to be a great opportunity to bring our our Puffs technology or a physical feature technology to the market and we call it chip DNA okay and this is specifically for IOT or is it got a broad range of applications we're seeing a broad range of applications that the microcontroller itself is actually when you look beyond that the security and components of it is actually pretty broadly based it's got the usual UART spies that I can see things like that you'd expect to see it's got a lot of memory it's got two megabytes of memory which is very secure because we use the puff key to encrypt that and we decrypt on the fly as we execute and so it's otherwise a pretty good general-purpose microcontroller for many many different applications okay and in terms of power efficiency it's up there yeah for sure it's it borrows technology from our wearable micros product like we're we're already successful in things like you sports watches and things like that that are super concerned about act mode power as well as backup power when they're in sleep mode okay and the product is often available now and from maxim and distributors so absolutely so it's available through all our distributors available for maxim and in addition it's the first secure micro controller that we're doing where we don't require an NDA in the past normally these products from us and our competitors are protected by NDA because they're pretty specific and we we know who the customers are but in this case this we're releasing this to the broad market we've got low cost development boards we're making it available to everybody with very little friction okay Chris that's terrific thank you very much
