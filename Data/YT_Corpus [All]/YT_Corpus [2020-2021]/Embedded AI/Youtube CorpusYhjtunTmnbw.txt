 Hello everyone! My name is Amit Shuster And in this video we're going to learn how to fully white label an embedded report That means how to hide the Power BI logo while loading the report Or until it's fully rendered As you may know, Power BI comes with a default loading logo Which some applications would like to hide We are going to learn how to control its visibility And how to show a different loading spinner Let's start First we need to find the location of the `powerbi.embed` call For this video I'm using the Power BI Embed "App owns data" sample You can find the link for the sample in the description below Now that we found the `powerbi.embed` call We are going to hide the iframe before we start embedding the report We will control the visibility css property of the container element Note, that we are using the visibility property of the element And not the display property Using `display: none` will remove the element completely from the document Which is not recommended Here I'm using the jQuery css API And setting the visibility to hidden The next thing we need to do is listen either to the loaded event Or to the rendered event, depending on what you'd like to achieve In order to listen to events from the embedded report We use `report.on` which receives an event name and a handler function There are multiple events that you can listen to Besides the loaded and the rendered event For example: error, pageChanged dataSelected, commandTriggered and buttonClicked. In our case we will first listen to the rendered event On the rendered event handler function We should set the embed container visibility to visible And remove the handler at the end of the block So it will only be called once We do this by calling `report.off` on the rendered event Let's see what we got so far We refresh the page And as you can see we don't have the Power BI logo anymore The report appears as soon as it finished to render If we go back to the code and change the "rendered" event To the "loaded" event We will get a different behavior With the "loaded" event The report appears as soon as it finishes the loading phase And starts rendering the report Now for our final step We will add a custom loading spinner We start by adding a container for both the spinner and the embed container We need to add an additional div element in order to center the loading spinner We call it overlay and add the image element inside At the bottom of the document we will add "style" tags With the additional CSS configurations We set the size of the container to the same size of the embed container For the overlay div we set the position to absolute And inherit the height and width from the parent And for last We set the spinner position to absolute And set the top and left properties to 50% minus 50 pixels So it will be centered We use the jQuery hide function To hide to loading spinner when the embed container is ready And here is our final result A white labeled embedded analytics for your application Thank you for watching Be sure to click the subscribe button To stay up to date with all the videos for Power BI Developers And if you liked this video Don’t forget to click the thumbs up button below I'll see you in the next video
