natural light into the building while deflecting direct solar radiation these features along with the thermal properties of its concrete structure are sets make the new facility the first LEED Gold certified passenger terminal in the world with tan sonnets International Airport already the busiest in the country and processing some seven million passengers a year above its twenty five million
