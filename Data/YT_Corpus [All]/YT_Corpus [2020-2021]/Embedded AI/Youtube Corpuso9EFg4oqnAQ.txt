 Hello everyone I'm pm Wilson in charge of embedded system today I'm going to introduce the product is TANK-620-ULT3 which is a fanless embedded system with the multiple COM ports It provides a low power, high efficiency solution which integrates the Intel Skylake U series First of all, we make a simple comparison table for TANK 6 series products. first is TANK-610-BW is integrate the Intel Celeron N3160 processor and COM port is support multiple COM ports up to 8 and multiple USB port up to 4 and supports wide range operating temperature from -40 to 60 degree and new one is TANK-620-ULT3 is integrated Intel Celeron 3855U processor support the core i sku for optional and for I/O port it support multiple COM ports up to 14 and multiple USB ports up to 8 and operating temperatures support from -30 to 70 degree and is also compliant with CE/FCC certification and here is the occasion of the TANK series and there we can just come with the 4 parts first one is AFC and then is ATM kiosk and industrial automation These applications have common points they need to connect a lot of equipment like LED indicators input/output devices, or sensors, etc. Let me first introduce what equipment needs to be connected in AFC This is the AFC system we usually see in the high-speed rail / MRT It also has several kinds of equipment including barcode scanner for scanning the QR code from phone or on the ticket RFID sensor, ticket collection systems LED indicators infrared sensors, and fare gate controllers All of the equipment need to be connected to communication via USB or COM port These requirements can be achieved by using a TANK-620 system And about the ATM system the devices that need to be connected in the common ATM include receipt printer card readers, depositing slot keypad, display screens buttons, and cash dispenser In the past system it need to use multiple systems or add expansion cards to meet all of requirements The TANK-620 can solve the problem to simplify the system complexity whether it is the AFC, ATM, kiosk and even factory automation It can reduce the cost of system deployment and the maintenance cost in the future And let's take a closer look at the fully integrated I/O of the TANK-620 First, we just mentioned before that it has 14 COM ports and uses board to board design to ensure there are no extra wires inside 24-Bit DIO, 4 USB 2.0, 4 USB 3.0, 2 LAN ports and also provides SATA to CF card support for option IEI also designs the small display cards to expand which can support one more VGA or a LVDS to achieve three independent displays requirement TANK-620 has a rich I/O design and a highly flexible expansion including dual full-size PCIe Mini slot which can install Wi-Fi, bluetooth, 3G/4G module M.2 M-key, expandable SSD storage device Also support three independent display configurations and CF card for option For easy mounting part it supports wall-mounted installation and a friendly small panel design on the back side of the system Users just need to remove it and loose two screws to replace the HDD no need to disassemble the whole machine anymore The TANK-620 is a fanless embedded system with high flexible expansion It integrates the Intel Skylake ULT series to provide a low power and high efficiency solution with a wide range DC-input from 9 to 36 volt wide operating temperature design supporting from -30 to 70 degrees rich I/O support, and also supports multiple OS like Win 7/8/10 and Linux TANK-620 is a highly stable industrial system which can reduce the cost of construction and subsequent maintenance to achieve a win-win solution This is my brief introduction If you have any questions please scan the QR code to go to the IEI website and get more detailed information Thank you
