 hi this is Mick Elliott of electronic specifier at the embedded world show in Nuremberg this morning I'm on the Pico technology stand a company has launched it soon as 6000E oscilloscope at the show and here to talk about some of its features is Trevor Smith of Pico technology hello Mick thanks very much for the introduction so yeah we've launched actually two new models that they're both part of the six thousand eseries they are both eight channel 500 megahertz oscilloscopes they're actually MSO so mixed signal oscilloscope so eight channels and sixteen digital channels the scopes as I mentioned they have 500 megahertz bandwidth on the analog channels and really deep memories so one of the models has two Giga samples of capture memory the other one has four Giga samples of capture memory and the other thing that really sets these things apart is that the the top model the 68 24e has a flexible resolution architecture that is to say you can choose to have 8 bits resolution with the maximum sampling speed of 5 giga samples per second or you can trade some of that sampling speed for improved resolution so 8 bits or 10 bits or 12 bits that reduced sampling speed so it's got the choice of speed resolution memory depth and channel count to address really the new next generation of embedded systems design and debug and is there any it's embedded design debug do you see that operating across the board of applications yeah broad range of applications so it's supported with the the picoscope 6 software that we've got running here in the background so it's a which is a already a widely adopted range of software on on our other range of pico scopes with support for things like math channels mask limit testing segmented memory and actually up to well a 21 serial protocol deep clip decoders included a standard and that the most recent one of those is broader reach the automotive Ethernet standard so we and it includes a software directional coupler so from looking at full duplex traffic on twisted pair wires you can separate the the traffic going in both or in each direction and decode master to slave and slave to master communications okay some of these features are obviously trend setting is that something that through talking to customers you you've integrated these characteristics into the scope yeah we've got a lot of feedback so whenever anybody downloads a software update so we provide software updates free of charge so every every few weeks or sometimes you know every couple of months we supply a new version of picoscope with new new capabilities and while the software is downloading and installing we just give a little opportunity from people to or from customers to tell us about what what they want next in the in the next generation of picoscope so we're always capturing this feedback and things like broader reach as I just mentioned and before that we we launched dolly which is a version of Manchester encoding we launched a decoder for those technologies and they were directly as a result of of customer feedback and requests and it's yeah that's really what drives the development of the well both the hardware and the software and just to be clear the scopes are available now through yourselves in distribution yep so we've moved into production we launched the products yesterday actually my on Monday we've got the first production batch now coming through this week and yeah we're busy ramping up production so initial shipments are on their way what I should add as well that in conjunction with the scope we're also launched thsi novel new we're calling it the probe positioning system so given that most engineers only have two hands and we've got a an 8 8 channel scope these guys they need some help in in positioning probes on test points and holding them they're secure while they make their tests and you know two four six or eight channels and the so the Pro Positioning System it's a it's got a magnetic base and then these gooseneck probe holders that then we clip in the standard high bandwidth probes and then as you can see even with a bit of movement those those probe ropes they sit securely on that on the test point so it's a it's designed to match the the eight channel scope that we're launching okay Trevor thank you very much that's terrific thank you
