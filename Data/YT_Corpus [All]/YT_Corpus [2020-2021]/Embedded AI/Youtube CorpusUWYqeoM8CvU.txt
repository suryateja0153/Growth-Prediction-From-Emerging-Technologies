 - Hi, I'm Dexter, a sixth and seventh grade math teacher. I'm going to show how you can save time by generating a math practice quiz. Let me show you how. Just type or draw a single math problem in OneNote. Use the select tool and lasso the equation, select solve for x, and then a new option appears. Generate a practice quiz. Microsoft uses machine learning to create a quiz with questions that are in the same format as the one you wrote or typed in. You can also copy and paste the link anywhere for students to access the quiz. If you distribute the page of the quiz through OneNote Class Notebook, your students can record their work on OneNote page and submit answers to the form directly inside of OneNote. You will still see the auto-graded results in forms but also have access to their work in OneNote. So you math teachers, try it out today and save some time. (chill music)
