 Visual perception allows machines to understand their environments in many new ways. In fact, smart cameras will be the key technology for the future of smart factories. Our goal at 3dvisionlabs is to drive this innovation. We're pushing the limits of depth sensing camera technology and combine it with the latest advances in visual AI. We're a team of software engineers, product designers, embedded developers and scientists. Now we're proud to introduce our latest product: World's most powerful, AI-enabled 3D camera: HemiStereo NX. There exists a vast number of applications for visual AI in industrial environments. For example, nowadays, more and more mobile robots appear the industry especially for transportation tasks. In order to fulfill those tasks, they have to know where objects are, they have to detect people and they have to precisely navigate. A pre-condition for this is to have precise information about the surrounding. Due to its fast feel the view of 180°, HemiStereo is able to precisely locate objects and detect people, everywhere. HemiStereo NX is an ultra-wide, ultra-high resolution depth sensing camera with industrial grade features. Integrated into the device is an Nvidia Jetson embedded computer. This small GPU-powered supercomputer allows to analyze image and 3D data directly in the device using deep neural networks. Industrial vision systems are often very expensive, especially stereo vision cameras. We wanted to change that. That's why we made HemiStereo NX as affordable as possible. Also, it was designed as an open platform. You can either run one of our pre-built applications or develop your own one. By that, we're giving developers and system integrators powerful tools to develop the future of machine vision.
