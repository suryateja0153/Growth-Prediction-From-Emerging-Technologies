 hi this is Mike Elliott of electronic Specifier at embedded world I'm on the Harwin stand with head of Marketing Ben green and Harwin using the show to launch a new product in its gecko range so Ben could you just talk just through some of the characteristic of this product sure Mick yes so yeah this is a high reliability connector and a one point two five millimeter pitch a very small compact lightweight design so ideal for small satellites avionics systems any sort of mission critical application where the customer is looking to reduce or to improve rather their size weight and performance ratio of their product system okay and I understand you know you can  attach cabling to this as well that's correct yep so because this is a horizontal layout and if you're in a small satellite application for example very very densely stacked PCBs you will benefit from bringing the cable in horizontally rather than vertically and that would enable you to save some vertical space in the system so there's a big advantage that customers what was the impetus behind launching this product were customers coming to you I mean I know the Gecko is a very you know very popular product were companies in satellites and other harsh environment applications coming to you and saying hey you know if you can do something we can fit in that needs to be low profile you know can you can you produce this for us absolutely yes as you said gecko is fast becoming the go-to almost a standard if you will for for high applications and it was that for customer feedback that really drove the the R&D on this one and yes there's a custom high high customer demand something that we offer in other families and now we're just expanding this range out to offer as many variations as the customers require really okay and the products available now and either from you or through distribution channel that's correct we launched here this show and it will be on the shelves and distribution very shortly okay and just as an aside Ben you're here at the show we know some companies have dropped out but it's still in a very important show what what are your ambitions this week well in terms of embedded systems technology this show does have it all you can see the hardware the software the component level guys all in one place so from an engineer's point of view we think it's one of the best shows to attend we're really looking to meet those engineers that are looking to improve the reliability of their system so the as I mentioned before the size we're in performance but the security of data is becoming so significant now some in mission-critical applications arising but those are the engineers that we really want to meet and you give them the advantage of our high reliability connectors okay Ben green thank you very much thanks mike
