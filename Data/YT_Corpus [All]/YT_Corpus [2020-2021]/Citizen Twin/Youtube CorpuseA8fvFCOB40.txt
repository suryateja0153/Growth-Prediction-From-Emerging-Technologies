 I really think it would benefit all citizens to spend three four days in space do nothing just just look out the window and understand that the earth is one and that we're all connected [Music] my name is Robert Thirsk I'm a former Canadian Space Agency astronaut I grew up in Western Canada born in Westminster BC but because of my father's occupation we moved all over Western Canada when I was a grade 3 student our teacher told us that in mid-morning she was gonna turn on the classroom radio her teacher explained we were listening to the voice of an astronaut his name is John Glenn and he was in space at that moment he had just launched a space about an hour ago it was said in my brain about becoming an astronaut someday and so the rest of my education high school university was focused on a career path towards toward space [Music] 1983 opened up the newspaper and there was an ad in the middle of the newspaper that said astronauts wanted I applied but so did four thousand other people so for some reason the Canadian Space Agency chose me in five other people as well about ten years into the Canadian astronaut program we were just sitting down for family dinner my parents were actually there in addition to my wife and my kids got a phone call from my boss and he said we did it you did it you've been selected by an international peer group of scientists to be part of this 17 day record 17 days space shuttle mission they could just tell if my response on the phone and the goofy grin on my face that this was good news the evening before we had been with our families laughing upbeat making jokes but also knowing this hug might be the last hug that we ever do the next morning we got up very early it's still dark got suited up get in the van and then head out to the launch pad the space shuttle Columbia was on the on the launch pad I'd been in the Columbia on several occasions before but this morning was different because this morning the rocket was being fueled and the fuel is cold and it's causing all this creaking and groaning and joints are expanding and contracting and you get the impression that the Columbia is a living creature and just as eager to get off the launch pad as we are the support crew leave the hatches closed the pressure check is done to make sure that the hatches is sealed at that point the cockpit becomes sterile which means that all conversation is very operationally oriented very concise the main computer ignites the three main engines that are tucked underneath the tail and the whole shuttle stack begins to begins to vibrate the computer sends a command to the two solid rocket boosters to ignite they look like roman candles on either side of the shuttle stack and they immediately reach full power now you've got six million pounds of thrust but there's these eight bolts that are this size that are holding the shuttle down to the launch pad at T equals zero they explode there's now nothing holding the shuttle down to the launch pad and we jump off the launch pad [Music] [Music] in two minutes or 40 kilometers high 45 kilometers offshore we jettison the two solid rocket boosters as we breach orbit you go from 3 G's to 0 G's in a fraction of a second the deceleration are our legs and our arms are flung forward release the seat harness flow it around the inside of the cockpit a lot of hooting and hollering because they've just done something that it's one of the more dangerous things that human beings do and we survived look up the window in my first view and this chill went down my spine I'm still worried remember that the chill because it was it was so stunningly beautiful the Sun was glinting off the off of the ocean and beyond the ocean was the the curved horizon of the of the earth and then beyond the curved horizon was inky black space and I could really appreciate that the earth it's a solitary planet alone for hundreds of millions of kilometres nothing else around and I was up there looking down on it and how many people have ever had that opportunity a couple of years ago my wife and I were having dinner with some some friends one of our dinner guests asked if I had returned to normal following my last spaceflight and I quickly respond to guess I've returned to normal but my wife jumped in and she said no you have not returned to normal psychologically you have never returned from spaceflight so we all laughed at my wife's comment and what I meant when I responded to her guest question about whether or not I had returned to normal I was speaking from a physiological perspective but my wife is right from a psychological perspective looking out the window changed my perspective and what civilization and society is all about and what the priorities should be for me for my family for society it as well [Music] you know for them the first week that I was in space I felt Canadian I had to had the maple leaf on my flight suit and then maybe the second week you know Canada sort of faded into the background but I was aware of North America my home continent because I'd traveled throughout North America and knew it very well and after the third weekend thereafter I was still proud to be a Canadian but this notion of citizenship with the nation's seemed to me to be irrelevant and I seen mostly to be a citizen of this global humanity I have to think about some of the the isolationist and nationalistic tendencies today and I think we're making a mistake there Nita cross-border approach Nita a one humanity approach to solve the biggest challenges for us which are overpopulation poverty inequality and then environmental damage these are big problems we need everyone working together everyone collaborating together of course I'm still proud to be a Canadian but I'm just as proud to be a a world citizen and eager to tax some of these some big problems that are out there [Music]
