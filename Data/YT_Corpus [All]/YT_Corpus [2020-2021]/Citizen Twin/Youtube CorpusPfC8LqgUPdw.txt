 hi welcome back to london conference the third day of london conference 2020 uh i hope everybody's doing all right i think this session is going to be wonderful i'm kate spoliopoulos head of events at center for london we'll be getting started in just a few minutes as a reminder if you're tweeting about this event or anything else you're seeing at london conference use the hashtag lundconf20 that's lon conf 20. uh we're not using zoom this morning as we are for our other sessions uh the chair for this session james crabt will be taking audience questions for the minister through slido the link to that slido is in your morning joining instructions that you should receive this morning and it's also on the mailchimp landing page and in the youtube stream so it should be available to you use slight of ask questions we're so excited and proud this morning to have taiwan's digital minister audrey tang here with us and to introduce her i would like to welcome session chair who is currently professor of practice at lee kuan yew school of policy in singapore former ft journalist and current netflix star you can catch him on bad boy billionaires of india very varied career james crabtree james welcome to the london conference stage thank you very much kate it's great to be here so good afternoon from singapore good morning in london good afternoon to audrey in taipei so we're here this afternoon to talk to audrey about a range of topics digital democracy the the pandemic as it has worked out from from asia protest movements open government and what all this means for cities and what london and taiwan and taipei can learn from one another audrey if i can ask her to hold up the mask that she has in her hand is going to demonstrate that taiwan is in fact a highly functioning society because audrey has just been to a real live in-person uh gay pride march in taipei this afternoon so taiwan is working sufficiently well that you can actually have mass public gatherings which in soon to be locked down london i suspect might be a somewhat chastening experience um anyway so we're going to talk for about 45 minutes as kate said please do ask questions we'll leave time at the end of the session to ask questions to audrey i want to ask her about taiwan's record during the pandemic about her passion for digital government which is what she does as a minister and has been passionate about even before her career in politics as a coder and technology specialist i want to talk about urban governance and a whole range of other things besides including diversity and equality um but audrey i think i have to start with uh the news of the day if you don't mind so everyone is obsessively looking at twitter and trying to work out what's going to happen in the united states this election is very consequential for taiwan given its some central relationship with washington um vis-a-vis beijing can you just tell me i mean what are people watching it very closely over there does the the people in taiwan have a particular hope for the outcome of this election or how does it look from where you are well quite fortunately um there's a 12-hour difference between the u.s east coast and taiwan which means that we will just go to sleep today and wake up knowing more about the result tomorrow and so the most of the nail biting in the u.s especially on the east coast is going to occur uh in taiwan time tonight um and so um we were i think spared of a lot of the nail by design uh now to answer your question more directly i think taiwanese people are aware that in the past four years during the trump administration there's a lot more strategic clarity when it comes to taiwan's role in the indo-pacific and we also see a lot of not only the ndi the national democratic institute but iri is republican equivalent to the german british nominee foundation reporter without borders freedom um the oslo freedom forum you name it uh being headquartered either moved from hong kong to taiwan or just started as headquartered regionally in taiwan so that's clarity taiwan's democratic achievement and our way of saying no to the false dilemma of public health on one side and human rights on the other or the pro-social social media on one side uh and freedom of speech on the other we managed to keep both ends thriving and that message was sent to indo-pacific with the help of course from the administration uh in the u.s and i firmly believe um no matter what the result of the election is uh the next administration uh will continue this relationship with taiwan um because both sides have identified quite clearly during their campaigns okay very good also let's um let's put our american friends uh and their dysfunction to one side and and look instead of the highly functional reaction that taiwan has had to the pandemic um i mean arguably the most effective response of any country in the world um i mean maybe for those in the audience who are just not that familiar with taiwan could you give a pen portrait of what it was that taiwan did right and given that your particular responsibility and enthusiasm is for technology and digital government what role did that play in the way that taiwan has handled kobit 19 the digital is purely a assistive role the most important technology to counter the pandemic is definitely chemical namely soap and alcohol hand synthesis and next to it uh the physical vaccine masks but digital does help in a way to spread a message about the correct use of mosques and hand sanitation so this is our official spokesdog for our central epidemic command center name is don chai eshibainu and this dog is now telling you you wear a musk to protect your own face against your own unwashed hands it's an extremely effective um idea that's worth spreading because it appeals to rational self-interest it doesn't say anything about protecting your elders it doesn't say anything about respecting your community it says you know you don't wash your hands with soap well where am i to prevent yourself from touching your own face and this idea really went viral on the social media and also when we introduced physical distancing when you're outdoor keep two shiba inus away and if you're indoor keep three shivaji news away again very easy to remember and so we have a word for it actually it's called humor over rumor um and so in the very beginning uh we saw that during the pandemic what was really the difficulty in countering the pandemic is actually the twin of the pandemic the infodemic because when people buy into conspiracy theories and buy into the fear uncertain and doubt as um you know amplified by the anti-social media i was trying to not to use that word but anyway by the anti-social media platforms then it becomes almost impossible for for science to thrive so from the very beginning we adopted a communication strategy based on the daily live press conferences of the medical offices based on the 1922 hotline where anyone can call and get their scientific questions answered but even more crucially if they have something that our scientists have no answers about if they report a genuinely new situation on the grounds then the 1922 will also escalate it within minutes to the central epidemic command sansa for example back in april in the 1922 there was a young boy calling into the command center saying oh you're rationing out mosques and i all i get the young boy in primary school said all i get is pink medical mask i don't want to wear pink medical masks my classmates will laugh at me the very next day on 2 pm sharp all the medical officers including the house minister wore pink medical musk and the minister even said pink panther was his childhood hero and so the boy becomes the most hip boy in the class because only he has the color that the heroes wear not just heroes but heroes heroes so the idea here is to show a real quick iterative cycle where any good idea from the collective intelligence gets amplified and in that way because it's fun it goes viral all the popular social media brands colored their own icons and avatars pink uh that week and so that spread the scientific messages much easier and also much more accurately than any top-down measures would can you say a little bit more about so you're an enthusiast for open data and and the role that that government can play in in that respect and i know that that making public information available on mask locations and things like that was a part of what people looked at as part of taiwan's success so just say a little bit about that side of things as well sure um yeah uh people keep saying it's my idea it's not my idea uh around the end of january uh there was a person was named howard the head of the google developer groups in tainan city a southern city of taiwan who gets fed up with the lying messages it's like whatsapp uh but with more stickers the line messages that keep saying that oh this store has run out of musk this store still have so much left for those of you who may be able to hear us but no longer see us so um even when you're you're uh you're talking to asia's leading technology politician then the technology gremlins can get in our way but we were talking audrey about open data and the extent to which that that was sort of interesting part of the pandemic response in taiwan and elsewhere in part i think because in previous pandemics um that had hit asia during sars and elsewhere there was an accusation that governments had basically hidden the scale of the problem and one of the things interesting about kovan 19 was how open almost all the governments in the region have been all the democratic governments and in particular about the nature and scale of the problem and i i just wondered if you could say a little bit about how that worked in taiwan yes certainly so as i was mentioning how from thailand city devised this way to crowdsource a map where his friends and families can pin on particular places in the mob whether they're still mosque in stock or not uh because there's rumor that says you know people are stockpiling mosques and so on and you want to put an end to it at least for his residency and friends and families well the thing is that he appears on national news so everybody is using his app uh and the next thing he knows after returning from launch he owes google 20k us dollars in api usage fees so he has to take the web service down and ask the gov zero community the g zero v community thailand's leading civil technology movement what to do and of course when when people in open street map and other communities started to help him i'm also on that chatroom so i showed his work to the head of the cabinet to our premier and say we need to do a reverse procurement meaning that they already have the spec they already wrote the app and we need to keep the resource running namely publishing the real-time availability of all the medical mosque uh shops uh all the pharmacies and so on every 30 seconds a open api and that really enables people who queue in line to participate in the accountability audit that is to say if i'm a adult when i am adult using my national health insurance card then people would expect that every two weeks at a time i would get maybe nine uh medical masks and people queuing after me can actually see me swipe my ic card and see the availability decrease by nine and so everybody understand that this is a fair distribution or when it is unfair if for example the people in rural places would take more time on public transportation to get to the pharmacies it gets to the parliamentary interpolation immediately um the mp hong and she was a vp of data analytics at foxconn so knows something about data uh she says uh to the minister chair john base on openstreetmap data that the distribution looks fair on distance but it's not fair on time and the administration did not defend the policy at all uh he simply said legislator teach us and we started co-creating and the very next day we introduced pre-ordering and 24-hour pickup from convenience stores and a more fair reasoning strategy and so this is really trusting the citizen and the social sector to co-create the entire distribution mechanism with the key real-time auditability very good i want to sort of take a bit of a step back so again many of other people in the audience may be less familiar with taiwan and its politics than uh than than certainly you are um could you just give a sense of how you yourself got into politics so your your party is the on you know is has a particular position in in taiwanese politics um but you have a particular background as well in technology how did you come to be taiwan's digital minister what was your path there for those non-partisan i am not any party member but when you say my party i did publicly um endorse a new party uh that set up uh just last year it's called a very happy party or i think the official englishman can't stop this party um and it's founded by quite a few popular youtubers and comedians uh very fun people and their party logo is the youtube logo but with the triangle pointing downwards uh anyway but it's not the ruling party it only has one city in the type of city council and in any case i'm not a party member and so my point uh in working with the politics is not working for the government i never worked for the government i work with the government in the same vein i don't work for the people i work with the people the the core tenant is what i learned when i drop out of middle school when i was 14 years old saying that hey i want to learn from the world web and the head of my school says okay go ahead with it i will fake the record for you with my blessings and so the things that i learned is internet governance the core of internet governance which is rough consensus surrounding code citizen participation things like that and it turns out that these also work on a day-to-day fashion in day-to-day democracy when we occupy the parliament in 2014 non-violently for three weeks and deliberated with 20 ngos all live streamed half a million people on the street many more online we managed to get pretty good consensus about for example not allowing any uh people's republic china regime components in our dan new 4g network a debate that everybody else is now having in 5g we kind of had that when we occupy the parliament and many more besides and so because of that i think participatory democracy has always been in taiwan's roots because our first presidential election was in 1996 which is the year that the white web went popular and so for us it's never just about uploading three bits per person every four years which is called voting but about more day-to-day engagement what time i mean so you taiwan in general has a reputation on you in particular for uh promoting a quite radical vision of participatory democracy some of which is online and some of which is not online i want to say a little bit more about that for countries in the west who i mean not thinking again about our american cousins but also in the uk who are anxious about the state of our democracies um and looking for new ideas about how they might be reinvigorated what what what can be learned from taiwan's experiment from the 2014 sunflower revolution through until today yeah i think uh the three pillars i just mentioned fast fair and fun they can be learned kind of quite independently of each other a fast iteration where in taiwan our top epidemiologist the person who wrote the epidemiology textbook during the covet when he wanted to talk to the vice president he just looked into the mirror it's the same person and so because of that our scientific authority and the political authority is the same one and the daily responses the fuss responses the collective intelligence that could be adapted quite easily actually just by arranging daily press conference and hotline and a call center right the fair part again open api it's not hard to copy um a few young people um the youngest i think just 14 years old from south korea convinced their government to adopt masquerading using the api designed by people in thailand city in taiwan i think the finch and kyung map the tainan hackers map is the first one that worked for koreans and even though the finjankan didn't speak korean he speaks javascript and so as long as they conform to that application programming interface maceration works perfectly well in south korea so that's the fair distribution part and finally the fun part humor over rumor again that's a playbook that many different jurisdictions can take a page of the idea is just make fun of ourselves it's not about making fun of other people so it's inclusive humor and that always travels faster than the disinformation that travels on outrage because if you have watched the film inside out uh if you have something that is on good that could turn to revenge or discrimination if you bring the co-creation the joy the humor part out then it goes to the joy the light yellow um color and it doesn't go back because in the mind the pathway only go one way so if we think the same day before someone goes to sleep um something they're upset about is turned into a humorous message uh they will go to sleep waking up remembering something humorous and therefore much more pro-social and able to then engage in rational civic discussion very good well i'm sure you're speaking to preaching to the gallery at the center for london which is an institution that believes in bringing the joy back into politics in all of its forms but um rather than rather than humor i wanted to turn to philosophy so unusually for a politician you have a personal philosophy which you describe as conservative anarchism which on the face of it seems a peculiar combination but i wonder could you explain what you mean by this as a guiding philosophy and maybe give our audience an example or two of how you put it into practice as digital minister certainly so a anarchist of course is someone who does not give command nor receive command who doesn't believe in coercion and only believes in deliberation that is what unifies anarchists of all planets and a conservative is someone who respects the traditions who want the grandparents grandparents ideas still make some sense uh in the current situation who don't want to destroy any of the taiwan's 20 national languages and therefore more than 20 coaches in the name of any particular coach's idea of progress and so these two taken together i think in the east asian context i'll just say taoism which everybody would understand but taoism in western context is maybe more like a spiritual thing or a religion thing and not a political philosophy but really it's the same thing as that wisdom very good and one one final question if you don't mind me asking so one one of the things that you're known for as a politician is you're one of the most senior most visible trans politicians in uh in asia i mean could you say a little bit about the kind of you've been on the pride march this afternoon could you say a little bit about the culture of diversity in taiwan that that has um kind of into into which you have fitted as it were and you you've prospered yeah i mean the the taiwan indigenous nation uh which i think our president taiwan shares some of their lineage uh doesn't make a gender discrimination when it comes to leadership um the amis indigenous nation uh which our presidential spokesperson kulas yotaka is a nation member um it's actually a matriarchy and so um there's 20 national languages 16 indigenous culture actually more and many of them have the idea of more than two genders and so if you're in a trans-cultural republic then the idea of gender being not strictly binary is it's kind of normal i personally spent the days after i drop out of middle high in indigenous nations especially in the atari region and they have a very different relationship to to nature the punong nation which caused the top of taiwan the ushan the jade mountain saviya or a long-lived spirit of which were just temporary stewards of again speaks to sustainability not in sdg terms but but in their own terms where gender is maybe not very important for a mountain spirit and so my whole point is that these artificial categories may be useful illusions temporarily but they cease to be useful illusions if you look at it from a trans-cultural identity which taiwanese more and more identify ourselves not in any particular culture but really in this process of transculturalism very good fascinating thank you so much i wonder can i go back to the question of trust so you you were mentioning the idea of fun and openness various ways in which you've tried to build or rebuild trust between citizens and the state again thinking less so perhaps about pure democracy and more about service delivery and the way that citizens look at the state what lessons are there for a country like the united kingdom or a city like london as it tries to find a way back uh to rebuilding trust with with citizens what techniques has taiwan use that others can learn from well definitely trust the social sector place the data stewardship and the joint data controllership that's a gdpr term um to the social sector and when the social sector owns the data produce the data curates the data that's when the social sector can feel empowered enough to negotiate its own terms there's many different words for that as a coalition collaborative or co-op or union or trust i lose count but anyway the idea is that instead of surveillance capitalism or authoritarian intelligence we make sure that our ai is a assistive intelligence and people can understand that they are crowdsourcing the data now this is of course all very theoretical so maybe i would just use one very short anecdote to illustrate the point in early april there was a case when a person was diagnosed with covet and the first day she took contact tracers she stayed home meets nobody she doesn't know how she contracted the disease the next day she finally admitted that she works as a professional um you know waitress in the intimate to such workers especially in the time of the pandemic so there's a lot of clamoring um in the you know anti-social media uh for the central everyday monsanto to invoke sanctions to put them in jail to find a large amount of fine and close down them and things like that but uh all it would do had we gone that way is to force them to go underground as in the prohibition area and make the pandemic even more unpredictable and quite fortunately we understood the idea of federated data controllership and there's ecc people some experts like philip law worked with hiv plus communities for decades and so we devised a real contact system as long as people could be contacted in case of transmission they don't need to collect their real names and no no none of the data need to be uh submitted to the state um and so we just explained the physical distance and resistance my apologies for these technical slight uh snafus but anyway we're back i was just a final question for audrey on the pandemic was about this some vision of taiwan's enabling technological state which clearly has elements that are bottom up involve open data use community groups but but i suppose i wanted to ask is there not also lying behind this a more top-down uh poem a dare won't say autocratic state that is working hand in glove with with the more um experimental and open vision that you suggest just to give us the full picture sure uh right after stars uh in 2003 our constitutional court said that because we had to lock down the hoping hospital unannounced for an indefinite amount of time it was barely constitutional it would be unconstitutional if that's nobody know what uh to do right so the constitutional court charged the legislature to not only set up the enabling act for the century of the command sunshine but also devise a way of quarantining that are constitutional and has a very fixed amount of time for privacy or freedom of movement limitations so of course there is a mandatory quarantine if you go back to taiwan you either go to the hotel for 14 days of physical currency or if you stay at home with your own flat and bathroom then you can put your phone or if you don't have a phone we give you one for a couple weeks to the digital currency in which case we do not collect new data our rule of thumb is that we never collect new data that we are not already collecting before the pandemic but based on the signal strength alone the telecoms no to a 50 meter radius degree whether your phone has broken currently or not and so if your the phone has escaped out of that area then the medical officers and you got asms automatically it's the same thing as a earthquake warning or a flood warning or forest fire warning except of course that the medical offices if they actually found that you broke the quarantine then instead of the 30 euros per day stipend that we pay for your collaboration you pay us back in a thousand times that as a fine so you can fund a thousand more people and of course there is this is mandatory you can't opt out of it you either go to the physical or the digital currency very good very good let's um let's broaden things out away from the pandemic to a few other questions that i think might interest um our audience here at the center for london one of which is about the future of cities so taipei is one of asia's most vibrant cities certainly one of its most vibrant democratic cities um attracting business from hong kong uh generally see as a kind of bastion of freedom around the region um there's been a lot of talk about the decline of cities in the aftermath of kovic 19. i wondered how does that look from from a city like taiwan is that same narrative about about cities coming under pressure present in taiwan and how do you see the future of urbanization as viewed from east asia yeah once the high-speed rails in taiwan begin functioning the entirety of taiwan or at least the west side of it functions like a larger municipality from the north uh city of taipei to the south metropolis of goshen it's just one hour and a half of high-speed rails and so it's all very much connected together when people in tainan made those medical mosque availability and so on they never need to travel to taipei because we always know that they're just one hour away in high-speed rails and the video works quite well anyway because in taiwan unlike other places broadband is a human right so anywhere in taiwan if you don't have 10 megabits per second for just 16 euros per month for unlimited data connection it's my fault personally and so um because of this the urban landscape feels very diverse there's not much urban rural um distinction when it comes to the western side of taiwan of course the mountainous part the indigenous nations the more remote islands and so on of course uh offers the cultural diversity and in fact is where the first nations of indigenous people kind of rely on uh but in the western side i think is merging into a larger kind of super metropolis and and so in a sense that that vision of a kind of east asian urbanization is not being but people aren't questioning that because of the pandemic that that moves on as it has before the the the sort of the fact that the future the future will continue to be urban as it was before well i think in taiwan the point is that we never had a long time so even if we delayed the opening of schools for a couple weeks to secure the mosque and hand sanitize us we never really stopped the schools either so i guess taiwan is in a a somewhat different path and we're looking at people not a new normal but rather the old normal augmented digital and this offers more or less the same urban movement trend as you were saying but without the showing off without a consumerism without the excesses all these has disappeared because it's just considered bad taste when people are still suffering so more sustainability more circular economy uh this thing that i'm wearing is made out of coffee bean waste and recycled plastic photos and these are are becoming much more fashionable it looks uh looks very fashionable i must say i need to get myself one of those one final question then we're going to go over to questions from the audience we've got some interesting ones which i'll try and rattle through in a minute which is about china so i think in you know one of the ways that taiwan is most visible on the global stages because of its tense relationship with china and it would be interesting to hear you say something about that but i was particularly interested in the the way in which technology is being used to unite um anti-chinese or anti-authoritarian movements around asia so the hong kong street protests in taiwan and in thailand the it's now called the milk tea alliance i wonder if you could say something about that and whether you see uh technology in these democratic movements as having an important role to play as people grapple with the rise of china as a phenomenon and then i'll go to questions from the audience yeah i think the milky alliance is fundamentally about open innovation right the the milk could be soy milk and it could be any kind of milk uh it could be ruivas as far as i'm concerned when we're talking about bubble tea it doesn't matter whether the tapioca is black or white and so the whole thing about the milky alliance is about the affirmation of plurality and affirmation instead of a technological singularity or authoritarian singularity that we're happy about plurality we're happy about a internet of beings not just things we're happy about collaborative learning not just machine learning we're happy about shared reality not just isolated virtual realities we're happy about making the state transparent to the people not the people transparent to the state as you rightly pointed out that is stark contrast with authoritarian intelligence ours is of a assistive intelligence very good very good let me let me turn to a few a few questions from uh from our audience here in london or not i'm in singapore but um here's a question so richard asks does taiwan engage in participatory budgeting and if so how does how does that in taiwan yes it works in many levels uh city council level works in the municipal level uh there's the pb.taipei on the district level in the taipei city uh and in arguably in a national level with the regional revitalization uh plan and so yeah we have pb in all levels and and so ben rodgers the director of the center for london also asked a similar question which is what about neighborhood and local government in taiwan um so he also asked about participatory technology but in a sense is taiwan's system of government is it centralized as in the uk or does this vision of decentralization extend to local government as well yeah the the six um kind of autonomous municipalities um all have their own system of uh direct participation in fact uh at the end of the year of sunflower movement 2014 specifically uh the mayor of taipei go and joe and also mayor of tainan uh lighting the now our vice president um both campaigned on an open government direct democracy uh platform and one uh because of it actually uh at the end of that year anyone who was against um citizen participation lose their election um and so it is a very hip thing uh to to say and do uh and we launched our national action plan for open government not only in the administration but also in the legislation as well as part of the open parliament uh network work so yeah it's it's a fashionable thing uh to engage in citizen participation and our work in the national government is twofold first is to amplify the better and best practices uh just like the voluntary local reviews of sdgs of the taipei city new diversity and television city to our international audience but also learn from the better practices from like literally better kavik from iceland the pb from motherlit and barcelona police from seattle and things like that and integrate that the latest invention being quadratic voting and funding from the ethereum community into our presidential hackathon and so our work in national government is not the top-down road it is the facilitative and bridging world very good um i bet that last bit about ethereum i think we might leave for another day um how can so we have a question from anonymous but uh they know who they are so how can londoners be encouraged to take more responsibility for their own data as it seems like citizens in taiwan do so you mentioned individual personal data what's taiwan's approach to that and what can cities like london learn yeah i think it's just about in the primary schools making sure that you teach about competence not to literacy our curriculum has totally changed starting last year replacing all the occurrences of media literacy data literacy digital literacy with the term competence because literacy assumes that they are consumers of narratives produced by the few but actually many primary schoolers probably has more instagram followers than i do right so they are the media they produce their own data they purchase the um air boxes from the primary school teachers um each class maybe maintain one one box uh to measure the pm 2.5 levels of air quality and contribute to the distributed ledger that monitors the air quality they engage in citizens initiatives some of our most active citizen initiatives are proposed by people in high schools for example banning plastic straws for bubble teas um it sounds like you know a challenge to our national identity drink but it actually uh is the thing and then gets ratified uh and so the point is that before they turn 18 they already have plenty of experience not only producing data but also producing suitable designs that can turn those data into worked and also working prototypes that then gets picked up by the citizens initiatives the participatory budgeting and participatory rule making systems and none of which require citizenship it only requires residentship and even if you're just 14 years old you're welcome to participate very good we've run up against our time at the top of the hour but if you do audrey do you have a couple more minutes you have two two or three more questions if you if you have time absolutely i have maybe maybe five more minutes yeah perfect okay that's great that's all all we need so there was one question i think maybe bouncing off your your answer about uh inclusivity and diversity um which is how do you try and be inclusive of those with disabilities especially in the digital world uh in in taiwan so maybe could you give us an insight onto that and then i'll ask one further question and then we'll close sure uh in 2016 we uh made the linux foundation open api standard while it's doing beta our national standard uh meaning that uh in taiwan when you procure a digital service if the vendor says oh i can only produce it for people with site but not for people with seeing difficulties they could get disqualified for failing the accessibility requirement being discriminatory right but then we amended the procurement rules uh four years ago saying uh for all the human interactions you also have to provide open api according to the os3 standard if you charge us too much for it or say that you can't do it well then um the vendor could be you know disqualified by saying that they're discriminating against robots we don't quite say that but that's the end effect and so because of the open apis it enabled people who want to translate into a different language who wants to make a experience that works better with screen readers or any sort of assistive technology not rewrite the entire website or entire digital service just uh reading the apis accessing the apis and that's why the mask availability map ends up having more than 140 different applications it's because each serves a particular need for a certain group of people very good final question so this was uh claire harding this was the one that got the most up votes um on our questions which was a very simple one so earlier in this conference the center for london hosted uh mayor siddiq khan um mayor of london and so the final question was if you had one single piece of advice for london london's mayor based on taiwan's experience of managing the pandemic what should it be what uh what if you if you were if you yourself are the mayor of london then what can a city like london learn from taiwan's experience the most important lesson well it's the pygmalion in fact if you maximally trust the citizens and the social sector then the social sector become your most trustworthy partner but if you do not trust the social sector and your citizens they become less trustworthy and also less trusting of each other so your choice very good okay thank food this has been a delightful conversation i've been looking forward to this very much uh the work that you do is um uh both interesting and inspirational so i i wish you all the best of it thank you very much for coming virtually at least to london this afternoon uh to share a little bit uh of that so thank you very much and hope to to see you personally uh or physically uh in london uh at some point soon so thank you very much audrey thank you particularly yes live long and prosper
