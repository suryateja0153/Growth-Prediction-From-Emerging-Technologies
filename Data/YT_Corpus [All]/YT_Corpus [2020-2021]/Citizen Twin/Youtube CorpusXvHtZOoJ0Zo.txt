Yes you seem so excited soothing him I am actually used to it, you can't leave all of them with the mum We must give each other a helping hand My name is Florence Makena, I am 49 years old I was born in Meru county Currently I am in Githurai 44, Nairobi When did you meet your husband? We meet in 1997 and got married in 1998 Life was okay but as you know the joy of a mother is having children I was not blessed with a child and my journey into finding out where the problem was begun I visited different doctors trying to look for a solution because I was not satisfied with what they were telling me but I did not find a solution when did you discover you could not conceive? after 3 years into marriage and I had an ectopic pregnancy I was told I had to go for a surgery to get rid of it it was terminated at 2 months from there I thought I would still conceive but that did not happen before getting these children I experienced a long journey that had a lot of challenges Africans don't believe it's okay to live with a woman who cannot have children and on the other hand a woman who cannot have children feels really uncomfortable we have seen our parents reject us because my wife could not give me children but I decided to be patient with her because she had not wronged me in any way and I knew it was not her fault but 3 years on she experienced and ectopic pregnancy which had to be removed she was operated on and after that we were hopeful with each passing day that she will conceive again we have used a lot of money, visited so many hospitals People kept referring us to different doctors and because we were desperate we moved from one doctor to another I did not want to frustrate my wife at that point I looked for treatment in all the places I knew, from Meru, Nairobi I visited many hospitals, many doctors but I was not successful what were the doctors treating? they said the Fallopian tube was blocked some said I did not have any problem, it' s only a matter of time I will conceive were you given any medicine, underwent surgery or what exactly happened? I was given some medicine and also there is a time I underwent surgery, but all that was in vain what year was that? In 2006 that was the first surgery? Yes then what happened? I still had to wait patiently and by the time I was realizing it, 4 years had already passed and I started seeking for help from another place again at some point I visited the herbal doctors because I had lost hope what was your husband saying at this point? he stood with me, he was even accompanying me to the hospital we spend a lot even on the herbal medicine he was supportive but the challenge was with some of our friends and his family who used to insult me they said I wasn't fit being in that family when I underwent surgery to remove the ectopic pregnancy, one of the family members said I was never pregnant, that I was just pretending Those words really hurt me because it was said I was just seeking attention from the family how did you feel especially when such words came from your own family? It was painful but prayers kept me strong, I would tell God, I hope you heard that I kept asking him not to put me to shame but instead bless me I had faith that I will get a child despite what people said what else was being said about you? some of my friend said I looked neat because I don't have children they said I had a lot of time to clean they said I was doing all the cleanliness because I did not have the children to keep me busy they used to really hurt me was your husband advised to get another woman? Yes, his friends and family told him to get another woman who would give him a child My own father insulted me and said I should stop wasting my money on a woman who cannot bear children My mother would insult my wife, insult me as well saying that I was stupid we were not receiving pressure from outside because people didn't know what we were going through For instance you guys wouldn't know if we had children before or not The people who speak ill of you are your family and close friends because they know your secrets It's not even people from Vihiga or Mombasa but your own family because they know your deep secrets what exactly did your other tell your wife when she insulted her? she told her that she was wasting the sons money my wife told me about it while crying but I told her she is married to me and not to my mother I told her she will only go away after I say so and asked her to ignore what people were saying I stood my ground, I am not that type of a person who is easily swayed by words and people have known me for that most of them would not approach me to say nonsense so they were throwing all the insults at here and your own dad too kept pushing you? Yes but I told him to keep off He used to tell me when people are getting married they first do it out of love because children are never there in the first place he told me he still loves me as much as he did when we first met and I should not listen to what people were saying and we would build our house peacefully he said the children will come at God's appointed time were you scared that some day he might go against his own words? Yes, I would get worried that some day he might come home with another wife and tell to me leave but non of that happened Just how did you manage to cope during those times? God was my only hope, at times I would stay awake and cry the entire night Prayer was my pillar and also I used to have supportive friends at times I would feel like leaving but my spirit would ask me to stay because so far my husband was a good man and I decided to be patient people would talk but I stayed because those words were not coming from my husband I felt like staying was the best decision because leaving the marriage was also not a guarantee I would have a child I had a lot of faith that I would bear children As a christian I had a lot of faith, I knew one day God will surely do it for us I knew a day is coming and God will do it, I had the faith I came from a very humble background, God has been faithful. He brought me all the way from Meru to Nairobi I am thinking I was actually the first person to come to the city even before my father It is important to have faith especially when you look back and see just how far God had brought you because the Bible teaches us to have faith, you must read and understand what it says Last year in October, I did not see my monthly periods and that really worried me because I thought maybe I was hitting menopause So I went to see the doctor because anyway age was already catching up with me the doctor said the first thing he will do is to carry out a pregnancy test I just laughed and said fine, but when the test was done he told me I was pregnant I could not control my tears but still I could not believe what he told me I went to see another doctor, it took 3 tests for me to believe I was actually pregnant I could not hold those tears of joy, I kept thanking God then I went back home and informed my husband he was so excited how was it like when you confirmed indeed God had done it? Yes, were excited but we still had worries if the pregnancy would survive we were excited but had some doubts at the same time that is when I even sunk deeper into prayers asking God to enable me keep the pregnancy and have children but I had no idea they were triplets, I knew it was only one child I could not believe it because it had been so long, so I asked her to keep it a secret and not to tell anyone from home I told her to be patient and see if indeed they are children because you understand at our age it's not so common to conceive My mother had no idea until when she out to bed, but my wife had already whispered to her mum about the pregnancy I just wanted her not to tell my mother because a lot had been said about us, so I wanted it to remain a secret until we get to see God's miracles It would have been embarrassing if the secret was out then we end up not having those children again I also never told anyone at home but my wife did tell her mum her pregnancy was quite a challenge because they were triplets and at her age it was tough but we had a very nice doctor and also I was glad she did not experience the challenges like other women go through while pregnant she did not vomit but only lost appetite for a little while she did eat well, she was having enough bed, and by the way she did not even exercise like others do you see when God wants to bless you He will do it, regardless of what people say out there My wife did not do any excise and she had a bed rest for almost 5 months Days passed by and the time to receive your guests came, how was it at the hospital? I went to the hospital when I begun experiencing labour pains and I was told I will be going to the theater for Caesarean section I was worried for the babies but the doctor assured me they will be fine he said instead of experiencing that pain it was best if I get operated on I agreed I was taken to the theater and an emergency operation was done I was really worried by I asked God to have the babies come out safely and healthy but after the operation I got so excited to receive 3 healthy babies, they were all okay that was 13th April 2020 were all the angels boys? Yes when I first laid my eyes on them after the operation I was so excited, only that I could not jump because of the CS wound but it was a joyful moment, I was just praying inside my heart and thanking God Can you tell them apart? Absolutely, in fact I was the first one to note the different features This is Emmanuel Muriuki We have miracle and finally Junior why that name? I just wanted to give them the names I was comfortable with because you understand there is power in names these children are like the new testimony we have Miracle John Gitobu this is Emmanuel Muriuki, he was named after someone who passed on So Muriuki means resurrecting he is called Emmauel Muriuki Gitobu then we have Junior Rukwaru Gitobu my name, he is my junior indeed when you were coming home with your children did you remember what people said about you? Yes but I am never that person who keep grudges at times my wife is the who reminds me of the wrongs people have committed towards us by I never keep grudges Even if you wrong me today and not tell me sorry that won't be a bother to me One thing I have learnt is all humans were created by God and there is a saying that goes we ought to accommodate each other because it's obvious we never have the same character did your father finally come around? He is really happy because according to our Meru culture first borns belong to the fathers side so this is my father, my brother and another sibling who passed on my 2 brothers and my dad My dad really wanted to come but that was not possible because of the lock down and the Covid-19 issues but now that the lock down was lifted they are preparing to come, they might be here on Friday although I am worried because times are tough and you understand when parents visit you must provide their fare back I don't know if that happens all over or it's only in our place Most people who we talking ill of me have actually been calling because of corona most people are not travelling but they have been calling to congratulate me, they can't even remember how they used to insult me I have seen the glory of God and when I became pregnant I asked Him to give me the grace to forgive them all I said I will forgive each and everyone who wronged me when I was childless and indeed I have nothing against anyone I forgave them all and why did you decide to call your child Miracle? I called him Miracle because my pregnancy was a blessing I gave him that name because indeed God had remembered me It doesn't matter how long you will wait but I named him miracle to represent the rest because my pregnancy was a miracle, I have no idea just how it came about but it's only God who understands when your wife hit the age of 45 which mostly doctors say it's menopause stage did you see that being the end? some of those things we just read about them in Biology, I never gave up the hope despite her age God knows how he blesses his people, even at 45 we still knew it shall be well eventually she conceived and I can see we are doing fine, we thank God for what he has done for us sure are you guys considering having more children? With 3 boys I think I am contended, although I can't say that is the end of the road but I am okay with what I have all I am asking God is for him to add me more years so that I can raise these children myself Taking care of 3 children at once is not a joke especially for a single parent at the moment he friend visits and my win too some things we are told are being offered by the government we heard there is money being distributed by Equity we also heard Safaricom is doing the same but what happens is that money ends up in the pockets of a few rich individuals but for us who genuinely need that help, we receive nothing it's better to have genuine friends because they can bail you out when you are in need as a mother of 3 children what are you doing to ensure they get food and other needs? it's a challenge, life has been tough because since we got these children we have there is no money COVID-19 has literally halted so much in my house it has really affected me My husband is a business man who has been selling his merchandise in Uganda and Tanzania he has not been able to continue with his business though, he is in the house and then it's tough raising 3 kids at once, he has been helping me out because when they are all crying you are in dilemma on which one to sooth first we have been here in the house, we have no hope for money and that's the biggest problem we don't have enough to buy the kids milk because mine isn't enough and also to buy diapers and basically to buy food how have you been surviving to get food? we have been receiving support from our close friends, they have been of great help some have shown us immense love I can't even explain it, I thank God for them I keep praying for blessings upon them they have been of great help, at times I am even ashamed of telling them that I slept hungry or even tell them the babies have no milk because they too are struggling especially at this time I have come this far because of friends times are tough very tough, but God had a purpose when he gave me these children they are His angels I know God will make a way, once corona is contained it shall be well we shall go back to work and my husband will go back to his business God cannot fail you when He gave you this responsibility Sure it shall be well Friends have been of great help to me were it not for the suspension of public gatherings I would have invited them over to help me offset the KSh 300,000 debt that is bothering me we have been bailing each other out, even those left with huge bills when they lose their loved ones my wife underwent a Caesarean section so we incurred that bill at the hospital, because the doctors needed to be paid inclusive of other things I used all my savings to take care of that, I have nothing at the moment I thank all my friends for the support they have given me, I want them to know that I love them I am grateful for this far I am also appealing to Kenyans and well wishers to support me in any way so that these angels will not lack milk or the diapers Let them help me in whichever way they can manage that is my appeal because times are tough what message do you have for your husband? I want him to know that I love him with my heart and that is why I chose to stick by his side when others were pressuring me to leave saying he might be the cause of our childlessness I want him to know that I love him with my heart I have always wanted to grow old with him even if the children would have not have come and to always by by each others side according to God's grace I know you are shedding tears of joy sure but you are also saying that your love towards him is true Yes and that is why I never left I wish you all the best and I know you will be able to take care of these angles thank you and because of corona we do the elbow bump The family of John Gitobu has waited for more than 20 years just to receive their first child and when their time came, they were blessed with triplets they just told me that their joy has erased all the pain and insults from people Reporting for TUKO News I am Kevin Phillips Momanyi
