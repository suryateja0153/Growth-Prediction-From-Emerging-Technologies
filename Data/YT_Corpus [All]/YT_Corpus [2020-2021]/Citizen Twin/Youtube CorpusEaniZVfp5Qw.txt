 [Music] what the heck is going on here well I'm trying to read so stop attention everyone your attention please I have completed my most remarkable invention yet a cloning ray why it's a laser beam capable of creating an identical clone of living organisms well not identical 99% identical anyway I'm still working out some bugs I know a who works at all though I think he's beetle Johnson wait was that a joke because I don't understand most jokes at any rate here's the big news I am now ready to test my cloning ray on an actual person why are you so excited to get a clone little apple inside a trench coat right just hop right up onto the pedestal little apple there's a stepladder for your convenience if and now to test my cloning ray and here we go how do you feel a little Apple more like a little under the cloning ray friends allow me to direct your attention to the clone animation chamber Oh can we call it the clone zone I think we should call it the clown zone trademark look you could see little apples clone fawning inside now the clone will remain in suspended animation until I pull this lever and animate him don't you think perhaps it just appears that way through the glass light refraction and all that you know the sciency things uh I don't think that's light refraction dude as I said it is only 99% accurate there is likely to be one thing different about each clone it appears in this case that that one thing is the clone sighs now would you like to meet your clone little Apple very well little apples clone will be placed in storage along with the other members of the clone army I'm building what did you just say nothing at all who would like to try next what about orange is ready to roll very well just hold still and [Laughter] the process is complete and it appears to be a smashing success no tundra bananas what's the cartoonishly ominous alarm all about orange I think you should sit down for this Wadia doc no legs this clone is identical to you in every single way orange sounds like a great guy in every way but one that is an annoying version of me would be the worst no orange it's much much worse your clone is evil I'm sorry orange but we cannot let your clone out of the clone zone he's far too dangerous to have roaming free and we wait what's happening but it certainly is annoying not talking about I'm super evil in fact I'm about to perform my first evil deed and it's a doozy what are you gonna do evil orange yeah what are you gonna do evil me wow it got quiet in here evil orange regular orange does that like every week multiple times per week I'd say oh I see well brace yourselves because I'm about to get even more evil Oh No now instead of blowing up the kitchen I'm going to do something far more sinister I'm going to constantly annoy all of you day after day week after week year after year I'll prevent you from reading things I'll even prevent you from having anything resembling a normal conversation who's gonna tell him evil orge you see regular orange already does those things he interrupts everything we do if I may interject it's very very important that we get evil orange into storage before he it's gates oh my gosh you mean to tell me evil orange is wandering around the kitchen and we don't know where he is he could be anywhere even right here oh what a relief yeah evil orange could even be right there wink Wow which one's navel orange is it me or me or maybe I I can't distinguish them they have equal legal readings on by evil auditor wait I know what to do orange yes I have something to tell you I've decided to ask passion out on a date who cares the one on the Left dr. bananas that's evil orange opted to start you go I think you'll enjoy the other members of the army I'm building a heavy militia uh guide me book club oh forget it well orange I'm glad we straightened out your true identity it would have been a real bummer if we sent the normal version of you off into storage yeah that would have been a real bum well I never thought I'd say this but it's good to have you back orange orange could I get those red glowing contact lenses back by the way I'm doing some experiments to eliminate redeye in photographs and I need them and also the yellow ones please [Music]
