 hello there my name is Alex Bergen I'm 17 years old and I'm from Scotland I'm also a course of the team behind the international youth cooperative we live in an increasingly interconnected world and we didn't want lockdown to put a halt to this so when we came up with an idea that allowed people to continue to connect and make new friends we worked tirelessly to make this project which we felt could make a difference in people's lives a reality for days with very little sleep later i YC launched we've now been running for nearly three weeks and are rapidly approaching 1,000 responses to the forum and we have responded respond 'yes from 37 different countries the response is incredible and we feel that that is a testament to how this project can help people while we're all stuck in lockdown while we're all in quarantine just find somebody new to talk to you it could ease the pressures of isolation help with loneliness and if nothing else who doesn't want to make a new friend how we work is we have a Google Form and it takes roughly five minutes to fill out in which you fill out some basic interests that you have we then take this and match you with somebody from around the world using an algorithm that we developed who has similar interests you then have a week where you exchange emails back and forth and then at the end of the week we match you with a new buddy there are four of us working on the project myself from Scotland Luca from Italy and me Josh and Matthew who are both Canadian we would really really like although the response has been amazing we would really really like for this to keep growing and to keep reaching as many people as it possibly can thank you very much and please go and check us out we are at iyc underscore 2020 on instagram you have the link to the forum in our bio you can also find us on facebook under my on my facebook and under any of the guys Facebook which you can also get through our Instagram page thank you very much
