 The theme today is going to be about giving an overview about the FIWARE vision and value proposition and how it is helping to build the Smarter Future. Well, this session is divided into three parts We will devote some time in better understanding the overall FIWARE Vision and what is the concept behind FIWARE? The second part will be going more into the details of what it means building powered by FIWARE solutions solutions that help to solve concrete challenges in different sectors, but also Helping to convert Organizations into smart organizations and Last but not least. We are going to present a little bit. What FIWARE means Going beyond the technology because FIWARE as you will see is not just technology is about creating a sustainable ecosystem That brings open opportunities to everyone Creating smart solutions in different sectors The Presentation will be followed by question and answers so what I suggest is that if you have any questions don't hesitate to write in on the chat and Therefore after the presentation is finished. We will go a bit through the different questions pick some of them and and give some answers. The session is recorded because We want to reuse these material and make it public on the web. So everyone can Go through it and hopefully will be interesting material for Understanding what is FIWARE and I get initiated in the FIWARE venture. So let's start understanding What FIWARE is - the history and what is the rationale. Why the FIWARE initiative was created? Well We are in the middle of the little revolution that will transform the daily life of people and businesses. We are experiencing how everything that can be connected is getting connected and now generating bunch of data big data that Now we want to analyze and in order to improve the daily process of individuals and businesses It is not The first big data revolution we have experienced You know And very much connected to the web there has been other two previous revolutions digital revolutions one Related with the e-business transformation when companies gain, a presence on the internet and That digital revolution Radically transformed the way companies Connect to their customers and and their partners or even employees and this was all Facilitated by the web technology and The second revolution was about bringing Individuals the opportunity to have a presence and identity on the web on the Internet also about radically transforming the way individuals were interacting and now that these Individuals and businesses are both present on the Internet the next digital revolution, the revolution where we are in is really about improving the processes of both individuals and businesses. Businesses, because the daily life processes have to do with their operations. An interesting aspect We In trying to okay An interesting aspect, if we analysed previous revolutions is that there was a major difference in terms of platform technologies being used the e-business Revolution Was really Experiencing a boost Thanks to the LAMP stack. LAMP for those who didn't now comes with the meaning of Linux Apache MySQL and PHP and it was the very popular technology stack that help businesses health SMEs All kind of companies to be able to develop Web portals to create those channels that were transforming the way companies were connecting to their customers or partners However, the web tool Revolution was characterized by the dominance of number of platform providers and both of whom are the hyperscale businesses of the internet today and This monopolistic behaviour does not help that much in creating  business opportunities for everyone so When FIWARE was started. It was created with intent of creating Opportunities for everyone and really go for creating a technology stack, an open-source technology stack in the same vein as happened with LAMP, That would help the development of Smart Solutions. the idea is that opportunities that will come connected to help in business to Digital transform opportunities that should not be just at the hand of big corporates the big integrators also SMEs and entrepreneurs should be able to capture these opportunities Because the basic software stack and technology that will enable them to capture those opportunities Will be open source and and free. We are talking about Smart solutions so first of all, I think it's important to stop for a second to understand what it means and what Smart Solutions are. The substantial characteristic of any kind of Smart Solution: n the smart digital life of the future, everything gravitates around management of context data. Data, that describes what's going on, at anytime Where? Who is doing things? and what is the rationale behind what is happening? actually, the smart solutions are Generally following a very basic pattern which is that of capturing information from many different sources to build What we typically refer as a "digital twin". A representation of the real world and that the digital twin representation is also referred as context and once this information is capture and this way of representing the real world is Facilitated then that information will be constantly analyzed and processed to bring support To the further automation of certain processes or to bring support to smart decisions so Those smart decisions and those automated actions can of course make an impact in the real world and change that state of context Which will be reflected again in this digital representation The "digital twin" representation that we manage in any kind of a smart solution therefore Creating a sort of feedback loop, which is in a sense the Very basic pattern of any kind of a smart solution. What is interesting and actually was a bit the basis of FIWARE, is then there is no standard way or rather there was not a standard way to represent digital twins or represent information describing what is context, and actually FIWARE is defined as a curated framework of open-source components that gravitate around a new open standard for context data management supporting this digital twin representation of the world and bringing components around and Connectors with different other technologies that will help to create the different smart solutions of the future How do we model context? How we deliver this digital twin representation in FIWARE very simple way? By the means of Identifying entities. Entities that are characterized by attributes whose values change over time. A very simple and intuitive model because we believe Simple is beautiful. So, it is a very broad and General purpose model which really can work in different domains. So if we are talking about smart cities, we are talking about entities like a shop or a bus, the citizens themselves each of them being characterized by attributes. Some of them might be quite dynamic like for instance the speed of the bus. Some of them might be still dynamic, but not change so frequently like for instance, it could be the idea of the driver of that bus Because it may change perhaps let's say twice per day and and some of other attributes are pretty static like it could be the license plate of that given bus. No matter what kind of nature whether an attribute is more dynamic  or more static the point is that by means of collecting information Regarding the values of all these attributes by the different entities We are able to create a digital twin representation of the city. Entities would typically link to objects in the real world Again the shop or a given citizen  and the bus are good examples. But it may be related to some digital entity or concept like for instance "incident claim". That might be issued by the citizen. That is also an entity which has a digital twin representation. The claim is made of attributes for instance it may have an associated "location" because might be linked it to certain Issue that has happened in a concrete place in the city and you may attach the URL of a photo as an attribute. Of course the citizen who has issued the claim if he wants to might be registering his identity on the claim and so on and so forth. This claim entity is perhaps nothing that is physically present. However it is something that has a meaningful conceptual identity of its own and the fact that a claim has been issued by a given citizen at a given moment means that the context, the status of this particular detail in the representation of the city has changed and perhaps decisions have to be made and actions taken considering that this claim was created in the city. That applies to many other domains  as a concept, so we may have the agri-food domain, we may have the energy domain The entities in each domain are of course different and their individual attributes - some of them might be common across different domains, so as an example, I may think about weather measurements and understanding the current state of the weather and this consists of attributes like "temperature", "humidity" and so on. This might be relevant for both cities and agri-food so therefore the notion of reusability of data models is is also highly relevant. and of course other sectors like manufacturing where we are talking about the transport robots that by the working in in the shop floor where I may deal with Doors that needs to be open and closed the operators, you know palletize er robot and stuff like this So first idea we bring with fiber is that we came with way to model Context to model and represent Have a digital representation of the world and and the second core Aspect very much connected to this one about Context and modeling is the API The fire in DSi API why we're in DSi and DSi stands for next generation service interface And it was an API that was designed by the fiber community to bring access to contact information is a "Simple, yet powerful" rights free, public, open API that allows applications to Provide updates on context and also consume context information. We say it is "Simple" because at this moment there is a RESTful Binding that any programmer can learn how to use in just one day. "Yet powerful", because incorporates a number of very powerful features like the ability to subscribe - to get notified whenever a change happens in context. For instance, I may want to know and and receive a notification "Whenever the buses in a given area go over a certain speed" It supports Geoqueries and it supports also Federation and advanced concepts like linked data. This API was designed within the FIWARE community We created a first formally standardized version of the API, which is called NGSI v2 which was created over time and with the experience of a number of systems that were developed using the API and in 2018 We pushed for Promoting the adoption and the evolution of this API as a formal standard within the relevant section (telecommunications)  of the organization called the European standards organization (ESO) and then the telecoms section - the ETSI organization in 2019 published The now current release of the API which is Named it as NGSI-LD. "LD" coming from  an acronym for "Linked data". Typically in an architectural powered by FIWARE,  there is a core component which is typically referred as a "context broker" which is an offering a standardized endpoint - a well-defined endpoint on the internet or the local network. Through this endpoint, you can perform different kind of queries and requests using the NGSI API. One important concept with regards to Context broker technology and NGSI, is The fact that you are querying into that standard endpoint and getting values or you are  updating context information For example - about what is value of the speed of a given vehicle, doesn't mean that the Context brokers is holding that information itself. What is important for applications that interact with the endpoint That offers the NGSI API is that you can perform queries and get access to Context information. You can subscribe to get notified whenever certain changes in context happen or you can update on context and where that information is stored is not something you have to deal with. The context broker will find the way to make sure that Your request is served as necessary. That means therefore, that for instance, the storage technology as something that I mean the API is not bound to any particular storage Solution or technology nor any particular message broker in technology nor anything like that. That is one of the advantages of this concept. One of the other advantages that it comes  when such an API is defined is that IoT becomes much simpler to implement, because the whole idea is, that the value of attributes associated to entities in your system, which may be related to a given IoT sensor Are obtained by just making a simple request using a REST API. The definition of "What is the specific IoT protocol that at the end of the day is used to get that particular value" is something the programmer will have abstracted away. Similarly, I may need to perform actions on an IoT device, and and I will not have to deal with there being a specific IoT protocol that device is a supporting for actuation. I will simply change the values of some of the attributes of the "Digital Twin" Representation of the world and this will create, as a side effect, some actuation of the corresponding device and therefore creating the kind of action that I am looking for. This of course comes because, as part of the platform, we bring a number of components that helps transformations between the different IoT protocols that exist today Like OPC UA or MQTT or Lightweight M2M all are different sorts of IoT protocols and will perform the necessary translation into FIWARE and NGSI Therefore making the whole development of IoT solutions much simpler. Another advantage of defining such a standardized API is the fact that, if we have the same API across different sectors, this will be boosting development of innovative services that could combine Data coming from different organizations. like the series like the smart port or in the smart factory and you know help to create a wide range of mean digital services that were not facilitated before of course this way of sharing data across Organizations is something there has to be govern Through the proper allocation and access control policies and That is part of what also fiber brings as a solution Last but not least in the future and that is part of the FIWARE Organizations publishing and sharing part of the day that they manage Will be able to monetize that data and therefore support the development of data economy At this point you may agree this Looks everything promising and also quite you know common sense, but Wi-Fi were What is what will give you a bit? trust that Relying on five word you are taking the best decision Well, I would say is very important the NGSI Standard has been endorsed a global level or by a number of different organizations and this Portfolio is growing here. I mentioned in a few of them. So ETSI as I mentioned Has been the world class standard organization that adopted NGSI as the basis for Context information management (CIM) Within Europe. I think it's worth mentioning the Connecting Europe Facility program (CEF) This is a program launched by the European Commission that intends to identify technologies that That are recommended to be used, not only by public Administrations but also companies in the private sectors to green support to gradient of digital services That can be replicated in different member states and And they have adopted FIWARE context what the technology and NGSI-LD as the basis. Yes. I made the global Organization are gathering together all the mobile operators It has defined a reference architecture for IOT a big data Enabled systems and NGSI Becomes the core API to be used for integration of the different In that reference architecture the inform life and the beliefs is an organization in which we have been collaborating for several years and the recommending in years I as one of the aps for supporting context well Access to context information in series and we are working with them together in defining standard data models for different domains We are pioneering with the number of organizations in in in different industries in the area of manufacturing It's worth mentioning the partnership we are We have with organizations like the International Data space Association (IDSA) where we are combining the IDSA technology with FIWARE to bring support to trusted data sharing The work we are doing Regarding technologies like OPC UA which is integrated nowadays within the FIWARE technology stack or with the ROS robotics open source initiative since part of the Technologies developed in fire. We are an integral part of the ROS operating system also partners is that are relevant in the area where smart cities and here perhaps to highlight the collaboration we have with The Open and Agile Smart Cities Initiative (OASC)  that brings together more than 130 cities in all around the world which have agreed to adopt a number of What they referred as mini-moon interoperability mechanisms of which Very important element is precisely the NGSI API FIWARE context broker technology is the core component healthy architecture and FIWARE is not just a technology.  FIWARE brings a curated set Of components which can be assembled together and with other third party platform components to accelerate The development of all smart solutions.  It is true that the core and only mandatory component in any  "powered by FIWARE" platform is that all solutions must be centered around a context broker supporting the NGSI API. Nowadays NGSI-v2 and soon NGSI-LD the assembler. There are several actual implementations of The context broker technology as part of why we're so even for that element you have different options FIWARE is not about take it all or nothing you are not forced to use All the components in is suite of components you will Be able to pick Different components and combine them with your preferred products and platform components They are connectors with some of the most popular open source ones and with this be able to build your own "Powered by FIWARE" platform. The only mandatory requirement is that there is a core component Which is the context brokers 14 and ESI and that any si is the Integration API you use for the integration of the different components and the basic API for applications to manage data this is a guess an enumeration of several components of the FIWARE platform and our long the different webinars that are Going on every Wednesday almost We will You will have the opportunity to learn more about each of these components We are planning to run dedicated sessions for each of these components you can learn and dive in on the features that each of them offer and how they can help you to develop your solution Everything is available, of course and our website (fiware.org) I suggest you to visit us and particularly, if you are interested in a more technical detail connect to the developer.fiware.org and of course, we are also on GitHub because everything unify way is free and open source Now let's go into the second part trying to elaborate more in what it means building Smart solutions powered by fiber we have to distinguish between two Perspectives one is how you can use fiber to create concrete verticals smart solutions like it could be for instance a smart waste management solution for a city or a smart watering solution for farm or a smart welding solutions for a factory But also it's being used to deal and uncover the entire transformation digital transformation of organizations transforming them into all smart organizations therefore FIWARE is Instrumental in building the vision of what is a smart city? What could be a smart farm or a bar Factory? so let's start with vertical smart solutions and this is typical reference architecture that you can follow and Use when building a given smart solution. Here. We are Illustrating as an example as smart waste management vertical application that is trying to cope with the efficient management of How waste is gathered in in a given City and You see these? architectures As any architecture of a vertical smart solution powered by fiber structure in a number of layers So going from bottom up We have a first layer which has to do with capturing the data data coming from sensors coming from cameras I mean from other systems and fiber brings components that helps you to perform this data acquisition and perform the basic transformation into Entities - the digital twin representation that is precisely the second layer of the architecture where the context worker is offering management of data and these digital twin representation of those entities that are relevant for your application space and on top of that a number of components enable data processing analysis and visualization Which are the last layer on top of which the applications are created going across the different layers, of course, there is a Identity Management and access control that is supported to ensure that The data that is accessed at every moment is accessed by the Parts of the application they have their right credentials That applies to any other domain So if I go to a smart farming solution like it could be a solution solving Dealing with smart watering We would have a similar structure because again the architecture the vision how you would design Power by fiber solution is the same. We will have a dedicated Webinar in the months of focusing on going into the details of this reference Architecture on what could be the role that the difference part of this architecture will play this is essentially the same way to represent the same figure and also as 30 degrees That FIWARE brings and what the context broker technology enables is to create Assistance of systems vision of your organization Typically in your organization you will need to integrate data coming from different subsystems each of them solving a particular challenge But you want to build a listing picture of what what is going on at? Organization level and be able to monitor and and and be able to make more smart decisions by means of Merging data coming from different verticals breaking the silence and Therefore be able to exploit information at large This leads to an architecture that that looks Certain stands similar to the one that we were displaying before for individual vertical applications Why because again, the context rocket technology is the central part Around which everything? Gravitates is where you would be Bringing access and managing access to information Describing what's going on in for instance a city? Which is the what is site is this plane? And where the entities digital means representing the relevant information is getting Represented there are again layers capturing Data from sensors from cameras but also from vertical solutions some of them might be powered by FIWARE and this is the reason why you see here's and arrows that are directly connecting the systems with context broker because the countless brokers are Can be federated as we mentioned and then on top of that is where you can the kind of operation centers that exploiting Information and overall the whole history string of data since context evolves We'll be able to support a smart decisions by the city Part of this information can be something that the organization Wishes to share and publish to third parties and fire brings components that easy this publication And furthermore allows you to be able to monetize Data, you may wish to share with other parties, of course publication and monetization is subject to again a strict and Authorization and access control which becomes one of the ingredients in this target and architecture An architecture that applies when I'm talking about an overall farm management system which needs to integrate otherwise silos systems that are solving concrete Challenges by the farmer like watering silo management field stone in livestock management all these different systems now with the power by fire Architecture can be integrated to generate an illicit picture same for factories and for other entities and organizations Actually Five where four organizations are as we say bringing then support to transform into more smart This is a transformation journey that goes through a number of steps and February is driving the standards that are helping Organizations to move from one phase to the other in this transformation first starting with breaking the information silos Second by creating a market together with other organizations by means of defining common information models third supporting open innovation by means of exposing part of the data that the organization holds and last but not least enabling or participating in a data economy by means of sharing data and why not monetize part of the data I will Skip some slides for the sake of time and also because there will be a dedicated webinar on this transformation journey elaborating on the different aspects To now go to the last part in elaborate a bit on what fiber is bringing beyond the technology We are trying to build a community and ecosystem Around the technology and fostering opportunities for two elements. I want to highlight in this part of the presentation there are other elements but Today we are going to focus on two one is the farmer marketplace So one of the instruments we decided to put in place Sometime ago was creating a space where? any Company that has developed solution or a platform and wants to commercialize that Will be able to showcase what they are doing It's not an app store. So we do not Inca mediate or interfere in how these Commercialization takes place is just a catalog where we want to you know Give the opportunity to people to learn what is there what different organizations are offering and hopefully also Bringing those organizations the opportunity to get rich by potential customers or potential partners There are different Elements in these marketplace and how it's organized. We considered power by our solutions or platforms that are part of Of the marketplace. These are solutions of platforms which have the fire where context both the broker technology and a core element in the Architecture of the systems there are five already systems and devices, these are elements, which might not be Created with an architecture based on fire web but are Exposing isn't interfaces that make it easier to plug-and-play the assistance like for instance IoT devices in any Powered by FIWARE architecture last but not least we are given opportunity to companies that are offering services around fiber like for instance training and coaching or consultancy and integration services, so marketplace.fiware.org is a place we Suggest you to visit to learn more about what? people use doing with the technology the second vector we I wanted to Elaborate about the father. I haves by where I have our detail innovation hubs, which are kind of the our Banja list in a given region, they are entities organizations that Really believe in the fiber mission and value proposition and are trying to foster adoption in a concrete region in the world and are building and providing a number of services to the ecosystem that they are supporting Around the technology there are a number of services that I find where I have can provide and here is a Short summary of office. I would like to invite you to attend and check when the upcoming webinar on FIWARE I apps will take place to learn more about what it means to become a father I have if you are digital innovation have Definitely it is this way. We now use to that end. What is why where I have providing in in summary is the first of all physical hot spot where you can meet people that is working on five where where you can Network and unconnect and And participate in the local community that is flourishing around five Where in the region where they find where I have operates? It's as cool so the organizations that run if I were I have typically deal with training and Coaching bring in support to companies that want to use the technology and Understand the benefits. It's a laugh because one of the missions that are far away I have had in and one of the things they can do is to validate Over by our Solutions of I've already assistance that can be then published on the fire marketplace They also may offer Capabilities for testing your solution, etc is also a business mentor in a way because will many of these if I were I have going to Help or you know engage in helping SMEs and entrepreneurs in the local regions due to in their coat market Using FIWARE technologies or having them to to you know get in contact with potential customers to also be present and Relevant fairs and so on and last but not least is the odd in a way the community creators and at a local level because all behind FIWARE iHubs is is really about thinking globally but acting local the FIWARE Foundation in conclusion, this presentation has been about the nonprofit organization that is here to serve the needs of the FIWARE community and support all its members in Not only developing the technology, but helping create sustainable ecosystem that bring opportunities to all Lasses light is a summary of what I have tried to bring as a message in this presentation and What summarize what 5em brings to you? First of all technology that is free for all forever Open-source components they have been created through real projects and also information models that you can combine with the technology to create interoperable and reputable solutions following an inclusive approach because everyone who wishes to Contribute their technology to find where are more than welcome and a compelling roadmap Where we are integrating the latest trends I brought Jane artificial intelligent robotics and so on I invite you to come and attend to the next webinar where I will be elaborating under Rama In some of these aspects about evolution of FIWARE that is going on a growing ecosystem around the technology which has an a good Mirror in the Highway marketplace where a number of companies are creating powered by fire where solutions fire already assistance providing services and Again, where these FIWARE marketplace is trying to help as an instrument for promotion a vibrant community? engaged in the success not only involving the people and the developers that are contributing to the technology, but also Organizations and individuals that are helping to spread the word and Bill with training Foster adoption and here the network of FIWARE iHubs, this is a Quite important role as well as the FIWARE Evangelists and last but not least a Foundation which was born just with intend to help the community to grow and and achieve its Objectives an objective towards creation of a smart digital future limbic because it works as our Lima and now, I hope you have enjoyed this presentation We can now go to Q+A and perhaps answers some more detailed questions people are asking about FIWARE.
