 everyone welcome to atlanta and company i'm kara kinnear in for christine palara happy friday we made it one more week under our belts it's a blessing just to be here isn't it um and also blessing us this whole week has been the one the only bringing us it's all good stories my friend crash clark how are you buddy i'm fantastic you know like i i was mentioning earlier in the week about your beautiful background you know your flowers you look like a disney princess now i'm home broadcasting social distancing and you get to look at my kitchen [Laughter] nice i have to say that is there's an instagram account that rates people's backgrounds for tv personalities what have you interviews it's pretty funny i'll post it because it's worth taking a look at i think that's been one of the more entertaining things is to see where people live and what they choose to put behind them you know during their their interviews so it's pretty funny yeah yeah and i've had to move a few things too i've got the coffee pot of the toaster now off to the side and i cleaned up a few other scattered dishes i mean you know i live the bachelor life so you know that's kind of what it is there you go there you go we can't expect you know what no i do expect more from you crash because i know you're going to tidy up for us when we start the show i tell you this this is pretty funny so i forgot that when i tried to play basketball in middle school go with me here it's a little sidebar um that my nickname my coach coach pete nichol hi if you're watching coach he's not um nicknamed me crash because i was not good at basketball and i fell all the time so it's kind of like we're twins not really wow that's awesome i love that there's a few other crashes that i've heard of i hear there's one up in philadelphia and then actually a miami dolphin football player from way back in the day his nickname was crash uh i think his name was jim jensen or something i can't remember who he was but yeah his nickname was crash cool well i feel like i'm in good company then all right let's get started i left mine back in the 80s but uh i like yours now you're the only crash to me let's get it started with some it's all good stories oh let's do it and let's get into some real good company here with a couple of super heroes this is a great story this is out of paralymp texas a couple of twin brothers actually decided that they just want to do something nice for the kids in the neighborhood you know i mean everybody's kind of stuck at home and you know schooling from home and whatnot so they dress up like superheroes and for free they just go visit kids in the neighborhood it is such a cool thing i love the spider-man outfits now they do it for free they don't get paid but what they do is they ask for food donations and in return they take those food donations and give it to a local food pantry there in pearland texas it is such a great story within a couple of weeks they've already uh donated like 20 000 pounds of food so it's just it's an amazing story two high school seniors young kids doing something for the neighborhood i love seeing things like this yeah that realizing there's a need and then helping us um fill that need food banks need our help if you want to help check out atlanta food bank there's people like jasmine crowe with gooder trying to do um trying not to waste any food and get it to the people that need it so what a cool story the kids i believe the children are a future crash they're doing well they're doing well all right next one yeah i i love that i i wish i wish i had that kind of mindset back when i was a senior in high school because yeah we won't get into it no i know i just skating by that's what i was doing all right let's do another one here this is this is a great one right here because i love when people interact with the seniors of their community and this is mount carmel uh senior living center and what they did was they started up a little pen pal association between just local people and the seniors you know because the seniors are also struggling they're you know they're stuck in they can't see the grandkids so people started writing letters to the senior citizens and it just exploded now they get letters not only around the state around the country around the world and of course you know the citizens of the senior citizen living center are writing back to people and some of the nurses there say you have to just go ahead and be patient with them because it takes them a little longer sometimes but what a great idea for our senior community to start a little pen pal association i love that me too crash because i think anyone can write a letter and taking five minutes to write someone in a senior living facility will really brighten their day also remember back in i mean i guess the 80s the 90s when mail was really cool like you couldn't wait to get your mail and you would run to get your mail and maybe you had a pen pal mail sort of lost its luster let's bring mail back that's my hot take for the day let's bring it back bring back the mail i like that we used to have a great relationship with angelo i still remember his name our mailman from way back i mean when i was just a knee-high little grasshopper as they say and we had a great relationship with him and we had a relationship with our garbage people too the guys the sanitation truck drivers yeah it promotes community it promotes community i like all right let's get that we have about a minute left let's get the last one in really quick crash cam okay speaking of garbage workers this is really great this little four-year-old girl was surprised by a drive-by parade for her birthday by the sanitation department in clearwater florida and it's just a cute little thing because she's always out there to watch the truck she's fascinated by them so they decided to do something for her fourth birthday they all did a big truck parade and the neighbors joined in they were handing out donuts they took pictures everybody of course wearing their masks in social distancing but this little girl what a great surprise for her by the sanitation department that is so fun i love a parade in general but especially if it's brought to us by our sanitation workers i told you my seven-year-old when he was little tears i mean they were his heroes we got so excited every morning for the sanitation workers they kept us going and you keep us going my friend thank you so much for gracing us with your presents all week long we've loved having you here
