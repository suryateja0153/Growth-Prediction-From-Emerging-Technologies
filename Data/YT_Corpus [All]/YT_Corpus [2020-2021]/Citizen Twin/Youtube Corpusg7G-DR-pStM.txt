 Hello welcome to today's webinar hosted by DDEL addressing the intersection of bilingualism and disability. We are all happy to have you here today and just want to talk a bit about what we're gonna be achieving. We're hoping that this webinar will provide your opportunity to really reflect on some of the theoretical and pedagogical ways we serve our students who are bilingual learners (excuse me) and expose you to more encourage the exposure of more than one language at school and home and dispel many of the myths that are out there about how we should serve our students. I want to introduce our panelists we have Dr. Steve Przymus (excuse me) from Texas Christian University, Dr. Alba Ortiz from University of Texas at Austin,  Dr. Todd Fletcher Associate Professor at University of Arizona, and Mr. Javier Vasquez Director of Bilingual Education in Fort Worth Independent School District. Thank you all and I'm gonna hand the presentation over to our panelists. Good afternoon everyone. It's a this is a pleasure for us and this is so exciting to see so many participants coming on thank you for joining us thank you Dr. Lindo. Thank you Javier, Alba, Todd for agreeing to join me in this in this presentation. Over the next 40 minutes or so we're going to be talking about the intersection of bilingualism and disability. One way that we've come up with to address this and to talk about some of the myths associated with bilingualism and disability is to couch these myths and this content in a couple stories. So, we've thought through some  children that we know from schools and some cases of school personnel talking to us asking about this. What what program should these students be in? How should they be served? So we'll start off with a vignette, then talk about some of these myths and address them, show the empirical research that dispels these myths, and then the second part of our presentation will be a little another vignette and then service-related myths. So, I'm going to jump in here. India, do you control the screen? Do I have to say, "go on to the next screen?" Looks like it. Or, if I do you remote control, am I able to control it? Oh. there we go. Okay, so our agenda for this afternoon is to mostly address common misconceptions about the intersection bilingualism and disabilities, and kind of how we'll do this is a panel format. I'll be sharing the content on the slides and on any slide Alba, and Javier, and Todd feel free to jump in with comments, and we may spend a while on one slide talking having a conversation about this or we may spend a little time on a slide and more on another one. So that's kind of what it'll will look like. I will talk about the implications of these common misconceptions implications on instruction and intervention and decision making and policy and law so the first vignette that we're gonna put out there and ask you all to kind of think about maybe a similar situation in a school a similar student that you might have in mind these vignettes are based on real stories but we use pseudonyms and no institutional names will be shared this first one has to do with an English Learner who is removed from bilingual education program and placed in a general education English only program largely due to underlying misconceptions regarding bilingualism and disability so here's our first student we're going to be thinking about so the first student will we'll talk about is Matteo and a little bit of background about Matteo and and and the decisions made about Mateo Mateo started bilingual speech services in kindergarten after being assessed in both languages he qualified with a specific learning disability in reading in second grade and started receiving both special education inclusion services in his dual language classroom and pullout restore services at the beginning of third grade the speech-language pathologists in in thinking through her schedule for the year found that he had been removed from dual language and placed in regular programming which what the school caused a general education classroom are in our p classroom this placement decision had been made at the end of his second year between his dual language teacher and the third grade regular programming or general education teachers upon learning about this change the speech-language pathologists contacted mom and explained the change in placement to her and found out that the mom had not given permission for the change mom didn't realize that this meant Matteo would no longer be with his twin brother who stayed into a language classroom a little bit more about Matteo he expressively uses more English but receptively is strong in both his mom speaks only Spanish and after being explained her rights she ultimately decided to leave Monty Oum in the old english regular programming so when a stop here and kind of let this sink in I know some of you on the panel Javier Laboy and Todd have some thoughts about some of the decisions that were made along the way regarding my fail and so I'll open it up to to the three of you to make some some comments especially regarding the decision making well Steve a couple of things to note here in terms of the agenda yep and I think we can see four over attention and instruction that was at first you know designated and also just issues with regard to the process for decision making that we're not that were not founded in in policy whether that state or federal policy and of course you know the there is a there is a whole bunch of guidance in terms of the the admission review and dismissal committees and then also the language proficiency assessment committee that apparently in this particular scenario though don't seem to be have been followed the only other thing I would add is that this oftentimes happens before the multidisciplinary team meeting so the professionals will get together and decide what decision they're going to make and not involve the parent in those discussions and essentially they're doing it so that everybody is on the same page when they get to the formal meeting right well thank you both I think that what we see in here could be in part explained through some of the common myths that we want to talk about in in this webinar and so we're going to talk about these four myths that you can all find in a National Academies of science and engineering medicine 2017 book promoting the educational success of children and youth learning English and this is specifically chapter 10 which is dual language learners and English learners with disabilities we'll take these myths one at a time and talk about what they are and in in the following slide we'll provide the research that dismantles these these myths but I I want to before we jump into these I kind of want to say that there's this webinar is not in any means meant to to be hard on teachers teachers always work from the best decision that they believe is for the kids and advocate for kids and but what we want to express today is that a lot of those decisions come from a Falk theory a gut feeling sometimes trying to understand bilingualism from a monolingual view a monolingual paradigm and we see those in these common myths that I've heard multiple times and I'm sure you probably all have as well such as myth number one exposure to or learning more than one language will overwhelm and confuse children with disabilities myth number two is similar to that and it says existing learning and language deficits will be worsened by exposure to more than one language limiting the ability of these students to successfully learn in English and these two myths what they have in common is essentially these myths are the intersection of bilingualism and disability and we we have bolded here more than one language and that that somehow is the impetus for the disability or for the confusion and and that's the myth that we really want to dispel today a third myth we're going to talk about which unfortunately I continue to hear in schools and many of you probably have as well is that English learners should stop using the first language at home and in school in order to learn English this is a very strong fulk theory that goes like this longer time in english means they'll learn English better and faster and this Foulke theory flies in the face of a lot of empirical evidence that we have that using bilingual education strategies tap into the whole linguistic experience and lived experiences of kids and through those strategies kids learn English faster and and better and we'll share some of that and the final one is a myth that a lot of you may be familiar with as well and that goes that code-switching is somehow evidence of confusion and disability all of these as I as I explained folk theory have to do with this gut feeling of people hearing multiple languages heard from children who have been identified with a disability in reading or writing or a language based disability and from hearing more than one language may be trying to describe bilingualism through a monolingual paradigm but let's get to some of the evidence that dispels these myths so if we take the first two myths that have to do with the intersection of more than one language and some kind of confusion or overwhelming a system or or causing a disability there's just a trove of empirical research much of it coming from the 2016 special issue in the Journal of communication disorders that shows that communicating bilingually for English language learners is just a part of their lived experiences something they've learned to do since they were very little something that if we were able to look inside their brain we would see they're using one unified linguistic system and are not being confused by speaking or being exposed to multiple languages and then other research has shown that English learners are not at any greater risk for language learning than monolinguals with the same disability and that their language impairment creates no more extra challenges than those faced by monolinguals with a language impairment some of the interesting studies in this area have shown when you count words in both named languages so a vocabulary study that English learners outperform monolinguals with the same language impairment and then moving on to and I guess that it I can stop any Javier Todd and an Alba feel free to jump in at any point with with some of this I'm going to go on to the next myth and this is this is an important one that we unfortunately continue to hear that English learners should stop using the first language at home in order to focus on English this taps into the other two as well that you know somehow continued exposure at home will confuse them bill it'll worsen and already impaired language system and we just know this not to be true and more importantly if we think about the importance of family culture of values the ability to continue being involved in a bilingual community life and education goals are very important considerations into choosing the language of instruction and should be conversations in the art meeting and in developing the IEP very importantly that limiting communication making this decision to stop using the home language at home limiting communication between parents and children and making it less natural and less intimate can lead to negative psychological effects uh Steve I'd like to just just share with our audience or had them to consider really what's at stake here Willie emphasize one language over the other basically what we're advocating is that subtraction in this particular case as it relates to language is it's better these children have an opportunity and have been exposed many of them simultaneously to both languages from a very early age and so for us to emphasize one at the risk of losing the other just is is really really something really hard to really consider from here are your potentially emerging bilinguals that we have that are going to be able to communicate reason listen and speak in both languages and it's basically if you want an example it's just like cutting one of your arms off and deciding which one is is more important I think that's also important what's also important here is that states like Arizona who passed the Proposition 203 eliminating bilingual education in effect and making programs only available for kids who are fluent in English back at the beginning of 2000 had a significant impact upon students who are then placed in structured English immersion classrooms and some of the research that we did indicated that the inability or the the state law of saying that don't dare speak Spanish in school teachers couldn't even make comments or explain additional concepts to help these kids understand what they were being taught and so we haven't talked so much here does talk about the emotional development and our study indicates very clearly then the psychological issues that came up when these children were told that they couldn't use their native language they were put in these classrooms and it took a toll on the not only the children but the parents so this is very very important of course that's changed now to some degree in Arizona so we have kind of gotten back a little bit with dual language programs but this is really critical and I would like to add to that the disability doesn't really matter and the severity of the disability doesn't really matter because people think the more severe the disability the more important it is for the student to be taught in one language and sometimes that may be true but that doesn't mean that that one language should be English you have to think about you know what it which language will get you the greatest outcome for the student the other is that you know there's not a lot of research but it's very consistent this the students with disabilities who stay in the dual language programs I'll perform the the English learners who had never been in a dual language program and they outperform the students that were taken out of the deal language program and so I think the issue is complicated because the research may not make sense to people without a background in language acquisition so it makes common sense that one language is easier but if you're bilingual it makes no sense at all yeah wonderful wonderful comments thank you all you know I keep on this point here I keep going back to the vignette with Matteo who's starting in third grade will no longer have the same educational trajectory as his twin brother a decision is being made that it might eventually impact how he communicates with his mom who speaks Spanish how he communicates with other family members and that this would could likely have an impact on on emotional development has made an excellent point the bilingual education programs are English programs and so students are going to be taught English as a second language in the process as a requirement of policy in law one of the things that happens though is that there are about angle education program models where students spend quite a bit of their time receiving instruction in a language other than English and I think that's when people get confused our concern that they're thinking they're not going to get enough English instruction so I think the point is well-taken that when you have a student with a disability you've got to have the native language accommodations and adaptations for the disability you have to provide them access to English as a Second Language along with the accommodations and adaptations for the disability so I just want to confirm that that we recognize that it's about legal education program for that reason it's more than two languages the other question Steve that's coming up is whether people are going to have access to the PowerPoint would you like to answer that I definitely can share this PowerPoint I'll I'll send it to the folks at D del India I'll send you the part actually in D I sent you the power point at the beginning of this so if you don't mind posting that you know way thank you so much they see one other point with regards to the student that was exited that we're talking about the mother was consulted kind of after the fact and was convinced that yes this program seemed to be the best program for her I'm not sure if that's because of the particular orientation of the teachers and their belief system about what that look like so I think that's really in a critical thing because according to federal law the kids can be provided instruction in in their native language in special education or if not provided native language instruction some type of program objectives clearly written based upon second language acquisition principles about where the student is and to develop a really good program to ensure that if they're not getting native language instruction they're getting good English language instruction at the same time but my thought goes back to this parent and what actually took place and we also know not IEP teams and meetings and making decisions and I think it's really critically we think through how parents are either told what to do or they're asked and consultant because sometimes parents perspectives are considering yeah I taught I'm glad you brought that up I my sense is that that it could have gone a lot longer without the mom even knowing that the change happened and this the the role of the parent you're absolutely right this wasn't done right and the role of the parent will definitely come up again in the second vignette which has a different outcome and a couple different players in there so I look forward to to bringing that up again cuz I think that's an important thing to talk about the last myth that we want to to share and there we go it takes a little while after I click a couple times and then I see it come up so bear with me here is coming up a little bit and it's this idea of code-switching is evidence of language confusion and disability and code-switching it by my area research is bilingual education multiple language development and we know that code-switching has been studied for four decades but yet it from a positive point of view but yet it continues to be seen in this negative light across different contexts and we know that code switching from studies is just a normal Grammatik grammatical it's correct it's communicative ly effective behavior and does not indicate language impairment however there may be something to the term itself code switching that may sort of reify negative perceptions about it so over the last 15 years or so there's been more studies conducted more articles written about translanguaging as perhaps a more preferred term for describing how English learners use their first and other languages in natural communication I'm not sure how many in participation tonight are are familiar with translanguaging so we'll take one slide and define it and compare it to translanguaging a little bit I think that'll be helpful moving forward there compared to code switching so translanguaging refers to the language practices and abilities of multilingual x' as the user full full linguistic repertoire while they're using their first and other languages for effective communication translanguaging includes features of multiple named languages so when we hear someone trans language we may from the outside here oh that sounds like Spanish that sounds like English that sounds like Somali or however but inside the individual's holistic linguistic repertoire or system all of these ballistic features make up part of the individuals sole and unitary linguistic system what some people call the idiolect and this is individual by person so as I said from the outside it appears that these individuals are switching between different codes or different languages or different linguistic systems which is strengthened by the term code switching however or but they're just selecting linguistic features that are although socially recognizes different names languages actually unified within and used as one linguistic system that is their translanguaging to put this disty reticle definition into practice my co-author Manuel Alvarado and I conducted a study over three months where we did several rounds of dynamic assessment analyzing language transcripts of content-based story retails with newly arrived immigrants students in a middle school and in their story retails we allowed them to trans language so we said use your whole language to tell a story related to this content and this didn't mean they went back and forth all the time the target language of the school was English so they would start talking about the content with their stories in English but they didn't stop when they got to something they didn't know how to say they kept going in Spanish or Tigrinya or the language of choice and then they would go back to English and keep talking about the content and when we were done what we discovered is we knew a lot more about their content knowledge and we knew a lot more about their language ability when we allow them to trans language so this is a kind of the power of not limiting kind of Javier said not cutting an arm off of an emergent bilingual an English Learner not limiting them to one language at a time we can see what they can show us in what they know we can make better decisions about them or with them so the second vignette will take us it's very similar to Matteo but now we're going to hear about a frying sure I'd like to make the point that you know translanguaging is a common characteristic all of us who are bilingual stew it all the time in the process of instruction ultimately our goal is that the student be able to communicate effectively in the language that's called for so if it's in school that they that they'd be effective English users if it's a dual language program that they'd be able to use both languages effectively and so as we think about disability we want to think about whether students are making progress toward that goal or if they're experiencing difficulty in comparison to students who are making progress because we don't want to overlook the possibility that the translanguaging practices may include features that are not correct or not appropriate to the context our to the linguistic system and that those are the markers that you're looking for I think you made a really important point that effective students who use translanguaging practices effectively communicate effectively it's correct it fits the context and very importantly others who are bilingual understand exactly what that what they're saying and so I think that that that's the differentiation that we have to be concerned with is it appropriate effective particularly in terms of age and developmental level or is this student an outlier in terms of the communication skills one other thing to you in addition to that is that perhaps our children are just in a particular phase with regard to their use and they're you know they're relying on the translanguaging aspect of it the major point that we want to stress here is that we want to see them progress to more and more you know proficiency in in either language and that that is a sign that they're kind of moving through that particular face where they're not having to rely on it all the time we're as much as they have in the past yeah those are great points and you know I encourage everyone to take a look at some of the more recent literature on translanguaging that encourages purposeful and strategic translanguaging as a way of making connections of bridging the literacy practices of students and not as the sole pedagogical method because we do recognize that we have goals we we do recognize that we want them to be able to proficiently communicate in one language at a time we also recognize that carving out the space to tap into their whole linguistic repertoire facilitates and lifts them up and gets them to a greater ability to communicate in one language at a time if done purposefully and strategically I think this next story is going to bring up a lot of questions as well so let's briefly talk about a frien who's similar to Matteo actually aphid Ayane started bilingual speech services younger even in pre-k around second grade he had improved in in language a bit still had some articulation things that they were working on but couldn't couldn't read yet so the speech-language pathologist contacted mom for consent to test a frame and mom shared at this time that the second-grade teacher had been encouraging mom to switch a flying out of dual language and into English only regular programming or general education mom only speak Spanish was frustrated because she wanted it I aim to stay in bilingual education and after being assessed in both languages a frien was found eligible for specific learning disability in reading during the second grade year at this time the Dual Language reading teacher felt it made more sense to teach him to read in English because he was getting special education in English and had pushed to have a frying removed from bilingual education into regular programming during the admission review and dismissal or the ardh meeting what may be called in other states multidisciplinary team meeting or a student assistant team meeting the speech-language pathologists overheard the dual language teacher saying that they were definitely going to switch a finale into regular programming however during the art meeting the mom refused to dismiss a dying from bilingual education and at that moment was backed up by the speech-language pathologists the administrator in the art and as well as the diagnostician so what came out during that is dispelling the myth that he wasn't confused because of the bilingual instruction that he was struggling because he has a severe learning disability in reading so this vignette introduces new characters such as the mom taking a greater role the the admin being in the meeting and I wonder if the three of you want to comment on this well first thing I just want to mention the fact that the administrator is involved and help well as a part of the team he made this decision we know the importance of the principal in the school and informed and educated principal that knows about second language acquisition knows about English language development that and most about bilingualism and and those are rare so we don't know anything about this administrator per se whether that was the case but I think that's really an important element here yeah I agree now I would like to add also the fact that as an administrator on the campus the administrator has the opportunity to have insight and a relationship with not only the the ard committee but also the elpac if he serves on the L pack and so that insight is just indispensable in helping to lead the process and to advocate for the child and two different fronts the other thing too that is really important to note is that the individual administrator has the ability to approve and authorize whatever resources or support changes in schedule the amount of time the pacing for the student in terms of the instructional accommodations you know they really are the best person to advocate and to put into effect safeguards to ensure that the student is being served appropriately through bilingual education and through special education services Thank You Xavier I do have a question about this the DL reading teacher felt made more sense attention to read in English because he was getting special education in English I know you've talked about this a lot in terms of you know the outcome the reality the setting the context for a particular student and what really is probably best for the student whether they should be taught in English or Spanish and I don't know what would you say about this particular case I think you I mean there's several factors that are in play first question obviously is what is the language of literacy instruction that the student is is receiving and so if it's in the native language I think it's always a good idea to remain in that language if the student is is having difficulty I think you also have to think about the transition to are the development of the English skills in tandem and working from the native language skills to transfer those skills to do English reading I think the dilemma oftentimes is the issue that we don't have very many special educators who are bilingual and so then it becomes really important that there be close consultation between the Dual Language and the special education teacher the special education teacher should be supporting the the classroom teacher in terms of what strategies accommodations adaptations are required to address the disability at the same time the dual language teachers should be working with the special education teacher who may be providing support in English but that has to be provided using English as a second language strategies so I think it's important for everyone to to bear in mind matura duly identified student regardless of what context Geryon so you need the supports across context and then working with parents who can provide tremendous support in terms of native language development is is always critical yeah I think those are excellent points the other thing is that these special red team the IEP team needs to document that and make sure who's responsible for doing what and making sure that these things actually occur so I think one of the things I would suggest is that schools and districts look at their IEP form because most of the ones they've seen are designed for modeling well intervention and so when that's the model when that's the format that you're programming for one language you don't always forget that you need to look across the goals and objectives and think about what are the content goals and what are the the language goals particularly if it's in an area like literacy when are you going to do native language when are you going to do English and who's responsible for for doing it so I think what both of you all of you been talking about leads into the service delivery myths and this was a great presentation that I saw from Texas Education Agency about two common myths misconceptions about dually identified students so if bilingual education special education do you have to choose one and what you were all just saying is that student qualifies for support from both programs had that student has the right to access services from each one and as Todd was saying in Alba two this should be delineated in the IEP that should be very very clear how this is happening Xavier has brought up the art committee and the El pack the language proficiency assessment committee and I appreciate that because I think I have heard this myth as well that the the disability Trump's the language status so the you know the the special education services somehow Trump the the language needs of the student and this is not the case and that both should be working in tandem to make the best decision for a duly identified student and then finally hope that might have been the last one actually before you go there there are a couple of questions if everyone is seeing which I think are really important questions one is the case where you have bilingual parents and the student has limited proficiency in the native language and so you know what are the implications for that I think that's important because people sometimes assume that if the student is bilingual their native languages - stronger language and if those skills are deficient then that kind of supports the the referral to special education so I think that there's always the intersection of the students language proficiency and the program that they're enrolled in and that you have to consider those two things as you make the decision about the language of instruction I happen to believe that you lead with the strong suit and so that becomes really important in terms of understanding the students language proficiency and then monitoring to see how its how its developing and so this is a student who could be bilingual but they may be being supported a little differently from the ones who really are limited in their English Proficient and have stronger native language skills someone else may want to come in on that but there's another question also on the table that I'll just put on the table so that anyone can come in on and that's whether children go through a an expressive language delay particularly in at the younger age is compared to monolingual children so this is a great question because this often feeds into the the myth that they're confused we often hear this my you know a would love to hear Todd and Xavier and I'll weigh in on this as well is to me and what I've seen in some of these vignettes that I've put together is the interaction that the student has with the teacher if the student has a feeling that they are not accepted or the teacher doesn't your wants them to be in a different setting a different program or however it can be very difficult for the student who want to express their affective filter is almost 100 percent high all the time in the classroom we've actually seen from some of these stories that women when they got out of the dual language classroom they started speaking more of their native language because the risk wasn't as great as it was when they were in the dual language not that I think that's the the best decision but I will say that the interaction the identity development of the student in the interaction between the teacher will have a great deal to do with how they express themselves in with the teacher in the classroom I think also another thing too is that sometimes unconsciously there is a some micro messaging that is sent in the classroom that the children even though they're very young are very astute to picking out and to see for themselves in terms of what language preference is being you know being utilized in the classroom and then again we cannot forget the the influence and peer pressure on on the students as well everyone wants to to belong and they have a sense of and they have that need right at that particular ages they're developing and so you know you have many factors many variables that are contributing to that you know that disposition toward you know kind of being a part of the the overall community the other thing outside of the classroom is how does the overall campus view another language you know what is the micro messaging there are the or the announcements made in both languages is there is there labeling and acclaim the campus that supports the community the school community in in their understanding of the development of both languages and so you know there's a lot that goes into it and our children once again or various they pick out and they know and and so they start to make these decisions they start formulating what is acceptable and so then that that you know leads them to put into practice those things that they feel are going to be accepted yeah I would come and I think that anytime you're looking at language proficiency you want to look at exposure and experience particularly in the context of the home but you also have to look at the program of instruction because we're doing some work with students in transitional bilingual education and under-the-radar the message that teachers have gotten is that they need to transition the students as quickly as possible so the transition actually begins in kindergarten with the goal of making sure that kids are ready to take tests in English by third grade and so the kids that were working with have very limited in our case Spanish language skills and they are English dominant even though their parents are dominant in in Spanish and so that's the effect of of instruction I'll just quickly comment on some of the other questions that were asked in relation to this it isn't uncommon to see that very young children seem to be experiencing expressive language problems in comparison to monolingual peers but that tends to be because we're looking at their production in only one language if you look at the production across languages and they tend to be as expressive or more so than their their monolingual peers and in the early ages of development parents will be concerned that their children will be confused and that the exposure to the two languages may be problematic but it really is a stage in that process that kids overcome and then do very very well and so one of the other questions that was asked was about kids you know in birth through five programs that to me is probably the biggest issue we have in the field because we don't have very many dual language programs for children that young and their instruction tends to be in English and it tends to be in English without any english-as-a-second-language support so we have kind of a breeding ground for language and learning disabilities and so I think we really need to think about professor development focused on dual language acquisition for very young children and then the role of parents in terms of supporting native language development even if the school feels it can't you're placing kids in a sink-or-swim situation also when you talked about English only policy is when you have repressive language policies in states such as Arizona and it leads to this whole thing we know you know research versus ideology which we haven't mentioned but we know there's a lot of evidence for the impact in the power of becoming bilingual or multilingual I'm sorry I was just gonna make the comment that one of the things that's very interesting to me since the emergence of your language programs that include monolingual English speaking children you've seen kind of a sway to supporting your language for monolingual English speakers which kind of flies in the face of what we've been telling parents or what parents have picked up that dual language will be confusing to the child they won't be able to learn it English is the language of America so to be a citizen and patriotic you've got to acquire English so let's minimize native language and I think we really have to think about the fact that that parents of English learners still are getting that message while many monolingual English speaking families are getting the message that you need to be bilingual in a global economy it opens doors you have economic privileges that come with that and so we don't want to create another inequity in moving to dual language instruction for everyone that's Steve you could probably speak to this because in Tucson that's what we've seen is that the bilingual programs in the south of the city have been totally eliminated they're coming back but yet we have the well-to-do school districts that now have dual language programs which is seen as kind of an elite ism now so that's really well I think what you're talking about all about I don't know Steve you your kids were in the program so yeah you're absolutely right taught it and this is not it's not an anomaly just to to Tucson you can find in higher socioeconomic status more opportunity in neighborhoods you can find more opportunities for bilingual education I want to say something - what Xavier and Alba and Todd you were all mentioning is the messaging here and Xavier you had mentioned signs and schools and a research I did a while back I looked at over a hundred signs on bilingual campuses 98.5 percent of the signs that English listed first English listed on top English and unmarked English in blue which is the most popular color of Americans Spanish and red which comes in seventh I mean often denotes anger and frustration and the wrong answer and so there are implicit messages going on about what the status of languages are in school and it's not surprising that kids as you say Xavier perceptive and pick up on that in schools as what language I should be speaking or limit themselves to to a degree um one thing that I do want to address about the the preference about bilingual program what dr. Ortiz was talking about I think a lot has been impacted with regard to how we view bilingual education over the years oftentimes it's been reviewed as a remedial program for students and so during what dr. Fletcher was as he was speaking I was starting to think about you know that's not so much the perception anymore it's more enrichment and you'll see and you'll hear lots of lots of micro messaging on the positive side for Dual Language so it's an enrichment program also you know that gets the interest of everyone and and so there's been a shift at least in my in my educational career the shift from bilingual being a remedial program to now it's gotten the attention and so now it's good for for everybody it's more enrichment like but the climate in our country is a very non-immigrant which has a lot to do with people and their feelings and their self-esteem about the parents of kids who are we're bilingual and so this has a very impressive effect on our schools and on our kids in their self-identity how they identify themselves that's really a powerful message they're receiving from the top and it's unfortunate because it really creates dilemmas in kids in terms of their own identity so we've moved into kind of a question and answer period because I know although it seems like you've been pulling some questions off of the chat or have been monitoring that a little bit or the Q&A we we've gotten through the content we wanted to share with you all just to summarize our content is exposing English learners to disobey with disabilities to two or more languages is not confusing is not going to cause a disability and that bilingual education programs for English learners should support bilingualism biculturalism by literacy and lead to better academic outcomes for then compared to English only instruction and Alba you had mentioned some studies about that one that pops in my mind is dicks in 2013 found that students exited ESL services quicker students with disabilities did if they stayed in bilingual education compared to those and not and then disability related needs do not take precedence over language needs denying emergent bilinguals access to bilingual education constitutes discrimination on the basis of language status and this has been mentioned that IEP should specify language of instruction and appropriate placement we're asking for everyone to be advocates here to ensure that educational policies protect the civil rights of English learners with disabilities and access to some of the literature we've cited you will have if it transitions to the next screen so we've got five minutes or so India do you want to go to Q&A and and pick some and ask the panel absolutely time we have federal law which is backing up on native language instructions so in ID a it says that you must consider the languages of the child if such needs relates to the child's IEP and this includes whether the language of instruction should be in the students primary language to deliver the services outlined in the IEP appropriately and meaningfully so we do have there's research but there's also a federal law which supports maybe more than the bilingual ed side so much but special it has a lot of power behind it that way I think we need to realize that and advocate based upon that federal law yeah well Sutton all right you do have quite a few questions here some of them have already been answered so I've gone through I know that one question is can the prisons discuss how translanguaging and other evidence-based approaches slash practices for bilingual students impact the assessment of these students well I'll just quickly oh no go ahead Alva I was just saying it sounds like a Todd question no well I think I have a former student Megan Farnsworth who wrote an excellent article in this I mean although you're really the expert on this but I think you have I like the idea of informal assessments you have to assess language naturally and with kids there are formal assessments you can do but they're oftentimes inappropriate and decontextualized so I think it takes both quantitative and qualitative information just kind of get at the puzzle that these kids present because we have they're hard to understand this is not easy the subject of we're talking about this is very complex requires basic research evidence of your own personal clinical experience maybe working with kids other things so this is a very complex topic and I wouldn't say that I'm an expert in that I think although I think your way of dealing with it and informally that you've talked about is very powerful and most meaningful I would just quickly say that number one the losses that the instruments that we use have to be valid and reliable for the student population being tested and so when you have English learners there very few of those around even those that are available in Spanish oftentimes don't fit the the characteristics of the students are being assessed and so that's why I always think that the response to intervention you know Universal screening progress monitoring in the context of the classroom using approaches like dynamic assessment on the part of the teacher become really important data to send forward to the whoever's doing this special education assessment skills have to be assessed in the two languages students have to be given credit for all they know across the two languages even when they give an answer that's not in the language the question is being asked in so you try to tap into what is it that the student knows across languages and what can can they do and so the student who's eligible for special education should be the one who if you used formal assessments that show where the student was low functioning that that data are corroborated by informal classroom based data that says yes you know we see the same thing when we use procedures that are more appropriate given the learner and then I'm always a fan of getting the parents perspective because if parents think there's a problem and they usually tell you he's not like my other children or he's not like somebody the other kids that he plays with then I'm going to take that to the bank because parents are probably the most reliable source of information thank you I know our time is up there there was one last question that I mean there were lots of questions out maybe let you share we can maybe have some posts or thoughts and response but one question that might be a quick one was what school district is doing a great job with what the bilingual program you know do you have any models out there that folks might want to look up as guidance well I'll say it on behalf of Xavier because he may not but me here's the director of bilingual ESL education for the Fort Worth Independent School District and in the four years that I've lived in Fort Worth I have seen Fort Worth to be very progressive in bilingual education very open to rethinking traditional practice and my own children are in public school and bilingual education programs in Fort Worth so I think that may be one to take a look at Camille can I ask you a question before you say goodbye is it possible to sentence and follow-up like articles or references I know there was some on the screen but there may be some other things when we discuss today love that absolutely love to have any resources you'd like to share we're gonna post some things on our website like white papers and resources around this topic as we go forward so any resources you'd like to share you know is happy to share with our members and on our website so anyone can access and I would ask about I'll talk to you after about the webinar itself how we can post or maybe share some of the discussion we have here I've gotten okay for the powerpoints thank goodness because we random emails like crazy so I want to thank you all for sharing your time and insights with our community I think I've taken over it so hopefully you can see there thanks for joining us and where you can find our detail website and those resources but thank you all for joining us today thank you very much to all the colleagues - that I know that are listening that hi it's wonderful to see you're out there were on the front lines still working and advocating for kids absolutely well thank you all you guys have a good one you too thank you thank you
