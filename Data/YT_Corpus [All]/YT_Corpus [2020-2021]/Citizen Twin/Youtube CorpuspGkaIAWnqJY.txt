 AND I'M ALI LUCIA. THE MASSIVE RECYCLING PLANT FIRE IN BECKER IS STILL SMOLDERING. OFFICIALS NOW SAY IT IS UNDER CONTROL. HERE'S A LIVE LOOK AT NORTHERN MEDALS RECYCLING IN BECKER. YOU CAN SEE SMOKE IN THE AIR. IT'S NOT AS DARK AS IT WAS BEFORE. THE BLAZE STARTED BURNING AROUND 2:00 ON TUESDAY MORNING. BECKER PUBLIC SCHOOLS CANCELED CLASSES FOR TODAY. THE DISTRICT SAYS THERE WAS AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE IN WIND DIRECTION AND THE SMOKE AND FUMES COULD POTENTIALLY BE HARMFUL. CHECK OUT THIS DRONE VIDEO OF THE FIRE THAT WAS POSTED TO FACEBOOK LAST NIGHT. YOU CAN SEE HUGE FLAMES JUST RAGING. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH OFFICIALS DECIDED TO ISOLATE THE FIRE AND LET IT BURN OUT. THAT HELPS KEEP FIREFIGHTERS SAFE AND SAVE WATER. IT MEANS THE FIRE ITSELF WILL BURN HOTTER AND CREATE MORE BLACK SMOKE BEFORE IT GETS OUT. OUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN, GET THE FIRE OUT. OUR NUMBER TWO CONCERN, AND AS IMPORTANT IS, PUBLIC HEALTH AND AIR QUALITY AND THEY GO TOGETHER. AND THEN NUMBER THREE WOULD BE, OF COURSE, IDENTIFYING THE SOURCE AND DO WE NEED TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION? MIKE IS IN THE WEATHER CENTER FOR US. THE SMOKE SHOWED UP ON THE WEATHER RADAR, DIDN'T IT? WE DID A FEW MINUTES, THE FIRE REIGNITING YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. WE WERE PICKING IT UP ON NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE RADAR. HERE'S A LOOK AT THAT AROUND 10:00 LAST NIGHT. I POSTED THIS VIDEO TO TWITTER. YOU CAN SEE THAT PLUME BETWEEN THOSE TWO BLUE ARROWS DROPPING AS FAR SOUTH AS BLOOMINGTON, BURNSVILLE, AND LAKEVILLE. THAT'S 60 MILES AWAY. ANY SMOKE THAT DOES MAKE IT HIGH ENOUGH IN THE SKY TO GET PICKED UP BY THE WIND COULD END UP OVER COMMUNITIES TO THE EAST OR NORTHEAST OF BECKER. SO WHAT I DID WAS PLOT A FORECAST. THIS IS CALLED THE AIR TRAJECTORY FORECAST. LOOKING AT WHERE AIR THAT IS OVER BECKER AT 1500 FEET WILL END UP IN THE NEXT 18 HOURS. EACH OF THESE BLACK LINES INDICATING A POTENTIAL SOLUTION AS TO WHERE THAT AIR COULD BE AS WE HEAD THROUGH MIDNIGHT TONIGHT AND THAT SHOWS US WHERE AGAIN, POTENTIALLY THE SMOKE COULD END UP. HERE'S A LOOK FROM THE SATELLITE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE NOT REALLY SEEING ANY OF THAT SMOKE. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS REFLECTIVITY OF THE SNOW COVER BEING SENT BACK UP TO SPACE. BUT I'LL PUT THAT TRAJECTORY FORECAST ON THIS MAP SO YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE TOWNS. THERE YOU GO, ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT MAYBE AS FAR SOUTH AS EAST BETHER TO NORTH BRANCH, CAMBRIDGE, RUSH CITY, BALDWIN, ALL OF THOSE COMMUNITIES, IF
