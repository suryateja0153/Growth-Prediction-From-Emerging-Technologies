 GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO THE STUDENTS, FACULTY, STAFF, ALUMNI AND FRIENDS AT THE SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOREST SCIENCES AND THE COLLEGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON FOR OUR FIRST VIRTUAL OFFERING IN THE SUSTAINING OUR WORLD LECTURE SERIES. I'M DAN BROWN DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL AND I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED TO HAVE TIMOTHY EGAN, ACCLAIMED WRITER AND VETERAN CHRONICLER OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE AS THIS YEAR'S SPEAKER. THE AUTHOR OF 9 BOOKS AND A LIFELONG JOURNALIST, EGAN WRITES AN ONLINE OPINION COLUMN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES. HE PREVIOUSLY WORKED AS A NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT FOR THE TIMES, ROAMING THE WEST. AS THE TIMES CORRESPONDENT, EGAN SCARED A PULITZER PRIZE IN 2001 WITH A TEAM OF REPORTERS FOR A SERIES OF HOW RACES LIVED IN AMERICA. EGAN'S REGULAR NEW YORK TIMES OPINION COLUMN ON POLITICS, ENVIRONMENT AND THE AMERICAN WEST IS CONSISTENTLY AMONG THE MOST READ PIECES ON THE NEW YORK TIMES’ SITE. EGANS’ BOOKS HAVE INSPIRED POPULAR DOCUMENTARIES AND FOUND THEIR WAY INTO MANY CLASSROOMS. THE BIG BURN, TEDDY ROOSEVELT AND THE FIRE THAT SAVED AMERICA, IS A PARABLE OF THE NATURAL WORLD. THE NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER IS THE BASIS FOR A PBS DOCUMENTARY OF THE SAME NAME. HE ALSO PARTICIPATED IN KEN BURNS' DOCUMENTARY, THE DUSTBOWL. EGAN IS FEATURED COMMONLY IN FILMS. A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, A THIRD GENERATION WESTERNER AND A FATHER OF TWO, EGAN LIVES HERE IN SEATTLE WITH WHICH HONORED HIM ONCE BY NAMING ME 12 A DAY IN HIS HONOR. TIM, WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS FOLLOWING THE LECTURE. FEEL FREE TO WRITE ON YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THE YOUTUBE STREAM WHERE HE WILL BE ABLE TO READ THEM. NOW, PLEASE WELCOME, TIM EGAN.  THANK YOU, DAN. GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME FROM MY QUARANTINE HIDEOUT, MY HOME IN SEATTLE. I AM SO GRATEFUL WE CAN DREAM A LITTLE, THINK A LITTLE, LOOK AHEAD A LITTLE. IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, SUSTAINING OUR WORLD LECTURE, JUST DAYS BEFORE THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST EARTH DAY. WE OWE IN LARGE PART TO SEATTLE'S OWN DENNIS HAYES. LET'S HOPE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST AND THE ONLY ONE IN SELF ISOLATION DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO IS IN ZOOM SPACE FOR JOINING ME ON THIS LOVELY SPRING EVENTING. THANK YOU ALSO TO THE SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOREST SCIENCES AND TO DAN BROWN AND DIANE WALTERS FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. I AM A TIME TRAVELER WHICH IS TO SAY A LOVER OF HISTORY AND THIS SPRING OF 2020, HISTORY IS IN A HURRY. THE QUESTION IS WILL WE RISE TO THE URGENCY OF THIS TIME? AS I STARTED TO THINKING ABOUT THIS LECTURE SOME MONTHS AGO WHAT NOW APPEARS TO ME AS A MENTAL POST-IT NOTE FROM A DISTANT TIME AND A DISTANT UNIVERSE FAR, FAR AWAY, I THOUGHT I WOULD TALK ABOUT THE POWER OF NATURE TO FORGE A NEW NATIONAL NARRATIVE. NATURE, RENEWABLE SOURCE OF INSPIRATION TO CREATE THINGS. IT IS AN ELECTION YEAR AND I WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING MORE LASTING THAN THE DAILY DEPRESSING GRIND OF THE POLITICAL NEWS CYCLE. MY THOUGHT WAS MOST GREAT ADVANCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT ARE PROMPTED BY DISASTER. SOMETHING WE LOVE, SOMETHING INTEGRAL TO OUR WORLD, WHEN IT IS LOST, WE ARE OFTEN MOVED TO DRAMATIC CHANGE. AS ONE PASSIONATE DEFENDER OF THE NATURAL WORLD, AN OREGONIAN TOLD ME LONG AGO, THIS IS A MAN WHO SPENT HIS LIFE FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF WILDLANDS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS, YOU MAY NOT LIKE US NOW BUT WE MAKE GREAT ANCESTORS. WHEN OHIO’S CUYAHOGA RIVER CAUGHT FIRE IN 1969, PEOPLE WERE HORRIFIED. THIS WAS A PAYBACK OF A DARK AND POISONOUS LEGACY OF A CENTURY OF DUMPING GARBAGE AND PEN CHEMICALS INTO THIS VITAL WATER WATERWAY. URBAN BERBERS LIKE THIS FOR DRAINAGE DITCHES BUT THE OUTRAGE FROM THIS AND OTHER THINGS LED TO ENORMOUS REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE, STRUCTURAL CHANGE. THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WAS CREATED IN 1970. THE CLEAN WATER ACT, 1972. THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT, PERHAPS THE MOST ENVIRONMENTAL STATUTE IN THE BOOKS, ABOUT THE SAME TIME. 30 YEARS LATER, CAME THE EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL. 11 MILLION GALLONS OF CRUDE OIL BLED INTO THE PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND. I WAS THERE ON THE SECOND DAY. THERE WAS A MOURNFUL SCENE AND A JOLT TO THE WORLD'S HEART. IT MAY MANY OF US APPRECIATE THE LAST GREAT WILD SALMON FISHERIES ON THE PLANET AND TO QUESTION THE PRICE OF MOVING OIL AROUND. AS AN ASIDE, I TELL PEOPLE THAT I OWE MY NEW YORK TIMES JOB UNFORTUNATELY TO THE WORST ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO, WE HAD THE BIG BURN, A FIRE THAT CONSUMED AN AREA THE SIZE OF CONNECTICUT IN A WEEKEND. THAT IS 3 MILLION ACRES IN TWO DAYS IN THE BEAR RIVER MOUNTAINS OF IDAHO AND MONTANA. AT THE TIME, JUST BEFORE THE FIRE, SMALL MINDED POLITICIANS WHICH, I GUESS, SOMEWHAT OF A REDUNDANCY, WANTED TO KILL THE FLEDGLING UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE FIVE YEARS AFTER ITS FOUNDING. WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FIRE MADE HEROES OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY HAD LOST AND MANY OF THEM LOST AND RISKED THERE LIVES ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC LAND ENDOWMENT AND THAT SENTIMENT SAVED A FOREST SERVICE FROM THE SMALL MINDED POLITICIANS. THE PUBLIC LAND ENDOWMENT CAME IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF ONE MAN, PRESIDENT TEDDY ROOSEVELT. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THIS STORY. I HAVE TOLD THAT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIMES AND I FIND IT FAIRLY INSPIRATIONAL. ON VALENTINES DAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1884, TEDDY ROOSEVELT LOST HIS WIFE AND HIS MOTHER ON THE SAME DAY. THERE WERE LIVING IN A BIG HOUSE ON WEST 57th STREET IN NEW YORK CITY. HIS MOTHER DIED OF TYPHOID. AND ROOSEVELT WENT UPSTAIRS AND HIS YOUNG WIFE WHO HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH TO THEIR YOUNG SON, TO THEIR FIRST CHILD, DIED OF BRIGHT’S DISEASE, A KIDNEY AILMENT, ON THE SAME DAY. ROOSEVELT WAS DEVASTATED. HE FLED TO A CABIN IN THE DAKOTAS AND SPENT MORE THAN A YEAR IN SOLITARY GRIEF BUT NATURE, NATURE AND THE WEST MADE HIM WHOLE, HE SAID. THROUGH ROOSEVELT, A POWER OF NATURE FORCED THE NATIONAL NARRATIVE THAT GUIDED AMERICAN POLICY THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE 20th CENTURY THROUGH PRESIDENTS DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN, THROUGH CREATIONS OF THE NATIONAL PARKS SERVICE STARTING IN 1916, THE CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION, THE WILDERNESS ACT OF 1964 AND INTO THE FIRST PARTS OF THIS CENTURY WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA PROTECTED VAST PARTS OF THE OCEANS. LET'S NEVER FORGET, THERE WAS ONCE A RADICAL THOUGHT THAT NATURE, NATURE IN AND OF ITSELF WAS NOT THE SOURCE OF UTILITY, A SOURCE OF INDUSTRY BUT WAS VITAL TO OUR COLLECTIVE SENSE OF SELF. ANOTHER ROOSEVELT, TEDDY'S COUSIN, FRANKLIN, FACED THE DUSTBOWL WHICH I CALLED THE WORST HARD TIME, A BOOK I WROTE ABOUT THE EPISODE. THE DUSTBOWL WAS CLIMATE CHANGE IN MICROCOSM. A HUGE PART OF THE AMERICAN MIDSECTION WAS DESTROYED, DESICCATED, LEFT BARREN AND LIFELESS. AND IT WAS ENTIRELY CAUSED BY HUMANS. THAT IS RIGHT. WE HAD OVERTURN THE NATIVE PRAIRIE GRASS WHAT WALT WHITMAN CALLED THAT EVER RECURRING MIRACLE, WE OVERTURNED IT TO PRODUCE WHEAT IS A GLOBAL COMMODITY. WHEN THE PRICE OF THE WHEAT COLLAPSED, THE FARMS WERE DESERTED. THEN THE LAND, THE EARTH ITSELF, TOOK TO THE SKY. I SAW THIS ALMOST LIKE A PARABLE. ONE STORM ALONE DURING THAT DUSTBOWL THREW MORE DIRT INTO THE AIR THAN ALL THAT WAS THROWN, ALL THAT WAS EXCAVATED DURING THE ENTIRE 7 YEAR TIME PERIOD OF THE PANAMA CANAL. I TALKED TO MANY SURVIVORS OF THE DUSTBOWL. I REMEMBER ONE MAN IN HIS 90s IN TEXAS. HE WAS HALF APACHE, HALF ANGLO, A COWBOY, A LOVER OF HORSES AND OPEN SKY. HE TOLD ME ABOUT A STORY HE TOLD HIS SON WHO ONE DAY, WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING OUT AT THIS BARE AND LIFELESS LAND, ASKED HIS FATHER WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE GREAT GRASSLANDS. THE COWBOY SAID, THE CAUSE OF THE DUSTBOWL WAS VERY SIMPLE. WRONG SIDE UP. NOW PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S RESPONSE WAS TO PLANT TREES. SEND AN ARMY. CITIZEN FORRESTER'S OUT TO PLANT TREES. IT WAS TO BE A GIANT SHELTER BELT, MORE THAN 11 MILLION TREES AND YOU CAN STILL SEE SOME OF THEM STANDING. THESE GHOSTLY FIGURES ON THE GREAT PLAINS. WHEN I FIRST SAW THEM I WAS AMAZED. I SAID WHAT ARE THESE THINGS DOING HERE? IN THIS CENTURY, UNTIL, OF COURSE, ABOUT A MONTH AGO, WHEN THE PANDEMIC RULED THE WORLD ORDER, I WOULD SAY WE WERE IN THE RESTORATIVE PHASE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT. THAT IS THE GREAT ENVIRONMENTAL SET-ASIDES OF LAND AND PORTIONS OF THE SEA IS LARGELY OVER. NOW AT IS THE SMALLER THINGS. THE URBAN PARK, THE LITTLE WATERWAY RESTORED, FARMLANDS THAT ARE VITAL TO OUR COMMUNITY. MAYBE AN URBAN SALMON RUN LIKE OUR OWN DUWAMISH RIVER. THINGS LIKE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND HAS BEEN DOING THINGS LIKE THAT FOR A LONG TIME. LIKE SO MANY OF US, MY THINKING CHANGED WITH THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. IT IS THE GREATEST HEALTH CRISIS PERHAPS IN A CENTURY AND SOON TO FOLLOW, SADLY, PERHAPS THE WORST ECONOMIC DISASTER SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. I HAVE TO PAUSE, TAKE A BREATH, JUST TO SAY THOSE WORDS. AS I SPEAK, WE ARE APPROACHING 2 MILLION CASES WORLDWIDE OF COVID-19. IN THE UNITED STATES WITH MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE SICK, GOD FORBID, WE MAY LOSE 60,000 OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS. I HAVE LOST FRIENDS AS I IMAGINE MANY OF YOU HAVE, WHO I THOUGHT WOULD BE AROUND FOR MANY YEARS. SOMEBODY I ASSUMED HAD 10 YEARS TO LIVE ONLY HAD 10 DAYS AS IT TURNED OUT. THEY WERE TAKEN SO SWIFTLY. BUT I GET A SENSE OF THE PANDEMIC HAS ALSO FOCUSED THE MIND ON MANY MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW GLOBAL CITIZENS WHAT WE ARE DOING TO THIS EARTH. I WAS JUST READING ABOUT THE 1964 EARTHQUAKE IN ALASKA. THE BIGGEST IN RECORDED HISTORY IN NORTH AMERICA. THE PLATES MOVED. THE CRUST CRACKED. BEACHES BECAME CLIFFS AND CLIFFS BECAME BEACHES. VILLAGES WERE DROWNED IN THE TSUNAMI AND THE SEATTLE SPACE NEEDLE SWAYED MORE THAN 1700 MILES AWAY. A CITY ANCHORAGE WAS LEFT IN RUIN. CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT AN EARTHQUAKE. IT IS NOT A PANDEMIC. IT IS MORE LIKE A SLOW-MOTION DISASTER. INCREMENTAL IN ITS HORROR POINTS, SOMEWHAT OF AN ABSTRACTION UNTIL IT ISN'T. YOU WILL RECALL OVER THE WINTER AUSTRALIA WAS ON FIRE. THIS GOT THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD. BUT IT DID NOT NECESSARILY MOVE NATIONS TO ACTION. WHY? ONE REASON MAY BE THAT WE HUMANS ARE NOT WIRED TO FOCUS ON SLOW TERM --EXCUSE ME, LONG-TERM, SLOW-MOTION DISASTERS. OUR FIGHT OR FLIGHT INSTINCTS ARE NOT ACTIVATED BY THE INCREMENTAL, AT LEAST, THAT WAS MY EARLIER THINKING. NOW, I HAVE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING I CALL A BIG RESET. COVID-19 IS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WITH SO MUCH MORE URGENCY AND SO MUCH MORE SPEED. ALL OF THE WORLD IS ENGAGED IN A FRANTIC, MOSTLY COOPERATIVE EFFORT TO FIND A VACCINE. PHILANTHROPIES AND GOVERNMENTS AND BIG TECH AND SCIENCE ARE ALL IN. THIS SHOWS WHAT THE WORLD CAN DO IN AN EMERGENCY. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER. THIS PANDEMIC IS A HUMAN TRAVESTY. IN THE MIDST OF OUR SUFFERING, OUR GRIEF, OUR LOVED ONES LOST, OUR LONELINESS AND SOCIAL ISOLATION, WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO REENGINEER OUR SENSE OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE. LET US, AS I SAID AT THE START OF THIS TALK, ALLOW OURSELVES TO DREAM A LITTLE BIT. IN CHINA AND ITALY AND IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES, THE AIR IS CLEANER NOW THAN IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 100 YEARS. YOU CAN SEE FISH SWIMMING IN THE CANALS OF VENICE. IN FEBRUARY ALONE, CHINA SAW A 25% DROP IN CARBON EMISSIONS. AND AGAIN, THIS COMES, I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, AT A TERRIBLE COST. THE LOSS OF MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE AS OF THIS DATE WORLDWIDE. BUT ALSO, LET'S LOOK AT THE LIVES THAT WERE SAVED WHEN THE GREAT HUM OF CARBON EMITTING INDUSTRY SETTLED DOWN. TWO MONTHS OF REDUCED AIR POLLUTION PROBABLY SAVED 4000 CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 5 IN THE UNITED STATES AND MAYBE 73 THOUSAND ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF 70. THIS WAS IN THE ESTIMATE OF MARSHALL BURKE OF STANFORD'S EARTH SCIENCE DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE LESS ASTHMA AND CANCER, FEWER LUNG AND HEART DISEASES. I POINT THIS OUT TO NOTE WHAT CAN BE DONE WHEN IT MUST BE DONE. ALSO BECAUSE THE ENTIRE PLANET IS AT RISK, IT HAS MADE US REALIZE HOW INTERCONNECTED WE ARE IN THIS FRAGILE ORB OF OURS. AND I STRESS THIS IN TALKING ABOUT THE DUSTBOWL. PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS WAS --IT WAS CLIMATE CHANGE IN REAL TIME. WHEN PEOPLE USED TO TELL ME YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE CLIMATE I DO POINT TO THAT DUSTBOWL AND SAY THEY CHANGE THE CLIMATE BUT INITIALLY THEY TREATED THIS AS THE GREAT PLAINS PROBLEM. THE OKLAHOMA PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM OF KANSAS, THE PROBLEM OF COLORADO. THEN THESE STORMS TOOK THE SKY AND DROP THE EARTH FROM THE GREAT PLAINS ONTO CHICAGO AND THEN THEY DROPPED A GIANT STORM OF DUST ONTO NEW YORK CITY. THE LIGHTS CAME ON AT NOON AND IN NEW YORK. THE SAME PRAIRIE DUST WENT ALL THE WAY OUT TO SEA AND HIT SHIPS AT SEA. AND ROOSEVELT WHO I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER, TRYING TO MAKE US FIND RESTORATIVE HOPE, HE SAID I WILL NOT LET THIS BIG PART OF THE UNITED STATES GO DOWN ON MY WATCH. HE RAN HIS FINGER OVER HIS DESK AND SAID, HERE IS PART OF THE PRAIRIE. AND WHEN THEY WERE DEBATING OVER CREATING THE CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS WHICH IS THE LASTING LEGACY OF ROOSEVELT'S NEW DEAL OUTSIDE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY, CONGRESS WAS DEBATING IT AND IT WAS ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHEN IT WENT DARK AND THE RESIDUE OF ONE OF THE BIG STORMS FROM THE DUSTBOWL CAME BY AND THE PERSON PROMOTING THIS SAID, POINTED OUTSIDE AND SAID THERE, GENTLEMEN. THERE GOES THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. SO PEOPLE REALIZED THEY WERE INTERCONNECTED. IT WAS NOT OKLAHOMA'S PROBLEM. SO I LOOKED AT THAT AND IN LOOKING FOR, LOOKING TO HISTORY FOR GUIDANCE, LOOKING TO HISTORY FOR SOMETHING WE CAN LEAN ON RIGHT NOW. I GO BACK TO ONE OF THOSE ASTRONAUTS THAT TOOK THAT PITCHER OF OUR EARTH, THE MOON WALKERS TOOK THAT PICTURE OF THAT TINY BLUE ORB AND IT MADE US REALIZE HOW MUCH WE WERE AT RISK AND HOW TINY WE WERE AND IT HELPED TO TRIGGER THE MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT AND MADE US REALIZE HOW INTERCONNECTED WE ARE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO BORDERS. YOU COULD NOT SEE ANY BORDERS FROM THOSE PICTURES. YOU DID NOT SEE IDEOLOGY. YOU DID NOT SEE NATIONALITY. YOU ONLY SAW OUR FRAGILE BLUE HOME. NOW, A PANDEMIC LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE DOES NOT RESPECT OUR FLAG. IT DOES NOT RESPECT A NATIONALITY. AND IT DOES NOT RESPECT A BORDER. STILL, AND THIS IS JUST MY NATURE, I AM AN OPTIMIST. EVERY DAY, I CHECKED THESE PANDEMIC NUMBERS COMING OUT OF OUR STATE AND WE ARE SEEING SOME ENCOURAGING SIGNS. THE GROWTH RATE IN NEW DEATHS, THE GROWTH RATE IN NEW COVID-19 CASES IS FLATTENING OR EVEN FALLING. WHY IS IT DOING THAT? BECAUSE WE ARE FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF SCIENCE. BUT FLATTENING THE VIRAL CURVE, SADLY, IS EASIER THAN FLATTENING THE CLIMATE CURVE. THERE IS NO HEARD IMMUNITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT THERE CAN BE HEARD MENTALITY. A POSITIVE ONE. AS WE LOOK AHEAD, AND WE TRY TO SEE THIS FROM NATURES PRISM WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES ALL OF US, CONSIDER A NEW NATIONAL NARRATIVE FROM NATURES POINT OF VIEW AND FROM TWO DIFFERENT SIDES. PERSONAL AND THE POLITICAL. SO LET'S START WITH THE EASY PART, THE PERSONAL. MOST OF YOU KNOW THE WORLD WAS POISED FOR A MASSIVE GLOBAL EARTH DAY NEXT WEEK ON 22 APRIL, 50th ANNIVERSARY OF EARTH DAY. A SHOW OF MUSCLE, THERE WOULD BE GIGANTIC CROWDS EVERYWHERE AND 180 NATIONS. WE WOULD HEAR FROM POPE FRANCIS AND GRETA THUNBERG WITH ONE MESSAGE THAT WE ARE IN THIS THING TOGETHER, WE HAVE LIMITED TIME AND IF WE LOVE NATURE, LOVE LIFE ITSELF, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. PANDEMIC INTERFERED, OF COURSE. BUT THE FORCE IS STILL THERE. THE ENERGY IS STILL THERE. THE MOTIVATION IS STILL THERE AND I WOULD ARGUE, BECAUSE I AM HOPEFUL THAT THAT MOTIVATION IS GREATER THAN EVER. I AM ENCOURAGED BY THINGS LIKE PROJECT DRAWDOWN. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE HEARD OF THIS. IT IS A LEADING NONPROFIT WHICH CAME OUT OF A BEST-SELLING BOOK AND STARTED IN 2014 THAT SEEKS TO REACH DRAWDOWN, THE LEVEL AT WHICH CO2 EMISSIONS START TO DROP AND I WAS READING ABOUT THIS TODAY, READING UP ON IT AND I REALIZED THAT IS FLATTENING THE CURVE. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. PROJECT DRAWDOWN IS BROUGHT TOGETHER CITIES, UNIVERSITIES, CORPORATIONS, NONPROFITS, COMMUNITY GROUPS. IT IS THE FIRST ORGANIZATION THAT I KNOW OF TO MEASURE AND PROJECT THE IMPACT OF SPECIFIC ACTIONS. THEY HAVE DONE THE MATH. THEY HAVE ANALYZED OVER 100 SOLUTIONS. THE REST IS UP TO US. YES, US. CONSUMERS. CITIZENS. HOMEOWNERS. FARMERS. BUSINESS PEOPLE. TRANSPORTATION PLANNERS. TEACHERS. EDUCATORS. HEALTHCARE WORKERS. PARENTS. GRANDPARENTS. CHILDREN. PARTNERS. SO ON ONE LEVEL, THE BIG RESET THAT I HOPE WILL FOLLOW THIS PANDEMIC, A BIG CHANCE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY, MAYBE THE SINGLE BIGGEST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN HISTORY, AT LEAST THAT WAS THE VIEW OF DR. JOHNSON FULLY IN PROJECT DRAWDOWN WHO MENTIONED IT IN A RECENT TALK. HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MOVE $1 TRILLION INTO THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. SO I AM ALSO ENCOURAGED BY GROUPS LIKE “WE ARE STILL IN”. WE ARE STILL IN. THIS GROUP WAS FORMED AS A POWERFUL, POPULAR, INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING WE ARE OUT, WITHDRAWING FROM THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT IN 2017. IT IS A COALITION OF CITIES, STATES, COMPANIES, TRIBES, FAITH GROUPS WHOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SIGNED A DECLARATION MAKING A COMMITMENT TO A SOLUTION. MORE THAN 2200 BUSINESSES INCLUDING SOME VERY BIG NAMES, APPLE, McDONALD'S, WALMART AND WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN WE ARE STILL IN? DO THESE COMPANIES HAVE TO BE PRODDED? YES, OF COURSE. COMPANIES ALWAYS HAVE TO BE PRODDED BUT ALSO, THEY FOLLOW MARKET DEMANDS. SOLAR WIND IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD AND MANY PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, ARE CHEAPER THAN COAL. COAL IS YESTERDAY. COAL IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF CO2 EMISSIONS SO GOOGLE ANNOUNCED NOT LONG AGO AN ENERGY PACKAGE OF RENEWABLES THAT MAKES ITS CLEAN ENERGY PORTFOLIO LARGE ENOUGH TO POWER ALL OF URUGUAY. EVEN WITH THE PRICE OF OIL TANKING RIGHT NOW, ALTERNATIVES ARE SOARING UNTIL ONE DAY VERY SOON, JUST PERHAPS A FEW YEARS AFTER THIS 50th EARTH DAY, THEY WILL NO LONGER BE CALLED ALTERNATIVES. I THINK IT IS INEVITABLE. YOU SEE, SOME PROJECTIONS SAID BY 2025, BATTERY-POWERED CARS WILL BE CHEAPER THAN THOSE RUNNING ON GAS. NOW CALL ME AN OPTIMIST BUT THAT IS WHAT THE PROJECTIONS ARE. IT IS NOT JUST THE BIG STUFF. BUT THE DAY-TO-DAY STUFF. CONSIDER WHAT WE EAT. A PLANT-BASED DIET IS EASIEST ON THE PLANET. CONSIDER HOW WE MOVE. ENERGY EFFICIENT CARS AND TRANSPORTATION. CONSIDER WHAT WE CONSUME. OR WE CAN CONSIDER WHO WE PUT IN OFFICE. THIS BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT ON THIS RESET. THE POLITICAL. IT IS AN ELECTION YEAR, AS NOTED EARLIER. YOU CAN'T AVOID IT. TIME FOR ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THE NATIONAL NARRATIVE. TIME TO BUILD SOMETHING FRESH AND NEW. TIME TO START SOMETHING. WE WILL WRITE THIS CHAPTER. IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT POLITICIANS AND DIAPERS MUST BE CHANGED OFTEN AND FOR THE SAME REASON. I DON'T KNOW WHO SAID IT BUT I LIKE THE LINE AND I HAVE USED IT BEFORE. SCIENCE, CHERISHING SCIENCE, CHERISHING FACTS, CHERISHING REALITY IS WINNING JUST NOW. WHY? BECAUSE LIFE ITSELF IS AT STAKE. PEOPLE HAVE NO TIME FOR POLITICIANS SPOUTING BS. YOU SIMPLY CAN'T GASLIGHT A PANDEMIC. ALL CLIMATE SCIENTISTS AGREE WE ARE APPROACHING A TIPPING POINT. AND THAT POINT IS CONVERGING WITH AN ELECTION TIPPING POINT. DENNIS HAYES, WHOM I MENTIONED EARLIER, THE NATIONAL ORGANIZER AS I SAID OF THE FIRST EARTH DAY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO THAT COVID-19 ROBBED US OF EARTH DAY THIS YEAR, TOOK IT AWAY. WE HAVE LOST MANY, MANY THINGS. I, AS I SAID, HAVE LOST SOME FRIENDS BUT AS DENNIS SAID, IT ROBBED US OF EARTH DAY. HIS IDEA? HE SAID, LET'S MAKE ELECTION DAY EARTH DAY. LET'S MAKE ELECTION DAY EARTH DAY. NEXT YEAR, THE 195 NATIONS THAT SIGNED THE PARIS ACCORD AND 2015 ARE BOUND TO SIGN ANOTHER. WILL THE UNITED STATES BE THERE, WILL WE WRITE A NEW CHAPTER OR WILL WE CONTINUE AS THE ONE ROGUE NATION SITTING THIS OUT? THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS ON NOVEMBER 30. LOVE OF LIFE IN ALL FORMS IS A POWERFUL MOTIVATOR. YOU HAVE ALL HEARD, I THINK MOST OF YOU HAVE HEARD, OF NATURE DEFICIT SYNDROME. THE IDEA, DRIVEN IN PART BY THE FACT THAT 80% OF ALL AMERICANS DO NOT GET ENOUGH EXERCISE OUTSIDE OR WORSE, NEARLY HALF THAT AMOUNT ARE JUST ENTIRELY INACTIVE. BUT JUST BEING EXPOSED TO NATURE, KIDS, WHO THIS IS USUALLY APPLIED TO, GET A SENSE OF ADVENTURE, THE CURIOSITY IS PEAKED. MOST OF US HAVE BEEN OUT IN THESE LAST FEW WEEKS ON THESE LOVELY SPRING DAYS. WE ARE LUCKY, SEATTLE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC APRIL FROM A WEATHER PERSPECTIVE. IT IS A WONDERFUL RELEASE OF OUR SELF ISOLATION. WE ARE ALSO LUCKY TO LIVE IN A CITY, THE ONLY BIG CITY IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN SEE 3 NATIONAL PARKS FROM A DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER. NO OTHER CITY HAS THAT DISTINCTION. IN THESE SPRING DAYS, HAS NATURE EVER BEEN SO SWEET? DID ANY OF US EVER APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY IN OUR LIVES, MORE THAN WHEN WE BROKE OUT OF OUR QUARANTINE FOR A FEW HOURS? ON MY RUNS THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS AND PARKS AND IN THE PART OF THE CITY WHERE I LIVE I SEE A LOT OF KIDS DOING OLD-FASHIONED THINGS, RUNNING, RIDING THEIR BIKES, PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK, CHASING A BUTTERFLY. TAKING IN THE NATURAL WORLD. THE KIND OF THINGS ME AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS USED TO DO WHEN WE WERE LITTLE KIDS. NOW, PARENTS MAY BE WONDERING AND UNDERSTANDABLY SO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BRING A KID INTO THE WORLD TODAY? A WORLD THAT THEIR KIDS MAY FIND UNINHABITABLE? BUT THE KIDS AREN'T THINKING THAT. THEY ARE JUST DEVELOPING A BOND WITH THIS EARTH, SOMETHING THAT WILL CARRY THEM, CARRY WITH THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. AND THAT BOND IS IMPORTANT. SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT USING NATURE TO FORGE A NATIONAL NARRATIVE I WILL JUST TELL YOU MY OWN STORY IN BRIEF AND IN CLOSING HERE. I GREW UP IN A BIG FAMILY OF 9. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY. WE CERTAINLY DID NOT HAVE A SUMMER HOME. I NEVER EVEN STAYED IN A HOTEL. UNTIL I WENT TO COLLEGE. IT WAS THIS COLLEGE, BY THE WAY, THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON. BUT MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID, WE WERE RICH. OUR SUMMER HOME WAS PUBLIC LANDS. WE HAD A STAKE IN THE 500 MILLION ACRES OF THE PUBLIC LAND ENDOWMENT THAT I TALKED ABOUT THAT CAME IN LARGE PART, LARGE PART FROM THE GRIEF OF TEDDY ROOSEVELT. THAT ENDOWMENT WAS AND IS PART OF OUR INHERITANCE, OUR DEMOCRACY. YOU ARE A CITIZEN. YOU BECOME A CITIZEN, YOU ARE BORN A CITIZEN. THIS IS ONE OF THE DEEDS GIVEN, THIS IS PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE. SO OUR BIG FAMILY OF 9 WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, WE WENT ON A LOT OF CAMPING TRIPS IN MONTANA AND IDAHO. WE LIVED IN EASTERN WASHINGTON. IT WAS WHERE I SAW SOME OF THE STANDING CHARCOALED DEAD TREES FROM THE BIG BURN. SOMETHING THAT HAD A MYSTIC RESONANCE TO ME. I HEARD WHISPERED MYTHIC REFERENCES TO THIS HUGE WILDFIRE, SEE THESE CHARRED OUT CEDARS, AND SECOND AND THIRD GROWTH FOREST HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS BEHIND THAT UNTIL WE EXPLORED IT LATER. BUT LATER AS I CONNECTED MY OWN LOVE OF NATURE TO A LARGER NATIONAL NARRATIVE, I DID CONNECT MY LOVE OF NATURE TO A LARGER NATIONAL NARRATIVE. GOING BACK TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE CIVIL WAR. WHEN HE GAVE THE GO-AHEAD FOR CALIFORNIA TO PRESERVE APART OF THE YOSEMITE VALLEY BEFORE THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS NATIONAL PARKS. MOST PEOPLE DATE THE FOUNDING OF THE PARKS TO YELLOWSTONE BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT, LINCOLN AT A TIME OF WAR WHEN THIS NATION WAS TORN APART, WE WOULD HAVE 600,000 DEAD, HAD THE FORESIGHT TO OPEN A WAY TO WHAT WOULD BECOME YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK. AND THAT VALLEY INSPIRED JOHN MERRILL WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE FOUNDING OF THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE WHICH HAPPENED IN 1916. PARKS ARE AMERICA'S BEST IDEA AS KEN BURNS CALLED THEM IN HIS DOCUMENTARY AND THOSE PARKS SAID A MAN WHO COULD NOT WALK WITHOUT THE AID OF METAL BRACES AT HIS KNEES, THAT BEING FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, SO INSPIRED HIM THAT HE SET ASIDE WHAT WAS IN THE OLYMPIC FORCE AND SAID IT AND DECLARED IT AS THE OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK. THIS AT THE DEPTHS OF THE WORST ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE IN OUR HISTORY. SOMETHING MADE HIM HOLD. THIS MAN WHO COULD NOT WALK IN THOSE WOODS. SOMETHING MADE HIM SEE BEYOND HIS OWN AGE. THE CYCLE CONTINUES. IT WILL ALWAYS BE SO. SO, YES, WE ARE IN PERIL. AND YES, WE ARE IN CRISIS. BUT WE ARE GOING THROUGH HELL AS THE SAYING HAS IT, YOU SHOULD JUST KEEP GOING. THE LIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS PANDEMIC IS THE CHANCE FOR A BIG RESET AND THAT RESET WILL BE WHEN WE TRANSLATE OUR LOVE OF THIS EARTH, OUR LOVE OF NATURE INTO SOMETHING GREATER. THANK YOU, AGAIN, EVERYONE FOR JOINING ME AGAIN ON THIS LOVELY SPRING EVENING. I THINK WE HAVE SOME TIME TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. OKAY, WE HAVE SOMEONE MENTIONED THAT MANY OF THE NATURAL WORLD IS COMING BACK IN HUMANITY'S ABSENCE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND HOW DO YOU SQUARE THAT? HOW DO WE COME TO THIS AND AVOID HURTING THE NATURAL WORLD SO MUCH. THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. I STRESSED AS I TRIED TO SAY SEVERAL TIMES IN THIS TALK THAT THIS IS A HUMAN TRAGEDY AS THE SPANISH FLU WAS 100 YEARS AGO. LET'S NEVER FORGET THAT. BUT IN THE MIDST OF THIS HUMAN TRAGEDY WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD SLOWS DOWN. WE TAKE A MOMENT TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND IT HAS SHOWN A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I'M REPEATING THIS BUT IT HAS SHOWN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU TREAT CLIMATE AS AN EMERGENCY THE SAME WAY WE TREAT THE PANDEMIC. WHY ARE WE TREATING THE PANDEMIC AS AN EMERGENCY? BECAUSE LIVES ARE AT STAKE AND PEOPLE MAY ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS TO LIVE IF WE CANNOT FIND A VACCINE. WELL, CLIMATE CHANGE, WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE YEARS BEFORE IT IS IRREVERSIBLE SO I AM HOPING THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE IN THIS LITTLE WINDOW THAT WE HAVE THE POWER TO ACT. IT IS GREAT. SO SOMEONE ASKS, HOW DO WE DEVELOP HERD MENTALITY SURROUNDED BY SCIENCE DENIERS IN POWERFUL POSITIONS. WHAT CAN WE DO TO CREATE THE BIG RESET? TERRIFIC QUESTIONS. MY ABILITY TO ANSWER THE, THE HERD MENTALITY I TALKED ABOUT IS A CONSENSUS. IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW, IT IS REALLY HARD TO FIND A CONSENSUS ON HARDLY ANYTHING. BUT THERE IS A CONSENSUS ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. I SAW A POLL THE OTHER DAY THAT SAID 95% OF THE PEOPLE THINK THAT SHELTERING IN PLACE IS THE RIGHT THING. IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY GIVEN WE CANNOT AGREE ON ANYTHING. NOW THE CONSENSUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE MAJORITY OF EARTH SCIENTISTS HAVE ALWAYS SAID ONE THING AND A SMALL MAJORITY, A SMALL MINORITY OF MOSTLY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED PEOPLE HAVE SAID ANOTHER THING. SO THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO YOU ALIGN THE TWO? I THINK THAT THIS IS SORT OF FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM, A GATEWAY DRUG INTO DISCUSSION OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT YOU ARE SEEING THE THREAT, THIS PANDEMIC POSES AND IT OPENS UP PEOPLE TO SEEING THAT WE HAVE A LARGER THREAT WHEN WE ARE THROUGH THIS. WE WILL BE THROUGH THIS. WE WILL HAVE A VACCINE. BUT OPENING THE BELIEF IN SCIENCE, TRUSTING SCIENCE OVER POLITICS. AS I SAID, YOU CAN'T GASLIGHT A PANDEMIC AND YOU CAN'T GASLIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE EITHER SO I JUST SEE, I HAVE BEEN READING OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS ABOUT HOW TRUST IN SCIENCE, TRUST IN EXPERTISE, TRUST IN PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT. THERE HAS BEEN A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT SHIFT, FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT INTO THIS MISTRUST AND THAT WILL TRANSLATE, I THINK, INTO ACTION. NOW, THE BIG RESET. WELL, AGAIN, SO MANY OF THE THINGS I MENTIONED THIS IN A NEW YORK TIMES COLUMN THAT I WROTE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WERE CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE, JUST SOCIAL DEMOCRACY THINGS LIKE OH, MY GOSH, UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, 27 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE NO HEALTHCARE SO PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW, NOW THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONSENSUS AT THE VERY LEAST WE ARE GOING TO GIVE FREE TESTS, FOR TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS COVID-19. WHILE THAT IS A DOOR OPENING TO PEOPLE SAYING, THE INSANITY OF NOT HAVING UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND THAT IS WITH THE POLITICAL NEEDLE MOVES. ALL OF THE WORKERS ARE DOING SO MUCH. THE FIRST RESPONDERS OF THE PANDEMIC NOT JUST IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY BUT IN OUR DAY-TO-DAY LIVES, PEOPLE THAT ARE KEEPING US FED, KEEPING GROCERIES ON THE SHELVES, DELIVERING THINGS. AND THEN OF COURSE THE NURSES AND PEOPLE WHO WORK IN TRANSPORTATION AND ALL OF THAT. LEARN TO SEE THEM FOR WHO THEY ARE. WE ARE STARTING TO VALUE THEM. THAT IS A RESET. SO IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO GO FROM SAYING WHY DON'T WE TREAT THESE PEOPLE WELL TO A FAIRLY UNIVERSAL SUPPORT FOR SOMETHING LIKE RAISING THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE . -- I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS FOR A FAIRLY LONG TIME, STUDYING HISTORY FOR MUCH LONGER TIME, AS I SAID, THE START OF THIS DISCUSSION, I CONSIDER MYSELF A TIME TRAVELER. I LIKE TO DIP MYSELF INTO AN EPISODE AND TEXTUALLY FEEL THAT TIME AND NOW I'M WORKING ON THE BOOK ABOUT THE 1920s AND I TRY TO GO REALLY DEEP INTO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THESE AND DOING THAT, I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN HISTORICAL EPOQUE EXCEPT FOR SOMETHING LIKE WORLD WAR II WHAT WE HAD TO -- I MEAN, WOMEN WERE NOT REALLY INTO THE WORKFORCE UNTIL WE HAD --THE FACTORIES. I HAVE SEEN PARALLELS. MY READING OF HISTORY HAS SEEN PARALLELS. SO HOW DO WE GET THIS RESET? I THINK THE OPENING IS ALREADY THERE. IT IS NO LONGER AN ABSTRACTION TO ASK FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. NO LONGER AN ABSTRACTION TO SAY WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CLIMATE BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN US OTHERWISE. SO --SORRY? YES. I AM READING A GOOD QUESTION HERE. YOU SAID BEFORE THE STRUGGLE OF THE AMERICAN WEST IS THE WEST OF POSSIBILITY OR THE WEST OF POSSESSION. THANK YOU FOR REMEMBERING THAT LINE. THAT WAS IN A BOOK I WROTE ABOUT THE WEST THROUGH CALLED LAST THROUGH THE WIND AND MY QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU SEE THIS TIME OF QUARANTINE AND LAND CLOSURES INFLUENCING THIS DYNAMIC. ALSO SOMEONE ELSE ASKED ABOUT NATIONAL PARKS AND WHY CAN'T WE USE THEM, RELATED QUESTION. GREAT QUESTIONS AND YOU KNOW, LET ME SEE IF I HAVEN'T, IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED IT YET, I HAVE BEEN AN OPINION COLUMNIST FOR THE LAST ALMOST 15 YEARS. I LEFT THE NATIONAL DESK AND WENT OVER TO THE OPINION SIDE AND SO WHEN I GET PAID TO DO FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES IS BE A PROVOCATEUR TO HAVE OPINIONS. I THINK IT IS INSANE TO CLOSE PARKS. CLOSE MUSEUMS? YES BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE IN TIGHT SPACES. CLOSE THE SMITHSONIAN, YES, OF COURSE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AGAIN IN TIGHT SPACES AND YOU CAN'T REALLY CONTROL THAT. BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU FOLKS BUT ME, ANECDOTALLY, EVERYTHING I HAVE HEARD FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING TO ME IS THAT, MY GOD! THANK GOD FOR NATURE! THANK GOD WE HAVE THE OUTDOORS OR I WOULD BE GOING CRAZY. I WENT FOR A WALK THROUGH THE OLD GROWTH FOREST OF SEWARD PARK WHICH IS JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM WHERE I LIVE. AND I LOOKED AT THESE 500-YEAR-OLD CEDAR TREES. THIS IS THE OLDEST INTACT OLD GROWTH FOREST IN SEATTLE. 250 ACRES. WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE ANGLOS CAME HERE AND IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY RENEWING. I JUST I TOOK MY DAUGHTER AND WE WERE PINCHING EACH OTHER. THE WHOLE GROUND WAS QUAKING SO THE QUARANTINE AND NOT OPENING THE PARKS IT SEEMS INSANE YOU CANNOT HAVE SIMPLE RULES. I GO FOR RUNS EVERY DAY AND EVERY OTHER RUNNER I SEE UNFORTUNATELY, I CANNOT SAY HELLO BUT WE RUN AROUND EACH OTHER. I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW ALONG SO I SAW A COUPLE OF THINGS TODAY IN THE NEWS THAT THERE IS STARTING TO BE MORE OF A PUSH AND A CONSENSUS THAT THE PARKS, MOST OF THE PARKS, SHOULD NOT BE CLOSED AT THIS TIME. HAVING SAID THAT, I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE PROTECT PARK EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS PUT ANY OF THESE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, BY THE WAY THE PARKS SERVICE IS THE MOST BELOVED FEDERAL AGENCY IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY DO THESE POLLS ON WHICH AGENCIES THEY CHERISH AND LOVE AND CONSISTENTLY, I AM SORRY, FOREST SERVICE, USUALLY COME IN SECOND OR THIRD BUT THE PARKS FOREST IS LOVE THE MOST. I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO PUT LIVES IN PERIL BUT IF THERE IS A WAY TO DO IT WITH PROPER SOCIAL DISTANCING TO HAVE RANGERS KEEP THEIR DISTANCE, TO HAVE THE ENTRANCE, PLACES, TO HAVE DISTANCE, WE CERTAINLY SHOULD BE OPENING UP GOD'S COUNTRY AND AMERICA'S BEST IDEA BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL BE HUNKERED DOWN FOR SOME TIME SO -- YES, SO THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT FORAGED FISH OF THE SALISH SEA. FORAGE FISH SPAWNING IN RECORD NUMBERS AS A RESULT OF THIS PANDEMIC. I SEE THIS AS HOPE TO SAVE OUR SR KW POPULATIONS? WELL, I AM NOT A MARINE BIOLOGIST SO I WILL TAKE SOMEWHAT OF THE PASS ON THAT AND I WON'T TRY TO GASLIGHT YOU ON IT BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED AND I MENTIONED IT EARLIER BUT NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, IT GOES TO MY THEME ABOUT HOW NATURE CAN HELP US FORGE A NEW NATIONAL NARRATIVE. WHEN WE FIRST LEARNED THAT THE ORCAS OF PUGET SOUND WERE IN PERIL AND WE SAW THAT I THINK IT WAS A MONTH-LONG AGONY OF A MOTHER ORCA CARRYING AROUND HER BABY AFTER SHE DIED SURFACING ON THE SALISH SEA, IT BROKE MILLIONS OF HEARTS AND REALLY TOUCHED PEOPLE IN WAYS THAT NO POLITICAL SPEECH, NO PAPER, NO BOOK, NO ABSTRACTION CAN IN JUST SEEING THE LIFE ITSELF AND THE HEARTBREAKING IMAGE OF THAT MOTHER WITH HER DEAD ORCA AND WHAT IT DID TO PEOPLE REALIZING, WHAT IT DID WAS MAKE YOU REALIZE, WHY IS THIS GREAT ORCA POD STARVING TO DEATH? WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE SALMON. WHY IS THERE AN ADEQUATE SALMON? PARTLY BECAUSE OF WHAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS DOING TO THE OCEANS AND PARTIALLY OR MAINLY BECAUSE OF HOW WE HAVE REENGINEERED THE LAND AT THE COLUMBIA RIVER USED TO BE THE GREATEST WILD SALMON FISHERY IN THE WORLD. THEY HAD 20 MILLION SHELLFISH. THEY HAD TO GO TO 6000 THOUSAND FEET. SIX THOUSAND VERTICAL FEET TO SPAWN. SO SEEING THOSE ORCAS STARTED, I THINK, A CHAIN REACTION OF NATURE AND WHAT WE ARE DOING TO NATURE AND I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE WAYS AND A PRIME EXAMPLE OF WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT, HOW WE CAN USE NATURE ITSELF TO FORM SOME SORT OF A LARGER NEW NATIONAL NARRATIVE. HOW DO YOU PLAN TO SPEND EARTH DAY? WHAT CAN WE ALL DO AMIDST THIS PANDEMIC TO CELEBRATE OUR PLANET? WELL, A GOOD QUESTION AND THANK YOU. I LIKE TO THINK I DID COVER THAT IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO THINGS, THERE IS THE PERSONAL AND BECAUSE I AM PRETTY HUNKERED DOWN LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, AND IF THEY REOPEN OUR CITY PARKS, THEY TALKED ABOUT DOING SEATTLE A WEEKEND CLOSURE, IF WE REOPEN THOSE PARKS I WILL PROBABLY GO FOR THAT WALK OR RUN AGAIN IN SEWARD PARK ON A TRAIL, THAT YOU WILL SEE 500-YEAR-OLD CEDAR TREES AND DOUGLAS FIRS AND VARIOUS OTHER FORMS OF LIFE . THERE ARE TWO BALD EAGLES IN THIS PARK. IT ALWAYS AMAZES ME THAT WE LIVE IN A CITY LITERALLY OF 5 MILLION PEOPLE AND I CAN SEE NESTING BALD EAGLES FROM MY BEDROOM WINDOW SO THE PERSONAL IS I WILL PROBABLY DO SOME SORT OF PERSONAL RESTORATIVE OR SOMETHING TO FIRE ME UP ONCE AGAIN. THE LARGER THING OF WHAT I WILL DO ON EARTH DAY IS I WILL PROBABLY START WRITING ANOTHER --START CHANNELING THAT PERSONAL LOVE INTO A POLITICAL RAGE BECAUSE I AM NOT GOING TO LET IT PASS. I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE A NEW GRANDFATHER. MY DAUGHTER GAVE BIRTH TO TWIN BOYS, IDENTICAL TWINS. AND IN FACT, THEY ARE WITH US NOW IN QUARANTINE. IT IS A LONG STORY BUT HOLDING THEM IN LOOKING INTO THIS NEW LIFE, JUST FIRES ME UP MORE THAN EVER TO REALIZE THAT I CANNOT LIVE, LEAVE THIS EARTH TO THESE PEOPLE IN CRAPPY CONDITION. GET ABOUT CRAPPY CONDITION. I CANNOT LEAVE THIS EARTH TO THEM IN A WAY THAT MAY KILL THEM SO THE QUESTION IS, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I WILL DO SOMETHING PERSONAL. I WILL HUG MY GRANDKIDS, GO FOR A WALK OR RUN IN AN OLD GROWTH FOREST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY AND MARVEL AT THE THINGS I SEE, MAYBE SEE SOME NESTS IN THAT PARK. THEN I WILL DO SOMETHING POLITICAL WHICH I THINK EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD DO, TOO. MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID SOMETHING. HE SAID, SOMETIMES IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAY. IT'S WHAT YOU DON'T SAY THAT'S MORE POWERFUL. WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT IS THE DON'T SAY IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP. IF YOU DON'T GO TO A PUBLIC MEETING, IF YOU DON'T GO, YOU DON'T VOTE, YOU DON'T CHANNEL YOUR PASSIONS ABOUT MOTHER EARTH INTO SOMETHING POLITICAL BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL QUESTION AS WELL AS A PERSONAL QUESTION AS WELL AS A SCIENCE QUESTION SO THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO. SOMEONE ASKED ABOUT RESTORING A SENSE OF WONDER AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS VERY WELL PHRASED. HOW DO YOU RESTORE YOUR SENSE OF WONDER? SO I AM JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE. EVEN THOUGH I AM AN OPTIMIST, I GO THROUGH THESE PERIODS WHEN I AM JUST INCREDIBLY DEPRESSED. IT OFTEN HAPPENS IN A POLITICAL MOMENT WHERE SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING AND I SEE THE TIDE GOING THE OTHER WAY. THE REASON THERE ARE SO MANY WRITERS IN SEATTLE IS BECAUSE THE GLOOM ITSELF IS CREATIVE. IT FORCES YOU TO BE CREATIVE, IT FORCES YOU TO GO INWARD, IT FORCES YOU TO TRY TO REACH FOR THINGS AND WHEN I GO INTO THESE GLOOMY PERIODS, I USUALLY COME OUT OF IT FAIRLY STRONG. INSTEAD OF FEELING APATHETIC THAT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING, I FEEL A STRONGER SENSE OF RAGE AND WANTING TO DO SOMETHING. BUT THE QUESTIONER REALLY NAILED IT WHEN YOU SAID, HOW DO YOU RESTORE YOUR SENSE OF WONDER? WELL, YOU CONSTANTLY RENEW YOURSELF. AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO, A REALLY SMALL SCALE, I DO IT ALL THE TIME, I’M A GARDENER. I GROW A LOT OF EDIBLE PLANTS AND I AM LUCKY I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE WHERE I CAN, YOU KNOW, MY POTATOES ARE SPROUTING RIGHT NOW AND HAVE KALE AND GARLIC THAT WINTERED OVER AND THERE ARE COMMUNITY GARDENS ALL OVER SEATTLE IF YOU DON'T HAVE PROPERTY YOURSELF. YOU CAN JOIN ONE OF THESE COMMUNITY GARDENS. I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHEN I WHERE I LIVE ON THE SOUTH END, BUT ASIDE FROM THE MAJESTIC, SEEING MOUNT BAKER TODAY , IS IT RESTORING YOUR SENSE OF WONDER, SEEING MOUNT RAINIER TODAY IS RESTORING YOUR SENSE OF WONDER BUT ALSO SEEING THOSE LITTLE SPROUTS COME THROUGH FROM WHAT HAD FORMALLY BEEN THE COLD EARTH RESTORES MY SENSE OF WONDER AS WELL. SO LET ME SEE, ANY QUESTIONS I MAY HAVE MISSED HERE? YES, SO THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION. HOW DO YOU ALIGN THE UNDERSTANDABLE NEED TO OPEN THE ECONOMY FOR PEOPLE'S BENEFIT AND ALSO THE JUSTIFIABLE NEED TO SLOW DOWN IN THE SPIRIT OF CLIMATE CHANGE? THE BIG RESET? IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. AND THAT'S THE THING THAT PEOPLE OF FAITH IN THE NATURAL WORLD WILL HAVE TO DO WELL TO COMMUNICATE. THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO AND I COULD NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH IS BE TONE DEAF ON THIS THING. THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS SAY THAT WELL, THE ECONOMY SHUTDOWN, SEE, THAT SHOWS WE DON'T HAVE AS MANY CO2 EMISSIONS. NO, THAT JUST SHOWS YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU HAVE TO SHUT DOWN. DOES IT MEAN THAT CHINA HAS TO REOPEN ITSELF WITH ALL OF THOSE COAL-FIRED PLANTS WHICH ARE AMONG THE LEADING CONTRIBUTORS TO CO2 EMISSIONS WHICH ARE KILLING US ALL? NO. WHY ISN'T THAT A RESET MOMENT? I WROTE ABOUT THIS RESET AND I HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING THEY ARE GOING TO USE IT TO PUT SOLAR PANELS ON, THIS FINALLY CONVINCED ME OF IT, JUST HAVING SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT FINALLY CONVINCED ME. AND YOU ARE SEEING --INTEREST --AS WELL. YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SAY, I AM DOING THIS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM A PANDEMIC. WHAT YOU DO WANT TO SAY IS WHEN WE COME OUT OF THIS AND WE ARE DONE GRIEVING, WHEN WE PUT OUR SORROW IN PERSPECTIVE --LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO DIFFERENTLY. LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE WE DON'T HAVE FURTHER SORROW AND THE TRAGEDY OF CLIMATE CHANGE. RISING SEAS ARE GOING TO KILL A LOT OF PEOPLE. A WARMING CLIMATE IS GOING TO KILL A LOT OF PEOPLE. I AM NOT ALARMIST ON THIS BUT THIS IS WHAT THE CLIMATE PANEL SAID THAT WE WILL HAVE MASSIVE DEATHS AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE FROM THE CURRENT CONDITION SO I LIKE TO THINK THAT ITALY, WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THIS, THEY WILL SAY THINGS LIKE OH MY GOD, THE INDUSTRIAL TOURISM OF VENICE BASICALLY DESTROYED THE PLACE AND MAYBE THEY WILL HAVE A TOURISM THAT IS KINDER AND GENTLER ON THE LAND. MAYBE THEY WILL ALLOWED TOURS AND THAT ALLOWS TOURISTS TO SEE THOSE FISH IN THE CANALS. WELL, I THINK, FOLKS, THAT THATS, LET ME SEE IF THERE IS --I DON'T KNOW -- THE POSSIBILITY FOR URBAN ADAPTIVE SPECIES SUCH AS CROWS AND RACCOONS TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS DUE TO DECREASING HUMAN ACTIVITY IN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT DUE TO THIS COVID-19. THAT IS KIND OF A LOADED QUESTION. I AM NOT SURE I AM PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE ALL SEEN THESE PICTURES OF THE MONKEYS RUNNING AROUND WHERE THE TOURISTS USED TO FEED THEM --MONKEYS AND ELEPHANTS IN PLACES LIKE THAILAND. CERTAINLY, I KNOW BLACKBERRIES WOULD SPROUT FROM THE SIDEWALKS BUT IF WE EVER DISAPPEAR, I AM NOT SURE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE ADAPTIVE SPECIES AND I SAID, I AM NOT REALLY SURE I CAN GIVE YOU A GOOD ANSWER ON THAT. LET ME SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE HERE SO I CAN MAKE SURE I TOUCHED EVERYONE, ANSWERED EVERYONE'S QUESTIONS. THERE WITH ME, FOLKS. YOU HAVE BEEN REALLY, REALLY GOOD. NO, I THINK --OKAY I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT SO LET ME JUST CLOSE AND FIRST OF ALL, THANKING EVERYONE FOR TAKING TIME ON THIS SPRING EVENING AND THANKS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOREST SCIENCES AND YOU KNOW, SUSTAINING OUR WORLD PUT THIS TALK IN A TIME CAPSULE AND THOSE GRANDKIDS I TALKED ABOUT WILL OPEN IT UP IN 80 YEARS FROM NOW AND THEY WILL PROBABLY LAUGH AT THE GRANDFATHER IN THIS LITTLE TIME CAPSULE SPEAKING FROM A PANDEMIC. I HOPE THEY ARE SEEING THIS 80 YEARS HENCE FROM A WORLD THAT LEARNED FROM THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE CAN ACT WHEN WE HAVE TO ACT. I HOPE THERE WILL BE RESTORED AS I AM STILL RESTORED AS ALL OF YOU WHO TUNED INTO THIS TALK ARE RESTORED BY NATURE ITSELF SO THANK YOU ALL. BEST OF HEALTH AND EVERYONE AND DON'T FORGET, IN NOVEMBER, THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO TO CHANGE THE POLITICAL CLIMATE. SO I AM GOING TO SIGN OFF AND, GO DAWGS. THANK YOU, FOLKS. WE WILL TALK TO YOU LATER.
