 [Music] um [Music] michael debakey is a true renaissance man his interests ranging broadly beyond medicine to literature music history philosophy political policy social issues and varied other areas he embodies the best but it in the science and politics and advice and wisdom and friendship and all that but but it never steers very very far from just being a good treat or patients you know the patient-doctor relationship is actually extremely important in any kind of healthcare system american people are very knowledgeable about medical care and then they're knowledgeable about getting good medical care that's evident also you see the increasing use of medline by the public michael ellis debakey was born to lebanese immigrant parents in lake charles louisiana september 7 1908. his father was a pharmacist and businessman his mother an accomplished seamstress the family name was eventually anglicized from the original spelling young michael's keen intellect manifested itself at a very early age and as a reward for doing well in his school work his parents would let him read the encyclopedia britannica he had completed the entire set before entering high school and his prowess wasn't confined to academics in those early years he played several musical instruments played sports learned to sew and enjoyed gardening debakey graduated from the tulane university school of medicine in new orleans in 1932 and within that same year stamped himself as a medical prodigy ford was at age 23 that he created the roller pump a device that provided continuous blood flow during operations this was before the time of blood banks so dr debakey used the pump to transfuse blood directly from a donor to a patient that pump would find a permanent place in the history of medicine when some 20 years later it became a crucial part of the heart lung machine that made open-heart surgery a reality yes in democratic america everybody is doing his bid there goes jimmy stewart on his way to enlist with the outbreak of world war ii dr debakey volunteered and while serving in the surgical consultants division of the u.s surgeon general's office he saw a need for delivering better surgical care to soldiers on the battlefield auxiliary surgery groups or asgs they'd be called small mobile units attached to larger field and evacuation hospitals the initial deployment of an asg came in 1943 to support the fifth army in north africa sicily and italy and it proved that asgs could maneuver with combat units and sustain operations within just a few miles of the front lines so in the allied invasion of normandy asgs supported the first third seventh and ninth armies debakey's vision came of age during the korean war as the asgs were renamed mobile army surgical hospitals or mash and the post-evacuation mortality of wounded soldiers dropped from 8.5 in world war one to four percent in world war ii and to around two and a half percent in the korean and vietnam wars after world war ii debakey's tour was extended a year so he could help shore up the veterans administration hospital system surgeon general kirk called me in and said i need you to stay on would you stay on for another year i asked the surgeon owner to let me call a hundred surgeons whom i knew well every single one agreed to stay on which really touched me we can think of no individual who has made a commitment to veterans in the care of veterans more passionately or more effectively than dr michael e debakey in 1946 debakey proposed that the millions of military medical records generated during world war ii could provide a starting point for valuable studies of the long-term effects of wartime injuries and illnesses he then drafted a blueprint for an agency to coordinate such research the medical follow-up agency since the agency's creation as dubiki predicted hundreds of follow-up studies on veterans have produced a wealth of information about the progress of countless medical conditions in 1958 the agency began compiling a database of pairs of twins who had served in the military the resulting twin registry which now lists nearly 16 000 pairs remains a tremendous resource for research in the 1996 keynote address to the national academy of sciences national research council dr debecky examined the 50-year history of the veterans medical follow-up agency evolution and prospects this handwritten first draft of that speech is illustrative of the fact that debkey always preferred pen or pencil and paper writing it out longhand rather than use a typewriter word processor or computer in fact colleagues say he didn't even own a personal computer until his wife gave him a laptop in the final months of his life when debakey returned to civilian life he went back to the tulane school of medicine but in 1948 moved to baylor university in houston which at the time had a small rather undistinguished medical school early on dr debake's quest to develop a world-class medical center in houston met with opposition and he became disenchanted planning to return to tulane the baylor board of trustees intervened however and persuaded debakey to stay at baylor giving him kart blush to fix things the fix was accelerated soon after when the houston navy hospital was turned over to the veterans administration and debakey was asked to help staff and run it the va hospital became a teaching facility of the baylor college of medicine and would later be renamed the michael debakey veterans affairs medical center debakey's surgical excellence and innovation soon made the medical world take notice of baylor and houston and help transform both dr debakey became a professor of surgery and chairman of the department of surgery at the baylor college of medicine where he later served as president from 1969 to 1979 and chancellor from 1979 to 1996. as the years passed he earned a worldwide reputation as a medical statesman advising every u.s president from harry truman to george w bush as well as international heads of state and royalty when great britain's duke of windsor traveled to houston for a date with debakey's scalpel he quipped i'm going to see the maestro in the 1950s dr debakey partnered with another brilliant heart surgeon dr denton cooley they formed a formidable team at the baylor college of medicine and methodist hospital in houston but in 1960 cooley went his separate way one of the reasons i separated from mike was i felt that he was too abusive of all of his residents and medical students and so forth and i didn't think i could be permanently involved in that environment i was never let's say anything around or hitting anybody or anything like that there are times when i was pretty sharp with my tongue but mostly i was trying to to uh show them how to eliminate errors you know dr devaki has sometimes has a reputation of being a little bit hard to satisfy at least in the operating room no but he's incredibly good to patients yes that's hard very he was very very considerate and attentive to the patients and i remember when i was at um at bellevue we would go we saw a friend uh my follow him we'll see patients and he he was a little bit like the grandfather of everybody there yeah exactly very very nice and generous of himself debkey the tough taskmaster existed in sharp contrast with the dr debakey whose soothing compassionate nurturing demeanor with patients became a hallmark of his career dr o h fraser recalls his student days and debakey's response to fraser's being late for a surgery that was scheduled for 7 am he said well you know if you really cared if you actually cared about the patient you would have been here at six you see if you were here at six then you could have seen the patient shed his anxieties seen what the anesthesia could do to help calm them and you could have been with him and you could have learned a lot but of course you would have to care to do that since you obviously don't care you know he just wouldn't let you off the hook you know when you look at his schedule what he needed to accomplish within a 24-hour period or the week period or whatever i mean he didn't have any real free time and so things that would interfere with that with his time schedule would be very irritating to him and he would want to minimize those and so he did it by being a tough task master and you know once he was on you you made sure that didn't happen again his schedule went on as his program through the 1950s and 60s debakey's accomplishments laid a solid foundation for his soaring reputation in 1952 dr debakey successfully repaired an aortic aneurysm a ballooning of an artery by cutting out the damaged segment in the abdomen and replacing it with a graft from a cadaver in 1953 he performed the first successful carotid endarterectomy the removal of fatty plaque from the neck arteries as a treatment for stroke debacy can actually thank luck for one of his major innovations you see seeking to use synthetic instead of cadaver grafts he went to a department store to buy some nylon but the store was out of dylon so a clerk suggested a new product dacron dr debakey liked its field bought a yard and then used his wife's sewing machine to create his first artificial arterial patches and tubes dacron turned out to last for decades as a surgical graft while nylon by contrast broke down after about a year in 1964 dr deveki's team accomplished the first successful coronary artery bypass using a transplanted leg vein to reroute blood beyond the blocked coronary arteries and in 1966 he performed the first successful implantation of a ventricular assist device vad that he had developed a heart pump to effectively bypass the left ventricle of the heart the chamber that does the pumping it was also in the mid-60s that debakey chaired president johnson's commission on heart disease cancer and stroke in addition regional medical centers can provide the most advanced diagnosis and treatment for heart disease and cancer and stroke and other major diseases there were a number of things that came out of it that were worthwhile for example you take the widespread steps of the coronary intensive care units that really came directly out of the rnp program that's a good example i would say that that the cancer the cancer institute's program largely uh was developed as a consequence of this report even though the regional medical program failed the cancer institute you know took off he creates systems concepts ideas and he has the stick-to-itiveness to see them through to reality one of the important visions that debacy began pursuing during the 1960s and 70s was the total artificial heart in 1963 he convinced congress to allocate funding for an artificial heart program at nih to spur the development of mechanical heart replacements within a few years he and other researchers were testing their experimental hearts in animals and discovering myriad problems that would have to be solved before the devices could be used in humans in 1969 some nine years after dr cooley dissolved the debacy partnership the two were plunged into an infamous feud when cooley without debacy's knowledge or approval commandeered an artificial heart prototype that debakey had developed and implanted it into a patient for 40 years debacy refused to talk to cooley in the 1980s debakey happened to perform a life-saving heart transplant on an engineer who worked for nasa and that chance encounter marked the start of a collaboration between the space agency and the surgeon so working with nasa engineers debakey helped develop a space-age version of the ventricular assist device there are scores of surgical instruments that he invented and this latest ventricular assist device is really a wonderful little contraption this marvelous little pump i mean he has a a pump which is not much bigger than my thumb that can pump six liters a minute it's about the size of a double a battery it's an actual flow pump so no valves so it makes it very simple you see and because of its size it's easily implantable in the chest now the pump isn't interesting for you historians this is very much like the archimedes screw as dr debaker would say archimedes but there's a diffuser and as you come through with the impeller here it's it's actually rotating on the basis of having magnets in the impeller as well as in the actual pump itself on the frame the blood would come into the ventricle from the left atrium and it would come into the pump and the pump would just move the blood right on through initially our approach was to have this last for the amount of time that would allow them to be a good candidate for a bridge to transplant but i think the most important uh probably innovation in all of this will be the use of these pumps auxiliary pumps chronic heart failure debakey's tiny pump battery driven and controlled by a miniature computer was first implanted in germany and debakey was there to witness the successful surgery firsthand a prolific humanitarian debacy performed more than 60 000 cardiovascular procedures and trained thousands of surgeons who practiced throughout the world to express their appreciation those students founded the michael e debakey international surgical society through a career that spanned more than seven decades dr deveki received dozens of national and international awards including the u.s army's legion of merit in 1945. the rudolph mattis award in vascular surgery 1954 the american medical association's distinguished service award in 1959 the albert lasker clinical medical research award in 1963 that award was renamed the lasker debakey clinical medical research award in 2007 the presidential medal of freedom in 1969 the national medal of science in 1987 the united nations lifetime achievement award in 1999 and the congressional gold medal in 2008. he's earned the fame that he has and he clearly has demonstrated his own personal commitment to excellence throughout his career michael e debakey championed the national library of medicine and was a tireless supporter and promoter of the nlm twice serving as chair of the library's board of regents and it was in fact debakey who as a member of the second hoover commission in the early 50s spearheaded the effort to have the armed forces medical library transferred to the department of health education and welfare be renamed the national library of medicine and be established on the nih campus in bethesda maryland to be perfectly honest i think the establishment of the national library of medicine has had such a tremendous impact upon the expansion of knowledge and transmission of that knowledge and you know today there is virtually no lag between new knowledge coming out of any kind of research activity and it's it's a clinical application the national library of medicine has done a lot more to make it the library a much more active force in the transmission of new information and in a sense in the education of not only the medical community the public itself we appreciate all that you've done for the library thank you very much it's been a really very very great satisfying and a great pleasure for me to see what's what the library has done and particularly to see down what you've done with the library because during your tenure you have really expanded this activity beyond anything that we had any vision for the library it's really extraordinary late in his career whenever dr debakey was asked about some of the most dramatic medical advances since his days as a young doctor in the 1930s he would cite the simple case of a man with a fractured hip his chances of surviving was virtually zero because he put him to bed and he developed pneumonia and there was no significant treatment of anyone he died today he gets a new hip replacement walks out of the hospital two three days later even as dr debakey entered his 99th year he still exhibited the same drive to ensure that patients needs were being met we would go and see them and he would go and make rounds at the age of 99 and and we would come up with him and he'd be on top of it or he would call them and even late in his life he had the same dedication to take care of patients that he knew exactly what he should do in his later years dr debakey realized yet another of his dreams the creation of a high school that would prepare young people many of whom are minorities for potential careers in medicine he just had the idea that he ought to do something to help all of the people particularly minorities of houston to try in medical science to enter the profession so the culmination of education and a career that is satisfying provides an opportunity to be a good citizen and to contribute to the society in which that citizen lives in the final analysis what nobler goal is there in life dr michael debakey was a lifelong scholar authoring all or parts of more than 300 articles and books debacy took who he was and what he had to say very personally always choosing his words carefully and each and every word flowed from his mind to his hand to the page whether it was a letter pamphlet book or lecture and no matter the subject it was well thought out organized and unfiltered as if providing a measure of synergy to the debacy legend in the last year of debacy's life denton cooley initiated a reconciliation and their rift was mended dr michael e debakey's amazing life carried him to within two months of his 100th birthday [Music] the acknowledged father of modern cardiovascular surgery passed away quietly in 2008 and is buried in the arlington national cemetery
