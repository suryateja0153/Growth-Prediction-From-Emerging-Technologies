 Why does your vote matter? Well, allow me to tell you a story. This is my family. My grandparents came here in search of a better life for themselves and their three sons, including my dad. They arrived in San Francisco just over a hundred years ago, in 1915. But it was a time of xenophobia and racism, particularly against those from South Asia, like my family. Shortly after my grandparents arrived Congress passed a new law banning South Asians from coming to the U.S. But my grandparents were lucky, they were here together. They bought a home and started a business. In 1921, my grandfather even achieved his dream and became an American citizen. But just two years later, his dream was shattered. In 1923, the Supreme Court made it illegal for South Asians to be American citizens. My grandfather’s citizenship was nullified and he was left without a country to call his own. This destroyed him. And sadly, a few years later, he took his own life. In a letter he left behind he wrote: “I came to America thinking, dreaming, and hoping to make this land my home.” “I established myself and tried to give my children the best American education.” “But they now say, I am no longer an American citizen. Now, what am I?” What have I made of myself and my children? We cannot exercise our rights.” “Is life worth living in a gilded cage?” It was more than 20 years later before the laws were changed and South Asians, including my dad and my grandmother, could finally apply for American citizenship. This is why voting matters. I hope my family’s story is a reminder of what we've endured to get the rights we have now, how easily they can be taken away, and how hard it is to win them back. If you haven't yet, please register to vote right now. And please, please, vote in November.
