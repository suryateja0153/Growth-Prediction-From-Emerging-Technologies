 that this is come to us via Twitter this is coming from the Whittier neighborhood I don't know if they're sound on it or not but these are police officers moving through the streets of the Whittier neighborhood I did see this this is so we'll replay it but you can get an idea of just how serious people are where they're literally oh my walking down the street and if you pay attention you'll hear the police say get in the house there are several commands and then you'll hear light them up and then that's when you get the the fire we'll play it again [Music] what we gonna say no I was gonna say she I had seen this tweet as somebody had tweeted this to me and she's saying that the National isn't obviously National Guard in a Minneapolis Police sweeping the residential street shooting paint canisters at us on our own front porch right and it's tough right because we heard a report we've talked some people at pimento restaurant earlier Pat and they were like everyone in the Whittier neighborhood this is video from earlier in the evening folks everyone in the Whittier neighborhood is on neighborhood watch and people are keep an eye out because we want it to be safe and we're all dialed into one another one woman told us she was armed and she's like if anyone comes through here that we don't know we're stopping them and that's what we're doing so you probably think maybe their intentions were good being on their porch where the police are like hey we gave you a couple warnings the letter of the law says curfew be inside and there was the the the conflict over it there I mean I can tell I don't think those folks think they're do anything wrong being on their porch and the cops are like we want you inside so I mean talk about the tenor and tone changing dramatically from last night well that is a remarkable piece of video watching troops walk down marks down a city street in Minneapolis and and show someone on their own porch and and we reporters asked the Commissioner of Corrections about this tonight Commissioner Snell who was handling all the duties tonight and he said that people are getting caught up in it that inadvertently that many police are many police are wearing masks of course they're heavily armed are they've got a body vests on Kevlar vests and they in some cases people have been whacked on their legs with batons on their own fortunes so that seems pretty extreme but these police and the curfew order was asking people to stay inside apparently what the doors closed and locked even people who are protecting their neighborhood so there is some misunderstanding I think by a lot of us as to how far this goes if I'm standing at my front porch but I was startled to see that video
