 I would find myself talking to those men the moment we part ways and I get to the house that spirit comes then it would tell me not to accept but instead I should masturbate I was at my sisters house at that time so I would get hold of a bible to read  As I am reading the spirit attacks me and I do it You would masturbate at your sisters house? I started breaking all the ties I had Say for example if I was with Cliff I would break the covenant between me and Cliff I prayed until God showed me that it is broken at that time who were you preaching to? People, I used to be invited to so many churches to preach You preach during the day and at night you masturbate? I would go to preach in a certain Church in Thika and people would really get blessed but at night, the spirit would appear and mock me asking me what was that I was preaching during the day and yet it I was it's property I grew up in a family where mum used to visit witch doctors It's like she was seeking for a solution because of family problems witch doctors used to come to the house and perform their witch craft My mum decided to get saved but before that I used to experience challenges I would wake up in the morning and find a scar on my face it's like something burnt me there's a time I woke up with a swollen face I would get scared of going out because of how I looked and in school, most teachers used to hate me for nothing Like the spirit of rejection was always surrounding me I joined High School but still I was confused on who exactly I was Later I joined College in College I can't remember what really happened, but I met a certain guy The guy told me that he loved me I was so excited because I wanted to experience what being loved means, I was also still naive the first night with him I got pregnant You slept with him the first night? after I got pregnant, it's like the guy already wanted to make me his wife he was seriously in love with you? he was genuine, he even took me to their home but before I was sure that I was pregnant, remember I was still naive, I could not tell, I had a strange dream It's a dream that I will never forget because it was not a good experience I woke up at around 3 am and I felt like I just had sex with someone  but I did not tell anyone about it i though it was a joke but the following night Please make me understand how did it happen? Was this man on top of you or inside you? We had sex, I was already introduced to it with my boyfriend so I knew how it's done So this spirit literally appeared in my dreams to sleep with me In the morning I had a feeling that something happened the previous night I had a heavy heart, I was just feeling weird that was the 2nd stage the first time it happened I was still young I did not really understand my self  At that time the spirits used to take me to a river I would see myself deep inside the waters but I cannot remember exactly what they used to do to me It used to happen every night and the strange thing is I never used to tell anyone about it it happened each night until I got used to it my pregnancy was still growing and still no one knew about it what about your boyfriend? I never told him, I felt like it was wrong to tell him such a thing but he disappeared when I was now at 2 months You guys had already gone home right? he had already taken me for introduction and he said he loved you? Sure we had already planned to visit my parents in April then 2 months later he disappeared? yes, that is while I was 2 months pregnant for him Were you in the same College? not really, he was doing his business he was wealthy So I begun praying so hard, engaging in prayer every other time but the demon would still appear to me every night My prayer was for that man to come back to me so that my child could have a father I was so cared of telling my dad about it with time I left Butere to come to Nairobi to my father I would never sit upright in the presence of my dad because I was hiding this pregnancy but it's like he was suspicious there is only one lady who betrayed me because she noticed I had a craving for paw paws and she was sure I was pregnant and she told my dad it was normal for a pregnant woman to have cravings My dad was so furious and when my mum came there's nothing he did not tell her but I heard the voice of God, he spoke to me in Kamba and said, Be Still I will handle this how did you tell it's God? It was a unique voice, He said 'Be still I will handle this and it's true He did it because after I heard that voice I felt a sigh of relief even though dad was so furious and he was even blaming mum because of me I decided to go to the village I did not even want to go to the clinic because I was scared I that I will be told I am HIV+ I just had a heavy heart but I made a decision and prayed I told God to forgive me because I was still naive when I indulged I turned negative after I visited the clinic I delivered a child at home, my sister can testify, I never experienced labour pains before that, were you still having sex with this demon? Yes, it was so serious, it would come in form of animals, a mentally ill person and I never disclosed this to anyone because I had the spirit of fear after I gave birth the demon became aggressive it used to appear to me while I am seated down It would appear at exactly 6 pm You would masturbate? I was not there yet Every 6 pm in the evening it would sort of caress me, to keep me in the mood, I felt like I just wanted to leave the baby and go to bed I tried praying but it did not leave me Later on I happened to get a job in Nairobi and the spirit just disappeared I begun engaging in business at that time, I have God's favor in business, I got employed by an Asian he offered me a job and a day later he made me a manager How? You are employed today and a day later you are the manager? Yes, I had just arrived from the village Did you come with the baby? No I left the baby while he was at 13 months There were so many employees in that company but on my second day I had the powers to fire and hire The favor of God was upon me, we used to get so many customers from as far as Eldoret that shop made money, I would even sell a flask for KSh 1000 yet it's actual price is KSh 200 The favour of the Lord was upon me I later joined the matatu industry the demon wasn't so aggressive at that time but I started loitering in clubs Remember I was still prayerful, my mum and dad knew I was fully saved My spiritual dad at the village had no doubt I was saved Yes it's true I was saved by my character painted a different picture I had a lot of money while working in the matatu industry I was not such a heavy drinker instead I would take men to the clubs and spoil them with alcohol You were their sponsor? I would sponsor them that went on for a while and every time I did that I would become sort of anxious, I did not even want to pray I then met another man He was a Luo, we fell n love We loved each other so much I had the money, I even paid rent for him You had the money and so you were still the sponsor? Yes, I was like his sponsor I think he loved me because of the money Whenever he called me ma'am I was already sending him money Initially I was living with my friend but I could not manage it now that I was either in Nairobi or Kisumu but the lady could not manage to pay rent on her own and at that time I was in Kisumu that is the time the spirit of masturbation visited me, while I was in Kisumu this is now the 3rd stage, the first one appeared while I was young, the 2nd one is when I could not just understand myself the 3rd phase is now when I begun masturbating My boyfriend and I had agreed that we would be meeting every Friday because he was also working The spirit would the attack me with a very strong urge and tell me a week was too long to wait but my boyfriend never knew about it So you would masturbate the entire week and then get to meet him over the weekend? Yes, the spirit wanted me to be with my boyfriend but at the same time get to satisfy it but to me it was just something normal when you have such a spirit in you, you will think it's normal and I never cheated on either, my spiritual husband and my boyfriend It reached a point that the spirit became too aggressive, I would make love to my boyfriend at night but the moment he leaves for work I do it Like you would sleep with your boyfriend at night in the morning you masturbate Immediately he leaves, and maybe at that time before I prepare to travel to Nairobi I would do it I started feeling uncomfortable because it was now getting out of control I never had peace, I would arrive in Nairobi and still feel a strong urge to have him again I would stay in Nairobi for 2 days and go back to him in Kisumu Immediately I arrive in Kisumu the urge is gone I was always travelling, in fact all the conductors who worked for Green Line Shuttle knew me I would arrive in his house and collect anything I had bought for him in that house then travel with it back to Nairobi the moment I arrive he would call me and sooth me over the phone, the following day I was on my way back to him I was always travelling how many times were you masturbating in a day? Just once in a day or once a week the spirit was always playing with my mind I got tired and I started praying I would always talk to God and apologize to him In the process I felt that I just did not want to be with this man anymore Little did I know that evil spirit was at work I just dumped the man, although I later learnt he actually had a wife I sunk deeper in prayer, I even travelled to Katoloni trying to seek God's mercy But I still did not know I was being controlled by this spiritual husband You were always confused? So confused, deep in prayers but I had no idea what I was even praying for At some point I would pray God asking for a husband but I was totally confused even the prayers did not seem to change anything When I left Katoloni, My sister owns a nail parlor, she asked me to help her because the lady she was working with had left I asked here where exactly I was going to stay She told me to go live with her She is my younger sister but she is married I was a little bit hesitant but something told me to just go I still had the spirit of masturbation in me It had disappeared for a while but then it reappeared Nice guys would approach me but I was just not interested we would talk nicely and even agree but later on.. I was always lucky, I would meet guys who had already made it in life, like already driving, owning a house We would meet up, go hang out somewhere and you know I have always been this independent sort of women Immediately I get back to the house, the spirit will appear and tell me not to give that guy a chance but instead I should just masturbate I would try distracting myself by reading the bible, at that time I am in my sisters house and I would stick to reading the bible but I would get carried away and end up doing it You are masturbating in your sisters house? Imagine We used to have a house girl, she was our cousin, I used to sleep with her in room and in fact we prayed together I would then get to the room and wake her up asking her to pray and at that time I am completely worn out, the spirit has tortured me I started praying asking God to give me money because I just wanted to rent my own house and God was faithful I moved into a bedsitter because I could not afford a one bedroom I had now given this spirit a chance to take over me completely You have now welcomed it... Literally, full time it was always there It was like a normal routine I remember one day I had just arrived form work, I was running my own business I was literally in a hurry, I could not wait to get home A voice was just asking me to hurry home, when you have such thoughts you cannot think otherwise First thing was to undress in a hurry, ever felt an obsession?  after you are done, you now get back to your normal senses and feel the shame, the guilt After living in that house for sometime, I felt it has become too small and I now needed a 1 bedroom I wanted to go back to the same house I used to live in before I called Joshua a friend of mine and told him I was looking for a house and he told me to go I am now moving into the 4th stage, the spirit is manifesting Now it was like a human being 3 days after I had moved into my new house, it had a unique design It has a something like a corridor in the house, then a bathroom As I was in my bedroom I felt like there was someone standing at the corridor I was just about to go to bed, but I felt some movements like someone walking towards my bed and it was not woman I just ignored and went to sleep and you have never told anyone about it? not at all, who would you even tell you are masturbating and at that time I was even preaching the gospel to who? people I used to get invited in so many churches to preach You preach during the day and at night you will be masturbating? Yes, there's a church in Thika and it had approximately 50-60 congregants I prophesied and their number increased to close to 150 I told the pastor he needed more people in that church, as we speak the church has about 200 people I would preach and I would witness people getting blessed but the same night, the spirit comes back It would mock me on how I was preaching and telling people nothing and yet I was it's property I would feel so guilty, I used to even fast but in the midst I would just break and do it the following day I told one of my neighbors I have a feeling that someone is in my house but she did not take it seriously at that time I suddenly stopped masturbating, I was now running after men I can't even count the number of men I have tortured just by my body how were you torturing them? a guy would call me and in the process we fall in love The guy would ask me to visit and given that I close business late and maybe he is working it only means I will have to go for a sleep over the spirit would tell me to go I would put on a sexy night dress, sleep next to him and deny him sex I have watched men masturbate in front of me, they could not just hold the urge I am there with them but I cannot just help it, the evil spirit has taken control I used to feel like I would rather die other than giving my self to that man, the spirit has told me no way you cannot and you feel nice by torturing them? Something would just tell me to give in and make this man happy but the evil spirit would say no, he has to sort himself out I have gone for sleep overs, I have seen many of them masturbate right in front of me and you used to dress nicely? seductively I guessed just maybe these guys were being initiated into the spirit of masturbation such that when he does it today and feel just how good it is, he won't be able to stop It's not easy to stop masturbation I entered the house and decided now I want to worship just before I discovered 4 evil spirits were actually living in me and I was alone in that house and I was still living in sin you know I came to learn spirits dwell in fornication that is where they feed from It would push me into doing it when it's hungry, after I have done it, now it gets the energy and I told God it will never happen again get saved and I would truly get saved I met a pastor who once told me to get connected to him through offertory I asked God to help me overcome the spirits because I wanted to get married I used to tell him there was no way I would get a husband when the spirits were in me No amount of money would benefit me if this spirit was still living in me So you had decided you want now to fight the demons I was no fighting the demons, I wanted a husband God give me a husband it says I got a point I told the demon I am now married to God I was tired with the evil spirits, the situation was so bad, the demon would even turn me at night when I am sleep You cannot deny your spiritual husband sex but you said enough is enough the day I moved into my new house, the spirit welcomed me, I had this strange feeling while I was entering the house and you know it was so obvious I was going to do as it pleases because there was no man in that house I was so scared, I was alone in the house, I could not call anyone at that tie because it was around 1 am that is the day I confirmed they are 4 I told Jesus we had already spoken, you have forgiven me Just come and fight for me I told God we have already had a conversation and you were feeling Gods love at that time and so for that duration God was now leading me I started breaking the covenants between me and the father to my son I broke my covenants with the Luo guy and in my life I have never dated any other man apart from that guy alone if you ask him about me, he knows me in and out I have never dated again I would meet a guy and our affair would not last for more that 1 month Like I would just lose interest in them, but for him we dated for some time I started breaking all the covenants I would say for example if I was dating Cliff I prayed until God showed me all the covenants were broken Still in that state I saw someone squeeze a swelling that was on my private part until pus and blood came out I told God II want to see blood to believe indeed it was broken I told him I want to see all those things that were deposited in me come out I felt a sigh of relief How was the feeling on your first day when you did not masturbate or even have bad thoughts? I felt good, I was not having any urge to have sex or masturbate It was a feeling I can't explain Initially If I happen to go with someone to town, they would feel pissed off I was like a celebrity, everyone would be saying hi and most of them are the matatu conductors Today they would say hello to me with a lot of respect It only show slowly but gradually things are now beginning to change Initially I could not get a man who wants a serious relationship that can lead to marriage most of them were just after sex and we part ways or the genuine one would date me for a while then suddenly change their mind Since I received deliverance and decided to give my life to Jesus Everything has completely changed I meet someone and with a lot of respect they would talk to me in a nice way and mature manner, which is something I had never experienced before I feel total deliverance Initially I would not even sit and talk to someone like I am talking to you now I used to have the spirit of fear I was always feeling scared even if I went to a man's house I would just feel anxious and worried and you are even free to open up? I have told so many people about it, I have even posted it on my statuses and you are not feeling guilty God is on my side, I was in a bondage before, I feel like my debt has been paid I am so relieved I feel like I can even insult the creditor I was in some cage, I was in a captivity, I could not leave or do anything, I was just there after God delivered me I can approach anyone I can go anywhere and anything I ask for from anyone I receive but the spirit of fear used to discourage me I could not even approach someone who owed my money I did not have the courage I was always afraid of how they would think if I asked for my money but today Tell me about those ladies who would come to your place I have met close to 10 girls since I posted about my story I would visit some in their homes because after giving my life to Christ I begun evangelism as well as to help the widows because deliverance comes when you do good Like yes you are saved but what about you actions, your dressing I had to change my dressing, How I talk to people I used to have that I don't care attitude but God has given me control like a woman I am now a complete woman I have been offering guidance and counselling for people in marriages and even earn money from it there is a family I counselled and they gave me KSh 20,000 but you don't have a husband I don't, but I just want people to live happy I would visit someone for evangelism purposes and they would start to confess and that normally happens when I give them my testimony, I would tell them if God delivered me He will do the same for them someone would tell you they have been sleeping with a snake, an animal people out here have passed through the worst, my experience was even better a person will tell you they slept with s snake, another a bad animal and another would even sleep with a cow a donkey I have listened to their testimonies and I am like my own was even better It's not easy for someone to narrate about their past experiences, why is it important for a delivered person to talk about such? if you are not delivered those spirits will never allow you to confess they can never allow you to say anything before I came here I told the devil I am going to expose you I was mocking him This spirit has tortured me, so it's my turn to expose him You would tell someone they have a spiritual husband and they will swear they don't have any but clearly what she has shows she is having a spiritual husband if you are not delivered you can never confess these things even to your own mum I have 2 prayer partners my own sister and a friend called Doris but I have never told them about my addiction in masturbation the evil spirit never allows you to confess he knows I have been prayed for there is a time he took me though deliverance It's not like I am trying to belittle the pastors but what I can say is there is no pastor who can deliver you I love my pastor because he gives you hope there are pastors when you tell you them you have a spirit husband they will even just kill your spirit even more Deliverance is between you and God because you know what you have been going through You can't confess you are addicted to masturbation Never say you don't have a spirit husband these spirits do exist A person who can explain to you better on how they operate is someone who has gone though the same like me some people will ask for money in order to help you cast the spirits out, but those spirits never go away You are the only person who can deliver yourself because your pastor cannot make decisions for you to stop masturbating It's you to stand firm and say you will not do it and refuse completely to listen to the lies those spirits give you What message do you have for Kenyans and how can they reach you? Stop feeding this spirit, it feeds on sex, lies, envy, gossip and indecent dressing when you dress up in a very tiny outfit it's like you are feeding it with fries and chicken I hope mine is not too short Some ladies would expose the whole cleavage when a man sees it they start lusting over you these spirits even torture the pastors I know of very senior pastors who have begged me for sex they just want to satisfy that desire, yet they are married men, some even do masturbate others cheat even on the alter this spirit can attack anyone, doesn't matter you are a pastor, a virgin, educated or not don't feed it and make a decision the same way I made a decision, make a decision to stop it how can people reach you? through calling, I am on Facebook Vennie Katoti I am on watsapp and my number is 0792208706 You can also call me on 0723234795 You can also reach me through Messenger so that I can give you guidance on the stages I went through to overcome because these things have stages there are people who are in the first stage others second stage what I can say is even if he has already build a mansion, we can still bring it down even if he died with your destiny, we can still snatch it from him by the way I have someone and I am getting married soon Amen things are working out now sometimes I would ask God is this a dream or what but He says it's a reality I have never experienced real love, but now I have people, I have someone We share the word of God, I feel good because I have been delivered, any slight sin will invite the demons back they will finish me So I have to stay stand firm, pray and keep holy all through just keeping holy and pleasing God I hope you got the message even if he is in Mombasa, he will not board that plane you heard what you have been told, we have okay? these things happen to come share her story you get to listen to this testimony through the email below
