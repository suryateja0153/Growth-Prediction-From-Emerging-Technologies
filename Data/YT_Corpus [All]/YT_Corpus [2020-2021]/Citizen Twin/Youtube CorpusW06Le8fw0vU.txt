finals and and and writing final projects so it thins out at the end so I thank you all for showing up those those of you that are still here I also want to compliment their I didn't get through all of the papers seriously but I did my best to read them quickly last night today that were submitted for today and just like the ones when trade finance they're really good they're I mean and and if there was anything that was kind of the learning objective of this this don't get too happy James what sad yeah I read it your Senate in Senate in its to show critical reasoning skills what is this new technology what is blockchain technology makes sense and just like in trade finance in Identity Management there's there's a data that really matters and we'll talk about this a bit but the data really does matter our identity and so forth but I wanted to turn back to trade finance just for a minute because James had challenged the whole group about supply chain management and Lauren was a little quiet but I she knows I'm gonna call on her so this isn't a cold call but Lauren you want to give your view on this a little bit Lauren who worked in supply chain management for four or five years I worked in supply chain sustainability and there's been a huge push and you know kind of the DeBeers thing touched on this there's been a huge push over the past like five to ten years to just increase like traceability pairen see-through supply chains to make sure like Conflict Minerals were to make sure that things aren't you know using a lot of water and water stress areas and things we've spent like a huge push for transparency through the supply chain and trying to figure out like how companies can basically like audit and assess their suppliers and like take it layers back and so one big thing now is like it's all done through I mean most companies doing through like assessment so it's annually like companies assess their suppliers and hope that they submit all this accurate information and hope that their suppliers are doing the same things like throughout the supply chain but there's like very little transparency into it there's it's like very hard to verify and there's like really like asymmetrical information on all sides so watching would be I think for sustainability purposes because right now you're just like hoping that companies are allocating the proper time and resources to like go through and track their like raw materials and supply everything but there's no real like verifiable or transparent way for it to be done and so like right now a lot of people are basically like a lot of customers are hoping that their suppliers you know they're taking them at face value when they say things like we don't use child labor or we don't you know source from these certain material or regions but there's like really no way to verify it so a big thing like I think a big opportunity for blockchain and supply chain is helping increase that traceability so that you know you're not coming from places where child labor is okay you know ideally you're coming to places with like good safety standards and things like that are you still on the rock-bottom minimalist side of supply chain blockchain about this class and even the eight or ten papers I read about identity management identity and access management systems and blockchain technology ranged I don't think I read any that were at a zero there were no absolute minimalist but there were some of your papers that veered towards that and [Music] aleem who's gonna talk to us probably sometime during today I'd say your paper veered towards the most maximalist side I had seen you yet and in in 23 classes with respect to a certain definition alright so we're going to hear from alene maybe in 20 minutes or something but mind you that's the surprise of the classes he's he's moved to the maximal aside at least on one application for blockchain technology which is also I think the right place to be is is that this is a technology that might have use cases that work and others that are just hype there might even be some digital native tokens that will survive and a most and my thought won't but there might be some that makes sense probably more applications blockchain technology applications than tokens but will start going through identity so again we'll talk a little bit about identity before we get into it identity and access management systems but what is identity then the sort of management of them particularly in a digital age some state projects in India and Estonia and then some blockchain technology projects private sector in essence and then of course some of you might be graduating and we'll talk about MIT is MIT had to do that so and the study questions were what are the trade-offs what does it mean to be self sovereign identity and how might blockchain technology address that and we'll we'll see show hands later how many of you plan to get your MIT diploma on blockchain I hope by the way that all of you planned to get an MIT diploma but there are some of you that are from Harvard here and from other schools so maybe you'll come back to MIT and then there was a handful of readings which at least from the write-up seem like they so open license certificate at least it's a certificate right kuda yeah I mean philosophical question like who you are and all the things that prove your identity currently our government issued documents or like school issued documents that prove that somebody else already done a background check to make sure that you are you say you are so sometimes it can be a bit of code sometimes it can be a nationality sometime it can be your face it depends on the context what identity identity is going back to their philosophical me please what it finds you as a unique individual and differentiates you from anybody else right and use additional instruments he serves the purpose of identify us as an individual to certain context that's brought each mentioned that the identities inherent to a first night of an additional article I understand so how many people agree with here it's something unique that identifies I agree you're great I think it has to be something that you can borrow in order to be identity otherwise it's just you think you have to be able to verify what Eric was saying that it's unique it's something about our humanity and it's about who we are I think it's so like my identity is like with my name you know this date of birth and like with my I like my finger like this is who I am and I think what you were talking about it's more like how can the society Arab I like that you are the one who you claim to be so I think there's different ways that we're talking about this I think it's like not unique in the sense that it's not unique in the sense that like it's like characteristics as someone has but like maybe someone else will have the same characteristics but it's more yeah as Jay just said like basically like someone can verify that what you say it's true like if you have these characteristics and that's part of your identity but there's it's not like unique in the sense that it's just make sure Alexis or you're saying your identity is not unique or are you saying certain attributes near me but like it's just like aggregation of characteristics you're saying it's not just who you are but how society accepts you it in a commercial sense in an economic sense identity is used for so many things I do believe and maybe it is philosophical I do believe that we are each unique Souls and so that's a belief system maybe but in an economic sense we have various attributes so those attributes might be shared I know in fact yeah whoa so what is identity there's a dude up there that I share DNA with exact replicable genetic material but I for one think that I'm unique from him and I have a different identity and you can be guessing while you pull this down off campus who's who it's not a test what's that James let's see we're unique different identities same DNA who has an iPhone with face recognition so when Thanksgiving Rob hands me his iPhone he says what do you say and I look he says just look at it and I look at it I say I see a bunch of text messages why and he cursed and he said he said I handed you my locked phone so whatever you think about fire metrics and high phones it didn't work or it does work I don't know so I handed them back my iPhone was a little older and I said could you open it for me with your thumb bread and he couldn't so just for now we have a number of sets of identical twins and err my father's family and so forth so he tried it with two of our identical twin cousins two women and they too can open each other's phones no with their face recognition not with fingerprints but with face recognition so they're just there's a little side story about identity shows you these stuff photographs that you're potentially can be identified thank you so I keep getting your pictures for my few brothers too oh yeah face recognition today I'm gonna do a fraternal that I don't know anything about Facebook there's actually a much simpler way to define identity philosophy aside you know there's these physical human beings and there's billions of them on the planet and one simple way to think about it is you want the hash each person's this is good but that's actually what you want to do you want a hash each person and get a number and the property of that is that if you come to me and I hash you I get some number and if you come again I get the same number so I know I'm dealing with the same person I mean that's actually one way even if you put on weight I hide in hash because I can use your idealistic right then your twin brother cuz you know what you won't have to say - I'm actually not sure but I don't think you right so now I have to I get the same number I know why I'm dealing with them this solves a lot of the problems in the business world do I see getting a credit card on a bank stuff like that and and it also solves the problem that I own in customers well argue is 0-1 Asha's is your hash of hash that I've seen in the past right so so that's a very simple way to think of identity and you puts philosophy I didn't you assume that there's some physicality of human beings so the question is like how do you implement this hash function so you're taking that you're not really putting philosophy to the side you're saying that maybe all well and good but you can also take a physical object a human apply a hash function a cryptographic means and get a unique identifier for that individual I can make have a counter feed of like five things that can essentially be the same thing and you will just have five different hashes for it right it'll still have to come from an on blockchain sauce for you to be able what's not thing it's human beings okay but like for you to be able to hash one person you can still reproduce five other entities with a different hash difficult you can't actually if I catch myself and I get a hash you will have a lot of difficulty producing another human being that way it's like finding the collision in the hash function you have you have raised a lot of difficulty producing it in a bin that has the same cache is mine because the hash function is collision resistant thing it's hard to come up to clone me a hundred percent for example my red enough even if I give you all the data behind my retina and you have it it's really hard to produce the retina in your own eye that you can scan into tend to be mean for example that's one way to think of passion somebody's just can't get enough and even though you know the full retina well it's no used to because you have to put it in your eye and go there and get scanned and it's like okay fine well our medical technology is not there yet if you want to take it like it's not even your physical representation right because you can change like what you are physically nowadays and so it's like it's what you know what you are and what you have or three things that you can put into this hash function well it should be it should be you're right it's not the whole of you like you have to do it very carefully so yeah the question is how do you cook the ref you had a person because like if you go by weight let's say just pass the hash function is your weight well that's bad because you get collisions so you have to very carefully metrics that behind the whole because it's not the hashing that's making this the biometrics because you have ya have to actually catch something right when you see when you come from the abstract constructive saying hash somebody you're actually seeing your hashing some biometric attributes that have to be unique actually they're really important when it comes to biometrics that's right that's right I know the question is like well biometrics get stolen how would you deal with that and have to be very careful that's still like an identifier identity right thank you guys are saying like you can you can replicate somebody's right now let's say perhaps that's right that's right or they gave somebody's finger tips but that doesn't mean that you're replicating their entire identity okay like so I like the idea of like passion somebody's identity hashing their person but I don't think it's just patching their I or just hashing their that's right but I think you're getting from something I'm looking for the perspective of a bank to verify what does a bank actually need to do it just needs to map everybody to some number and when you come back it needs to figure out which number you are or if you're a new number that's like all you need and then you know problem solved and then by the way personal data attributes you just link those to those numbers it's not a difficult problem it's an orthogonal problem it's very you solved that intervention so let's create it what Elena's saying is he's not talking about our soul or our unique identity he's talking about something that a verifier a bank might be able to do and that you could say there's seven billion people on the planet now and there'll be 10 or 12 billion one day but you could take each one of them and somehow have a unique identifier a hash function that has each of those don't do it off of DNA though because Eric and I you know and hundreds of millions of others would so that's DNA is not a unique identifier for true identity so the concepts of identity for things that I think about sometimes some of the papers were about three but there's attributes a claim a credential and attestation what would be an attribute just any old attribute of any of them what's that your retina or it could be your age address citizenship name write a claim as my name is Gary her claim might be an I am so old or I am a US citizen or a claim might even be I have $5,000 in my bank account I mean sometimes there are other forms of claims or I do have a bank account at Bank of America I don't think I have 5,000 in it right now no all right a credential is what we started with that I think James mention it a driver's license an ID card a utility bill sometimes I mean there's hundreds of forms of credentials we think of the governmental credentials the history of credentials are interesting the first tens of thousands of years of humankind didn't have any and and and we started to have on passports really or anything even that old a an invention in a sixteenth century the King of England had some pass boarding but it so that his citizens could be recognized in other countries it was so that their rights would be respected and somebody would not be kind of messed with like I'm under that sovereign don't don't you know mess with me but in terms of a true permitting system it was largely implemented about a hundred years ago anywhere between 100 150 years ago it's not that old a system but it was old paperwork and I don't know if any of you have ever yes to see a grandparents or great-grandparents are an ancestors like passport or those documents if you have them but they're intensely paper in fact if they're from the late 19th century there's no photographs and he started out photographs in the early 20th century and so it's a big change in the last 30 or 40 years of digitization of this has actually made it a little harder in some ways I mean there's efficiencies but it makes it harder and then at Tec sation is a third party verifying it and that's what aleem was talking about how somebody can verify your identity they're basically I make a claim my name's get Gary I might give a credential my passport to show it the picture looks like may a human looks at it lines it up says all right you can come in you can enter the country of Germany or wherever I'm traveling they don't actually know that I'm really the but it'll they do some verification so those are the big kind of pieces identity and access management systems the functions and these are just taken from a bunch of readings authentication that and then authorization authenticating that I have the bank account authorization I can use it or authentication I'm a US citizen authorization I can come into the country of Germany here so based upon some attribute somebody authorizes me or something that maybe some of you have dealt with it's some stage of your life that first time you went in and handed a driver's license in so you could take a drink at a bar make it tangible you know that's like authenticating do you look like that person and then who are the parties in this system users service providers identity providers anybody want to tell me about this ecosystem at all alphy you didn't write you wrote last time no identity in a more full software is who you are but yes the identity provider can be somebody like the state of the state of New York or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts birth certificates death certificates marriage certificates attribute authorities like certificate authorities are kind of a more recent invention I don't know that they existed 100 or 200 years ago but but an attribute Authority says these attributes we will validate them they're central authorities that say yes this is this is correct and certificate authorities are particularly an invention of what 40 years maybe the internet 30 years in 1976 1976 thesis at MIT does anybody want to say what a certificate authority is because they're in the middle of all of that by the way every time that you go to the Internet today a certificate authority is involved in that transaction probably a hundred billion times a day around the globe it's probably the order of magnitude probably a hundred billion times a day a certificate authority is used a lien you want a certificate authorities or how we access the internet all day long for what they are on the web yeah right so on the web you have a bunch of websites let's see you have facebook.com and you want to visit it and give it your password so if you have evil people like me I might set up a fake server and pretend to be facebook.com mess with the DNS records get you to visit my server this is my server but you can't tell DNS domain name sir yeah so anyway yeah is that when you actually do a look up from facebook.com from IP address that's actually very insecure and attackers can mess with that been redirected to their servers so and they might completely replicate the Facebook base so you might think you're interacting with Facebook or you're not doing directly with an attack of website and you type in your passing of your username and then the attacker steals it and then he just redirects into the real Facebook and you will notice the attack at all does that make sense like that and all happens in nanoseconds right so and it's it's called a man-in-the-middle attack so so what what you do is you use public key cryptography to solve that problem you say okay let's give each website a key pair so facebook tom will have a keeper secret key and a public key so now the question is well there's a public key for facebook.com but how do you know you have the right public key for facebook.com this an attacker could also give you their public key for their fake facebook.com so now how do you distinguish between those two that's where the certificate authority comes in so the certificate authority signs these public keys and you have the public key of the certificate authority you have a signature from the certificate authority on the public via Facebook com you're now ready to trust that you're dealing with the real facebook.com and you can encrypt your password to facebook.com using your public key there's a lot of public keys around I know we earlier learned about public key and private keys as part of blockchain technology but know that when Satoshi Nakamoto wrote that paper she was just using asymmetric cryptography public private key cryptography that had been invented really in the 1970s and then but it adopted as the internet came along and took off and had a lot of use in the 1990s to secure the Internet by 1996 in the way that the Internet secured on TSL and SSL in these various ways it's secured was public key private key cryptography a full twelve years before knock them out a wrote the paper but used for a different case but Facebook has a public key and all those public keys of all the websites that you visit every day there is a central authority called a certificate authority there's actually a hundred-plus certificate authorities but but certificate authorities that say this is the Facebook public key so that when you go to your Facebook or you go to Google or you go to a shop on Amazon you know you're actually so that's a corporate or that's another form of identity it's not one with soul I would suggest not that's not a negative thing about Facebook I just don't think websites but you all might have a different philosophy I didn't think websites have saw British I'll try to do it in lay terms and then you'll hit it there's kind of a handoff that when you send that signal when you're you're trying to access is it Facebook you're accessing Facebook that they send you some information including their public key that your in essence a certificate authority is automatically checking but a lien will give you the more technical about some important is gonna be remember the New York Times will have a public key they don't have a corresponding secret so you visit their website it turns out that when you download the website from the New York Times with that announcement about the snowstorm that's actually signed with their secret key so you verify the website that then you get you verify it against the Republican and you know that only they know the secret key so only they could have to offer that information inside it's nearly the New York Times sends you a signature over every piece of information you send you and you verified against the public key which in turn you verified it from safety to go to three if you remember there's a little bit of broccoli we did earlier this year that asymmetric cryptography with a public key and a private key also has digital signatures so you have now two things let's go back to Bitcoin in Bitcoin transactions you have a public key and then somebody signs a transaction and the the math behind it the cryptography behind it is a signature and a public key that come from the same private key there's a way to do a function to check that they came from the same private key and and the heart and soul of what was invented in the 1970s was not just that there's a public key and a private key but also that you can digitally sign it and then when the digital signature is compared to the public key its unique if they came from the same private key so going back to the New York Times The New York Times you have both their public key and then each headline each piece of information has a digital signature and and of course you do have a centralization a lot of centralization on the Internet related to these certificate authorities it's not the user witnessing any of this interaction security works with HTTP which is web and this is done this is where you find that this little log in the browser that's guaranteeing that that's the website because the holy exchange of information includes the public key from the website and the verification is not by the browser has that meaning and you could actually see what certificate authority I only pause on that to pause not only to tie back earlier conversations about public key and private key but the whole Internet is reliant on these certificate authorities and blockchain technology might be a way to step around and have a new paradigm what how how does the person interact with these various parties it's trying to verify there's an initial layer which we were just talking about that you're actually dealing with your I don't know make it up de sure no it's that's a hedge fund but with Bank of America fine that you're really dealing so that's what we were talking about that you they are Bank of America and you're really dealing with Bank of America and you don't even participate that but then there's another layer that if you've forgotten your password they're gonna ask you a bunch of of questions like you know the usual questions about who was your first pet and who was your first significant other and things like that but it's some point done they'll freeze you out of America has their anti-fraud provisions what we were just talking about is really at the inner internet browser and in essence Facebook is the one that's trying to be identified that you know you're a hundred billion times a day some human around the globe is trying to be protected that they know they're dealing with the right identity on the other side we were talking about human identity there's also the identity of the web sites and that's what we were just chatting about let me move on and then I divided left D confused because you were asking about what happens if you forgot your password you I would contend it's still kind of a little archaic I mean it's it's a little bit like if you if you forgot your pay a couple of times you use a username and password and of course if you have dual authentication they might send you a notice to another you know a text message or something but if you've forgotten your password then it's literally backdoor sort of saying well do you remember your question I never remember the questions you know who was your first friend in elementary school who was your first what was the first car you drove in but it's it's crude it's those there's and then they usually freeze you out for fraud protection after two or three times of of trying that and almost always there's something where they can send it to you another place Identity Management some of the pain points what what are we trying to solve and why would blockchain technology maybe help us help us out privacy and security is a big one there are a lot of lot of thefts identity theft how many people work in in the room have had their credit card this year in 2018 we're 11 months in have had their credit card have to be replaced cuz the bank got in touch and said it's compromised no only about 20% of us I would have thought it was gonna be more I feel like my I get one of those calls every 18 to 24 months I don't know maybe I shop too much or my daughters are using my cord too much do you think that's it I just assumed that some merchant has has been hacked again I mean every time a merchant loses a million or a hundred thousand or 50 million accounts then the banking system needs to send out those notices I'd share a commission or a financial Consumer Protection Commission in Maryland and the credit union advocates in Maryland came to our Commission and said we need some help we banks and credit unions have to protect a lot of data but every time a merchant loses data it's us credit unions and banks that have to replace all the credit cards and they feel there's an asymmetry commercial asymmetry that the banking sector is bearing the brunt of other merchants non-financial sectors data breaches and should the state of Maryland this is a live issue actually in front of our Commission should the state of Maryland change its laws to put higher cybersecurity responsibilities or non-financial sector actors and the financial sector would say yeah that kind of feels you'd be leveling the playing field and the merchants are saying you can't do that on every grocery store and bar that seems like it's a little out of sync credit card number through these folks your credit card should have a keeper secret you know publican you give your public key how do you pay out all you sign with your secret key that's on their credit card so nobody knows their secret keys on your damn card never lose that card and problem solved we can you know as many public use as they want problem solved same thing with the SSN why would you disclose to you became a maximalist almost let me just it so that the in terms of the big pain points privacy and security a bunch of identity theft forged credentials back to the passport or the driver's license or the credit card a forged credential whenever that yes and of course just how do we update our personal identity for any time we move and this term PII is three letters you'll learn in business because at some point in time you'll be running a business and somebody will be coming in your chief of information officer and say we've had a breach and unfortunately we broke some laws too because in in the US and in other countries GDP or you have to protect certain data and it's usually called PII is usually the bucket of data you need to protect but every time you update your personal information your how do you how do you keep it updated Ross was there question I just had a question back on your Maryland I make the assumption maybe it's wrong that if your commission allows the banks to passes that regulation well we're just an advisory but if we recommend to the General Assembly that the banks are not going to lower their feet the merchants so how what's the dollar number that they're trying to push towards I'm trying to size the paper what's what's the amount of cost of those banks that they're trying to move to the merchants and thus drop to the banks bottom line I don't I don't have a figure it's a very good question what what what we know is that the overall statistics on fraud and credit card is I think high-teens basis points I can't remember 15 or 18 basis points but less than 20 and it might its own or than 10 so visa Network charges what 270 basis points or so and and the fraud and the fraud part of its 15 or 18 basis and yes we bank it's how much of the 275 I don't know and this is particularly credit credit unions are coming to us and saying they're saying there's an externality the merchants the gas stations all right so you're you're saying I know which way you would vote on our commission right so what's going on a little bit about data breaches I just tried to sort of list anything over a hundred million customers but then I had to put a face book in because it was 50 million but these are just like a dozen or so really big data breaches there are so many data breaches in 2018 alone that you couldn't list them on a page like this this is the last five years of hundred million or more data breaches so there's there's there's a problem here inside were secure and that's just the u.s. furnish didn't the Indian system Lake malloon 1.1 million people's IDs were hacked it was announced in January of this year and so yes it's a lot it's a lot going on in every once in a while politically it captures the attention of particularly Equifax did Facebook does Wells Fargo I think the breach was three million it's not even oneness it wouldn't it wouldn't get to the 50th page by size but at Wells Fargo had other issues that was capturing capturing the public attention is a lot but it's one of the I think one of the challenges of blockchain technology solutions is adoption how do you get Marriott to contribute to a new system if you come up with a really clever creative new system because there's so many thousands of merchants that are trying to deal with their cyber security risk and marriott all of a sudden has all these costs but how you get them involved in your new blockchain technology solution i think it's just an adoption issue which somebody might solve i just it's not where as Ross says we'll wait a minute if the banks were done just X right they wanted I spent the credit but the merchants have no bargaining power that's true so a couple of state identity projects Estonia has a identity they started in 2002 well before blockchain technology and it's run on a software called X Road software and while some folks might think of Estonia as a blockchain friendly nation does anybody want to take a guess whether this software is blockchain technology what's what's the consensus no it's not that doesn't mean it doesn't work but they've sort of wrapped themselves in the sort of spirit of where blockchain nation and they also have health records and many other records they're going online and it may be at some level inspired by that they have 1.3 million people in Estonia I think it bigger the state actor and the challenge sorry British is at har so there's a national identification system and it was promoted really for inclusion Financial Inclusion and a way to get government assistance and and welfare to hundreds of millions of poor India at the time that it was rolled out well over half of India was not that did not have a banking account at all 12 digit ID and biometrics being fingerprint and iris scan I think they would deal with the identical twin issue I think for my little example that my twin brothers Rob's finger didn't open my iPhone but there's been a lot of problems and either that's not a blockchain project either but it has I my read of it is at hair and maybe British has some views has done some very positive things in India but it's also come with some very scary things it's a quick nugget of information about other it was the fastest system in the world to reach 1 billion users faster than Facebook or any other online platform and optional it was not a mandatory system for people to get it optional system but it was the fastest one to reach 1 million but it's optional but you can't get your government assistance any longer if you're not in it right it's not like that so actually there has been some government efforts to make it that way but then the court actually rejected those proposals so they said that you cannot make it mandatory to you know make people receive benefits based on this so we were happy that they might have some ease of obtaining those benefits but it's not like without it you cannot parish is saying it accurately but the court only ruled that this year during 2018 I think and for a while a lot of hundreds of millions people thought that's the only way I can get my assistance but the 12-digit ID and the biometrics has produced a system where along with a payment system where you can do a QR code right on your iPhone and get goods and services and it's pretty efficient but it's one national system one national system and there's been a lot of challenges not just the hack but also some mistakes sometimes and based on those mistakes people feel like they've lost their identity I mean there's still this human that they are but they've lost it in a governmental sense and thus they've stopped getting their assistance and there's occasionally reports of suicides and reports of deaths and things like that where people are no longer recognized in the system because they're at Harr ID so there's a lot of public debate in India and and and about the net benefit versus some of the costs self sovereign identity for things I think about people and identities control and entities people and entities control their identities more than we have now this is a concept these we have direct access without some intermediary but our identity is transportable but not our human identity but the attributes of our identity so I use the term more loosely here and then it's widely usable or interoperable self sovereign identity what's that yeah I remembered that back and forth self sovereign identity does not rely on blockchain technology it's a concept in a debate about should should we go back to something that we and a sense have in the 19th century and even early 20th century that we we could walk into any store and there might there might be other forms of censorship there have certainly many prejudices and racism and all sort of challenges but we could walk in without a document you know we weren't walking in it wasn't we might have some gold some money in our pocket they would take the gold coin or the silver coin self sovereign identity is also thinking about can we sort of have the individual hold their credentials as we held a physical passport but hold it in a in a wallet in some way Ross doesn't this only work if you also have a decentralized analysis but go to your example the only reason that works is because people could go in and pay with a completely anonymous form of money if if unless you have a real broad say Bitcoin distributed system your bank will require you to waive this when you sign up for a bank account you will have to wait and it's gone they just will decisions so Ross is raising well will this even work unless you have a truly decentralized money system I don't think it's reliant on a decentralized money system I can see your point that it's benefited by dissembling uses any commercial transaction you have the counterparties you know Facebook will make you waive right because they want the information right and Google would that's right you cut yourself off from all those things but don't just make it as part of the contract part of the access did you wait sovereign entity concept that all of us humans could control our identity not just their birth and our nationality but maybe even our digital footprint our spending patterns and so forth and Ross is raising well maybe Facebook and Google wouldn't transact with us as a commercial reality you're saying their market power they might cut us out I think some might try and that will be this hasn't been really adopted self sovereign identity the benefits of of taking identity access management systems onto the blockchain technology you know and eight or ten of you wrote papers on this does anybody want to comment on this is like my summary some of the benefits you can address verification cost and fraud you potentially can lower some of the costs and fraud I think you can trace provenance you deal with censorship and so forth and and and truly I think you can help one privacy but the challenge is is the real challenge is is that if you're storing personal identifiable information on a blockchain blockchain technology works by distributing the data to all the nodes and so the initial write-ups three and four and five years ago was like well could you put self sovereign identity in essence in a blockchain and store it and everybody started to say no you really can't do that because you're not gonna put my all my personal stuff on ten thousand nodes I think prevent that because the main security goal of any identity scheme including the one I described is you want to prevent identity theft well to prevent the personation I just chose not to read read through this page I'm agreeing with you I mean these are the pain points that would all address yeah and in general I think when you think about identity that should be you should have you have to look at it through that lens because what else is identity for if it's not for preventing people to claim their someone else that's what an identity scheme does and if your scheme doesn't address that fundamental problem like by the way all of these startups don't because SSN numbers are still out there and required legally so as long as that's a social security number yeah say goodbye to to prevent the guy what are you doing then you know and like something that was not like very much addressed in the readings I thought it was like also that fact that if you used a blockchain technology so happen in the lame dog like it's immutable so something seen as a good thing right here in this case like normally like example in Europe normally in the internet you can request to delete information you have if like google has a link which mentions you for instance but like here you wouldn't be able to do it because the information is there like if someone like still they don't like even if you want to delete it that somehow you can't because it's immutable right so how can we deal with this so you're raising a plant and Europe under the new privacy law the GDP are you have a right to be forgotten or a right to be deleted and so how can blockchain technology interact and work within that framework if your actual information is on the blockchain I think you're right I think it's very hard but I do think there are solutions if it's just a hash of your information that's being stored on the blockchain I think you were mentioning the fact that like you can store all the data basically of the blockchain and then when you transfer it you just say like as a certification oh yeah this is my information and it is true you can verify it is true but you cannot have like the actual information on your identity it says your United States citizen and that changes cannot be changed and then what about those privacy for people that I think you raise a good question but it's any this is one of the challenges of any identity database but it's also a challenge of a money database called Bitcoin you have ownership today and tomorrow you might no longer have the coin today you might live in Massachusetts but a year from now and you get your fancy job and wherever you are you might not live in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts you so I don't think it's just citizenship it's just the updating the records and the attributes that you're no longer can vote here can no longer but I think I think that challenge is is surmountable purpose of like watching like yet you're citizens you may change but then you attend new information saying that your citizenship has been updated and that becomes the source of truth no I think that's correct I think that's a solvable challenge well your hue go at his hand over there very good why I just what happens if you lose your private year if somebody finds your private key or like somebody cuts your eye out no but but but really right what happened if somebody steals your identity then it's gone like you're not getting it back steals your pride your identities you're still sure steals your private key like if you don't protect that right I think you guys raising the right question but that just means that's not the right solution you can't pin it all on just one private key that's lost well maybe they'll make an exception hopefully like ten people ever show up let me try this plow in for a second of what are the projects and this isn't this is a short representation there's I could have made three more pages of representation I'm gonna hit three or four of these just for fun there's three or four that are icos I'm gonna choose to skip all of those but there are I want to mention that Civic secure identity existence ID sovereign which gets s o V Rin but sovereign that gets a lot of write-ups in other papers we're all icos initial coin offerings to use a token to an incentivize a system of self usually self sovereign identity in some point none are up and running yet and and and you know I've had my doubts about some initial coin offerings but they're three or four and they were probably six or ten others that I didn't quickly find bid nations an interesting project that literally you can voluntarily get a citizenship in bit nation it is a decentralized borderless voluntary nation but the key word is voluntary they don't have a UN membership they're not part of the World Trade Organization they have no geography but the concept is you can get a bit nation passport and you can get some authentication through that about some attributes about your birth and things like that there is a a standard setting group a distributed identity foundation that we're going to talk about in a minute now I'm going to show a slide which is just a whole bunch of efforts coming together and say well maybe we can do some standards around this and then there's rebooting web of trust that runs events I think they're only economic model is to make money on the events but some of their research and some of their papers are very interesting that you you can read about this and and not listed on this one area that's spending a lot of time on self sovereign identity is the world wide web I think it's consortium but ww3 see where you can go and on github you can read all sorts of information from WC w3c about self sovereign identity and they're promoting ways to do digital ID and and trying to form standards so I think w3c which is not really a blockchain project and this distributed identity foundation for any of you that are actually interested in pursuing some of us you want to stay abreast of it cuz it's the standard setting also that I think will be relevant but questions or thoughts for those who have done research on some of these other than Ally alright what's your question James has my SSN that James is me for all intents and purposes so that it's a policy issue so these companies are basically a very inefficient way to change the policy like hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in all of these guys and by the way all of them do public key crypto it's not like something revolutionary here but at some point some of them will get some market share maybe convince a few bags but maybe those banks will convince the government start you're saying an underlying challenge at least in this country is that we have an antiquated public policy related to a tax ID called Social Security no number you know initially Social Security numbers were not even a tax ID initially they were to participate in a retirement program called Social Security and you were not legally required to have a number in the 1930s or 40s when it first came about I didn't get my social security number until I was fourteen I think now you pretty much get them at birth in this country they can't use it for much you're not working but but you're you're saying it's a public policy a challenge at least here I would say in every country there's some public policy challenges that are very real around how attributes of identity are measured whether it's off of taxes or our birth records and so forth can I hold because I want to just hit two of things this foundation these are all the people in this foundation doing all of this work like it's just a list that you can look at later and they've set up and I apologize they set up sort of this whole idea about decentralized ID and server so they have a whole program it's not a small effort that they are investing in this and I only put it up to say there's a lot of energy a lien might be right it's all you know fraught with some risk because it's on the backs of government ID systems not just in the US public key infrastructure is currently could change and and a lot of these concepts are on decentralized public key infrastructure basically where are these public keys whether it's Facebook's public key or any public key where is it stored I suspect a lien that you'd say this is at least going a little a little better direction right this is a key part of just saying instead of the public key and having these certificate authorities to have a secure way to store the public keys and a decentralized hashed your using hash functions and blockchain technology and I think all of them have this in the middle of it somewhere we with Facebook's public key is otherwise we're in trouble because you might use my Facebook server so it's really just the consensus problem it's not about cashes security forget about that everybody has to agree what faceless public use and that's where the blockchain content all right sorry Sean basically that's not I don't think that's a Colin polity power the way if you want to change the SSN system we have to change the whole entire system of like how commands are going to cooperate and two constants the social cost is much greater it just to be kind of the key key itself I mean I think he's entirely talking about point of view of implementation there's a nature Act which says banks have to send us a sense that the government which basically means banks meeting I think using as a sense so in some sense you're right but but also government has to do so yeah so that's before I don't think it's just here in the US what's happened is is the attributes of our identity or a credential or identity whether it's for tax systems for banking systems in the last 30 odd years as we've digitized and also post 9/11 and terrorists we started to we started to use all of these things for anti-money laundering know your customer so the financial system the tax system and our identity systems have now all been you know kind of linked up and and not always with the best intent I mean maybe they were the good intentions but with not with the best results and it's part of why I thought if we were going to cover blockchain technology in the financial sector identification systems were really important as well because it's so linked up with banking and finance and that wouldn't have been the case before the digital revolution and the internet and so forth I think this is the last cover slide but this is self sovereign identity platforms basically right now if if we want to keep our identity if we want to keep our identity and only give it up a platform could create and enforce rules governing the workflow this is a little thing called bit but I get bits on blocks dotnet but pretty much most of the startups are using an architecture around this this happens to be bits on blocks view of it but it's basically I'm gonna keep my attributes of identity and I choose when I can give it up and when it's used authorities and issuers so I think I have hopefully oh yes MIT that's where I wanted to go so what did you all think you read you read the little article about your own you're gonna get in it James you're gonna get your blockchain tech blockchain for 4 I'll go in 2007 my university was declared independent from the University of London trying to get a copy of my transcript okay I have many different people say oh I get it and they say oh contact the old university because how many of you are gonna get a blockchain back diploma when you graduate MIT all right a quarter of you and those of the that aren't who didn't raise their hand what's that yeah well I didn't see any hands scope over here so you're not I don't care really what's that oh you did I when somebody who didn't raise their hand why aren't you gonna get is just like both information about the process how to get it what I don't know yet so you're just saying is there's an information curve you have to learn about it the people that raised their hand said you get it how many of you will also get a paper diploma you want something for the wall or or for the significant other for the children or the parents right right yeah there's still something about that I don't even know where my college diploma is by the way but you still want that piece of paper was there anybody who is only gonna get a blockchain diploma no and any of you that go to a different University do you wish your university at a blockchain diploma no no he's gonna speak up maybe not all right so it's a novelty it's MIT we're innovative we have it I hope you all do come next Tuesday will be our last time together I'm going to try to wrap up sort of with some ground truths as to what I think the whole topic and the subject is this was meant to be about the business of blockchain technology getting through at least enough of the details knowing those details and then saying well how does that apply to the markets with hopefully hopefully you feel that you've gotten and Tuesday will summarize it all some critical reasoning skills that you can sort through the hype and the reality and those of you that came in maximalist you're probably more in the middle some of you that were minimalist maybe came well maybe you're still but you came you know a little because I I thought that was the right place to teach and you've all given me a tremendous feedback and I've learned a lot from you all but let's keep it going see you on Tuesday you
