 [Music] hello and welcome to watches TV welcome on the first edition of primetime and a very happy New Year to all all our very best wishes and to start 2020 on a new note well we've slightly updated our China identity and we are extremely inspired and motivated to pursue our coverage of watchmaking with the goal of publishing at least two new video reports per week and to do so well the team has slightly gotten bigger here at our watches Club old town Geneva office and I therefore want to thank again so much our patrons who helped us make it possible and obviously anyone is very welcome to join the party on patreon especially that we shall shortly implement a very special bonus feature for those supporting us and I will come back on this in due time but to make all these contents possible well the team still has to grow a little bit and concretely we are looking for someone with the journalistic skills someone quite passionate about watchmaking but you don't have to be a total watch nerd this will come over time automatically and well someone with indispensable good writing skills but ultimately willing to go on camera too so someone that will fit the spirit of the team and could help us keep the momentum accelerating well and for those interested where you will find a form on our website linked below and though we've started to look for someone here in Geneva well you don't have to be based in Switzerland but in Europe for sure as you will naturally have to come to Geneva once in a while so I thought that it was the right thing to do and reach out directly to you guys because I mean who knows maybe there could be someone out there just perfect for this watchmaking mission anyhow I also wanted to simply thank all of you since you are now more than a hundred and twelve thousand subscribed to this channel makes us very proud thanks for the engagements thanks for the comments the shares the likes and so forth it's a real motivation for us and additional to this well we've travelled quite a lot in 2019 and you can't imagine how nice it has been to meet people all around the world who had very nicely come up to me and thanking our little team with what we do it makes us feel purposeful and this is sincerely very rewarding feeling so hope to meet even more people this year would be a great sign okay quick risk check that's my boo bacon Oh from 1949 such in such impeccable condition I mean I just love it really really do okay wrist check done and this is primetime watch making in the news and it will be quite a long one with not only the latest newsworthy stories regarding the watchmaking industry but we will also come back on some of the main highlights the most significant new watches tops and flops the main trends and business news of 2019 will it will be a fun little recap moment and what can we learn from it so let's start with some pretty fresh news and a pretty incomprehensible story in this rather complicated context for watch making and we don't yet have the definite official numbers but based on what we already know well the overall turnover of the Swiss watchmaking industry has apparently seen a small increase of export figures it's a very marginal but makes people feel good kind of a placebo effect but the overall production volumes have declined quite drastically I mean we're talking approximately 3.5 million fewer watches produced in a single year so that's a crock so that's approximately 15% less and this is hurting in particular the lower tier segment of watches produced here the luxury segment is still doing strong and increasing in fact but this is this has a really meaningful impact on the entire industry and we'll come back on this in another video well anyhow a few days before Christmas the Swiss Competition Commission kind of a antitrust Commission whether it justice sent out a really sweet present to the swatch group and suddenly and rather brutally told them that they could no longer deliver they deliver ETA movements to third-party brands I meaning the lights are brightly IWC short part agreeable mercy and so many other brands and this as of the 1st of January so we're talking roughly 500,000 movements for which these brands have to find an alternative so ultimately this commission came slightly back on this decision but just pushing it back for a few months so in the short term there are like I said no real alternative to the sourcing of such movements by others flyers and the big irony of this story goes back to some ten years ago when the SWAT group announced at the time that they would stop delivering movements a bush and other kind of components to third party brands and at the time it was the same commission which obliged the group to continue it delivering these brands so one doesn't really understand everything I mean the politics behind but it can still be summarized that kind of what goes around comes around for this world group but this again will naturally makes the life of some of these brands quite complicated we will follow up on this but in this rather shaky business environment and the timing of this decision may really sound I mean quite odd have to be honest okay next news and more brands from the Richmond Group are now offering eight years of guarantees on their Watchers Byron RI IWC and this is obviously a really good thing I mean it should simply be a standard and I just don't understand the ones which are still offering only two years I mean if you trust your products that you're selling well give the customer a clear sign that that's the case you know as simple as that okay next and let's talk about the crown 2019 was quite a crazy here for Rolex I mean benefiting from such hype just amazing and to cope with the situation what we heard about production capabilities increases but that's all very secret and difficult to verify but on the other hand one thing very public and announced just recently is that as of the first of January Rolex has increased the prices of its model by approximately eight percent and you know what well I doubt it will have a much effect on the desirability of those of its products and will just increase the smile on the retailer's faces and for those who bought the models in 2019 well for you I mean you just saved eight percent I mean obviously this price increase will also be good for Rolex as a balance sheet but did they really need it well okay talking about Rolex and desirability one has to quickly talk about the flipping of some of these hyped watches and one has to say that we've seen prices go a bit down and last couple of months and say insane can be said regard patek plus a few AP and fishimene mothers okay and still concerning rolex and this will most probably create some kind of precedent as they recently started to sue a company customizing some of their models and claiming that they are actually counterfeiters so interestingly enough rolex once went against an american LA based company called lac Californian and I say this because there are obviously so many similar companies around the world even a few here in Switzerland so I guess times might become a bit complicated for those doing these customization and it mustn't be comfortable feeling to have the hoard of the Rolex lawyers on your back but I'm really interested in seeing our the outcome of this lawsuit it will be a pretty explicit demonstration of the power of the crown anyhow I mean there is such a fine line in terms what can it can't be done but I personally think that the biggest issue is that most of these people start companies are really playing in a grey zone basically insinuating that you are purchasing Rolex and this is where the problem lies and will remain in California as the state recently banned as of the 1st of January the use of crocodile for watch straps actually goes a little bit beyond this but this is a trend which I believe we will see more and more in the coming years and we've already seen for instance alternatives like calf skin and even bracelets from vegetable origin embossed with crocodile and alligator patterns okay I'm still regarding the US and since I had talked about this a few months ago well I was really pretty excited to head to Miami for the February edition of watches and wonder a bit of Sun some nice cocktails some nice watches and nice people well you know kind of sounded perfect but this event has just disappeared from the agenda and bizarre thing about it is that there was no real communication regarding the cancellation of the events this was very quietly done and just proved once again the challenge of organizing what shows and on that matter well naturally 2020 will be a pretty decisive year for the future the two main venues of Bowser world and as I changed this last one now rebranded what does it wonder I know it can be a little bit confusing but anyhow both shows will now be running one after the other like in the good old days actually I mean to go or days was when there was only one show well anyhow sh h being first here in Geneva and of April followed by Basel event early May and when I say decisive well you have to remember that some big names continue to pull out I mean we knew about leisure meal out of a size H but they've done so in a in style let's say with this rather eccentric of bow bone collection or Audemars Piguet but obviously this was a bit less flamboyant with the questionable introduction of the code 11:59 and we've just heard that Gerber for say is also leaving the Geneva show but the hemorrhage II also concerned buzzer world as Seiko and Breitling are also out so yes this may sound all quite gloomy and anyhow for me well I mean the benchmark of his excel successful event was definitely set last year by the Dubai watch week I mean I wanted them what an amazing event that was I mean still had fantastic souvenirs of it okay let's now have a bit of fun and let's come back on some of the most memorable moments of 2019 in some kind of compilation of reports published during the year and we'll start with what I think were the more noticeable innovative timepieces of the year and actually bashful constant and definitely introduced a super interesting and pertinent timepiece with the traditional twin beat this is a timepiece which has to balance prints so two frequencies so we have the user can choose between two modes one mode that we have that we have named the active mode on which the watch is functioning to five Hertz so 36,000 rubbished spur hawa offering four days of power reserve and you just select the mode and standby and by doing so we are changing the the oscillator and we have a 1.2 Hertz or theater which has given us more than 65 days of power reserve without losing the indication of the perpetual calendar sincerely I was very happy that such a traditional brand as that firm could show us what they are capable in terms of innovation and on a very different level and this time talking about a pretty recent brand I like what Hasan's came up with but obviously this is very very different and for diehard mechanical purist well some might not appreciate it as much so in a concrete way means that your mechanical watch will set itself automatically to the time you decided it has to be in and you will never have to wind it anymore because the watch will stop if you don't wear it and as it is a mechanical watch with an automatic movement when you wear it you wind it and if if you take it off for more than 12 hours a crown because that's the name of the technology will stop the the mechanical movement and from the moment you put it back on the wrist you double tap the glass it will set to watch to the right time and it will start to run again okay another big technical introduction this here came from Tag Heuer but this didn't go too well hello and we have a girl here who are using for the very first time some super high-tech material for its hair spring something that has been applied for an industrial produced collection let's check it out maybe the most exciting part of the watch which you can see from the outside is what we call our ISO graph technology this is a new hair spring technology developed in-house and it's the biggest single change to traditional regulating organs since the 1600s and we make it in-house out of carbon it's a carbon composite of carbon nanotubes and amorphous carbon so we have the rigidity of the nanotubes blended with the plastic properties of the amorphous carbon and we design the hair spring in-house using in-house computer software she developed the perfect hair spring teammates with our Garland's wear which in this case is made out of aluminum yes this was the main highlight of tying her at this year's buzzer world I mean sounded very promising but after the first batches of washes were shipped on the different market well they had massive issues with it and simply had to pull it out I mean totally stopped talking about it and to this day I mean the auto BIA remained now a classical hair spring powered watch so very strangely this didn't really catch the attention of anybody and might just prove once again that people forget things very easily I mean we didn't and also prove that to bring serious innovation well it's definitely hard path to walk remember when the same team introduced the zenith DVI lab well took them a while between the announcement the spectacular announcement and the final delivery of the first few pieces regarding other major technical achievements of the year I really loved the Hermes Laura you know such a cool and playful watch hiding true complex mechanism first of all we have to put all the indications through the center it's come from the base movement and goes through the center and then redirected to the sub Tyler we have two moon phases Mike went on in 59 days and parallel to that we have also the 31 gearing or T's for the date and for the correction we have to place Bohr's star wheels in the same position at one place to make the correction in terms of playfulness while Oatlands also had something fun to the HS fair is really reusing this essence of this product and their DNA of all transiting is really present with a three-dimensional sphere that show the time with a 450 degrees turn every hour and with a retrograde minutes 2019 offered us quite a fireworks of multi-access to be on behind which we find the same genius watchmaker mr. Ellie could I and once personified in the spectacular and B&F legacy machine Thunderdome so quarry designed the back of the movement and you're going to see this incredibly beautiful pocket watch looking like movement highest level of finishing hand finishing on everything you turn that piece around and you'll see the world a very could right come to life I asked Eric one thing I want the craziest most insane 3d kinetic sculpture regulator you've done he went all in he went all in so you've got the largest fastest multiple access to be on a regulator in the world between size and speed to give you an idea the three cage is turned in one in twenty seconds one in twelve seconds one in eight seconds that is insanely quick and another variant with the / no doubles very own only budgeted no again a big different cache Pune trolleys Lizzie Philip wasn't too sure abandon ship one - Mia don't support you at all Oh Matata cashes in on his old APA specificity tape while the Vitesse copied the cache on ITV and shot monkey Casio geometry sake I shot my birthday but coming back on NBN F when the first lady's watch was also greeted with big success with the flying tea I have no idea what a woman wants so I realized this can only work if I stop thinking what would they like and I instead put in a mechanical sculpture everything I love in the women of my life and so you've got this dome and under the dome you've got the life and that was linked to maternity for me and if you if you turn the piece around the rotor is this incredible Sun because it's the same thing I gravitate around them well Gary continued to impress when it comes to extra thin watches beating a record every year and sadly making us completely forget that this used to be PRS territory so you can set the time with the push button and 9 9 o clock and you have on the other on the other side you of the push button to start and stop and reset the program it's a periphery clutter movement the movement it's a bit wider because we have the the Platinum periphery croto it's not only chronograph is a GMT chronograph so it's true the most useful complication that everybody want to use and what to say about Gribble for say who double push the limits of their GM team with the crazy quadruple to be on version with looking at is of course iconic GMT display here with the rotating globe turning in real-time giving us the first visual time around the world then of course we've got a red GMT hand here which is operated by the pusher at four o'clock and then we've got the third time zone in fact with your local time which you can synchronize anywhere around the world and the to be on one and to to be on three and four I can't excite you the sapphire ring giving the equator position here view down to the southern hemisphere during the data and then the movement side so here we see the characteristic 24 cities 24 timezone disc rotating in real time again and yes I said double because then they introduced something we wouldn't necessarily expect it from them a sports version of the GMT so the first aspect which stands out is obviously the curve in shape of the case it is properly a rounded and sis just marvelously on the wrist so one of the cool aspect of all this is that when you look at it from the top the case of the watch really seems round in fact and but in reality it's much more overweight kind of a little optical illusion which works just fine but good news didn't start there as we had the great privilege of following undercover the making of their very first fully handmade timepiece the difference is really what we sometimes like to call the intelligence of the hand the gestures have to be an extension of the hand so it means that you know we are here in the workshop what we call our Atelier tradition at global force II and this means that here there is no numerical control no computer driven equipment to really master making the different techniques of components different types it could easily take 10 or 15 years of practice to get really to the top level as as we say in terms of precision to be able to make a reliable and precise handmade timepiece since we're full of good news well we shall hopefully pretty soon publish the this kind of documentary approach film that we did about it I think you will really like it coming soon okay but what making doesn't stop to Switzerland and we got to see some pretty interesting people and timepieces elsewhere such as this really original automatic hematocrit more it's Christmas no rote or no peripheral rotor no micro rotor but instead a hammer light component thus its names hammer Hama tech and this very different-looking component works by flipping from one side to the other around the top axis and by moving ever so slightly even by five degrees this will fuel up the energy stored in the barrel so though we are talking traditional mechanical watch making it seriously looks different the architecture of the movement looks different as a whole we are really not used to this and it required more than three years of development sir by the team of moritz Grossman to finalize this movement in London we also got to see an amazing timepiece from Charles of France ham with a very complex regulating organ and just learnt a story behind this watch is the development we wanted to show the iconography of the company we wanted to show the roots of the company and yet we wanted it to be a 21st century company so we looked at material sciences we looked at escapement technology we have succeeded and we've made a development of George Daniels double impulse chronometer fitting it to a wristwatch which had never previously been done we were also very happy to go to Japan and meet the very interesting independent watchmaker Hajime as our casino GNE sanguine angry cara music ara okay the video MonaVie has to be master so this tiny mark which is our no Tokyo say circus their hearts burst and when he sent George negative now yes c'mon you st. Jude hang out there's no doctor it's Turkish to sino-korean estado de Botton Naruto - did I Hodge named Emory hey those taketori must talk about it once I clean up in the coronagraph automatically the more yeah my original Nakano chronograph - normally it's grounded for nine days through what I knew and what about the lightest mechanical watch ever produced with young French watchmaker Valentin Homolka it says the latest watch mechanical watch in the world with 16 points 9 drums yeah that's the catch sixteen point nine grams I mean this is a timepiece that you actually don't feel when you have it on the rest it's a combination of polymer and carbon fiber and it's a secret okay I know that this watches design didn't suit everybody but on the other hand and whenever I'm wearing it you can't believe the attention it gets and this coming from some super serious watch people okay the next subject concerns the hunter for the next successful steel sports watch and let's simply do a little recap of what we've talked about in 2019 then I have to start with our longings Ernie who shocked the world world with their first ever steal sport watch something they said they would never do but there you go and business is business as the German brand introduced the OD sales forty point five millimeter in width 11.1 in height totally new timepiece new movement and long a insisted on the sports dimension of this new timepiece and I think that the terms sport here would fit a bit more as they went pretty conservative and could have gone a little bit more wild to prove their point next big launch or let's say big budget spent on that launch and I will talk about the new shopper Alpine Eagle we can clearly feel that they are looking to narrow the gap in terms of price point between the very nice high-end luc pieces and this Mille Miglia and be a bit opportunistic but in these troubled times for watchmaking nothing wrong with crying but actually this shopper mimics slightly 1980s collection of the brand code at a time the st. Moritz which had these features so honor and save more or less and in the last edition of primetime I had a good time and loved talking about the new and rows be r05 connection with this mix of so many existing icons well the idea behind this of course is that in the market there is a pent-up demand for luxury steel watches and as we all know in the industry there are some of them you just can't get it's all circular so when you look at the designs there are no straight lines anywhere and we've developed the for our first in-house automatic movement it's a very robust movement so this is not a slim eight millimeter thing this is a robust watch and we couldn't do a summary of the year without mentioning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] million francs [Music] yes this was quite something and in my eyes has contributed and making watch making enter kind of a new world new dimension but I was also happy that we witnessed the acknowledgement of George Daniels contribution to watch making with the highest price reached by an independent okay in a certain way Patek is also independent but anyhow and this piece is his first and only watch to feature not only a perpetual calendar but it's an instantaneous perpetual calendar meaning all the functions shown precisely at midnight it has minute repeater designed by himself it has a thermometer it has Toby on with coaxial escapement of course equation of time power reserve and an annual calendar which indicates the the number of days in that and that specific month and in 2019 I was also very happy to have had as much birthday celebration as I did with our new unboxing series [Music] [Music] and we shall continue with this I mean they are definitely fun to do but we'll really concentrate on some pretty crazy timepieces you know might as well make these birthday as worthwhile as possible but we will also continue to produce diesel walkthrough videos because we really love making them and for me the surprise of the year was the incredible success in terms of audience of our Jacob and Co video reports and we don't really know why or maybe could it be yeah and they're not bad at other stuff too if you see what I mean [Music] the main novelties in Basel this year is we have first time ever showing introducing casino astronomia where you actually could bet on the numbers and it always gives you a new number yes I was and still am quite surprised by the massive user this visa got and doing a walkthrough Jacob & Co could therefore interest a few people it seems but on a less glamorous but extremely meaningful level you guys know we love the suppliers of this industry the ones making it all possible and for this one we always love to go to the Eph Jean I mean as a trade fair dedicated to them but this year I hope we'll be able to visit more of them directly in their environment and disclose our together some of their secrets the the AP HJ as as a service that it provides is for me one of the most interesting exhibitions that I actually visit and the reason for that is that ideas are very easy but the most complicated part in actually realizing of the final product is the process and to get to the end of that process you need to know the companies who are based here in 2019 obviously what a great moment for us was when we celebrated a hundred K subscriber and had this little nice party here in Geneva with some great people not to mention mr. Philip before obviously it was great to meet all you guys and I hope we'll have another good excuse to do another party here in our Watchers club okay well I mean this is finally it for this first edition of primetime a special edition of course thanks for watching thanks to our patrons and without insisting too much but I mean you're all welcome to join in as I mentioned and if you're interested in collaborating with us and be part of the journalistic team well don't hesitate to inquire and more info on our website and finally well we have some good stuff coming your way such as a walkthrough of at creamier I mean as our neighbors just out there just a little teasing so let's go for our first and enthusiastic beaver watchmaking of 2020 happy new year and see yours [Music]
