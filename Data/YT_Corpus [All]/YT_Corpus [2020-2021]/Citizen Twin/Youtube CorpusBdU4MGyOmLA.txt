 NBC News live right now in any time streaming on roku hulu Facebook and ABC News doc live from ABC News the State of the Union and the Democratic response [Music] when I'm Terry Moran here at ABC News headquarters in New York and we are going to be previewing the state of the union president Donald Trump's third State of the Union it comes at a fascinating time for him and for the country a moment of high drama President Trump will step before the Congress that has impeached him the house that has impeached him and the Senate that is on the verge of acquitting him that votes scheduled tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. and it looks all but certain that he's going to be substantially acquitted with the Republicans to a person voting to acquit there it looks like there might be a little bit mystery in it but probably not so he's got a story to tell is he going to is he going to tell it antagonistically is he going to dance on the Democrats or is he going to look forward to the next big chapter the 2020 election presidents traditionally used this stage this national stage to set the terms of their reelection campaign in reelection years let's go to our team down in Washington in the capital Jon Karl covering the White House force marry Bruce to Congress John let me go to you first what do we expect and I know you've heard a lot from the White House about what the president wants to accomplish tonight so what are we looking for well the White House officials say that he does not intend to speak about impeachment frankly Terry I find that to be a little surprising and I wouldn't be surprised if there was a little bit of ad-libbing if it's not news prepared remarks but overall officials say he's going to strike a tone of and I'm going to read this verbatim this is from a senior White House official he's going to lay out a vision of relentless optimism Donald Trump is what that's what at the White House say he will do their saying this will be a address that basically sets the tone for his reelection campaign it talks about the accomplishments that have happened under his watch including obviously the economy they'll talk about the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that was signed last month and he officials insist he will be optimistic and forward-looking and that is very telling he's got a good story to tell but his audience is immediate audience in that chamber as I say the Democrats who impeached him tried to kick him out of office through the most drastic remedy that the Constitution has impeachment and the Republicans who have protected him from that so Mary Bruce covering the Congress for what what are we gonna see from the audience we're gonna first we're gonna see everybody's everything to show up there well look what while it is not clear if the president going to address the elephant in the room what is clear is it's going to be pretty awkward in the chamber as you mentioned the president will be standing there speaking to Democrats who now have impeachment to senators who in less than 24 hours are going to face that decision of whether or not to remove the president from office now there are going to be some who simply are not showing up in protest about a dozen Democrats have said they don't plan on coming because in their words they essentially don't want to dignify the president's behavior by condoning it by showing up one congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio Cortes saying that you just want to normalize the president's lawless conduct also some chairs that will be empty are those who are trying to replace the president out on the campaign trail senators Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders Amy Klobuchar they are all now attending to some other breaking news of over the last 24 hours and they are out in New Hampshire working the campaign trail so there are some who will be missing but remember it's not just that it will be awkward perhaps between Democrats but also that there are a growing number of Republicans who the president will be facing who in the last couple days have come out and said well they don't think what the President did was impeachable they also don't think it was right and appropriate either in Terry keep in mind he's going to be over his left shoulder he will have Nancy Pelosi speaker Pelosi and president Trump have spoken to each other since the middle of October and that was didn't exactly go very now that was the meeting at the White House where Nancy Pelosi stood up and walked out on the president they have not spoken not in person not over the phone in since middle of October and it was a year ago at that last State of the Union address where Nancy Pelosi wearing white as I understand she will be tonight suffer just to color with that kind of smirking clapping motion that that she had that was caught on camera this this year John it does look like the president's got the got the whip hand here he's he's in that he's he's in charge well Terry you can look at this past month that much of it was consumed with a an impeachment trial dealing with his fate and yet many White House officials look at the month of January and say it was one of the best months of the Trump presidency he mentioned that the trade deal you know the Met radio I mentioned earlier that was signed the economy doing well taking out Qasem Soleimani the the Iranian leader they believe that they've had a great month and now coming into this it which is obviously ironic given that so much of it was tied up into this impeachment trial with Democrats making the case that he needs to be removed from office because he is a threat to the nation but he feels like he's coming into this feeling quite good all right John Karl and Mary Bruce you'll be up there for the big speech it's a long one buckle in thanks very much and here in New York I'm joined by Nightline co-anchor and veteran reporter and good friend Byron Pitts is with us so Byron we're hearing from John and Mary he's got a good story to tell at a very very dramatic and strange time he's being impeached and he's gonna claim victory yeah you and I both have covered a number of these speeches from a number of presidents and I was just thinking I can't think of a time where there's been more drama on the evening so many different storylines going on all the ones that you so eloquently laid out and you wonder which one of those will they touch upon and thinking about you think of all the major speeches of President Trump has given I can't think of one we're didn't take the opportunity to poke at his adversaries and going in tonight he has good ammunition I think by most accounts what happened in Iowa last night was a disaster for the Democrats right he's not gonna be able to resist dunking on that exactly I mean it's it's it's like me late late night comics aw I mean they had one job right yeah one job for years to do it and didn't get it right so you would seem like he's gonna lead in there as you laid out we certainly know the outcome of the other vote tomorrow it's hard to see this president missed the opportunity to poke fun at that and again because the people who came after him many of them will be in the room looking him in the eye and they'll know that in the end they didn't get where they wanted to get and he survived as you mentioned over his shoulder if someone who is clearly not just on different sides of the aisle but just philosophically emotionally a opposed like I think most people argue they probably don't like each other and and they'll be in proximity you just I mean certainly how how meaningful it might be with with all the the issues going on in the world with the coronavirus different challenges issues going on on the Wall Street but this president does have good things he can he can stick with and how wonderful it might be in this giving the state of our union that he would give this unifying speech that yes there are these challenges around the world but look at all the good things that we have accomplished as a nation but that's not his style it's not his stuff but you're right if he's ever gonna do it it's this moment now the Democrats can't let him because he's sailing towards a reelection he thanks given what the economy is and previous presidents with a good economy have done pretty well but I think that this would be the hinge for him to turn that corner not like right you and I because we've talked about such things right and you always you know I both know you've there oftentimes there are moments where the leader of the free world the president rises to the occasion and does something that that friends and foe will go huh right that's not been his style and there's no expectation about looking at what happened yesterday with a not just that there were mistakes made in either glitches but this fact therefore for years we've been hearing or for several years we've been hearing that the Democrats are energized to take on this president energized discipline ready to go in an Iowa we didn't see a record turnout right there were these technical problems that you don't see if you're really if you're really ready for primetime you're gonna get this right and so so does it use that to say see I told you these people aren't worthy of me or does he say you know what let's all move forward together the you know I've had these successes they've had some glitches this is a reminder that perhaps this is my time we're going in the right direction and and to you all who are struggling I mean he can use the disadvantage you all have had a bad 24 hours come with me there yeah across the political I don't know but but you never know because let's let's talk about the scene there that chamber at Grand Chamber we're looking outside but the grand chamber of the House of Representative where the Senate comes to join the cabinet is there the president and the Speaker of the House and the Vice President up there also members of the Supreme Court let's go to Devin Dwyer who tracks the Supreme Court I know because I rely and work with Devin on that subject from time to time so Devin this has become a controversy over the years which justices are going to show up and and and increasingly fewer and fewer do because it does feel like a political event they don't want to be part of but what can you tell us about the justices who are gonna be there yeah it sure does Terry this is one of the more uncomfortable events this is the Supreme Court justices participate in each year you and I have both heard it from members of the Supreme Court this year were told by the court the Chief Justice will be in attendance along with Elena Kagan representing the courts liberal wing and then president Trump's two appointees to the court Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh will be there front and center as well both of them were here last time now these justices have such mixed feelings about being there this goes back to Antonin Scalia of course who you covered very closely Terry he called this a chow spectacled every year and stuck his nose up at it Anton instance Alito said it's like having to sit like a potted plant without giving any expression and he struggles with that from time to time responding to some of President Obama's speeches but I'm really going to be watching closely Chief Justice John Roberts tonight because he is not only the Chief Justice of an entire branch of government but he's still technically presiding over the trial as you say of President Trump so he's actually still leading that effort and he's going to be you know convening the court later next month to decide on whether subpoenas in three separate cases for president Trump's financial records should be upheld and that whether the President himself the man who will be staring him in the eye tonight will eventually have to turn over those tax returns so it's always a difficult position for those justices to be in and it's great body language watching tonight among all the other things we'll be looking at as the speech goes on there was that famous incident Devon when President Barack Obama castigated the Supreme Court from that Diet United on citizens united saying it was a wrongly decided case and Justice Samuel Alito shook his head and said no no that's wrong and got in trouble for it he's not showing up tonight he that's right and he he has said that that was a moment that burned him that he wanted to stay out of the spotlight like so many of them do but I've heard from Justice Kavanagh who has talked publicly about feeling like this is the Super Bowl of politics of American government he feels a responsibility to represent the judiciary in that chamber he likes being there he has said in his speeches and so he's one of the more smiley members of that court at least for the opening ceremonies with the president Terry you can expect will reference the court tonight he has talked a lot in his presidential campaign and his reelection campaign about those two appointments to the court and as you know appointing more federal judges to the bench than any other president at this point in his first term so a lot to talk about with the judicial a lot of help from Mitch McConnell there Devin thanks very much let's go to one of the members who will be listening to the president tonight Congressman Joaquin Castro representing Texas his 20th congressional that's San Antonio if he looks familiar his twin brother Anthony was running for president as well congressman thanks for joining us yes thanks for having me thank you and so this is a president do you agree or disagree coming to the Congress sort of honor on the crest of of a wave it looks like impeachment is not going to work for the differences that can be removed from office he's got a pretty good economy what do you expect from the president how do you judge how he enters the the chamber there his status before the American people well that's certainly one way to put it I would put it a little bit of a different way which is this is a president who was among a few presidents in American history to be impeached so he comes into this chamber tonight under a cloud because of that and you know usually in these speeches presidents will take credit for how well the economy is doing for international affairs but this is a president who comes in with many challenges they're also income inequality has grown he's shepherded a tax bill that helped only the wealthiest Americans his foreign policy has been a very chaotic one and so you know you've got a Congress I think that is very suspect of many of the president's priorities and his policies can I ask you about morale in the Democratic caucus given what President Trump will say is his you know his defeat of an unwarranted impeachment his good economy and then the Iowa caucus mess last night it has morale among the Democrats your colleagues it's fine I mean look the years under this administration have been intense for many reasons President Trump has won have been one of the most divisive presidents in American history and that is weighed I think pretty heavily on many members of Congress so in that sense it has been quite intense but in terms of our outlook and what's on the horizon I think we've been very positive and and I think are very bullish about the coming months I won't ask you one more question you know we watched these states in the State of the Union addresses and one side rises in the north Riaan style applause 2530 times the other side sits on its hands most of the time that'll happen again tonight what's your feeling because the American people kind of I think by and large polls show would like more more comity more bipartisanship in Congress how do you feel about your fellow Republicans in that house I know what it'll look like but do you feel like you can do any business across that partisan divide yeah you know the issues that get the most coverage are the issues where Congress is very divided along party lines but there are things that happen here every week where people are actually in agreement and there are areas of overlap where I think we can still work together and hopefully we'll have a chance to do some of that in 2020 yeah let me ask you so what would you say is the last thing you worked on that you felt good about working with Republicans well I mean I'm working on bills all the time that are bipartisan bills and I think that's the case for all of us for example I'm on the Foreign Affairs Committee and have a few bills at least that have co-sponsors that are Republicans I've done work with for example mark meadows on on voting around the world and he's of course a it was head of the tea party so there's a lot of stuff that goes on around here that's actually bipartisan it's just not covered in the same way that many of the big issues are and and that's on US Congressman Joaquin Castro a little good news tonight thanks very much thank you so let's uh let's go back out let's go out onto the campaign trail right now after that mess in Iowa as you probably know the Iowa caucus just melted down completely no results were reported at all for close to 24 hours and still not even two-thirds have been reported are what Johnson is with Bernie Sanders up in New Hampshire they've all gone from Iowa to New Hampshire Bernie Sanders has the right to be in the Senate chamber as the United States Senator but he's up there in New Hampshire well what's the fallout from Iowa and the the president's seizing this spotlight tonight what's Bernie Sanders doing well Terry he actually just wrapped up a huge rally right here hundreds of people very excited to see him and despite the frustration despite the mess out of Iowa they are energized they're motivated they're excited about those preliminary results that are coming through Bernie Sanders himself came up on the stage and said that he got more votes in the first and second round in Iowa than any other candidate but as we know it is neck and neck with Peabody jej who is also claiming a win out of Iowa so there's certainly certainly that level of uncertainty and Bernie Sanders unable to claim that full victory that they really wanted coming here to New Hampshire that said looking forward of course the State of the Union is tonight which you've been talking about and Bernie Sanders is actually skipping that and he has his own response that he'll be putting out later tonight after the president speaks now this is not the first time that he's done it but it is the first time that he's doing it while he's running for president we do expect to hear some of the things that he said on his stump speech earlier tonight things like President Trump is not above the law and he will reference that impeachment vote because after all this wraps up tonight tomorrow Bernie Sanders has to head back to Washington to be there to vote on impeachment against President Trump Terry that's right with there'll be an exodus of senators from New Hampshire as the four who are running and a back in Washington to cast that vote thanks very much let's go to Martha Raddatz my colleague and who was my host for the Super Bowl party as well Martha so you could talk about football well it was great it was a great party I'll tell you that and I want to ask about foreign policy so the president's got a State of the Union I don't know how much of it is gonna be dedicated to foreign posit but what kind of a story do you think he has to tell her well well I think one thing is clear there won't be a lot about foreign policy there wasn't a lot about foreign policy last year but the story he can tell is going after people who as he said shouldn't be alive today Baghdady that was certainly a significant move on the part of President Trump and those who tracked him down over all these years the head of Isis we have today a report coming out of the Pentagon that so far it hasn't made much difference operationally or in command and control and as John Carl mentioned he'll certainly talk about soleimani in Iran as well although not much of a difference has been seen there in terms of what Iran is doing through proxies I mean we had some Katusha rockets or mortars hitting in the Green Zone very recently so I think what everybody will have an eye on is what comes next in those countries and what the president says about that last year he talked about North Korea and a good relationship he had and that there had been no missiles missile launches in 15 months well in the past year in 2019 there were about 15 or 19 15 to 20 short-range missile launches coming out of North Korea and you had a president last year Terry who said they wanted to end the endless wars that great nations do not stay in endless wars and if you look at the numbers around some of the places where we are they've been reduced somewhat in Afghanistan somewhat in Iraq at one point and and now they have sent in more troops there so we hear the president is about to leave the White House on his way to the capital but let me ask you about the chamber and there he is we're taking a look at the picture that's on the other side of the White House that is the that is the South portico door Security's coming out there and aides so he'll be out with the first lady shortly there's the beast as they call it that's the Cadillac Martha you've written in that haven't you I have not written in that yeah I certainly have not written in that but I but I've seen a lot of those motorcades go by right down the street because as you know we're just just a very short walk to the White House all right period ABC but it is it is quite a ride and those who protect him on this historic night really whatever you think whatever you're waiting to hear at the State of the Union it is an incredible evening to see the president United States speak in front of Congress speak in front of the nation of course I think tonight will be a little more of a campaign speech I also love Terry won one of my favorite things to watch is the Joint Chiefs the Chairman and all the heads of the branches of the military and when they walk in I can tell you from people who've done it in the past that it is not a real comfortable situation for any of them those are the people I like to watch clap because they are only allowed to clap when it has something to do with the troops they have to stay away especially in that chamber away from anything political I know often times they look like a bunch of grumpy old men and indeed they are men still all of the Joint Chiefs that could change someday as women work their way up through the ranks but that is an interesting group to watch we know of course the President Trump loves to talk about the military and some of his guests tonight are our veterans and and military families but that is something he will highlight as well I'm quite certain he will highlight how much money has been spent on the military how much he likes military of course we also have this year the space force that's something new he can talk about as well all right Martha thanks very much for that and we will continue to watch the South portico there when the when the president comes out will show you we do have the white house always releases a few excerpts some of the quotes and the applause lines that he expects the president tonight will say he's leading quote the great American comeback as he puts it that his main goal when he came into office was to revive the US economy he'll also throw some red meat it's some some some lines that his base will no doubt like and you'll see standing ovations from the Republican side he says we will never let socialism destroy American health care a dig at Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party in general general and he also says the United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not criminal aliens we were just talking foreign-policy with martha raddatz our Kyra Phillips has just come back from a trip with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Ukraine in in part where she had a great interview with him caret joins us on the phone and Kara that was well time to interview Mike Pompeo who is thrust right into the middle of the impeachment as it emerged that he was according to witnesses very much involved in the president's push for political investigations in Ukraine and you talked to him about that what'd he say absolutely I mean Perry that's why I wanted to go this is why I wanted to have an exclusive interview with him because he was the first senior US official to go to Ukraine since the impeachment trial began and I wanted to be there with him I wanted to see what he had to say I want to see how he interacted with President Solinsky of Ukraine and other leaders we were in London Ukraine Belarus Kazakhstan Uzbekistan I mean it was quite the trip Carrie I hadn't you know talked about the stands since the Iraq war even going back to Afghanistan so I had to definitely refresh my history lessons and also foreign policy and and and what what was behind this trip that you know policy wise but at the same time sherry as you well know you know it was what's been at the heart of this impeachment trial is the millions of dollars in American security assistance sent to Ukraine and in the middle all of all of this I mean talking about the trip getting ready for the trip this manuscript gets out this book that john bolton former national security adviser has written and I wanted to talk not only about Pompeo Strip but also what had had come out what had leaked with regard to this manuscript and in addition to that I wanted to see if journalists in these countries specifically in Ukraine we're talking about it as well and I was quite surprised sorry to see that they had a lot of questions for us they had a lot of questions for Secretary of State Pompeyo and that that was very interested interesting to me because well president Trump has tried to play this down as well as Pompeo at many at many moments within this trip and and the interview it was quite revealing to see how much interest there was in the impeachment trial and with regard to secretary Pompey on what he was going to say as he made this trip well you asked him point-blank about the the evidence that has come in in the impeachment trial and the revelations in John Bolton's apparently forthcoming unpublished manuscript that that Pompeo was very much involved and I was struck when you said while you have you ever known john bolton to be a liar it's a mission of the things to say let's let's take a listen to what Mike Pompeo Secretary of State told our Kyra Phillips he writes about that you and he an esper went to the Oval that he told the president this is an America in America's interest to not withhold aid he said that espera said this defense relationship we have gotten some really good benefits from it notably military equipment manufactured in the US Trump will hide Ukraine is a corrupt country we're pissing away our money is that how you remember that meeting yeah unlike others I don't talk about conversations I had with the president but there were many meetings out that we know that's very clearly right I was an advocate for continuing to support what I was doing right here in Ukraine today I continue to think that there's good value for what we're doing you wanted the aid to get here absolutely why why was it so important to you at that time why why did you fight for that and go to the President and say we've got to get that aid to Ukraine here for the same reasons I just described to you in the beginning of our interview this is important to the United States of America we have challenges here to freedom we want to make sure democracy flourishes here it's on the edge of the European opportunity and now this country is firmly anchored in the West and if we get it right it'll be so for decades and for generations so that is secretaries take might Pompeo and cure as I said he pushed away your question there on what actually happened and he also basically called John Bolton a liar he did he did he did not deny and I and I asked him point-blank you know are you are you calling him a liar he's saying have you ever known him not to be truthful and he did not come forward and say directly that that that they were always on the same page and you know what else I found interesting is that you know we had a chance to talk also outside of that interview Terry and I think that Secretary Pompeo is going to have a lot to say as time goes on I will not be surprised if we will learn a lot more as time goes on but he is at this point dedicated to working with the President on on specific issues to improve relations to not only help get past what they have been downplaying as as a hoax and a trial that is not credible but I just I have a deep-seated feeling that we are going to learn a lot more as time moved on all right and he's certainly less survivor in an administration full of turmoil and staff turnover Mike Pompeo has been there from just about the beginning as director of CIA and then Secretary of State Kyra thanks very much we're gonna go to break for a moment when we come back we'll have more of our look ahead there's the beast waiting for the president to take president Trump to his third State of the Union address stay with us we'll be right back [Music] in DC Friday night February 7th live the first debate after Iowa and the last debate

the president will arrive at the Capitol for his State of the Union address so he'll be leaving fairly shortly and we want to talk a little bit about politics now with Byron Pitts this Iowa caucus Fiasco it's a gift the real winner of the Iowa caucus was Donald Trump Oh without question without question I mean it was me he couldn't have scripted it but I know last night we were all working preparing for the show and in our business you always lay out several possible scenarios and which direction the story might go trust me there was not a scenario for it there'll be no numbers provided at all and it was stunning I mean it's I mean certainly we're all mindful in any industry there are mistakes there you know things do but but to completely miss the mark and the impact that has on the chemist you know we've often talked in the past about the momentum the Big Mo the candidates need coming out of Iowa and that they work hard to earn well that was that was denied you think about you know mayor Pete and what if in fact it turns out that he won the night what it would have meant for him as this you know outsider two years ago to come this far and and that now that moments been missed certainly I would think if if President Trump was the biggest winner of last night then you have to think former Vice President Joe Biden is a close second right because we're not talking about how exactly look at look at that look at those numbers that's 62% of the precincts of the vote in and we don't know what the what the 38 that's out where they were but so this is a partial result we aren't calling a winner at all but look where Biden is and and for so long everyone has said he's the favorite he's the front-runner but as you were just talking about football in the break and it's like you know when that when the come out beginning a football season and they say Clemson's number one Alabama's number one but if you go oh and for okay.we you may be great on paper so at some point like he has to start winning someplace right I'm a Chicago Bears fan there were people picking for the Super Bowl at the beginning of the wait years it was painful that way but let's go to Iowa our Tom yamas when the chief anchors here at our streaming channel is out there in time you were out there day there digging out from the rubble today what did look like well it's still the biggest mystery in politics Terry and it's now 24 hours since the voting got underway here in Iowa yesterday and we still have no winner sixty-two percent as you as you mentioned has been reported but this is a debacle and Tom Perez the chairman of the DNC has just released a statement this is just in tonight right here on ABC News live and he says this is never gonna happen again he says this is completely unacceptable he also says they're never gonna use the app that they used here in Iowa there seems to be a coding problem with that app there are actually two problems there was a problem with the app and then the backup system there was supposed to be a firewall which was that they could phone in some of the results but it turns out so many people were phoning in yesterday there more than 1600 precincts all across the Hawkeye state that the phones got jammed up and people had to wait for hours they were on hold forever they just hung up and Terry the Des Moines Register had an interesting story Hardy decides yeah sure president and first lady entering the the limousine there were just taken them as they get into the the limousine and on route to the Capitol off they go it's a short drive down Pennsylvania to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue where the president will give his State of the Union dress but Tom I'm sorry I interrupted go on no it's okay you actually remind me looking at the president the first lady he won his caucus he was declared the winner early in the night yesterday in the Republican caucuses but again back to the democratic caucuses the Des Moines Register had a very interesting story story were they they actually spoke to some precinct captains people in in the rural parts of the state on the far western edges eastern edges they didn't even have smartphones they couldn't even use the app so from the get-go they were going to phone-in and yet they were using this technology throughout the state the chair of the party here of the Iowa Democratic Party here said it was unacceptable he apologized but Terry we're now more than 24 hours later and we still don't have results they came out here almost four hours ago with the 62% reported in where the rest of the numbers what's happened and why should people have any faith in the system if we can't get those numbers you were speaking with Byron obviously the Republicans and the Trump campaign is gonna seize on this they're gonna say the system is rigged but it all plays into the Republican hands and as you mentioned it plays into Joe Biden's hands and it's disappointing to all the people in Iowa who actually the voters who go to all these events they would see the candidates that go to their coffee shops they go to their churches they'd watch these candidates try trying to listen to them speak and pick someone and then all the volunteers and the staffers that worked for more than a year because Terry you cover the caucuses you know it's the ground game here it is so important you've got to have the ground game here and and now you have a headline that's unclear is it Sanders is it mayor Pete mayor Pete should be riding that big mow into New Hampshire he had a pretty good moment today he got a little emotional when when sort of he realized he is somewhat victorious here there in New Hampshire and I'm sure he'll get a little bit of a bump but now you have Joe Biden and his whole his whole campaign is based on the fact or at least the theory because it's not a fact that he's gonna be electable that electability is issue well guess what you gotta be elected to say you're electable and so far right now it looks like that's not the case with Joe Biden it sure doesn't and we're looking at the senators coming in Ron Wyden there Bob Menendez of New Jersey sherrod Brown of Ohio and I and Tom raised a great point biron about the confidence that people need to have in the count it's and in this era of hacking and and and doubt in institutions in general do you think this has an impact on on the trust that people have in the vote itself absolutely you know as we've often discussed there's for any person anything is always a narrative right anything that happens to reinforce a narrative so it there are concerns in our country our election process who gets to vote what votes are counted that that's built into our DNA now as a nation we have concerns about and so what happened in Iowa only reinforces that that if we can't get if that the Democrats can't get it right for a few hundred thousand people in one state why should we believe it's it's it's once the all saying fool me once shame on you fool me twice and so yeah I would think it for we knew because so much of our nation right they you know they get engaged as they as they need to and if that the passing the gaygent was they got it wrong in Iowa where there's some problems a couple years ago why should I trust the process why should i participate in the process and that that is that the evil genius is aware of what the Kremlin did to the United States in 2016 let's go to Yvette Simpson we're having to be joined by the CEO of democracy for America a progressive group and Yvette thanks for being with us I wanted to ask you both about about the State of the Union but first this what subject we're talking about the debacle in Iowa how do you read the impact going forward big small what what difference will it make that this thing happened I think the party is going to have a long overdue conversation about Iowa and whether it should be the first state about caucuses in general and whether they're the best way to make sure that everybody is represented there's a lot of folks who were not able to engage in the caucus process and so that's another issue voter integrity making sure that we have paper that we have backups that we don't use new systems without testing them and so that is kind of the conversation we're gonna have particularly with Nevada right around the corner and they also have a caucus format as well and they got to get that right and they've already said they are going to use that app yeah they better not but I do want to say Terry there was some good news coming out of Iowa right we had the largest group of first-time caucus goers 35 percent first-time caucus goers the number of young people tripled over 2016 who engaged in the caucus processes so we're engaging younger voters which we need to that millennial population is large and we need them to engage and so there was some good news coming out but I do think the Iowa Democratic Party the DNC needs to have a conversation one about making sure that we have diversity in those early contests and number two making sure that we look at this caucus format and find out whether it is equitable whether it is Democratic or whether we need to go to the primary format across all of the contests up until into convention and just taking a look at President Trump how strong do you think he is coming for the country right now with the story that he wants to tell you know if you're if you're Donald Trump you never have a bad day you have a perfect car everything's great everything's wonderful what we know is that this president is the king of spin right he's told almost 17,000 lies in the last three years he's been president 17,000 false or misleading claims he says everything is great when we know it's not right he tried the spin is work on the economy when we know his trade war is impacting agriculture now manufacturing we know that the ultra-rich are getting way richer and the rest of us are suffering and so we expect to hear a lot of spin a lot of misrepresentation he's talking to his base and certainly a lot of rhetoric a lot of racist rhetoric because his words around immigration let's not forget there is still children caged at the border that the Muslim ban was expanded by six more countries and so we need to make sure that and I can't wait to hear the response from Governor Whitmer and of course Veronica Escobar who's right at the border who's gonna do it in Spanish because that's where the truth is gonna come in is with that response we expect we expect a lot of spin a lot of misrepresentation and everything to be perfect and great that that is Donald Trump and you're also right the line that he will be saying we are told is the United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not criminal aliens and whatever you think of the policy implications of that since he stepped on the national scene talking about how Mexico sends rapists to the United States he has drawn that issue in the starkest and as many believe the most racist terms he would deny that but he bet thank you very much for that so we should say one of the pieces of theater that presidents get to have in the State of the Union is filling the first lady's box with guests that they might reference in their speech and one of them in the lady in the first lady's box above the Senate chamber Rush Limbaugh and his wife will be up there Rush Limbaugh one of the most influential political voices of the past generations iron who announced yesterday that he has advanced lung cancer the president wants to honor him very divisive but he changed American political district Oh without question a force and I think it was you know as we saw a different circumstance but as we saw last week with Kobe Bryant that it's it's humbling when when the reality that that faces us all impacts the lives of people of note is it Rush Limbaugh a force a lying for for conservatives positions and he's a force and raising money for for driving the agenda of the Republican Party and and yesterday and the other day in distance hearing his words and the haunting nature of his voice now it does remind you for as divisive as the divided as a nation can be at times as difficult as our politics are that people have the individual eyes I thought when he spoke the other day about his family in that regardless of how we feel about each other's politics you always wish well for an individual and I'm thinking about you know this this night and you and I both have been around the world and Martha touched upon this that we've been a lot of places in the world that were these kinds of gatherings of powerful people to only occur when someone has to die for it to happen but in our nation as divided as we may be that politicians from both sides of the aisle they're being polite to each other they're shaking hands are being civil and that's one of the many things that makes America such a magical place that for all that divides this we are still the United States of America and this event the State of the Union address is you see the members of congressmen senators filing in there and advanced the president is something the State of the Union is in the Constitution one of the requirements of being a president and there actually aren't many it's a very vague majestic generalities as they say define the Constitution but to say the president shall give an address on the state of the end shall report understanding it didn't have to be a speech it was originally written down here's Nancy Pelosi trying to get a little order here on the part of the House to escort the President of the United States into the chamber the gentleman from Maryland mr. Hoyer the gentleman from South Carolina mr. Clyburn the gentleman from New Mexico the gentleman from mr. Neuer what she's doing there is announcing the escort for people desk fourth the president and those are the people who will escort the president into the end of the chamber let's go to up here Thomas who covers justice issues and other things as well and Fiera I want to pick up on one thing that we've been exploring and that is the security of the vote in our elections I know that's you've done a lot of work on that what impact do you see the debacle in Iowa having and what are the main concerns that law enforcement has going forward in this election about the security of the vote well Terry even though the election coming up in 2020 will be handled by the individual states clearly what happened in Iowa yesterday in terms of how the Democrats handled it does not inspire confidence and to say the least and law enforcement continues to be concerned about protecting the election the the ballot box if you will just yesterday the Department of Homeland Security put out a notice to the states talking about the fact that the Russians will continue to likely try to attack the election they talked about how in 2016 the Russians actually were able to get inside the voter database of the state of Illinois and that they could have altered or changes changed some of the voter data they also talked about the fact the Russians had set up a fake website to put out fake stories posing as legitimate journalism so that is very much on the minds of law enforcement and in fact when I spoke with the FBI director in December he said that Russia was at it in the past and they'll be at it again and and as we were talking that the the mere vulnerability of the count to hacking is enough to a road trust and I want to ask you I've lived in England for five years and covered a few elections there they count 30 35 40 million ballots paper ballots by hand it takes a while it's probably not as accurate as a perfect and reliable software count would be but that's where we are right now how much how much esteem is there behind the movement for the United States to go back to paper ballots well you know I can't say that there's a lot the there is a lot of conversation about having backups to some of these computer systems there's some legislations that's been pending in the Congress that Democrats want the senator the Senate Majority Leader to act on that he is not leading to some to call him Moscow Mitch which he doesn't like very much so that is still even that Terry in our country is area of divide even though we know what happened in 2016 all right well we'll look at how that develops Pierre thanks very much let's let's step back for a moment and take a look at this moment this moment for Donald Trump and for the country and and let's get the take of someone who said through some of those speeches some of the State of the Union speeches Barbara Comstock is a former member of Congress from the state of Virginia Barbara what do you think of this moment for president Trump what do you expect well I think you always see you the State of the Union the president gets the end at attention and I was able to set out his agenda and really highlight his successes so I think you're gonna oh yes those the members they did so that's alright please go on well and he always really has stuck to a script on the State of the Union as most presidents do because you want to include all these successes he has the economy that he can has a lot of bragging rights on 63 percent approval on that economy the u.s. MCA a lot of opioid legislation where people have worked together on this and he didn't he has things like criminal justice reform and I think you're going to see a lot of the special guests that he has there today are going tonight are going to be addressing some of these bipartisan issues he has worked on so that's why I think you've heard the White House talk about it being low-key but I think it will also be an attempt to sort of reset the narrative and take advantage of what is not only a lot of good news for the president but a lot of bad news for the Democrats given the debacle in Iowa which obviously indoors to the president you know you know his his advantage and then also tomorrow will be the end of impeachment which like Bill Clinton impeachment has actually made them stronger and giving them his highest approval ratings now that's right yeah it is mirrors that impeach me a little bit we're looking at the chamber right now we see Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on the diets wearing white as do as are many of the Democratic women members of Congress take us in that room a little bit but the white is in honor of the suffragists movement and and perhaps the ER a as well take us in the room a little bit what's it like to be in their room it's actually smaller than it looks on television isn't it well it does it's an evening where it's very packed everyone is in there and so a lot of times you have Democrats and Republicans sitting next to each other you don't beyond you know your own side so you have people who are friends who will come together and then there's always who's gonna stand up for it you know and clap at certain points and that's why I think you know the president will gear a speech to really kind of forcing both sides to stand up and clap you know if you talk about the success of the economy if you talk about the work they've done together for our veterans or to battle opioids you're going to have to have the whole audience rides and I was there during the Obama administration as well as the Trump administration and I know that is sort of the script that a good speech writer will set out so that you find the ways to bring everyone together and you usually will see people do that and those who don't kind of look like you know sore sports right well bringing together is one of the things the president's can do from from the dads but we also know from the excerpts that the White House has released that he's got some some lines designed to divide and stoke the base that this one where he I've said it a couple times the United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not criminal aliens and he has everything capitalized and so should the socialism lines certainly that's going to be something that for the American public at home is going to be well-received you may have people and the Democrat side not want to stand up to it but actually some of those more socialist leaning members aren't even attending tonight in protest right exactly they have they've stayed back is Mary Bruce said Barbara thanks very much what a pickup on the immigration issue and go to Devin Dwyer Devin you were just out in Iowa talking to people up in northeastern Iowa I believe about the issue Donald Trump has changed the way people talk about it and you heard that yeah I sure did Terry this is an issue that doesn't always divide evenly along party lines as well northeast Iowa relies on immigrants for their economy like so many other parts of this country and even though it voted for Donald Trump by 29 points back in the election 2016 they were very concerned about the president's language they want the laws enforced but they want legal immigrants to and it sort of was an indicator of where the conversation is at on this issue so many people on both sides are frustrated they want some common sense as we see the Supreme Court justices that we were talking about earlier Terry coming into the chamber right now and so I think you're gonna see the president used this moment tonight to pivot to pivot away from immigration as Barbara was mentioning you're gonna see Democrats try to do the same thing this is a big audience for both parties 47 million people tuning in tonight Terry will hear a lot about health care and immigration to issues you're gonna hear a lot about headed into this campaign this fall all right thanks Devon I want to go to barn for some final thoughts here on on the person of Donald Trump the personality politicians tend to be they used to be about edition big inclusive stables get as many voters as you can but Donald Trump came to office with this deliberately divisive rhetoric what you expect from it I expect more of the same you know talking before me that there are things he can talk about that he's done well with that would grow the tent larger you know his his work with criminal justice reform and the Super Bowl yes with that just today I interviewed 50 cent fitty cent for a story I'm working on and he talked about criminal justice reform and and gave a nod to the President and States and so you would think there's there would be a way for him to lean into that to enlarge the tent but as you said that's not his tonton do you think he's doing that that criminal justice reform and that ad where there was black woman yes that got out of prison is he looking to take black voters away from the Democratic Party or is he sending a message to other voters to white voters I would tend to believe just based on people who I talk to around the country that it is it is the second right that it is an effort to show that see despite what people say about me look at look at what I've done but I think certainly many minority communities on a host of issues this president is not seen as someone who who who welcomes them into the not so far anyway well we are going to take a break when we come back you'll be on the network with George Stephanopoulos to see the president's State of the Union address the Congress the diplomatic corps the Supreme Court all assembled and the President of the United States will enter that chamber

Union and the Democratic response now reported in George Stephanopoulos good evening welcome to our special cover to the State of the Union these annual speech is always a moment of high political theater this year takes it to a brand new level the president about to enter a house chamber where just seven weeks ago he was impeached that has happened before Bill Clinton in 1999 but Trump is now the first president in American history to face reelection after impeachment this addressed the kickoff of his 2020 campaign he enters the chamber one day before senators would deliver the verdict in his impeachment trial acquittal is certain and one day after the chaos and confusion of Iowa's Democratic caucus as we come on the air tonight still no official winner but the results we have show Pete Buddha judge Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren all ahead of Joe Biden who for much of the last year had been polling best against President Trump and tonight the president's audience in the chamber even more split than we've come to expect Democrats like Nancy Pelosi you see her right there convinced Trump is a lawless president who betrayed his oath by inviting foreign interference in our elections congressional Republicans United behind him at least publicly many echoing the president's claim that he did nothing wrong in his dealings with Ukraine and all this against the backdrop of an economy growing for its 11th straight year the longest expansion in American history that plus overwhelming support from his GOP base has driven Trump's approval to the highest levels of his presidency so expect a buoyant speech tonight will news anchor David Muir is in Washington David we joined a group for lunch with the president earlier today he clearly believes he's in the driver's seat as we start this election year yeah really no question about that George fully aware of those poll numbers the Gallup number in particular nearing 50 percent that's an all-time high for this presidency we know the numbers drive this president aware at all times where the polls are also aware of the strong economy they'll talk about that quite a bit tonight the Dow hitting 29 thousand for the first time in recent weeks and as you pointed out George it's not the elephant in the room everyone in Washington aware that the president is on the eve of acquittal in the Senate and Pietschmann trial he has survived the impeachment hearings and the trial all eyes on the president but also all eyes tonight on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi not to tell you George after we met with the president which is a tradition to meet with presidents on the days of these addresses that goes back several administration's but we also met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who confirmed this afternoon but she has not spoken with President Trump since October 16th it's been months since those two have had a private conversation and here comes the sergeant-at-arms paul irving to announce the president [Music] the united states working his way up the are their national correspondent if the president is buoyant Democrats defiant we are now seeing the president coming face-to-face for the first time with these accusers in this impeachment process the body language alone here tonight is going to be fascinating there is a lot of tension in that room while it is not clear whether the president going to bring up impeachment it is clear that this is going to be a very awkward moment for many inside that chamber you mentioned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supposed to be over her shoulder throughout this entire speech having led her party in impeaching the president she now is effectively having to welcome him into her house and the president you know directly in his eyesight tonight will be those house managers who have been leading the case against the president in the Senate now Republicans that I have talked to here are urging the President to steer clear of the subject of impeachment entirely while Democrats are bracing for the president to take something of a victory lap and in fact roughly a dozen Democrats are simply sitting it out saying they don't want to dignify the president's actions with their presence here tonight hasn't there shaking the hand of Chief Justice John Roberts of course has been presiding over the Senate trial looking for what they were saying like their John Karl is in the chamber as well John and Johnny part because of impeachment this state of eating a little later than most years of music came right after that Iowa caucus yesterday the president reveling in that confusion he called it George an unmitigated disaster this morning but he is positively giddy about the chaos and the uncertainty among the Democrats while he has strengthened his grip on the Republican Party going into the campaign and make no mistake this above all will be let's see that encounter with the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi he will hand over the speaker and the vice president copy of his speech an extended hand from the speaker I'm not sure the president saw it or not but regardless they didn't show tax present me take this in for a few minutes to the first lady right there she's joining her box tonight rush limbaugh talked to her she seemed like their horse announced yesterday that he's fighting lung cancer members of Congress the President of the United States there you see a whole channel expect many times tonight put one side to be cheering yeah it'll be sitting and notice all that way in the room you know members of Congress during the surgery anymore think it's a political speech the chance of four more years the Madison Senate Republicans thank you very much madam speaker mr. vice president members of Congress the first lady of the United States my fellow citizens three years ago we launched the great American comeback tonight I stand before you to share the incredible results jobs our booming incomes are soaring poverty is plummeting crime is falling confidence is surging and our country is thriving and highly respected again America's enemies are on the run America's fortunes are on the rise in America's future is blazing bright the years of economic decay are over the days of our country being used taking advantage of and even scorned by other nations are long behind us you are the broken promises jobless recoveries tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth power and prestige in just three short years we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of Americans destiny we have totally rejected the downsizing we're moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never ever going back I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been our military is completely rebuilt with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world and it's not even close our borders are secure our families are flourishing our values are renewed our pride is restored and for all of these reasons I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress the state of our union is stronger than ever before the vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise from the instant I took office I moved rapidly to revive the US economy slashing a record number of job-killing regulations enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker pro-family pro-growth and most of all pro-american we are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race color religion and Creed very very high since my election we have created 7 million new jobs 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration the unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century and very incredibly the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any Administration in the history of our country if we hadn't grievers the failed economic policies of the previous administration the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success the unemployment rate for african-americans Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history african-american youth unemployment has reached an all-time low friction American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years and last year women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low the unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in US history a record number of young Americans are now employed under the last administration more than 10 million people were added to the Food Stamp rolls under my administration seven million Americans have come off food stamps and ten million people have been lifted off of welfare it eight years under the last administration over 300,000 working age people dropped out of the workforce in just three years of my administration 3.5 million people working age people have joined the workforce since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent three times faster than the increase for the top one percent after decades of flat and falling incomes wages are rising fast and wonderfully they are rising fastest for low-income workers who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election this is a blue-collar boom median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded since my election US stock markets have soared 70% adding more than 12 trillion dollars to our nation's wealth transcending anything anyone believed was possible this is a record it is something that every country in the world is looking up to they admire confidence has just reached amazing new highs all of those millions of people with 401ks and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60 70 80 90 and 100% and even more jobs and investments are pouring in to nine thousand previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones a plan spearheaded [Music] [Applause] in other words wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven't seen investment in many decades creating jobs energy and excitement this is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this it's all working Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran tony Rankin's from Cincinnati Ohio after struggling with drug addiction Tony lost his job his house and his family he was homeless but then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones he is now a top tradesman drug-free reunited with his family and he is here tonight Tony keep up the great work Tony thank you Tony our roaring economy has for the first time ever given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start the second chance of life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn't be done but I got it done and the people in this room got it done [Applause] thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign the United States has become the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world with the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years America is now energy independent and energy jobs like so many other elements of our country are at a record high we are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago likewise we are restoring our nation's manufacturing might even though predictions were as you all know that this could never ever be done after losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built companies are not believing they are coming back to the USA the fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is in the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is one of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal in fact unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for president following nafta's adoption our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs many politicians came and went pledging to change or replace NAFTA only to do so and then absolutely nothing happened but unlike so many who came before me I keep my promises we did our job six days ago i replaced nafta and signed the brand new US mexico canada agreement into law the u.s. MCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying american auto jobs and massively boost exports for our farmers ranchers and factory workers it will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity we will have that fairness and reciprocity and I say that finally because it's been many many years that we were treated fairly on trade this is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions also promised that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of America's jobs our strategy has worked days ago we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA [Applause] for decades China has taken advantage of the United States now we have changed that but at the same time we have perhaps the best relationship we've ever had with China including with President Xi they respect what we've done because quite frankly they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year decade after decade without someone in our country stepping up and saying that's enough [Applause] now we want to rebuild our country and that's exactly what we're doing we are rebuilding our country as we restore American leadership throughout the world we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere that's why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba we're supporting the hopes of Cubans Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to restore democracy the United States is leading a fifty nine nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro [Applause] a tyrant who brutalizes his people but medoras Gripen tyranny will be smashed and broken here this evening it's a very brave man who carries with him the hopes dreams and aspirations of all Venezuelans joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate president of Venezuela Juan Greedo [Applause] Thank You mr. president great honor thank you very much please take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom thank you very much mr. Faison thank you very much socialism destroys nations but always remember freedom unifies the soul to safeguard American liberty we have invested a record-breaking 2.2 trillion dollars in the United States military [Applause] we are purchased the finest planes missiles rocket ships and every other form of military equipment and it's all made right here in the USA we are also getting our allies finally to help pay their fair share I've raised contributions from other NATO members by more than four hundred billion dollars and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled and just weeks ago for the first time since President Truman established the air force more than seventy years earlier we created a brand new branch of the United States Armed Forces it's called the space force [Applause] in the gallery tonight we have a young gentleman and what he wants so badly 13 years old in lawn Faye he's an eighth grader from Arizona and please stand up ian has always dreamed of going to space he was the first of his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy he aspires to go to the Air Force Academy and then he has his eye on the space force as he and says most people look up at space I want to look down on the world but sitting behind Ian tonight is his greatest hero of them all Charles Magee was born in Cleveland Ohio one century ago Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen the first black fighter pilots and he also happens to be Ian's great-grandfather [Applause] credible story after more than 130 combat missions in World War two he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam on December 7th Charles celebrated his 100th birthday a few weeks ago assigned to build promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General and earlier today I pinned the stars on her shoulders in the Oval Office General McGee our nation salutes you thank you sir from the pilgrims to the founders from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future members of Congress we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people the people are the heart of our country their dreams are the soul of our country and their love is what powers and sustains our country we must always remember that our job is to put America first the next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American dream yet for too long countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools to rescue these students 18 states have created school choice in the form of opportunity scholarships the programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list one of those students is Jenaya davis a fourth grader from philadelphia Jenaya [Applause] denies mom stephanie is a single parent she would do anything to give her daughter a better future but last year that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children janea and Stephanie are in the gallery Stephanie thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter thank you very much but you die I have some good news for you because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over I can proudly announce tonight that an opportunity scholarship has become available it's going to you and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice now I call on Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity janilla has just received passed the education freedom scholarships and opportunities act because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow for this reason our magnificent first lady has launched the b-best initiative to advance a safe healthy supportive and drug-free life for the next generation online in school and in our communities Thank You Melania for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children thank you very much my administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background through our pledge to American workers over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans my budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation's high schools tonight I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America to expand equal opportunity I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation's historically black colleges and universities a good life for American families also requires the most affordable innovative and high quality health care system on earth before I took office health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years I move quickly to provide affordable alternatives our new plans are up to 60% less expensive and better I've also made an ironclad pledge to American families we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security always the American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills that is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency many experts believe that transparency which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year will be even bigger than health care reform it will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care but as we work to improve Americans health care there are those who want to take away your health care take away your doctor and abolish private insurance entirely 132 lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans to those watching at home tonight I want you to know we will never let socialism destroy American health care over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded health care to millions of illegal aliens forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who are lawfully crosses our borders these proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration that is what is happening in California and other states their systems are totally out of control costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money if forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free health care to illegal aliens sounds fair to you then stand with the radical left but if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government health care for illegal aliens this will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where as we speak a long tall and very powerful wall is being built [Applause] we have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time early next year we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed my administration has also taken on the big pharmaceutical companies we have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before and I was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years the cost of prescription drugs actually went down and working together Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels I've been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done and done quickly and properly I'm calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices get a bill on my desk and I will sign it into law immediately [Applause] [Applause] you think we are curving the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years among the states hardest hit Ohio is down 22% Pennsylvania is down 18% Wisconsin is down 10% and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all protecting Americans health also means fighting infectious diseases we are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the corona virus outbreak in China my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat we have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease Alzheimer's and those struggling with mental health and because Congress was so good as to fund my request new cures for childhood cancer and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness here tonight is a special man beloved by millions of Americans who just received a stage four advanced cancer diagnosis this is not good news but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet rush limbaugh thank you [Applause] and rush in recognition of all that you have done for our nation the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor the Presidential Medal of Freedom I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor please [Applause] [Music] [Applause] congratulations Thank You Katherine as we pray for all who are sick we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs in 2017 doctors at st. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive born adjust 21 weeks in six days and weighing less than a pound ellie schneider was a born fighter through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents little ellie kept on winning the battle of life today ellie is a strong healthy two-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother robin in the gallery ellie and robin we're glad to have you with us tonight Kelly reminds us that every child is a miracle of life and thanks to modern medical wonders 50% of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survived it's an incredible thing thank you very much every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie that is why I'm asking Congress to provide an additional 50 million dollars to fund neonatal research for America's youngest patients that is why I'm also calling upon members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late term abortion baby whether we're Republican Democrat or independent surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God as we support America's moms and dads I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave serving as a model for the rest of the country now I call on Congress to pass the bipartisan advancing support for working families Act extending Family Leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation 40 million American families have an average 2200 dollars extra thanks to our child tax credit I've also overseen historic funding increases for high quality childcare enabling 17 states to help more children many of which have reduced or eliminated their wait lists altogether and i said congress have planned with a vision to further expand access to high quality childcare and urge you to act immediately to protect the environment days ago I announced that the United States will join the 1 trillion trees initiative an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world we must also rebuild America's infrastructure I asked you to pass senator John Burroughs highway bill to invest in new roads bridges and tunnels all across our land I'm also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed Internet including and especially in rural America be better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe that means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level including our nation's heroic ice officers [Applause] last year our brave vice officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries 5,000 sexual assaults 45,000 violent assaults and 2,000 murders tragically there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens in sanctuary cities local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ice to be safely removed just 29 days ago a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92 year old woman the killer had been previously arrested for assault but under New York sanctuary policies he was set free if the city had honored ices detainer request his victim would still be alive today the state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a stationary for criminal illegal immigrants a very terrible sanctuary with catastrophic results here is just one tragic example in December 2018 California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests including convictions for robbery and assault but as required by California's sanctuary law local authorities released him days later the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence he viciously shot one man going about his daily work he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest he walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon he hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles critically injuring innocent victims one of the victims is a terrible terrible situation died fifty one-year-old American named rocky Jones rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range murdering him in cold blood rocky left behind a devoted family including his brothers who loved him more than anything else in the world one of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight Jodie would you please stand Jodie thank you Jodee our hearts we fear loss and we will not rest until you have justice Senator Tom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt [Applause] I asked Congress to pass the justice for victims of sanctuary cities act immediately the United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not criminal aliens in the last three years Isis arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers and I have sided nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the Menace of human trafficking domestically and all around the globe my administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States before I came into office if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested you were simply released and allowed into our country never to be seen again my administration has ended catch and release if you come illegally you will now be promptly removed from our country very importantly we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala as a result of our unprecedented efforts illegal crossings are down 75% since May dropping eight straight months in a row and as the wall rapidly goes up drug seizures rise and the border crossings are going down and going down very rapidly last year I traveled to the border in Texas and met chief patrol agent Raul Ortiz 44 months agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers and rescued more than 2,000 migrants days ago agent Ortiz was promoted to deputy chief of Border Patrol and he joins us tonight chief Ortiz please stand a grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of border patrol and ice thank you very much these historic gains we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit welcoming those who follow the rules contribute to our economy support themselves financially and uphold our values with every action my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Thank You Mitch his colleagues in the Senate we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written this includes two brilliant new Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh thank you and we have many in the pipeline [Applause] my administration is also defending religious liberty and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools in America we don't punish prayer we don't tear down crosses we don't ban symbols of faith we don't muzzle preachers and pastors in America we celebrate faith we cherish religion we lift our voices in prayer and we raise our sights to the glory of God just as we believe in the First Amendment we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country so long as I am president I will always protect your Second Amendment right in reaffirming our heritage as a free nation we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation now we must embrace the next frontier America's manifest destiny and the Stars I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts using this as a launching pad to ensure [Applause] my administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism last week I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians recognizing that all past attempts have failed we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future three years ago the barbarians of Isis held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria today the ISIS territorial Caliphate has been 100% destroyed and the founder and leader of Isis the bloodthirsty killer known as al Baghdadi is dead we are joined this evening by Carl and Marcia Muller after graduating from college their beautiful daughter Kyla became a humanitarian aid worker she once wrote some people find God in church some people find God in nature some people find God in love I find God and suffering I've known for some time what my life's work is using my hands as tools to relieve suffering in 2013 while caring for suffering civilians in Syria Kayla was kidnapped tortured and enslaved by Isis and kept as a prisoner of al Baghdadi himself after more than 500 horrifying days of captivity al Baghdady murdered young beautiful Kayla she was just 26 years old on the night that US Special Forces operations ended al Baghdadi's miserable life the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general mark Milley received a call in the Situation Room he was told that the brave men of the elite special forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name Task Force 8:14 it was a reference to a special day August 14th Kayla's birthday Carl and Marcia America's warriors never forgot Kayla and neither will we every day America's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart one of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher hake on his second deployment to Iraq in 2008 sergeant hake wrote a letter to his one-year-old son gage I will be with you again he wrote to gage I will teach you to ride your first bike build your first sandbox watch you play sports and see you have kids also I love you son take care of your mother I am always with you daddy on Easter Sunday of 2008 Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb that night he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country sergeant Hank now rests in eternal glory in Arlington and his wife Kelly is in the gallery tonight joined by their son who is now a 13 year old and doing very very well - Kelly engage Chris will live in our hearts forever he's looking down on you now thank you thank you very much thank you both very much the terror is responsible for killing sergeant hake was Kassim Soleimani who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chrissy's life Salamone was the Iranian regime's most ruthless butcher a monster who murder or wounded thousands of American servicemembers in Iraq as the world's top terrorists allamani orchestrated the deaths of countless men women and children he directed the December Dussault and went on to assault the US forces in Iraq was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard and that's why last month at my direction the US military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Salamone and terminated his evil reign of terror forever our message to the terrorists is there you will never escape American justice if you attack our citizens you forfeit your life in recent months we have seen proud Iranian 'he's raised their voices against their oppressive rulers the Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons stop spreading terror death and destruction and start working for the good of its own people because of our powerful sanctions the Iranian economy is doing very very poorly we can help them make a very good and short time recovery it can all go very quickly but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help we are here let's see which road they choose it is totally up to them as we defend American lives we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East in Afghanistan the determination and valor of our war fighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress in peace talks are now under way I am NOT looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan many of them totally innocent it is also not our function to serve other nations as law-enforcement agencies these are war fighters that we have the best in the world and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all we are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home war places a heavy burden on our nation's extraordinary military families especially spouses like amy Williams from Fort Bragg North Carolina and her two children six-year-old Ileana and three-year-old Rowan Amy works full-time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families for the past seven months she has done it all while her husband sergeant first class Townsend Williams is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East Amy's kids haven't seen their fathers face in many months Amy your family sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and a peace and we want to thank you thank you Amy good Amy there is one more thing tonight we have a very special surprise I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment he is here with us tonight [Applause] welcome home sergeant Williams thank you very much as the world bears witness tonight America is a land of heroes this is a place where greatness is born where destinies are forged and where legends come to life this is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt of many great generals including Washington Pershing Patton and MacArthur this is the home of Abraham Lincoln Frederick Douglass Amelia Earhart Harriet Tubman the Wright brothers Neil Armstrong and so many more this is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp Davy Crockett and Annie Oakley this is the place where the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas Patriots made their last stand at the Alamo the beautiful beautiful Alamo the American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest strongest fiercest and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the earth our ancestors braved the unknown tamed the wilderness settled the Wild West lifted millions from poverty disease and hunger vanquished tyranny and fascism achieved the world to new heights of science and medicine laid down the railroads dug out the canals raised up the skyscrapers and ladies and gentlemen our ancestors built the most exceptional Republic ever to exist in all of human history and we are making it greater than ever before this is glorious and magnificent inheritance we are Americans we are pioneers we are the Pathfinders we settle the new world we built the modern world and we change history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God America is the place where anything can happen America is the place where anyone can rise and here on this land on this soil on this continent the most incredible dreams come true this nation is our canvas and this country is our masterpiece we look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored our brightest discoveries are not yet known our most thrilling stories are not yet told our grandest journeys are not yet made the American age the American epic the American adventure has only just begun our spirit is still young the Sun is still rising God's grace is still shining and my fellow Americans the best is yet to come [Applause] in terms election-year state of the union ends on an optimistic note sort of the applause right there he came out of reality television and he displayed that talent tonight 78 minute extravaganza tough to emotions both high and low over there 778 minutes and began with a double small bear President Trump refused the hand of Speaker Pelosi she refused the state was her high honor indistinct privileges because usually due to introduce the president United States then a ringing declaration from the president the state of Union is stronger than ever before and a litany of economic good news that you can't deny a president who has the good fortune to be in charge when that economic good news is being shared by so many Americans reached out to the African American community in an emotional way you hearing get the praise there from Republican members of Congress introducing one of the Tuskegee Airmen and its great-grandson who wants to be an astronaut there were also gut punches at Democrats on health care and illegal immigration something you've never seen before a Congressional Medal of Honor given out during the State of the Union for rush limbaugh the talk radio is that's certain to be a controversial move and something else we've seen on reality TV on warning television I know it well a family reunion American servicemen coming home to greet his family as I said so many emotions touched Jon Karl you were in the chamber George this is the 11th time I've been in the chamber for a State of the Union address three different presidents I have never seen anything like this there were the high moments certainly with Charles McGee that Tuskegee Airmen that unified the chamber but this was the most partisan and divided chamber I have ever seen for a State of the Union even exceeding Trump a year ago I don't know if you noticed this but just after the president finished his speech Nancy Pelosi somewhat dramatically toured the speech up behind him as he came into this chamber none of the Democratic side applauded that's a standard thing everybody applauds when the president comes and that did not happen here and when the speech was over the Democrats ran for the exits you know usually you see the president's the first to leave the chamber the Democratic side was almost completely empty by the time he worked his way to to where he is now and George also the other moment that stands out chance of four more years the Republican side is the Democrats often booed and groan during the speech we had that moment towards the beginning where the president actually was greeted with a chance of four more years from the Republican side again something I've just I've never seen in the state of the union's the president and president has left the chamber Democratic response in just a couple of minutes to be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the state of the union and the Democratic response here again George Stephanopoulos and we are back after president Trump's 2020 State of the Union as we said 78 minutes where the president laid out his agenda for re-election also hits some cords of emotion and did something as we said it has never been done before giving the Presidential Medal of Freedom during the State of the Union address senior White House correspondent SIA Vega is here with us that is getting a lot of attention online yeah because it appears that this was a completely unprecedented move that just happened and they're awarding that Presidential Medal of Freedom not just in the chamber but to someone as controversial and divisive in this country as Rush Limbaugh who whose past comments on race whose past comments and women are already making the rounds on Twitter people are many offended by this but you heard those applause inside that chamber George the Republicans in there see Rush as a very strong person in their party and they were happy to see the thing he has been a strong supporter of President Trump as well we were waiting now for the Democratic response we given by the governor of Michigan Gretchen Whitmer the governor of Michigan should be speaking from high school cafeteria in East Lansing Michigan who two daughters attend the school good evening I'm honored to be here and grateful that you're tuning in I'm Gretchen Whitmer the 49th governor of the great state of Michigan tonight I met my daughter sherry in Sydney's public school East Lansing high school we're here today with families and parents teachers and most importantly students I want to thank you all for coming but tonight I'm gonna talk to those of you who are watching at home I'd need a lot more than 10 minutes to respond to what the president just said so instead of talking about what he is saying I'm going to highlight what Democrats are doing after all you can listen to what someone says but to know the truth watch what they do Michiganders are no different from Americans everywhere we love our families and want a good life today and a better life tomorrow for our kids we work hard and we expect our government to work hard for us as well we have grit and value loyalty and we still root for the Detroit lines we and all Americans might be weary of today's politics but we must stay engaged our country our democracy our future demanded we're capable of great things when we work together we cannot forget that despite the dishonesty and division of the last few years and that we heard tonight from the President of the United States together we have boundless potential and young Americans are proving that every day by taking action that's what I want to focus on tonight Monni Scott is 13 years old and lives in Muskegon Heights Michigan Monte Street was covered in potholes they were ankle-deep and he got tired of waiting for them to get fixed so he grabbed a shovel and a bucket of dirt and filled them in himself during my campaign people told me to fix the damn roads because blown tires and broken windshields are downright dangerous and car repairs take money from rent childcare or groceries and we the Democrats are doing something about it in Illinois governor JB Pritzker passed a multi-billion dollar plan to rebuild their roads and bridges Governor Phil Murphy is replacing lead pipes in New Jersey all across the country Democratic leaders are rebuilding bridges fixing roads expanding broadband and cleaning up drinking water everyone in this country benefits when we invest in infrastructure congressional Democrats have presented proposals to keep us moving forward but President Trump and the Republicans in the Senate are blocking the path when it comes to infrastructure money has tried to do more with a shovel and a pile of dirt than the Republicans in DC have with the Oval Office and the US Senate bullying people on Twitter doesn't fix bridges it burns them our energy should be used to solve problems and it's true for health care too for me for so many Americans health care is personal not political when I was 30 I became a member of the Sandwich Generation that means I was sandwiched between two generations of my own family for whom I was the primary caregiver I was holding down a new job caring for my newborn daughter as well as my mom at the end of her brain cancer battle I was up all night with a baby and during the day I had to fight my mom's insurance company when they wrongly denied her coverage for chemotherapy it was hard it exposed the harsh realities of our workplaces our healthcare system and our childcare system and it changed me I lost patience for people who are just talk and no action so as a state senator I worked with a Republican governor and legislature to expand health care coverage to more than 600 80,000 Michiganders under the Affordable Care Act today Democrats from Maine to Montana are expanding coverage and lowering costs in Kansas governor Laura Kelley's working across to bring Medicaid coverage to tens of thousands in New Mexico governor michelle lujan-grisham enshrined ACA protections into law every Democrat running for president has a plan to expand health care for all Americans every one of them has supported the Affordable Care Act with coverage for people with pre-existing conditions they may have different plans but the goal is the same president Trump sadly has a different plan he's asking the courts to rip those life-saving protections away it's pretty simple Democrats are trying to make your health care better Republicans in Washington are trying to take it away think about kids like 17 year old Blake Carroll from Idaho who organized a fundraiser to pay for his mom's colon cancer treatment for 19 year old Ebony Meyers from Utah who sells art to help pay for her own rare genetic disorder treatment no one should have to crowdsource their health care not in America but the reality is not everyone in America has a job with health care and benefits in fact many have jobs that don't even pay enough to cover their monthly expenses it doesn't matter what the president says about the stock market what matters is that millions of people struggle to get by or don't have enough money at the end of the month after paying for transportation student loans or prescription drugs American workers are hurting in my own state our neighbors in Wisconsin and Ohio Pennsylvania all over the country wages have stagnated while CEO pay has skyrocketed so when the president says the economy is strong my question is strong for home strong for the wealthy who are reaping rewards from tax cuts they don't need the American economy needs to be a different kind of strong strong for the science teacher spending her own money to buy supplies for her classroom strong for the single mom picking up extra hours so she can afford her daughter's soccer cleats strong for the small business owner who has to make payroll at the end of the month Michigan invented the middle class so we know if the economy doesn't work for working people it just doesn't work who fights for working hardworking Americans Democrats do in the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats pass a landmark bill on equal pay another bill to give 30 million Americans are raised by increasing the minimum wage and groundbreaking legislation to finally give Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices for America's seniors and families those three bills and more than 275 other bipartisan bills are just gathering dust on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's desk Senator McConnell America needs you to move those bills meanwhile Democrats across the country are getting things done Pennsylvania's Governor Tom wolf is expanding the right to overtime pay Michigan is too because if you're on the clock you deserve to get paid Nevada Governor Steves to select North Carolina governor Roy Cooper are working to give hard-working teachers a raise and speaking of the classroom wisconsin Governor Tony eavers unilaterally increased school funding by 65 million dollars last year in Colorado governor jared Polis have an active free all-day kindergarten and in 29 states we've helped pass minimum wage hikes into law which will lift people out of poverty and improve lives for families that's strength that's action democracy takes action and that's why I'm so inspired by young people they respond to mass shootings demanding policies that make schools safer they react to a world that's literally on fire with fire in their bellies to push leaders to finally take action on climate change they take on a road filled with potholes with a shovel and some dirt it's what gives me great confidence in our future and it's why sometimes it feels like they're the dolf's in the room but it shouldn't have to be that way it's not their mess to clean up it's ours the choices we make today create their reality tomorrow young people I'm talking to you and your parents and grandparents Democrats want Safe Schools we want everyone to have a path to a good life whether it's through a union apprenticeship a community college a four-year university without drowning in debt we want your water to be clean we want you to love who you love and to live authentically as your true selves and we want women to have autonomy over our bodies we want our country welcoming and everyone's vote counted 2020 is a big year it's the year my daughter Sheri will graduate from high school it's also the year she'll cast her first ballot along with millions of young Americans the two things are connected because walking across a graduation stage is as important as walking into the voting booth for the first time her future all our kids futures will be determined not just by their dreams but by our actions as we witness the impeachment process in Washington there are some things each of us no matter our party should demand the truth matters facts matter and no one should be above the law it's not what those senators say tomorrow it's about what they do that matters remember listen to what people say but watch what they do it's time for action generations of Americans are counting on us let's not let them down thank you for listening god bless america good night Democratic response sir from the governor of Michigan Gretchen Widmer talking about what Democrats are doing all across the country one of basically two Democratic responses tonight perhaps the first one Nancy Pelosi ripping up the President's speech at the end and then this 10-minute address from Governor Whitmer right there Matthew data I grew up in Michigan pretty clear from her comments right there that health care is gonna be at the heart of this campaign yeah and we still do root for the Lions even though that's a long suffering I mean the thing about anything about me and both the speeches the president State of the Union address and that speech is there addressed on the same issues the economy and healthcare to the same people 10,000 11,000 people in Michigan that voted and caused the president to win associated with the number that people that approve of the President on the economy but disapprove them personally if 10% of the country that they're both sides are going for on those to spend you saw her go after the president personally there at the end in order to undercut him personally but not let him take credit for the economy let me go back to Mary brew senior congressional correspondent Capitol Hill a little more from speaker Pelosi after she walked out George we were just able to catch up with the speaker and she was asked by reporters why she ripped up the president's speech and she said because it was quote the courteous thing to do considering the alternative she said it was such a dirty speech the reaction from Democrats here leaving the chamber has been that they feel that they just attended a Trump campaign rally one top Democrat saying who's just at a mago rally and there is no question this was a much more political in the tone and tenor than your usual State of the Union address that was clear from the chants straight off the bat of four more years if there was ever any doubt about whether this is Donald Trump's Republican Party I think that was solidified tonight when it became very clear throughout the Republicans are completely behind this president even though of course George over recent days we have seen a few of them a growing number come out and say that while not impeachable they do feel that the president's actions with regard to Ukraine were not right and were not appropriate but the reaction from Democrats here overwhelming is that they feel that Donald Trump is simply launching into his fall campaign here George no question about that David Muir the disdain between Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi mutual and palpable yeah really striking George that moment when she ripped up the script as half of the chamber was applauding the president after a State of the Union was really something and that's going to be certainly talked about debated for the hours and days to come after this I have to tell you not only did we meet with President Trump today for that off-the-record lunch that we typically have with you know administration's dating back that several of them we also met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and I did ask her would she be willing in this final year of the first term to actually talk with President Trump to seek some sort of compromise on infrastructure prescription drug prices which she has talked about Senator Schumer has talked about she hesitated but eventually said she would be willing to talk with him it acknowledged that she hasn't talked with him since October 16th but I have to say George after watching that moment it's hard to imagine either one of them being willing to talk with one another doesn't look like it's gonna come anytime soon okay we're gonna take another quick break we'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is that are you than a me Jonas at the Gunners woman Veronica Escobar no paso giving the Democratic response in Spanish tonight let's talk about the night now with our political panel here with Chris Christie Evette Simpson Rahm Emanuel and Chris let me begin with you what's your impression listen the Democrats saw tonight what they're gonna be up against for the next ten months that's not all Trump at his best he was disciplined as many times as they booed and heckled he didn't respond which we've seen him do before on a number of occasions the very beginning that chamber right but I mean you know he looked at them he watched what they were doing he stayed disability stayed on his speech we were following along with the text there were very few deviations from the text and he laid out his argument and he landed out strongly and clearly and directly and there'll be all kinds of people quibbling back and forth about things that's the nature of politics today but I the president gets an a-plus tonight because if I heard this say it's a political speech of course it's a political speech it's a beginning right no but there was some good John that's it Karl in the beginning we feel a little critical about the idea that you know was more political than he's ever seen well I've watched a lot of first term presidents give this speech and it's always very political and this was political tonight but I think the president made his case and I think Democrats saw the kind of campaigner they're gonna run against this time which is different than last I think John's point was more about the partisan environment in that in the chamber but I take your point as well in that sense it was hard to mistake you know especially towards the beginning of the president's strong outreach towards the African and community for the first section of the speech you know he knows he's doing really really poorly with african-americans he's going at it but I will tell you that that rush limbaugh recognition probably undercut the entire thing i mean when you think about what rush limbaugh has meant for with his racist rhetoric i mean i feel like he gives with one hand and he takes with another you honor it's Tuskegee Airmen and the you honor Rush Limbaugh like that juxtaposition isn't lost on people it is Black History Month and I think it was probably right of him to recognize the history of african-americans in this country but when you honor someone like Rush Limbaugh right after honoring someone who risked his life to fight for this country I think african-americans know better and Robin was pretty clear the president where the president thinks these Democrats vulnerabilities are going into 2020 the word socialism Medicare for all health care for illegal immigrants yes yes yes you got it I mean here's the thing what's he gonna turn the page and look to the future give people a sense that the country was on the move and look I'm not a supporter obviously there's an effective speech and of course it's political I've never worked on nine state of the union's every one of them regardless of where they come in the presidency our political speeches they set out the agenda they said what you're accomplishing are and they honor America's spirit and this character he did that now I do think there are things that he's done like Rush Limbaugh that are gonna actually work against that grain but in the end of the day when you look at the people the honor outside of Rush Limbaugh you look at some of the policies he talked about going forward which were more bipartisan on child tax credit occasional education infrastructure bill you go down the planting trees you go down the list it was let's work together and he didn't is I think Chris is exactly right he didn't take the bait and he talked about in a country on the move for his goal it's a b-plus a month America tonight he understands where his weaknesses are in those collar counties in Pennsylvania and some of the suburbs in Michigan and Wisconsin that's what he needed to do tonight he did it the question will be going for think everybody's thinking the appeal let's say the african-american or women it's not for those groups is actually for his voters to feel comfortable with how he is doing not that he's going to go from four percent of the african-american vote to eight or something like that by saying that this is a more generous person but he actually has been all year fundamental it was a speech designed to get 51% of the vote when you look at that speech it was designed not to get 60% of out and rally the country behind him in a unifying way bring the country to get was to get 51% of the vote and the question I think that Chris was just raising is he did it for 78 minutes he did a pretty good job for 78 minutes can he do it for the next 78 days let alone the next 10 months at this stage he can't give a 60 percent speech when Nancy Pelosi stands there and rips up the speech and you have members on the Democratic side looking down paying no attention give this you can't bring 60 Americans I disagree with that I there's things he could talk about that would bring the country together they may not go together that's where he has brought Congress together mentioned it briefly was criminal justice reform our senior just course when a Pierre Thomas that is this was the president considered his signature bipartisan accomplishment last year he did indeed and that's an area where you see Democrats and Republicans in strong favor of doing more to make the criminal justice system more fair but George I must say that the divisions here were stark seeing that African American general who was honored by the president tonight and then having Rush Limbaugh on it in the same way was just another reminder of just how divided the country truly is no question about that well the the Trump campaign believes firmly that they can make some inroads in the african-american community in this upcoming election you saw that with criminal justice reform you saw that with school choice but to me that's point eight and eight out of ten black Americans believe that the president has racist nine out of ten are not happy with his job performance they've got a long way to go on this issue before we go I do want to talk a little foreign policy Martha Raddatz our chief global affairs anchor also your president put that towards the end of this each talking about the successes against Isis the killings about Baghdadi and general Soleimani their onion and what seemed like what could be maybe a half-hearted outreach hand to the Iranians a half-hearted attempt to reach out to the Iranians which I doubt will work at all because the Iranians including the Ayatollah have already said they will not negotiate with Donald Trump as Arif their foreign minister says he does not trust Donald Trump so there will be no negotiations George but this speech was really larger than anything he said about foreign policy as you know he didn't mention North Korea at all and that that could be a real problem for him in the coming years but this really was a gift to Republicans it was Donald Trump measured weaving an incredible story with a lot of heroes involved it was that was very skillfully done there is no question about that Martha thanks very much gonna take another quick break we'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] at that crime once set bunny show all the time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
