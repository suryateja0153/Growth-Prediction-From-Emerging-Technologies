uh thank you to our wonderful panelists who i will introduce in a moment and thank you to all of you who are attending at home uh we really um appreciate your interest in the the webinar and hope we can share some useful information and a conversation in the round table today so i'm uh it's my privilege to introduce this group of four incredible panelists i'm mostly going to let folks introduce themselves because i want the audience to get a sense of the speakers and their work in this arena but briefly i will introduce folks we have first jemele lundy he is the committee administrator for the public safety and criminal justice reform committee at the minnesota house second we'll have marquita stephen she is the director of education programs and policy at urban league twin cities third we'll hear from aluchiomyoga who's the co-founder of black visions collective uh and last and certainly not least we will have council vice president andrea jenkins from the minneapolis city council so jamel if you could spend just a couple of minutes introducing yourself and telling the audience a little bit about your work in this area that would be terrific sorry let me get this unmuted very quickly um hello my name is you just heard i'm the committee administrator for the public safety and criminal justice reform committee um i'll try to keep my um my statements kind of within um and i'm sorry i also work with the naacp on the transitional reform committee with dr raj i'm trying to keep my statements kind of within the general gist of um what members have expressed publicly and with the direction my chair is looking ahead in the upcoming session um the work that we uh the work that um the state legislature took on specifically myself and chair mariana who is the chair of the public safety and criminal justice reform committee involved looking at the broader systemic and i would also say kind of the state level response to the um death of george floyd but also the ongoing um police brutality um that we've seen throughout not only the state of the nation knowing the nation kind of the world um and we've um in our work um reached out to a whole series of folks obviously we are continuous communication with the administration who had to respond to kind of the uprisings that uh followed the death of kasara the killing of george floyd and the um we also reached out to other academics and professionals to try to craft and sorry and community leaders as well try to craft a set of uh bills that we thought could um the criteria that we would what we were looking for is a um set of bills that work together to prevent um an incident like this from ever occurring again um and uh for that reason um we put together a package that we call the minnesota police accountability act uh it won't go through the full act but essentially it had three different components three different packages of bills um one did the reclaiming community oversight act um which really looked at a regulatory compliance and civil litigation uh there is the um the reforming accountability act which really looked at criminal accountability and lastly the reimagining public safety act which kind of looked at restructuring larger policy uh infrastructure of policing and of looking at the kind of the governance model of policing and generally um and i think those those big acts containing several bills um all looked at the problem systemically and i i'd love to kind of discuss it further as we get into the questions terrific thank you very much i'll turn it over to marquita then good afternoon everyone and glad you were here i'm marquita stevens the director of education programming and policy at the urban league twin cities my remarks primarily will center around the research that we did in conjunction with the naacp's on a project last year funded by the leadership conference and we looked at the attitudes and perspectives of african americans primarily in minneapolis about the minneapolis police and we pin that and i'll share some of those results with you my own experience also stems from the role as a facilitator in the conversations between the citizenry of rose rio and the police and city departments right after the philando castile murder a few years ago and that was informed in part by a briefing that i received at in ferguson after the michael brown killing as well so that's the lens through which i'll be speaking today terrific thank you oluchi hey y'all my name is lucci i use any pronouns um i think it is important to say that i'm black i'm queer i'm trans um because i am everyone who has come before me um i'm a community organizer i think it's important when we're talking about conversations around policing and systems change that uh we bring it to uh an academic level um and i'm bringing my community with me as far as the conversations that i'm gonna talk about i've been organizing um for eight years since the uh the beginning of the black lives matter movement i really got activated um in what was going on in minneapolis at that time um i also uh was one of the folks who were integral into the fourth precinct shutdown in 2015 after the murder of jamar clark um and also the occupation of the governor's mansion when philando castile uh was killed um i'm one of the co-founders of black visions um which is an organization that's centered and led by black queer and trans minnesotans um mainly youth um towards the liberation of our people um yeah and i totally look better than i do in my um photo that everyone loves to use so just so you all know i am a better looking person than in that picture and i'll pass it on to the next person okay and with that if i can hand the mic over to council vice president jenkins thank you so much michelle and and thank you for inviting me to be a part of this conversation um and i just gotta state that um i think that photo of you oh g is hot in fact i was uh thinking that before you said that i'm like wow i love the jacket i like the little hair thing that's kind of sticking out on the side but um so i just wanted to to claim that um andrea jenkins minneapolis city uh council member vice president of the minneapolis city council you see her and her pronouns i too am black trans queer and very proud um and so bringing my ancestors to this conversation because they dreamed that we would be in this um in these roles that we occupy in society now um and shaping the way the ways and um the the structures that can support uh black liberation and so um you know right now we are in the midst of a very uh intense um budget conversation around how we um reimagine and implement um reimagined public safety strategies but i want to emphasize that um you know we we can shift how public safety works in our culture and society but we also have to shift all the other institutions around how we function in our culture and society we have to root out the the racism that is inherent at the state legislature we have to root out the uh racism that is inherent in the philanthropic um uh systems that that support the non-profit industrial complex we have to root out the the racism and the foundations of slavery that underpin institutions like the university of minnesota in almost every single academic uh institution in our nation and so you know it's uh it took us a long time to get to this place um it it can't take 400 years for us to to overcome it but it also is not going to happen overnight and i think you know historically since african americans landed on these shores in 1619 we have been building towards a more righteous more just society the the challenge is that is as as we have been working towards that black liberation there has been obstacles and opposition to that work that has been significant and well-funded and very pernicious uh in its quest to keep black and brown communities oppressed well thank you so much everybody for those powerful introductions and for joining us today so i'd like to start with a series of questions directed towards each panelist and then transition into a broader discussion with the group and so oluci i thought i might direct the the first conversation to you um you know as jamelle mentioned in his conversation and his introduction you know we're here obviously because of the police killing of george floyd and the massive mobilization of community members over the summer and the efforts to reimagine or transform or abolish or to fund policing in minneapolis and so i thought we might start grounded in that community mobilization which black visions has been such a key part of the summer and of course going back many many years since the start of the the black lives matter movement and the the start of um all of these groups and coalitions around transforming public safety in minneapolis that have emerged in the last couple of years and so i thought what might make sense to sort of ground our conversation in the most recent development of um activist demands is around the development of the people's budget and so i wondered if you might talk a bit about where that idea came from and what it's calling for yeah that's a good question thank you for that um yeah so the people's budget was really our way of trying to do participatory budgeting um in a six-week time period which was very hard to do right um so it's really around like how are we as the constituents of minneapolis coming together to talk about what are the budgetary priorities for our city right um so the people's budget came together with um about four different listening sessions with over a hundred different individuals and organizations that um live in work and play in minneapolis to really accumulate and say let's vision um of minneapolis in which we have the autonomy of deciding where our money goes right um and where our money goes where it's not killing us um so what are some alternatives that we want to invest in what are some programs what is the art that is necessary for us to not just survive but thrive for us to be able to put health first to be able to fund um notable alternatives um that actually work right because we know that if we if we actually fund prevention then we don't have to re fund response and we also know that the police or the minneapolis police department doesn't actually prevent anything they don't prevent anything right um so how do we prevent how are we funding prevention and not um response i mean the third thing is like how are we actually understanding that all of these issues that we're having can stem from anti-black racism can stem from capitalism right can't stem from patriarchy and how are we actually um utilizing and funding economic solutions as well we are in the middle of a pandemic in which millions of americans are below the poverty line they have been before and now they are we have houseless people we have encampments all over minneapolis um so when we take a look and we say wow instead of funding housing we're going to fund what we'd like to say is public safety but when we know isn't public safety that's that's that's cognitive dissonance right that is not that is not actually equitable um so what the people's budget was this was our way of trying to do participatory budgeting on a smaller scale and say hey this is actually what the people of minneapolis want um and this is actually what's going to what's going to get us to thrive and not just survive in in our society now terrific thank you and i really appreciate how concise you are that was impressive um terrific so i was going to turn the mic next to marquita and you know i had originally thought about this question in terms of what's been happening in among north minneapolis residents over the last couple of months so there's been some pushback in north minneapolis um to the declaration from the um powderhorn park event to end the mpd including a lawsuit from um eight citizens who says that the city is not protecting them adequately and so i was gonna ask what is your sense from those conversations that you've been having this summer with community about northsider's priorities for police reform and policing transformation and i guess i'll open that up a bit to say you know you had also done this earlier research with naacp and so if you want to sort of start there and then kind of walk us through forward that would be terrific marquita you're still muted thank you for the question i have to say though that as i think about the question i have to my mind centers on the fact that not much has changed in terms of the residents um perspectives about policing the same things that were troublesome you know in 2019 are troublesome in 2020 which are troublesome in 2010 which were troublesome in 1974. i mean it it's the events of the day have not done much to advance um the perspectives about policing on the part of african americans our research says that their um one of the things that is claims the attention in terms of reform is better relationships between police and the community that hasn't changed you know people want better relationships with the police within the community the other items that are concerned to them is that police receive adequate training and address racial bias that hasn't changed people still believe that racial bias within the police force exists and it's directed at them that hasn't changed um they think about the lack of accountability and transparency on the part of policing and are awaiting the progress of and watching the progress of the um case against the officers charged in the floyd murder um with baited breath as they say um so there's nothing much that has changed in terms of the events it's just another event and interestingly enough though i will add that one of the things that they were concerned about which is a reflection of the um reality that they see this occurring in and that is mental health services not only for the public at large that needs them those those individuals among our citizenry that need that but for the police as well there was some recognition on the part of the people who participated in the survey and focus groups that policing is a difficult job and that it is um stressful and that um dealing with these um very um uh life-threatening in some instances situations on a regular basis can create mental health issues for the police as well and they're concerned their concern is as to the extent to which those issues are attended to on the part of the police department for if it is in fact not attended to on a regular basis weekly or what have you then that frustration is my is maybe the source of their inability to have good relationships with the community at large um they bring that unresolved trauma that they have to the situations that they're facing as well so there was a recognition and i think that is the only new thing that we found out of the um conversations with people that there is a recognition of that fact nonetheless it doesn't um let them off the hook that it is something that they have to attend to within their own ranks within their own structures um such that they are fit to serve the community that they have sworn to protect terrific thank you very much so i wanted to to turn next to council vice president and andrea jenkins and um to sort of have you respond to you know as we've been talking about already in this conversation i think and as we heard a lot last night at the hearing the community has really different ideas about the path forward with policing right and there's there's calls for defunding the police there's calls for the safety for all budget plan to try and transfer some of the funding from mpd to alternative first responders there's also a call to try and create mobile mental health crisis units um and i just wonder if you could give us kind of your thoughts on where you're at in processing all this you've been so at the the center of these conversations in some ways because of the the word that you represent um and i just wondered sort of if you could speak a little bit on sort of where you're sitting now in terms of how you think about the priorities of what comes next great question and i'm really um really just honored to to be in this in this space and and listen to my co-panelists as they describe their realities um and um you know i took notes on last night's hearing i have literally about 10 pages um the the it was interesting i mean you know in some ways we think it's divided but in many ways people were all asking for the same things um how how do how do we create um public safety in in a in a new reimagined way that that keeps everybody safe um but i think the divisiveness is reflected in the in the fact that people have differing ideas on how we get there um i was really kind of struck by the comments from um marquita and actually not struck in any way at all because i am black i you know i i live and breathe in black community space and talk to black people on a very regular basis um and but i was i was just surprised by you know some of the remarks in that people were didn't say we don't want police they said we want police to be accountable we want police to be relatable we want police to understand that they play a role in our community just like the bus drivers just like the butcher shop just like the post office just like the social services that people rely on they play a role in our community i think the challenge is that the police department in minneapolis and every place else in this country i mean minneapolis is not an aberration the the police are militaristic and in every community in in this country um you know sans white communities where it does appear that people that the police are very capable of being an integral community member and part of those communities it it is not evident that they have that same level of relationship and um commitment to being in community in black spaces and black communities and so i i was just really really struck by that but i know that to be true you know i i talk to my mom i talk to my aunts i talk to my cousins i talk to my um my friends um who who who live in various communities all throughout the country um and certainly here in minneapolis and and and black people are saying um for the most part we need police we need them to be accountable we need them to be professional um and we need them to be active and committed members of our society um you know last night's public hearing was um emotional it was very passionate um it was very it was very well organized i mean certainly we heard from a number of people from um supporting the the police um the people's budget um and then subsequently um the safety for all proposal that has been um submitted and forwarded by um council members cunningham um bender and fletcher um and and and there was a um considerable amount for supporting the the mayor's budget um i fall somewhere in between that space and really want to and will be supporting the safety for all plant that you know everybody i believe um wants to see a mental health response a a co-re co-re co-responder um scenario that addresses and um responds to to mental health uh crises um to to really shift some of the professionals from the minneapolis police department to other agencies within the the city um including the office of violence prevention and funding that support and um and i will say that we have been on this path i mean this is not um new it certainly has been um i think accelerated with the murder of george floyd which by the way um you kind of alluded to uh michelle but folks don't know i i am the eighth ward um city council member and um the intersection of 38th and chicago sits almost squarely in the middle of my ward uh and so we were um we were and are still deeply impacted by the murder of george floyd and we're reminded of it every day because we have a um a quote um autonomous zone that is disrupting the the flow and the movement of people through um out the ward and and impacting the the city um quite frankly um so deeply deeply challenged by these issues you know i i will state that i am an abolitionist i believe that we must rid our society of prisons um but when i think about how that manifests itself i know that there are some people and this has been true throughout the history of uh human society that are not able to fully participate in in societal life for a variety of factors and reasons and we have to help those people to become those kinds of contributing members to society um but sometimes people have to be pulled out of society to have that happen and so what if prisons became colleges and right now they are colleges they are colleges on how to become a better criminal um but you know there have been examples throughout the world um and particularly in in um in germany in russia where you know prisons are um compounds that people can walk about freely can go to school can have jobs that pay real wages um not slave labor so that they can continue to support their families and be connected to their families um and they don't they don't call them prisons that is where we need to be moving to in our society um and the same with abolishing the police we need to be supporting structures that will make crime and um violence less of a reality in our communities however that work is going to take time and we still will need to subsequently remove people from society that can't abide by those rules if we if we want to have a society that is governed by laws and rules then somebody has to enforce those laws otherwise we are just um living in in in quote i guess anarchy people are um we need people to be a part of this social contract that says we are going to respect and um and love each other which is a word that you know i just struggled to say um and and that is um at the core i think of of how we are going to move forward but you know i i heard a lot last night and and even this morning lucy said police don't they only respond to crime yes but people need that response if i have if somebody gets murdered i i need somebody to go and investigate and hold the people who murdered my family member accountable please do that um please do i i think personally um prevent crimes when you know one example was last night that i will share again today when you're driving down the freeway and you see the state trooper you slow down you don't drive 95 miles an hour um past the state trooper you so so police do deter crime is it uh is it enough of the deterrence um clearly not um you know which that's the argument of the the um um i'm sorry my brain i'm so over tired you guys but the death penalty is supposed to be a deterrent right but it really is um as i think i've heard either last night or this morning some maybe michelle you said it violence begets violence i am adamantly opposed to the death penalty i don't think the state has a right to to kill anyone whether it's judiciously or extra judiciously and those who do it should be completely held accountable but we have to be a nation of laws and we have to enforce those laws you know people say crime is only created because of um um poverty i i beg to differ we have a white house full of criminals and those people are rich as hell and they are breaking the laws and creating violence economic violence uh putting kids in cages every single day that's crime and those people are not poor or need to have activities for their kids people create crime it it it's a reality and i'm not sure how we get how we change that but um i could tell throughout that you're jumping to diane but we actually we have one more question for jamal and then another question that gets exactly to this issue of like how else do we support community members and how do we think about alternative responses to preventing harm and so is it all right if i put you just on pi it's fine low-key i have adhd i will probably forget what i was gonna say but it's okay it's okay it's okay okay i promise you get to be the first responder to that next question so jamel i wanted to give you a chance to jump into the conversation and you know the reason we invited you onto the panel was minneapolis of course doesn't exist in a vacuum minneapolis is embedded in a state context and of course in a national context as well and i think some of the conversation that gets missed around the question of transforming policing is how much cities can actually accomplish right and how they're constrained by both state and federal policy and potentially um right with the right kinds of leaders enabled by state policy and enabled by federal policy and so i just wanted to give you a minute to talk a little bit about how you see the role of um state policy setting what cities like minneapolis can do and what you think should happen at the the state level to sort of push this issue forward all right um so i wrote a few notes on uh kind of the approach the legislature took and why it took that approach um i do think the state plays a very important role as obviously we license all local police offices and then we create rules and obviously statute that govern the behavior of police officers and actually restrain them in many instances but also empower them in many instances to do both negative and positive things and so um a part of our legislative response to the death of george floyd actually started well before the death of george before one of the issues chair mariani and i identified when we were originally when the chair was first issued this committee assignment and i was born as committee administrator was police brutality and it was a actually a uh an issue area where we had very little help and so we spent the better part of a year and a half before george floyd occurred michelle you're one of the people we met with and kind of exploring what the academic literature said we reviewed all the reports put forth by the state of minnesota and other academic institutions he looked at the naacp report issued with the um help of the um um the urban league we also looked at uh michelle gross the community united against police brutality put forth a report uh we looked at the old governor report following philando castile we reviewed upon your advice michelle kind of the conflicting uh reports put forth by the different um subsection committees from that governor's task force and what we found was essentially um especially after um reviewing a lot of the um after george floyd occurred is we found that minneapolis had a lot of the proposals in place that a lot of folks were suggesting so they had the chokehold ban the duty to intervene there are a lot of policy proposals that minneapolis and on a policy level that is supposed to be enforced by the chief law enforcement officer is actually compared to many of the other smaller localities kind of ahead of the curve and yet because of this um for many reasons uh we still had negative outcomes and so what we at the state level recognize that it is part of this came on a lot of our discussions around these bills where that is a the state's role is to ensure that every citizen's human rights are always preserved and that is the relationship proper relationship it should have when it comes to police accountability is looking to ensure that yes there are a lot of discipline matters and labor matters that are uh of a local purview when it comes to human rights it is a state responsibility and it's technically everyone's responsibility and sure everyone's human rights are protected and so um for that reason when it came time to um interface with the senate which is a gop controlled entity we felt the emphasis from the senate on what what i kind of think of as clio enforcement and cleo's a a acronym for a chief law enforcement officer um they had a series of bills of five bills that were basically all relied on the chief being told to do certain things so the chief of police would be told no more chokeholds you now have a model policy put into place that you must ensure that folks don't have a chokehold they make sure that they report any law enforcement malfeasance so there's a duty to intervene and we found that none of these had state teeth had had no teeth where the state would they see um somebody violating this model policy that the state would be able to step in and um issue um some type of action on an individual law enforcement's license and without that um ability to protect human rights through licensure and you're just using policy and union um arbitration to enforce discipline that there is a a different level of accountability that comes from um an independent entity with authority and so what we endeavor to do is to create if you're looking to solve the systemic problems oftentimes you create an institution or a system to combat that systemic problem and the issue we're looking at here is from systemic state violence and particularly systemic racism and what we're looking to do is create systems within the existing institutions or infrastructures we're not reinventing the wheel um part of that is for political reasons because it's more difficult to build a new institution than to augment an existing one um you encounter more resistance and it's actually more expensive too on top of it um for those reasons what we endeavored to do was look for different ways for instance um um that i can go through quickly um there are three acts and i'll highlight three really quick bills within each one so the reclaiming community oversight act there are several bills in them three of the uh big ones are uh repealing the uh retroactively repealing the statutes of limitations um that allows for individuals who are victims of police in order to sue folks um in the future um or to sue folks um who've harmed them in the past so currently there's a tetris limitations um and the clock the um police can run out that clock because it can't begin to tick until the investigation is done they uniquely have power over the investigation um secondly is um and i'll wrap this up very quickly a law enforcement oversight council reform what we've noticed is local law enforcement oversight particularly even if you have a really great commissioner who's in charge of it um those assistant oversight councils don't are legislatively prohibited from doing investigations from providing um being authorized to provide discipline recommendations themselves and from having subpoena power to ensure that they have access to all the records um and a lot of that is most of that is brought forth by statutes um and then um lastly of his data collection regulatory reform we passed portions of this but essentially the state of minnesota the public doesn't have a dashboard to look through individual police um i'm sorry um police department's discipline records we have no way to compare apples to apples we only have um a sheet of paper that's statutorily um mandated every year that each department issues to the post board and up until this year the um the administration the post board didn't publicly even publish that one sheet of paper and so um it's um there's a number of systemic issues when it comes to accountability that the state put in place um and then lastly i'm just going to very quickly run through and i don't want to spend time with actual legislation i do want to talk about it on more higher level um they're out of the state policies uh limits that kind of restrain the ability of locals to act and then some of the the changes that are coming into state policy that hopefully gives us the ability to start moving there and so i'll run through it very quickly i wrote it down in a note um we have disempowered local community oversight boards um that is by statutes we have um atrophied law enforcement innovation there is no state level investigate investment there is no one out there looking to find a disruptive way of hunting down stolen items there's no new programs for looking at um you know there isn't at a state level a high level of investment in innovative law enforcement techniques that could provide different types of crime prevention that doesn't necessarily flow from police um there is a uh there was a captured regulatory body the post board hasn't issued a single police accountability regulation in its entire history that was not brought on by a state legislature like the state legislature have to tell them to do anything involving that's not the way a regulatory board should function they should look for different ways to rein in what they're tracking and seeing as um over your oversteps especially if you have kind of a global uprising that comes um and then um what else um the complaint record statutes prevents sharing complaint records uh freely the discipline process statute um gave gives even you know now too much power to arbitrators and local folks when it comes to violations of human rights um there's a police versus public safety subsidy so we subsidize police work in a way that we really don't subsidize public safety work we don't look at the holistically what creates a community safe for instance like those mental health response teams community bonds interrupters um you know domestic violence shelters and we don't look to systemically fund those in the way that we give lga out and help out local law enforcement then lastly the cost of reform which is the dirty the dirty thing folks i like to talk about is it costs money to do things like decriminalize even cbd it's costing over a million dollars to our budget to make something not enforced by law enforcement um and eliminate uh you know largely unpaid fines and fees and a lot of these uh efforts that would eventually reduce the prison population require an upfront investment which makes it expensive and difficult to do when you have to settle a state budget so and this my last point is uh three quick conclusions three quick solutions or bright spots to overcome some of these systemic barriers um regulatory reawakening has helped me at the postport the governor has appointed folks who are finally been seated a majority of governor's appointees who are um reform-minded folks that are obviously the post board still propagated by largely law enforcement however at least our law enforcement with an open um open mind to reform efforts um and there's a lot more community engagement post boards some of the appointments are for instance my friend dr raj who now sits on the post board who will uh hopefully be a new voice there to help enliven this atrophied regulatory body um statutory reform uh creating a citizens council and post board so current now we have a a body within the post board dominated by citizens which um individuals like for instance cities like minneapolis can bring legislation to and have that body voted to the final post board the actual board members and they have to vote it up or not so it's not just a citizens council that has only the power to issue reports they can put something on the agenda of the post board proper and make them vote on something that could have a lot of effects on local minneapolis and lastly um legislative uh prioritization that's a new new development um when i when we first started working on police brutality we couldn't get anyone to listen you know our bills were like the one bill every year we knew we were going to get beat up on were the police brutality bill cops would come in and laugh aside i know michelle you probably followed some of our work so you know that we weren't taken very seriously uh people would literally say we're like hey there's a crisis of confidence in law enforcement and they would say no one believes that no one doubts law enforcement then we have to go and meet with the same folks after a global uprising around the lack of confidence in law enforcement and so um now that folks have seen that and we awaken that the the leadership at least the governor's office and the minnesota house have highly prioritized this issue and even the senate um i'm somewhat hopeful that uh that the majority of leader gazelka has some um political impetus to at least appear as though he would like to work on this issue so um i don't know i've seen a lot of folks who are doubting it i'm hopeful that the appearance of not looking like you could care less about the plight of people of color is a is a enough of a impetus for him to at least act on something but um i'm holding my breath they could care less that we think they care less hey councilwoman uh vice president comfortable for chickens i firmly do not would not disagree with that assessment but i was going to say the the record is not great on that one but but we can all we can all hold our breath well thank you very much jamal i appreciate it that was terrific so i you i'm conscious that we're um running uh a bit late on time what i was gonna transition next to was a question about you know this concern about community members and crime and victimization has obviously dominated the front page of uh local newspapers or last couple of weeks and i think that conversation often gets reduced into this conversation of like do we have enough police or do we have not enough police for the problem of crime and less about you know how is the pandemic increasing economic instability that prompts crime how is the closure of schools and community centers and all kinds of opportunities for youth creating crime how are empty businesses and empty streets creating opportunities for victimization and so i wanted to give everybody a chance to kind of weigh in on sort of public safety beyond policing but we're a little short on time so i think what we'll do instead is i'll turn the floor to eluchi who i promise to come back to i will honor that promise and then i want to end with just a really quick one sentence from all of the panelists you know something that audience members said in a lot of their comments to the panel was what can i do and so if you just have everybody has one sentence to conclude with we'll start with a lucci after your comments um with what you would leave panel members or audience members with sort of what are the next steps for them and how can they get engaged in this work cool yeah so i'm going to keep it short and sweet um so first of all um loki i'm actually asking for no police um but that's another we me and andre can talk about that in a later time um so i think that there's a difference between deterrence and prevention right when we look at deterrence deterrence um inhibits the likelihood of something will happen right it doesn't actually prevent it from happening which is what prevention is so even in the example of the speeding example right just because you see a cop car on the side of a road it might deter you from from making that behavior but it doesn't actually change you from making that behavior in the future you're just going to be sneakier about how you make that behavior right and that's the same thing with policing so we look at for example folks who sell drugs because it's an act of poverty right um they don't stop selling drugs because they get caught they just find other ways of selling drugs so they don't get caught right so it's like and then also when we talk about crime so i think something that you said that really stood out to me andrea was like crime is like just because someone is in poverty doesn't mean that they'll commit crime or crime is not an act of poverty right but low-key jeff bezos is one of the biggest criminals in all of our existences right he is going to be a trillionaire in about 10 years right he's a cr he's a criminal because he profits off of slave labor because he fires people in the middle of a pandemic because he does not care about the people that work for him yet the things that he does are not called crimes but if i who is someone who's living under the poverty line or to go steal a tv from walmart because i need that in order to sustain for my family then that's automatically a crime so when we say crime we have to actually say what we're talking about and when we say crime it's like crimes profit off of capitalism so even your example of when donald trump locks away children contributes to the prison industrial complex that actually um sustains capitalism right so he might not be poor but he is getting other people richer and that's what we're talking about when we talk about crime right so i think those are very two important points i think the last point um that jamil you talked about was like the cost of decriminalization right and like even cbd is gonna cost us a million dollars to decriminalize or whatever legitimize but what you're what you're not seeing is like even when we took take a look at the the decriminalization of marijuana in colorado and washington which were the first two states to do that and you look at your their economies years after their economies boomed because of that but who was making the money it was white affluent people not the black and brown people who were criminalized for that same drug before so those are just a couple of things that i wanted to say before i left so i apologize no thank you very much i appreciate it okay so let's go uh marquita we haven't heard from you in a while do you want to give the audience your last thought um i guess i would anchor my philosophy in a sense of full citizenship black folk are looking for full citizenship and so we're looking for laws to come out of the state that will allow us to live freely and in in good intention and that the laws governing um policing to me need to start with a redefinition of the role of policing we need a constitutional amendment or some such thing that will redefine policing and shift it from that which is created to protect property to that which is created to protect people we haven't had a redefinition of policing since it existed since it began and we need to do that if we are going to expect the behavior and the actions of police to be any different how i define you is in large part how you will behave and so until we take that step we're just tinkering and um we're at a point now where our citizenship is at risk and so we can't afford to tinker any longer and so i would say that the next steps would be to in in honor of the question you asked us to address at the end what to do next need to advocate around full citizenship for everybody including black folk this division will then stop or at least be addressed as a result of anchoring what we do in any way that will advance full citizenship for everybody in the community black folks included terrific thank you okay hml you've got 60 seconds and then i'll let council vice president jenkins have the final word okay for 60 seconds um the big thought i'd like to leave folks with is thinking about um and i'm gonna use this uh sexist term advisedly which is think about policing using a guys with guns model because it's mostly guys but um where you think of where when you think about police reform i often advise folks to use this model to help think about a state use of force and ask themselves does a state agent who does a specific function need force to accomplish that function that is so if we we find out meter maid folks who write tickets for you for parking they're a state agent who who tries to patrol crime but they don't need force to do that function and there's a number of functions police carry out that they don't they don't need force to do so why are we overburdening an institution that should be that you know is best at we would like to think they're best at and they're specifically charged as agents of the government who are the right to use force we should streamline that which is why i like to use the phrase modernizing public safety versus abolishing the police both can actually in the policy space end up with the exact same policy um but they take different approaches to get there without presuming that you need to lower the amount of police or money to accomplish a specific public safety game even though oftentimes you probably do um or probably can um and then um the one thing folks can do i just cannot stress enough post board pull sport post board i tend to think that um we can the same ways we've regulated a lot of industries and a lot of actions from individual citizens in many ways police over regulate some communities i think police can be regulated into respecting human rights but it takes a lot of authority changing governance and um um independence invested within that authority in order to bring them in um but that is a vision i hope i hope to see actually carried out in the state of minnesota so oh and blacks i'm sorry you can write a comment in the post board for some upcoming rules that they're having you can approach the citizens oversight council on the post board which is a group of citizens who can put police regulatory changes into a vote at the post board and actually change policy so again you have citizens at the post board right now representative herr being one of them um who can inform police policy and they have a whole bunch of power so i would steer everybody who's watching that to contact someone they know um like uh dave hutch um who serves on the post board if they have an issue with minneapolis and specifically if a governance issue thank you very much and madam vice president i'd like to give you the the final concluding thought for our audience absolutely i will try to keep it to the request of one sentence um become an anti-racist um you know check your anti-blackness and i know i have to work on being an anti-racist everyday anti-sexist anti-homophobic anti-transphobic i have to work on that every single day and so i think everybody has to and should and if that occurs we can end many of the social ills that are uh impacting and um that are negatively impacting our communities today terrific thank you well with that i will say thank you to our audience and turn things over to megan who will close the program thank you professor phelps and thank you to all of our panelists for joining us today and
