 [Music] my name is Carl bottoms I'm a computational scientist at a Naval Research Lab and for nearly seventeen years I've been in charge of NASA's sungrazer project sungrazer project is a citizen science project that allows anyone in the world to discover new comets that are seen in images recorded by the joint ISA NASA Soho satellite recently the project has reached a very special milestone Soho has found 4,000 previously unknown comets in nearly 25 years so I want to share with you my favorite comments that Soho has discovered these were a pair of bright comets both members of what's known as the Kreutz group which is a very large family of comets that all follow the same path in space unfortunately unlike nearly all of Soho's comets these guys will completely vaporize by the sun's radiation most of Soho's comments are what we call Sungrazers which means they follow an orbit that almost grazes the surface of the Sun but we've also discovered a lot of comets that stayed just a bit further away from the Sun and unlike Sungrazers managed to at least partially survive passing by the Sun this comet Soho's 420 second discovery was found back in 2002 here we see it swinging around the Sun at a seemingly safe distance unfortunately it kind of looks to me like this comet may have turned entirely towards the stored x' the end of the movie it it can be hard to know the exact fate of comets like this because they're often impossible to locate from the earth because it's so close to the Sun one of the great things about Soho's Comet discoveries is they also teach us things about the Sun here we see what looks like a typical bright Sun grazer racing through the Lascaux cameras and in this case disappearing behind Lascaux solid occulting disk and normally this is the last we see of them but this comment to our absolute astonishment was also visible in images of recorded by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory which looks at the sun's million-degree atmosphere and extreme ultraviolet light this was the first time anyone had ever seen something like this we were completely blown away by this result and we can use comets like this almost like remote probes they allow us to learn about the environment close to the Sun by watching how the comic is reacting within that really extreme environment finally this is certainly not the biggest or brightest comet soko has ever found for me it's absolutely one of the most important this is so host 4,000 common discovery that's a truly remarkable milestone for this mission duration particularly as it was never designed to look at or discover comets this milestone is also a huge testament to the NASA and ASA scientists and engineers and support teams that have kept Soho running so well all these years and of course probably most of all it's a testament to the army of citizen scientists who have contributed so much free time to scouring the Soho images and in helping us realize all of this incredible size of getting so far here's hoping for another four thousand comets [Music] you [Music]
