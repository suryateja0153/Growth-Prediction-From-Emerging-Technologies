 the first time I was very starstruck probably seeing Serena for the first time I said how much I loved her in an interview and then the tournament just like set up this like basically a fan meeting for me she came and hugged me and a little this is awesome Oh actually she it's not like she gave me her number one Arlington's where one fan that would be kind of creepy [Music] hiking both this is new moussaka and today I'm gonna be sharing some of my First's with you first person I followed on Instagram it's a tree of Beyonce Rihanna Nicki Minaj don't tell anyone if I have burner accounts and I follow them on my burner counts too so yeah they're like the Holly the Holy Trinity first person that fall of Units probably my sister my first crush probably Danny Phantom I don't want to talk about it but honestly okay everyone that's watch Danny Phantom that was younger had a crush on Danny Phantom it's not a secret okay okay the first time that I picked up a tennis racket was when I was three which is according to my dad and I think that's accurate cuz there is a picture of me when I also look very little holding a tennis racket my first set of tennis shoes were Nikes I think which is great cuz can just do it the first professional tennis much either watched it was definitely the US Open because I was living in New York before I want to say either Agassi or Serena and Venus I don't know which one though the first professional tennis match I've ever competed was in Jamaica I mean haven't you to make us since then I really want to but yeah I lost that match so I didn't really have the greatest memories the first thing I think of in the morning it's probably what time is it and can I get away with sleeping for longer my first word was probably mama or Dada I don't know I don't want to get in trouble with any of my parents it was both at the same time my first pet was my current dog she's a forever puppy her name is Penn yep but we call her Pam fee she's a mini Australian Shepherd and she's super cute but she's also kind of fat but don't tell my mama said that my first CD like one that I bought probably Amanda Palmer The Dresden Dolls my first job was the one I signed up for when I was 3 years old and I'm still grinding tennis player I don't know if that counts as a job job this is what I'm out here doing my first car was a Nissan GTR it's the one that I'm driving right now and she's my baby and I love her I don't drive her every day because I don't leave the house you're not supposed to eat the health right now probably brain bones that's the one I've just been using forever it's my gamertag mostly I've been playing Minecraft a lot during the quarantine but I've been playing overwatch skaara I like very open-world tape games my first best friend was a girl named Jasmine I know her last name but I don't think she would want me to like her how like that in elementary school in alden terrace in new york i remember her very much because i was really sad to leave because I moved to Florida to play tennis awkward the day before I left to Florida because I didn't have an email so we could never keep in touch but she remains in my heart first celebrity crush ones I agree on a like I don't know no guy has ever given me like that Wow look at look at this amazing piece of art like whenever she post an Instagram guy you know my first celebrity crush is my boyfriend let's just go with that beautiful my first movie that I ever saw in I Peter probably Harry Potter I want to say like the first one I remember watching or begging my dad to let us watch aquamarine when it came out that was a very vivid memory for some reason my first date was last year um the girl doesn't get out much I don't know we were just hanging out I don't even know if he considered it a date to be honest I don't want to be over here like I'm the only one calling it a date maybe it was just a hangout my first hangout was at the Clippers game this is like exposing myself my first kiss was um from my mom when I was little my first heartbreak was when I was like six it was right after I watched the live-action Peter Pan and I was waiting by the window and he never came from then on I just didn't trust it the first time I was ever really embarrassed when I was in elementary school I really needed to use a bad boy seeing this and you know how like the teachers always think you're lying well I wasn't lying okay that's all I have to say if you can't put two and two together about that I wasn't lying my first major disappointment how big is major I know when my mom said there was wasn't for me like food was a very big part of my childhood I ran to the fridge so excited and it was nothing in there especially since like you passed like so much fast food restaurants on the way home the first song better memorized all the words probably moment for life by Nicki Minaj this big moment to this very moment actually go I feel asleep okay I'm dead the first time I ever realized I was famous wasn't ever because I don't know what that means my life it's the first time I was very starstruck probably seen Serena for the first time I was young I was like sixteen bacala I said how much I love turned in an interview and then the tournament just like set up this like basically a fan meeting for me because I uh I love her and she's the reason why I got into tennis and then the tournament was super nice and then I was a fan in the fan meeting and when she came husband you know this is also my first big surge I don't worry like buying things for myself like that I like to buy gifts for my mom because she's been working ever since I was really young good I just like to like give back to her a lot first thing I would do if I had a billion dollars probably help my dad build his school and she's like really into it and they're building tennis courts and stuff so and I know I just feel like it's really cute when I see all the pictures of the kids playing tennis but that's also like a billion dollars is a lot of money huh I don't know I would have to come back to you with a PowerPoint presentation thank you so much Teen Vogue I hope you enjoyed my first and I hope you learned a little bit about me [Music]
