 [Music] thank you welcome it's delightful to see so many people here the topic of spies seems to be endlessly fascinating it packs out houses all over the country I'm here today to tell you about a very brilliant spy who was a very bad man and we'll get to whether those things and in what ways those two things are related the the strange psychological makeup of people of that sort of mid-century generation who spent their lives deceiving everyone around them but first I want to just run you through the basics of the story how did this man Ricard's organ zorga actually strangely enough is a is negative it means melancholy mister melancholy although he certainly was not melancholy in his life and work he was hyperactive priapic and extremely dangerous so the miss named Ricard's or gay was a man with a fatherland and a motherland he was born in an expatriate German family in Baku the oil city in the Caucasus capital of Azerbaijan in the Russian Empire in 1895 his father was an oil engineer his mother was the daughter of a local merchant she was Russian but she didn't speak Russian at home and he spent the first years of his life as an expatriate in the in the in living in considerable luxury in a suburb of Baku and that's one of the things I think that many spies have in common in fact the sense of otherness I think the zuhr gain never really felt that he belonged in the society in which he grew up he always he wrote in his prison memoir so has been a spoiler that he gets hanged in the end so you do I said it is actually the first introduction in the book and it's in his prison memoir he wrote he he he writes that he you know he felt from his childhood this sense of not belonging to this bourgeois world of first but cool expatriate life and then later his father moved to Berlin where they lived in us in a in a wealthy suburb and his father became a banker so rather like Kim Philby and there's actually rather a lot of similarities between the life of Records or gate and the life of Kim Philby and they're particularly their backgrounds as well he grew up in privilege but he didn't really feel part of that world and Kim Philby wrote in order to betray you must first belong I never belonged and I think you could say exactly the same thing about records or game and the major event that set his life in train his his career in train as a spy was the same event that United traumatized slaughtered they said many of that generation it was what the Germans called the the kinder more the this mask of the innocence the experience of fighting on the Western Front and zorga joins up in 1914 as a young idealistic German patriot I'm thinking you know like we've all read out Philip malach in August 1914 you know young men all across Europe having no idea of the sort of slaughter there they were signing up for sign up including zorg a yeah within six months within eight months he's on the the river either in Belgium in a student battalion and he which is largely massacred and to get a sense of the trauma and the profound personal impact of that war you the most lyrical they're they're really lyrical but the most powerful example of writing about that is not actually is or gate it's someone who was almost exactly his age who fought in very similar areas of the Western Front and was in fact a wounded in the next-door hospital in 1916 was Adolf Hitler and in mine Kampf Hitler describes the absolute rage that he feels that the old world has betrayed him and his generation as massacred and caused this mass pointless slaughter and the old world must be broken says Adolf Hitler and precisely the same in precisely the same way this young bankers son records all gay finds himself filled with rage at the old world and Hitler as we know goes in to create his own National Socialism and but a whole generation of Communists and records all gay among them find this wellspring of idea of motivation in that disappointment and and and in in that horror and in practical terms actually he is in hospital where one of his nurses gives him starts giving him communist literature and he starts reading his way to enlightenment as he is he as he puts it and he the foreskin pilot confinement of a hospital bed I think also shows profound restlessness in him and he joins the the cohort of young men of his generation who become radical communists and of course we now tend to associate Russia immediately first and foremost with communist revolution but actually strange enough the Bolsheviks themselves the ideologues bation Borgia there's a Bolshevism thought that Germany was much more likely to go Bolshevik and the German proletariat is much bigger it's much more ripe a place for a communist revolution and in fact there were we've again sort of tend to forget this how close Germany came to becoming a Bolshevik communist country there were at least depending on how you count them five or six revolutions between 1918 of spartacists and 1923 there was the red raw Munich there were various apprising and the young records all gay was very involved as a communist activist he was a lecture students in Kiel he was pursuing an academic career in fact he became an economist after the end of the war after demobilization he firstly tried to study the doctor became an economist and so on but also all this time he was also a an underground agitator in fact quite literally underground agitated because he he signed up to work in a mine to agitate of the miner so he became actually a real underground agitator in a mine so this young man very passionate very very didactic having a sort of a slightly pedantic high opinion of himself he's an academic he's actually throughout his whole life as a communist strangely enough he never loses this sense of his sort of patrician in what would today call entitlement is actually he's constantly even when he's working as a spy later in his career he's always sort of talking down and just Emily being rude to to his to his subordinates and just sort of you and bossy people about say so see so he always considers himself to be sort of officer class but to cut a long story short he is identified by Russian agents of the Communist international Moscow run organization designed a spread world revolution he's recruited by the Communist international does various spying work for them in throughout the 1920s then at the end of the 1920s he is sent to Shanghai Shanghai is at that point the the entrepot of the east of the Asian trade it's also basically a colonial city although it's not actually formally a colony but various chunks of central Shanghai controlled by various colonial powers self-governing sub regulated colonial powers and also importantly if you're a spy it also has four separate police forces none of whom talk to each other so that's pretty very handy is you have a city which is divided into little bits one of them is the International Settlements you're basically the English settlement which is the one you want to avoid because it's a police forces run by Northern Irishman so they're very serious about their security and in fact they were very the the British Special Branch were actually extremely effective at rolling up Communists in fact in London and Shanghai both you have the French who obviously less you know the they obviously sir I didn't obviously they are less concern to the security you have the Chinese ever the Japanese you have a small sub nation Japanese concession and you have the local Chinese police which controlled the entire mainland on behalf of the falling ailing nationalist government so this all gay starts to arrives in this city which is the capital of espionage in the 30s and in that period more or less every sort of great illegal Soviet agent that ever operated anywhere some point pops up in in Shanghai and he has he has a very successful career he's where he identifies that the things that become the sort of the the planks the bulwarks of his successful espionage and they're really simple it's just by being incredibly charming he's just a really very charming personable man and I think I mean the this we can just we can talk about this in the in the Q&A afterwards but there the way espionage has changed over the intervening 80 years but in that in those glory days when human intelligence was everything it was just getting information out of people was all gay basically didn't ever in his a career steal any secrets people gave him secrets they told him secrets and he traded secrets he was just a very personable man and men wanted he wanted to be him women wanted him he was extraordinarily charming promiscuous sexually and he was actually in many ways the prototype of James Bond if Ian Fleming's us right about that that there's all gays sort of swashbuckling my club-hopping man about town was on the models of James Bond the sort of Sevilla James Bond but the most interesting part of his career ensues in not in Shanghai where he acquits himself perfectly respectively but in the next and most dangerous stage where his or gate goes from just being a rather good effective everyday spy to being a world historical figure and he creates probably one the greatest spy networks in the world in Tokyo Japan intensely mysterious to the Soviets intensely dangerous the Soviets because this new Lee hatched imperial power which has defeated Imperial Russia in 1984 and 1995 has suddenly spread over into Manchuria in 1931 they start to expand into huge swathe of mainland China and acquire a large land border with Siberia so obviously the the Soviets are really very interested to know what are this other Japanese doing and zorg a creates is sent into this deadly spy mad country with a very powerful not not just no police forces that speak to each other but actually five inter lapping interlocking overlapping police forces that very much do talk to each other you've got the talker the military intelligence and so on so this is actually a police state with a very tiny expected community which are very physically obvious unlike in Shanghai where you've got sort of many tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of Westerners in in in Tokyo they're very rare so what does he do he creates essentially two parallel sparring networks one of them and the most important one based on his charm aforementioned because he decides to do two things one he will he and his bosses decide that he doesn't he's not going to hide he's not going to go under assumed identity he's not going to go and pose as something else he's he's not going to have what they the russian spies soviet spies at that time described as a boot a false identity a constructed identity though he was just going to go as records or gay journalist because he was records or gay journalist he actually hid in absolutely plain sight and that was actually a brilliantly simple and effective cover because he was in fact actually rather I read his article say you know how to hit a rather pedantic rather sort of you know plotting but nonetheless a successful journalist he becomes that the correspond for the for the frankfurters item which is the most prestigious German paper at the time so there's no subterfuge he's just hides in plain sight and his main source is a man who to whom he has obtained letters of introduction Mangal Egan ought a left-hand Colonel and German army former intelligence officer in fact who is posted to Japan and who has given his all get as a contact as it turns out I cannot becomes firstly the military attache and then the Ambassador a German ambassador to Tokyo is a very important position he's a very important and interesting mountain though because as you know Germany and Japan later going to military alliance so that's sort of Nexus of the German Nazi Germany's representative in Imperial Japan is a key man to know and he is best friends with records or gay despite the fact that within a month of arriving in Japan the first thing that this Olga does as well as befriend or you cannot potentially very important source is he also seduces his wife so I call him an impeccable spy but there are many ways and I get to the other ways in the in a moment that his work is very far from impeccable in fact he's actually incredibly reckless despite the fact that this guy has seduced his wife or he cannot in fact even jokes about it he calls his new friend the irresistible one there's obviously some sort of strange interpersonal dynamic in the in the arts relation in the family relations but anyway the and arch became begins to just confide in ins or game as all gay why does he confined ins all gay because all gay actually becomes very good networking he becomes the go-to guy for art another G senior diplomats because he seems to be amazingly well informed about the ins and outs the inner workings of Japanese politics he's just like this amazingly well-connected journalist and of course the reason why he's an amazingly well-connected journalist I think you got there for me it was because his major Japanese agent was a young idealistic communist Japanese journalist who with whom he had worked and met in fact in in Shanghai hot Soumya Zaki he gets transferred to the headquarters of his newspaper the Asahi Shimbun and you know and he gets transferred in May in in the way of a certain kind of journalist he goes from his career progressionist from journalists to sort of you know analysts sort of leader writer to sort of think tanker to government advisor and that's not unprecedented as we know from the current election I mean the the the the path from journalism politics is also existed in 1930s Japan so you you have the and ultimately at the height of the spy rings effectiveness and fame you have records or gay is one degree of separation from Adolf Hitler via his best mate or you cannot with whom he has breakfast every morning at the Embassy and they chat about you know the secret diplomatic cables that have come in from Berlin and what's all gays has heard about about the latest gossip on Japanese politics is one degree of separation from Hitler because art is speaking quite regularly to Hitler goes to Berlin many times to meet Hitler he's one degree of separation from the Japanese Prime Minister because Hatsumi Ozaki is eventually appointed to what's called the the The Breakfast Club or the the breakfast council where the top senior government advisers meet with the Prime Minister so he's one degree of separation from the pre definite Prime Minister and he's also one degree of separation from Stalin because he all this time is sending messages to Moscow headquarters long voluminous encoded messages which his boss his immediate boss no actually many of them were his trying to communicate on a daily basis to Stalin so he finds himself in one degree of separation from Japanese Prime Minister from Stalin from Hitler and the way he holds us all together is because I mean you're all dealing with information and the value of it this is a classic example of a virtuous circle of information which becomes self reinforcing either this or gay himself is reinforcing his in his reputation as a brilliant sort of knowledgeable man about the Japanese politics because of all the secret stuff that he's learning from his agent his his agent Hatsune Miyazaki develops a formidable reputation for nerving brilliantly having incredible insight into the workings of the Western the Western powers because the stuff is or gates peel is passing to him and all the time of course in this circle only or you cannot is there is the dupe really but he's also the only one that survives I cannot and and and all the sort of cream of this and all the secret stuff is going straight to Moscow so there's a really simple key to this I mean as well as being his his his charm and personal skills and so on but he just creates this information mill that just bigs up everyone every participant and and makes them all incredibly famous in the old fields without anyone really quite knowing why where they got this brilliant information from so the next question is what why is he important what did he do that we that we have such General Douglas MacArthur later the Viceroy American Viceroy and governor of occupied Japan he calls all gay a devastating example of a brilliant success of espionage the spies in history who can say from their graves the information I supplied to my masters for better or worse altered the history of our planet can be counted on the fingers of one hand records or gate was in that group says Frederick Forsythe the best buy of all time says Tom Clancy despite and spies says john lecarre a and his work was impeccable whether the title comes from it says kim Philby so what did he do that was so incredible and world-changing and important one very simple thing there was not a simple thing one very major thing if anyone knows anything about is all gay and in Russia and Japan both he's actually world famous it's in in Brittany's that's one there but if anyone happens to be a spy buff and happens to have heard about him the one thing people know about records all gay is that he warned Stalin that Hitler was going to invade in June 1920 in June of 1941 and was not believed that is true as all gay did in fact warned the Soviets multiple times that plans for Barbarossa were advancing he even knew which generals were was able to pass on which generals were in charge of which sections of the front he knew more or less the date because zorg a was speaking commonly regularly not only to art but to all the military attache s that were going backwards and forwards between Berlin and Tokyo through through the whole through the whole period through the months immediately preceding the Operation Barbarossa because of course if you think about it unlikely though it may seem the quickest way to go from Berlin to Tokyo is in 1941 spring of 1941 quickest way and also you could fly but train yeah you could get on the train turns out of Vostok that's the fastest way if you're gonna try to cross land and their allies from 1939 to 1941 Soviet Union and the and and in Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression pact it's called a non-aggression pact but in fact it also it's a military alliance and they and they carve up Europe Eastern Europe between them Poland notably and and the Baltics and the Soviet Union as is supplying the German war machine with an enormous amount of mythic material but also crucially allowing Asian material soybeans and rubber to cross on that very same train track so as all gate is not not only sitting in the Chancellery of the German embassy reading their confidential memos and and and having daily chats with with with with the ambassador but he's also talking to his mom to his friends and acquaintances and old mates who are coming through with various dispatches from Berlin so he's very well informed it must be said that this Olga was not the only person to warn Stalin of the danger in fact as we now know there were 19 different agents in various positions including a group of agents called the rota capella the the the the the red choir who is who anti-nazi are officials in the foreign in the German Foreign Ministry in the Luftwaffe and so on who were also reporting bits of crucial information and all of this was going back to the headquarters of Russian military intelligence and it was being reported to Stalin Stalin did not believe it why this is very interesting part of the story and as everyone in this room was actually engaged with information and the uses and misuses of information it's a really salutary tale and a terrifying one because why didn't style and believe all of these reports that were coming in warning him dozens of them over months Hitler is really going to invade he's going to invade here details like forensic details that Luftwaffe is as ordered you know ten thousand mission with the engines I mean it real forensics how is this ignored very simple because Hitler could because Stalin's intelligence chiefs are too scared to tell him something that he doesn't want to hear it's a classic example of groupthink I'm there been other examples I mean if you read Bob Woodward's accounts of how the Iraq war was was was fought and so on this idea of a clique of people around the leader who become obsessed and particularly if their intelligence professionals become obsessed with providing or filtering in information that the leader you become convinced that the the boss does not want to hear that the Germans going to invade therefore everything that his intelligence chief this man called Philip Golikov general Philip Golikov edits the information that he's receiving from his or gate and from all the rotted capella and all these other agents and he fill its it out and he leaves in the bits because if you read the originals you see that you know every intelligence report it's not you know it's never a slam-dunk it's always like on the one hand but this other person says you know that they're they're always hedged in some way so what he does is he sort of takes all the bits which hedging against an invasion and puts those in his report Holocaust reporter Stalin and all the bits that are mitigated there that are that I said that are to ask hindsight enlightened minds strong evidence that actually it's really going to happen that part he either frames as he disclaimers in or he just leaves out altogether and so the result is that actually several or he discredits the saws-all so indeed on one of the reports and one of the Stalin writes and if I was one of the interesting and wrote a very chilling things about looking through the Soviet archives is that Stalin has a very distinctive handwriting and he always writes in very thick blue or all red wax pencil and so you're leafing through these documents and you just see like that's you know stylin right on that and he says like you can send your source to his mother Stalin he's a st he sounds I'm signing this up so you know he's which is you know fairly strong this disapprobation so style it actually has is being fed this disinformation from the skewed information by his intelligence chief why is that why does that happen because General Philip Golikov was the seventh head of Soviet military intelligence in five years the previous six were all executed so clearly that's not a great job or to put it more specifically there are certain things that his six predecessors did that obviously were rather badly wrong so and automatically they did various things to displease Stalin they all themselves became victims of the purges along with hundreds of thousands of other members of the party basically from 1937 onwards until nineteen till well into the 40s you have this mentality of the purges which of course is another kind of groupthink and another toxic kind of groupthink because you have an intelligence organization civil military intelligence or and the secret police the NKVD you have the party the organ of government all of the major institutions of the Soviet state are suddenly consumed with this paranoia deadly paranoia that somebody is getting is either saboteur or a spy and/or an enemy and of course as we now know with hindsight what they really all were enemies in one way shape or form of Stalin or that's how it started at least so it wasn't really about saboteurs or spies it was just about political but it's all about purging the political opponents in the party but the results of the operational result is that you have swathe of senior officers within the fourth Department which is whether the the contemporary name for the Soviet military intelligence I just rounded up and murdered short accused convicted and so on zorga was one of the very few soviet agents to survive because the end of 1938 a call went out to every Soviet field agent resiliently bureau chiefs all around the world saying come back to Moscow and by this point because it was 30 38 already the purges already been in full swing for a year so some of them got why some of them didn't some of them refused to return some of them returned including people like Theodore Marley who was the recruiter of the Cambridge five and so on you know very brilliant some of the greatest biases have unions ever produced we went back to Moscow and were in prison and shot we're the ones that refused to go back were all themselves hunted down and murdered Mossad style often the latest one was in leg was murder in 1961 I mean the KGB really held had to had a long memory they were had they were hunted down and murdered with one exception that exception is zorg a who as well as being charming and extremely clever and manipulative also very importantly has just the devil's own luck he just gets away with so much egregious it's extraordinary and one of the things that he does is completely unbeknown to him and he doesn't really think this through but he agrees to go said like yes I'm going he says he agrees to the summons yes I'm on my way like yes except that my agent Hatsune Miyazaki is in Manchuria at the moment on a reporting expedition he's not going to be back till at the end of the month I have to debrief him and let you know and the other set but he said so he he not deceitfully but actually jed truthfully says give some reasons why he's not going to go right now and by the time he actually is ready to go they didn't want him to get to go back anyway is that it's it's it's over the guy who summoned him has been shot seriously and and then his success has also been shot and then his successes success has been shot one of them one of the heads of the four Department last last for 20 days in August of 97 1939 but and then it's all over and he's still in Turkey but everyone that he's that he knows everyone examine he's ever worked with everyone who knows him and anyone who even knows people that he's worked with they're all gone they will they've all in execution pits they could be decapitated not only their own party apparatus not only their own security apparatus but and their and their armies senior staff which puts them in very bad position when they start to fight a war with the Finns in 1940 they also totally decapitated that oppa decapitated there and that their own security apparatus they've sort of Zoar gate is in situ finding feeding them with some of the greatest and high-grade intelligence that any spies ever provided to his masters and yet at the top there's this sort of knot of paranoia and disbelief and the people who are running the intelligence that's getting to the top Stalin obsessed not totally unreasonably with a survival instead of actually telling telling the boss the truth so the result is that Stalin did indeed does not know what that is blindsided by Operation Barbarossa that they were within within two weeks of our Soviet troops already charging through to justice Millette cetera and we know the story if it's blitzkrieg sweeps across the plains of western Russia was all gay by the way by that time has been proved right because I mean a hundred German divisions cross in seven borders is somewhat hard to ignore piece of evidence that mitigating in that he actually okay he was actually telling the truth but the next question does or gate is okay so we know the Japanese the Germans have invaded us what are the Japanese going to do because the Japanese are Germany's allies the Japanese have two and a half million men under arms in direct proximity to the Soviet Union and we now know I mean it's really clear I mean I think any serious historian would dispute this the if the Japanese had invaded Siberia the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941 in tandem with their German allies there's there was absolutely no way that Stalin could affordable one two fronts the world would have been absolutely lost so the question bazoer gay you know June 23rd the day after Barbarossa is y-you know what what are the what are the Japanese going to do and zorga is abled by throwing all of his espionage resources into the breach to confirm you know by late summer that Japan is actually definitively not going to invade the Soviet Union for a really interesting practical reason the army there's been a long back-and-forth strategic debate for years between the Japanese army the Japanese Navy the Japanese army is on land it wants to continue pushing through China Japanese Navy is obviously on sea and they wants to continue pushing through by sea through Southeast Asia to the Dutch East Indies to the Philippines to French you there China and so on the Navy wins the strategic debate why because Japan is running out of oil Japan has no oil to run its war machine the that the Americans have blockaded in fact in some ways the Japanese if you go to the to the Japanese equivalent to the Imperial War Museum the narrative is amazingly that actually the Americans started the second world war against Japan not the other way around because the and that the Pearl Harbor was retaliation for an act of war which was the Japanese that the American blockade of oil which which is Sudan in the in in July of 1941 so and in fact the Geneva Convention a blot only an economic blockade is in fact technically an act of war so they have a point in their minds so they are unusual to think of Pearl Harbor as a sort of a self-defense move but anyway that's how that's how some the Japanese saw it and see it to this day but the point is that the the blockade is actually economically devastating and compels the Japanese to take the Dutch East Indies they cannot continue fighting the war they kind of continue lighting their houses or heating them of them without that oil so rather as Hitler's but the you know the Marxist do have a point there is very strong material of materialistic element to world history Hitler was driven to the oil fields of Baku to fuel his war machine and that was why he drove towards Stalingrad and towards Baku the place that records all his birth and so the Japanese didn't invade the Soviet Union in 1941 because they were driven towards the they had they had to get the oil fields in but over any rate long story shot we're gonna get to the questions in a second zorga is able to tell his soviet masters for sure that Japan is not going to invade that summer which is enormously important because it allows the Germans that the Soviet High Command to withdraw the up to five army cause to the defense of Moscow and as we now know actually Hitler lost the war not a Stalingrad not of course not anywhere else but actually a bit Moscow Moscow was the last point where he could have won the Second World War if he'd taken Moscow in the winter of 1941 he didn't because it was reinforced by Siberian troops hence you know all the sort of world's historical significance of records or game so that is the thing that he does that puts him into into the into the category of world-class spies but the I just want to leave you with two things firstly I'm personally fascinated by his the personality of a man that can spend nine years of his life lying to everybody around him literally everybody he has a Japanese mistress but who doesn't know about his espionage activities or his Serbian wife even his closest spying colleague katsumi Ozaki he lies to him too as Olga tells him that he's working for the Communist international not for serving military intelligence he has this almost pathological desire to deceive and also running in parallel with that this extraordinary desire for danger and self-destruction and I said he got away with also egregious it's crazy things one of the crazy things he got away with was that he when his favorite pastimes was getting extremely drunk and driving a very powerful motorcycle a high speed usually with girls on the back this is major seduction technique and and so he had this enormous e powerful zundapp flat twin 500cc very powerful motorcycle which I see ways it weighs 180 kilos it so really it's a real monster and he drives this at speeds of 100 miles an hour and at one point he completely drunk having drunk at least the bottom half of whiskey he crashes this thing into a wall he doesn't he doesn't even crash he just doesn't notice the wall it just drives into the wall and the law and the wall wins and he breaks his jaw horrific Lee and he's taken to hospital and he stays conscious forced himself to stay conscious calls for his friend a friend a colleague from German Embassy comes said he summons his mate who unbeknown to the colleague from German Embassy is actually his radio man a man called max Claussen Moscow trained radio man German communists he's working with zoar gay says called max Claussen he stays awake and long enough to mask Levin to show up and he says like max like check my jacket because in his jacket pocket the sometimes it's better in peccable but not always impeccable spy has a radio as a message written on Clare in English because he communicates strange reasons with a with Moscow Center in English in his jacket pocket which is just there like the the his spy message his report which he's just left in his pocket and he gets away with it he and and on the night of Operation Barbarossa he gets drunk at the Imperial Hotel stands up on the table and tells an audience of Nazis Hitler is as a bandit you this is the end of him Stalin Stalin will will will be the end or when it will will put an end to your criminal activities he shouts to which point that one says let ha ha ha like a crazy old Richard who's also the only person by the way who is I think simultaneously a member of the Soviet Communist Party and the German Nazi Party at the same time but I'll leave you with a leave the last word to Licari because John the carrier bridge a very brilliant review in fact of the first ever book in English to be published about is all game and I think he nailed and John the Kerry nailed him in a way that I have not been able to better he was a man's man and like most self-appointed and romantics he had no useful women outside the bedroom he was an entertainer people even his victims loved him soldiers warmed to him immediately he was an exhibitionist I suppose and the audience was always of his own sex he had courage great courage and a romantic sense of mission when his colleagues were arrested he lay in bed drinking sake waiting for the end he wanted to train as a singer he's not the first spire to be recruited from the ranks of failed artists a French journalist describes him as possessing a strange combination of charm and brutality at times he undoubtedly betrayed the symptoms of an alcoholic what did spiring give to him a stage I think a ship to sail upon his own romantic seas a string to tie together a bunch of middle range talents a fool's bladder with which to beat society and a Marxist whip with which to scourge himself the sensual priest had found his real Mitty he was born wonderfully in his own century only his gods were out of date [Applause] did he ever leave Tokyo returned to Russia or Germany or did he meet his end in Japan sadly he did not leave Tokyo he although strangely enough actually went one of the translating and things about writing about someone who says secretive and so pathologically deceitful is that you you only catch glimpses of the sort of the the inner life the true inner life in the reports of conversations and so on and I think there there are indications that he had a bank account by the way in his own personal bank account in Hong Kong he had which are still operating interestingly enough even under Japanese occupation during the war he he certainly made talk to his his friends about about leaving about bailing out you know doing that sort of critical period at the end of 1941 but the the long the short version is no he never left he never left Tokyo he was he was arrested by the merest chance in fact despite all of the extraordinary things that he did he has all the extraordinary risks the risks that he took and also I didn't mention the butcher of Warsaw in 1941 the Germans become somewhat suspicious about this man who is this journalist who is so close to their ambassador the Germans have been asking zorga to write various economic reports and political reports on the political situation for the Germans the Germans have been using him as a source and as it turns out there is some paperwork or some whiff of scandal concerned with as all gays own communist youth in the 1920s when he still sort of roughhousing with all the with with with the the communist insurgents and in Kiel and so on and the deputy head of the SS decides to send a man to check on zorg a and the man he decides to send is a man called is a Gestapo colonel called years.if mice injure the use of messenger has the unusual distinction of being a man whom the Gestapo want to hang for war crimes now that's a very high bar but the nonetheless my senior manager that he he gets saved from his war crimes accusations by the Gestapo by the by his friends in the in the SS because he was actually an old first world old comrade of Heinrich Himmler anyway long story short they send mice injure Gestapo colonel in a submarine in a submarine to Japan to investigate records or game so this is a man who is known as the butcher of Warsaw he makes a big social impression in on his arrival in Tokyo by eating steak raw steak with his fingers he generally isn't a terrifying man and incredibly dangerous opponent and zall gay of course does what he does with everyone as he takes him drinking and whoring in Ginza and within a couple of days he's his best mates with the butcher of Warsaw and and and turns out they're also what the Germans called come from Hardin they they were actually with serving in the same section of the Western Front etc etcetera so so so the he's he has this extraordinary this extraordinary sort of luck and and evades every possible jeopardy until the last minute at the last minute it's completely random his turns out his agents his Japanese agents had been recruiting their own sub agents so essentially the Japanese who he works with and sees whether they're two of them have themselves recruited two other people unbeknown his all gay and this of a secondary was sort of almost tertiary ring of agents drawled from former communists which is actually a very bad thing to do operationally because they're all known to the police and so on and just completely randomly one of a network of in fact several dozens of sub-agents gets arrested some questioned by the police and then they just sort of simply unravel all the way up the line and they get they get tubes or gates assistant a guy called Miyagi Miyagi names or Zaki and names all gay so it's actually really ultimately although he does lots of extraordinarily injudicious and dangerous things it was ultimately in through no fault of his own that's all get gets called thanks so you've written about Zora gay who spied while posing as a correspondent abroad and you yourself as I understand it are a correspondent abroad yeah that's true one are you concerned that you've sort of played yourself but but more more more seriously do you as a journalist face suspicions because of your profession are you concerned that writing about famous spy journalists will make that worse that's a really good question um yeah I spent my spend most of my missing my career in Russia and in and then I was I was based in the Istanbul for 15 years and working mostly in in in Iraq and Afghanistan Syria Iran Russia and I did mostly conflict journalism Sarasota suicide covered Wars and you know Bosnia in Iraq and Iran and Iraq and Afghanistan all those places last one eastern Ukraine and the thing is you realize that in in sort of particularly in unstable countries everyone thinks that you're a spy anyway I mean whether you can just be with your an aid worker or I mean you know every single Afghan every single Syria and things that you're every single Turk thinks that you're a spy of some I mean it's it's just sort of a cultural sort of thing but on the other hand because it's assumed to be totally because they also doesn't seem that they're taken very seriously but but I mean it actually is a problem because strangely enough I have actually come across several people posing as I mean rather rarely but actually thought on that I think I would say three occasions in the field I've come across people who claim to be journalists are obviously not journalists and it's really interesting because you know you can you just clock them immediately because you know they're idiots and you know they just haven't you know they don't know they know what they're doing you did you have you know Google you know just sort of you know they're sort of pathetic science what they've set up as covers it's immediately obvious that they these guys are not professionals and the sort of the the actual journalists they're like sort of white blood cells they're just sort of you have you know you are right off sorry with you know and not having anything to do with you and you tell they sort of sorta don't take that guy so actually it's it's really quite hard to pose as a journalist to be a journalist and a spy I think is probably quite easy because we do exactly the same job but you know I'm constantly amazed at how amazingly badly informed diplomats and indeed the very few spies that actual professional spies I know how badly informed they are journalists are much better knowing the country just because they have incredibly different you know they're we know much wider acquaintance and and you know they I'm not even entirely sure what spies actually do anymore in terms of like human intelligence spies because as we know as you know much better than I you know data mining I'm the whole Belling cat story I don't know whether you've you know you know you know what betting cat is you know one not know what banking oh my god okay sorry people you need to work you need to read about Belling cat Belling cat is extraordinary because it just shows you the future of intelligence who set up this organization which uses citizen journalism to gain extraordinary forensics on an intelligence the most the thing that most famous for is the mh17 she'd downing so it turns out like so a missile is fired from a field in eastern Ukraine that knocks out a civilian airliner out of the sky June June 9 2014 I was I was there actually it was incredibly horrific been a lot different story but the the Belling cat is able to establish by cross-referencing you know social media posts of the tracted of the Volvo truck that tows this book rocket array into Ukraine and and and tracks it like it's spotted here at this point you know and the images is time logged and then here and here and here and here and then on its way back and here and here and here and here and then like where did it come from like well they look through sort of Russian soldiers social media posts they see like oh this is this is the same book and actually it's in this this army basin anyway an enormous array of data points all open-source produced this extraordinarily compelling and essentially sort of impossible to fake picture of actually what really happened and in fact that's actually much more forensic ly interesting useful than having a spy who's telling you you know this is this this happened or that happened so and and in fact I'm very interesting The Omen and most recently the you know the the Bellingham people also identify the scrip hole would-be assassins by you know brilliantly they they ran the the information from which the British police published the fake passports that they used that the the to as would-be assassins ask Republicans I'm in a press release so Berlin cat says well this is interesting using using a Russian pun let's just see if any of this information on the passports is true and it turns out that the first name and the middle name and the pit and the place of birth and a date of birth of one of the two fake passports which by the way have consecutive serial numbers making this so fake I mean they're not fake though they're just that they're real passports believe that obviously like sort of generated deliberately for this operation and is actually exactly the same first name second name pays place date of birth as a person who happens to work in Russian military intelligence like amazing alright so so then having discovered this guy's real name they then like look at look at his look up his you know in the open-source data of like where does he live he lives he has a flat in st. Petersburg what's his car registration okay was car registration so they find the car where's that car registered to the pay pays Road taxes oh it's registered to the headquarters of this Department of Russian Malaysian telchines in central Moscow oh and what are the other cars registered that address oh the other 380 people who work there you know so all this like crazy stuff is just out there lying on the surface and you just need to sort of pick it apart no one just you know no one's guarding against that stuff but I mean that's the future of intelligence not not human intelligence I mean but that is it's all it's all in the data and if you know where to look you just you know everything he lives now it must be hard for you to find data did he leave a footprint for all the people he seduced to all the people he drank did they write about him yeah well actually one of the great he didn't write about them but they didn't write about him he wrote about them and one of the things actually that that's that makes it so easy and also challenging is that actually every one member of the spy ring is arrested every member of the spy ring but one sings like a canary they actually in captivity for different reasons actually the radio man spills the beans because he and it because actually unfortunately it was all gay the radio man max clouds and having started up as a communist actually goes into business using Soviet money that becomes a very successful businessman buys his wife fur coats and decides that actually he's not actually a communist after all he's actually a Nazi so that becomes a bit of a problem if you were actually a professional civic intelligence officer and and and it caused a bit of a fundamental contradiction say say he's actually trying to prove to his interrogators max the radioman is trying to prove that he's actually a Nazi there's all gays trying to get swapped by Moscow so he's trying to prove it isn't into his masters what a great loyal communists he is in fact he's expecting to be exchanged ultimately which is not the Russians totally disowned him they screw him completing so all the members of the spy ring actually confess his all gift case at an enormous length he literally write enormous book length and memoir and during the two years that he's in jail so they all have very that they'll have very extensive sort of writings about themselves and also as we now know the Japanese from the almost from the first moment of their of the spy rings activities had been transcribing they identified the transmitter they didn't know where exactly where it was but they were listening in to transmissions and this so Japanese from like 1932 until 1941 they are transcribing thousands and thousands of streams meaningless numbers which are being transmitted like clickety click click click so letter so is it quickly and click click click by encode and they just don't know they don't know what it is but they just keep transcribing it for years and have this gigantic archive like and and then finally they reach that they find the operating said they found max Claussen and they find a very well thumbed copy of the German statistical handbook from 1933 and they said and they put two and two together and they actually now able to decipher these some seven years worth of random numbers they've been painstakingly writing down so we also have literally the entire everything that there's all gave a sent to Moscow Center is also chronicled so there is actually a lot of material my great pleasure [Applause] you
