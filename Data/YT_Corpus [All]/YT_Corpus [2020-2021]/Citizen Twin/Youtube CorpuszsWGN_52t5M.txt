see you there enjoy the video peace out hey guys welcome back to my channel if you're new here what's up how's it going and if you're coming back what's up how's it going it's so good to see you again soon I hope you're doing well you see what happens when you subscribe to my channel you get an extra greeting at the beginning of every single one of my videos okay so just press the button okay before we get into this really quick as I'm filming this it is it is currently Thursday January 23rd I have 1 million nine hundred ninety four thousand eight hundred and twelve subscribers so by the time this video comes out I might have two million subscribers which is insane so thank you for 2 million subscribers literally all I've ever wanted to do is just make people laugh and the fact that that's my job now and there's so many amazing people watching my videos every week and coming to my shows I just I seriously cannot thank you enough this is literally a dream come true so thank you okay enough of the sappy stuff what am i a tree no I'm a man I'm a human man folks so today we're gonna be looking at a pair of tick tock pranksters /di wires slash product reviewers they do a lot of different content but the one through line through all of it is that every single video confuses the absolute [ __ ] out of me straight up after watching all their tic TOCs my head was bleeding it was bleeding so scratching it so much and that wasn't because of my lice you know they're just the videos were so confusing they were head scratchers even my lice were confused I don't have lice see the account that we're looking at today is called we we're cute I'm gonna be honest up until about ten minutes ago I thought their name was we we are cute and they dispel our wrong because when I wrote the script for this video I wrote a joke about their name being we we are cute so that's a little frustrating the joke I was gonna make is their name sounds like if tik-tok asked the both of them what they wanted their profile name to be and they both wanted to say we are cute at the same time but then one talked over them alright so what do you guys want to call your tik-tok account we are cute perfect we we are cute it is oh yeah I still film the joke even though it doesn't make sense anymore but going forward I'm gonna call them we we are cute and there's nothing you can do to stop okay I could try to describe the type of content they do but I can't so let's watch one you won't believe what my Starbucks sells hey baristas can I get one holiday bagged air please coming up got it so when I first watched this video I was like well there's no way this is real there's no way they actually yelled all those things and did that but when I watched it a second time I realized that I was right they didn't actually do this obviously dude she's walking into the Starbucks yelling at the top of her lungs [Applause] nobody even bats a [ __ ] eye no one even acknowledges her dude and when the employee says coming up it's just so obviously her voice is saying it coming up even when you watch the first part of it when they say you won't believe what's at our Starbucks it even looks like it's voice over so they just dubbed over the whole thing you won't believe what my Starbucks sells do they expect people to think it's real or are they like parroting these types of videos I don't I don't get it dude man it would be wicked funny though if this actually was real like this is a real thing that happened but like she goes into that Starbucks so often and just acts like a lunatic all the time that the the baristas are just used to it here's your coffee sir that'll be $2 Hey yet one holiday bags enemies what the [ __ ] sir you're fine it's she's she's harmless yeah you know she's just kind of gills then we give her an empty bag it's really we she goes away so yeah there's an example of the type of content that they make on tick tock just truly one of a kind that's all I can really say about it and if you're thinking to yourself huh these gals look kind of familiar it's because they are okay these are the girls who were in the first episode of the Bessie pigs base here is that I did on my channel like last year so I've already made a video about them basically and I remember in that video when they mention like what [ __ ] that they like made videos on social media so me and my sister are instagramers and influencers and we make content for apps never in a million years what I have guessed that this these are the videos that they make so aside from these weird like secret menu items videos they do they also have this common thing where they make ramen they just have videos where they make ramen in different ways and they never make ramen the way you're intended to just like they never make videos the way you're intended to which is all wrong ramen mac and cheese it's a thing and milk add flour add your cheddar mix it it should look like this and your ramen and mix take your mini blowtorch and make it brown and enjoy grab your mini blowtorch and make it brown go on go get it go get your mini blowtorch [Music] why aren't you go getting your mini blowtorch you don't you don't have a mini blowtorch [Laughter] oh you [ __ ] loser saucy ramen it's a thing add in your ramen caught a cup of tomato sauce boiling water halfway a sprinkle of parmesan and wait it's a thing okay spaghetti did you know that spaghetti exists [Music] cotton-candy ramen it's the thing cook your ramen add two drops of your cotton candy flavor add your cotton candy color it smells so good and looks even better how to make a delicious carnival Robin tree at home my [ __ ] throw up all over my microphone and it's gonna sound real nice I also love the the two drops a cotton candy flavor and pours the whole [ __ ] bottle in there mom must be that girl in that one video who's like I had two shots of vodka and she pours a half the bottle two shots of vodka those have the same energy yo this house like this is like that video energy okay I can't think about that anymore L sawl a ARP on cam so let's watch one of their pranks their other content is weird but you can't you

Cole a prank on my - it's like she bugged in short circuited or glitched or something dude fake olap rank they do have this really weird style of talking in there tic TOCs though you've probably noticed it is weird because I watched some of the YouTube videos and also in the the bestie fix bad they were in like they talk normal yeah it's more of jello than a like then I'm like a drink alright are you ready to pick my dream guy totally but whenever they film with tik-tok they go into this weird way of speaking where they like emphasize the wrong parts of words it's so weird it's just like glitter prank on my mom she's gonna kick me out of the house Wiener prank on my mom this jumbo push pop might look like a push Bob but it's gonna taste so beefy that's one meet you ollie mom I just filled up my spitting llama hat picking on my sister and giving her a little bit of spit if you can't see here is a little spin wool you like oh well I hope you don't have the [ __ ] volume turned up too loud on this video right now because if someone overheard you of listening to that yikes did hey go on if you can't see here is a little spin wool alright let's watch another one that's similar to the the Starbucks one I just got the Taco Bell meal and I wonder what surprise will be inside look what I got I saw this on BuzzFeed and it's real so beefy dude what's going on dude got like my brain doesn't know what to do when I watch these videos like they're so like all over the place that camera angle - whoa oh my god what did I get do you I just don't understand why they talk like that right do you think this is like who they how they actually talk and the YouTube videos are just like them putting on a character but in everyday life they talk like they're tic TOCs hey what did you what's up what did you what did you want to talk to me about well I think you're great and all but I think we should see other people wait what do you what are you saying I'm sorry I can't keep lying to you this breaks my heart and I'm sad but I never want to see you again Wow I cannot believe you and to think and to think I was gonna take you out for a fancy steak dinner tonight so beefy we're gonna watch one more because a holy [ __ ] this is like the crown jewel of their of their entire tick-tock account this realistic rubber Rock will really fool your friends but kenick fool our mom Rock more like squinch in what the [ __ ] okay so the premise of this prank is they want to fool their mom by using a movie Rock which is a rock that looks like a rock but it's it's it's not real it's on a real rock is a movie rock you know like Dwayne Johnson the movie Rock but it doesn't even look like a rock looks like a bath bomb dude it looks like someone cut a pool noodle and sprinkled glitter on it and then the next scene the sister says Rock more like schooling shin I don't know what that means man with like do you think do you think they write these before or was that improv because if it was improv it has to go on one of those compilations or is like top 10 lines you didn't know were improvised in movies that's got to get in some list somewhere because that's that's genius man I feel like these girls are like living on another plane of existence like we they're like their frequencies are like vibrating on different levels we can't even comprehend they are a theory of ageless otherworldly beings okay they're not humans they can't be okay and then they shush us and then the one sister gets mad at us like we're the weird ones and then the mom what the [ __ ] was that hey hey guys could you explain that dude is your mom a [ __ ] robot bro what are you guys that's that actually would explain so much if you guys were to solve robots it's the mom when she gave birth it's either the mom is a robot or like a really heavy smoker and they have like one of those holes in their neck and both are very possible dude cuz if I if these two are my daughters I'd be a [ __ ] chainsaw created I would smoke some I be I'd be in the DJ group chainsmokers I'd be the third one hey dude this girl said that her favorite band was a chain smokers and the best baek's Bay episode no Ashley like Scott music her favorite is [Music] dude full circle I kicked my camera Wow how did I not realize that before oh my god this goes all the way the top huh I got okay I need to stop I kid
