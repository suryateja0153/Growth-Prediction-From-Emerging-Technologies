 it is 934 we are continuing to follow breaking news in Minneapolis right here on mid-morning I'm Heather break and I'm Jason to Russia let's get you caught up on a busy morning in Minneapolis this was the scene earlier this morning on East Lake Street in 27th Avenue in south Minneapolis is building on fire part of a corner building there that houses a number of restaurants and small businesses this is what it looks like from MnDOT traffic cameras you can see just how big that fire was it really lit up the morning sky and then right around 6:00 a.m. you can see this fire here it's the max at pawn shop it's just off of Cedar Avenue and this video comes in to us from citizen app the entrance the building the top of the building engulfed in flames and just take a look at just how much smoke that billowed out of there and it caught it on our traffic cameras there from miles and miles away back near Lake Street this morning the National Guard and Minnesota State Patrol did form a barrier they were ordering people to stay away from that area the National Guard did leave right around seven o'clock this morning but the State Patrol stayed behind while we bring you the news of the fires and the damage and the unrest we remind you that all of this follows the death of George Floyd on Monday Minneapolis is third precinct has been sort of the epicenter of all of this it's where the officers involved in Floyd's death are believed to have worked and that just went up in flames overnight the city making a decision to abandon the precinct rather than protect it they stood and evacuated as that building was taken over set on fire burned for hours our christian Cordero has been covering all sorts of fires in the area near that precinct in Christian you're in a shopping center just on the other side of 55 this morning we are yep the highlight shopping center this has a seven mile fashion it has a home toys furniture store Dollar General and we've seen these firefighters out here for the past hour trying to put it out as it burned all night long I was talking to some people who live in this area and they said it was it's unbelievable really I mean on so many loved I think that's kind of how we're all feeling right now but just the fact that something like this can be burning for so long and now it's really just the firefighters jobs to make sure it doesn't spread any further than any of those hotspots are kind of contained to where they are but you know this is the the fires themselves have been I guess maybe the big stand out thing that we've been focused on this morning and then you also have all the vandalism on top of it so we're right here in front of City trends and you can see the smashed windows there's a whole lot of graffiti this is maybe the first time that I haven't seen the walls of graffiti just laced with profanity so we can show you most of it don't fan too far to the left there mark so yeah we're of course just trying to wrap our heads around exactly what so many people had to wake up to this morning so many of our local business owners who just were already maybe struggling presumably struggling all of them or if they weren't it's because there are essential businesses so now these grocery stores who are providing food and providing necessities during this pandemic are out of business and they have been looted Jason so it's just really it stuck overall of course and we're at this point just paying attention to Minneapolis Fire as it works to put this out yeah just dozens and dozens of fires they've been trying to put out this morning obviously Christian there's there's no sense as to whether there's like an organized effort by a couple of people to set these fires or if these are all individual I mean that's part of what's being investigated to it is and you know it's interesting it's such a delicate balance to at this point it would be assuming right so it's such a delicate balance to not assume that we understand the people who are causing this much pain to this city and these cities really but we I've spoken with people from all kinds of backgrounds this morning I can tell you that much whether they are personally affected by these kinds of tragedies in the in the livelihood sense because they work or live nearby and then you have people who are protesters and have been doing things so so peacefully and they at the very least are waking up in shock and they can't recognize the city that they've known for so long yeah it's gonna take years to rebuild some of the damage that we're seeing this morning it's tough to handle for sure Christian Cordero your reporting has been incredible thank you and thanks to your crew for their work this morning
