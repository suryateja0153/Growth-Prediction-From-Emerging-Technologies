 hello everyone my name is michelle ortiz-fortel and i'm the director of financial aid at the university of chicago law school and my name is danida cook i'm the admission and financial aid analyst at the university of chicago law school we wanted to take a moment to answer some financial aid questions we frequently hear we understand financial aid can seem like a daunting and stressful process but we want to assure you that we're here to help you every step of the way absolutely so let's jump right in making the decision to attend law school is one that is not taken lightly we understand that financing your law school career is an important backing factor in making the decision to attend the university of chicago law school so michelle can you talk about the different kinds of financial aid that's available to students yeah that's a great place to start um once you're admitted to the university of chicago law school we'll offer a financial aid package that is equal to the cost of attendance the package will include loans and may also include scholarship funds scholarships do not need to be repaid but loans either federal loans or private loans must be repaid after graduation yeah so michelle you mentioned a cost of attendance can you talk a little bit about what cost of attendance is sure the cost of attendance is used to create a budget for students it's really the total amount it will cost for a student to attend the cost of attendance includes direct charges such as tuition and fees and it also includes estimated indirect charges such as room and board books and supplies and other educational related expenses great thanks michelle so you mentioned scholarships and loans so maybe we should spend a little time talking about how to apply for scholarships and or loans so i'll start with scholarships and let you take loans if that's okay sure so all admitted students are considered for admission scholarships we do not require any additional forms for these awards however if a student would like their financial need to be considered then we would request for the student to complete the free application for federal student aid for fafsa and the u-chicago need application providing need information is completely optional and then one more thing to add is we do require parental financial information on both forms if the student is 28 or younger at the time the application is submitted yeah and for federal loans the student must submit the fafsa and add our school code there are two types of loans we'll package students with the federal direct unsubsidized loan and the federal direct graduate plus loan more information about these loan programs can be found in the types of financial aid section on the federal student aid website students can also borrow from a private lender the application and terms of the loan are available directly with that lender and students are not required to accept all loans offered i briefly talked about the cost of attendance a couple of minutes ago and so students can borrow up to the cost of that up to the top of that cost of attendance minus any other aid that they receive such as uh scholarships and things like that yeah speaking of federal loans how does one qualify for a federal loan um well for the loan programs generally speaking both the unsubsidized and the graduate plus loan as long as you are a u.s citizen permanent resident or eligible non-citizen you haven't defaulted previously on a federal student loan and you've completed the fafsa you'll qualify if you're male you'll also need to have registered with the selective service between the ages of 18 25th 18 and 25 excuse me the the big difference between the two loan programs is that the graduate plus loan also requires a credit check yeah so you know we also get international students who apply and are admitted into the university of chicago law school so are these programs available to international students unfortunately international students cannot participate in the federal loan programs however international students are eligible for scholarships and may apply for um private education loans we are unable to assist in the uh the mode of securing a private loan due to conflicting interest and things like that but the university does provide a list of private lenders who have provided loans to our international students um and the in an international student has to apply directly with the lender yeah and you know speaking of scholarships again you know our admitted students are the best of the best and often the admitted student may have a competing scholarship offer so can you just talk a little bit about if we match scholarships that are offered at other institutions absolutely that's a great question generally we don't match awards from other institutions however we are committed to assisting admitted students who are truly interested in studying here at the university of chicago law school with that being said you know we're happy to discuss individual situations and and work through your concerns you know we ask that you email our office um if you would like your award to be reviewed and then you know we'll kind of cover the process uh just know that our funds are limited and we might not be able to revise all awards however we do make our uh we do our best to make the university of chicago a possibility for you yeah and so you know if a student is not offered a scholarship at the time of admission is there an opportunity to reapply you know in their second or third year well um all of our scholarships are three-year awards however we do encourage students to sign up for our newly created listserv where we send our students email updates regarding outside scholarships and their criteria and deadlines we also have an outside scholarship page where we list over a hundred and fifty outside scholarships ranging in awards from 500 to 45 thousand dollars yeah both of those are great resources for students who are looking for scholarships so we've talked about scholarships and loans something else that we commonly get is does the university of chicago law school offer any loan assistance for students who are pursuing public interest careers um yeah absolutely we're very proud of the loan assistance program and we think it provides great benefits to our alumni um graduates who work in the public or non-for-profit sectors and who've borrowed um through the federal direct loan programs are strongly encouraged to apply for what we call our lrap program alumni alumni can take the maximum advantage of our assistance in combination with the federal public service loan program loan forgiveness program or pslf um some highlights of our lrap program including uh include uh providing full salary i'm sorry full funding for salary up to eighty thousand um potential partial funding for those who make between that eighty thousand and ninety thousand range um students can participate up to ten years post graduation and they can come in and out of the program as their situation eligibility changes within those 10 years students do need to be in the appropriate income based repayment plan in order to qualify and right now those consist of uh the ibr income based repayment plan the um pay uh or what's also known as pay as you earn or the repay revised pay as you earn um there is also an annual cap on this program so for those of you who are interested or have questions i would advise you to check out our website or you know contact one of
