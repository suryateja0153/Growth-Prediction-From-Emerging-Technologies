 hello friends today's video is about this   this is a HOTAS joystick and throttle  system for your playstation controller.   it's 3d printed and you can download the files.  just print one out. snap it all together like this if the pieces are a bit tight just use the force.   and now you can play microsoft flight simulator  or any flight game that you have with a bit more   realism. it's a bit of plastic where you have your  joystick here and through this linkage and these   ball joints this large stick now controls your  little stick. the throttle is similar but it's got   a little bit of tape for friction so it stays in  place so you can go low throttle or full throttle Flight Simulator now has Tokyo so i  get to fly all these familiar places why isn't this update the altimeter what?  vario-wesome! what could be rudder than   getting to fly over your own house? so that would  be where the emperor lives and here's hibiya park   this should be shinagawa i think i really love the weather simulations  in this game it's really nice wait a minute that's no moon it's a space station!   that's right friends star wars squadrons is out  and everyone's playing space combat simulations   again. you could use a HOTAS system like this for  space combat as well but i think you all see that   it's lacking a few things so that's why i made a  few upgrades. watch out it comes with a trigger warning and here it is it's two sticks two triggers two  thumb sticks they all pull on these buttons here   you have your both hands on there so it's hands  on stick and stick so who's ass grab your service   droid and turn on your targeting computers go hunt  down some thai fighters all right come on r2 uma so we have two sticks two triggers two thumb  buttons and for the face buttons you have   to reach out for the faces here uh in  oculus you can actually tap on your face   so you can see the face buttons  that's why it's called a face button   all right this is making me sick  r2 turn off the targeting computer right so it kind of does work in vr but it might   make you a little bit sick  so you try it out yourself all right let's get one kill i suppose i should thank you i eat ships like you for lunch i mean  literally i ate a wing for lunch today so obviously it does work it's a bit flimsy  second of all i'm really bad at this game too r2 how do you get good at star wars squadrons so as you can see the triggers are pulled by   these strings that's all the thumb buttons so it's  a bit flimsy but so is the original design funny   thing about these space games is there's really no  reason to actually roll so as to orient yourself   with the plane of everyone else but i find myself  still doing these coordinated turns in this game   just as a courtesy to other players all perhaps  to fulfill the uh sci-fi tropes if nothing else this game is really good because it  lets you customize the controls yourself   so the default controls are almost like an fps  game like shooter game which is funny for a space   combat simulation my first instinct would then  be to first of all get inverse pitch so you pull   towards yourself to go up and next to have the  roll and pitch on this right hand stick just   like when i'm flying a real airplane and on the  other hand i would have the throttle and the yaw   but on yet another hand i also fly these drones  for that i use one of these with two sticks also   see and it just so happens that here in japan  where i started flying these things this right   stick is your throttle and the left one is your  pitch so it's reversed for those two controls   and flying a 3d spaceship like this is actually  more reminiscent of flying a drone so for me it   actually makes sense to assign this as your  throttle over here and this is your pitch so   that's how i'm gonna go with it then you get your  pew pew lasers on this one and i think this is for   targeting i think you can turn this around i think  targeting might not be as useful as something else oh and the game even has a setting for  if you're feeling a bit on the dark side you can attack a star destroyer too  this is cool what is that oh my god   so how do you like it my two stick whose ass why  don't you print one for yourself try it out see if   you like it if it gets you better scores in star  wars but you can of course use it in all games   so you could just have this trigger version  of the joystick on your right hand and have   the throttle over here for any sort of airplane  game almost remember it's still a very flimsy   thing especially with these triggers this is  really at the limit of what you can do with a   plastic add-on so if you're looking for a  really good hot ass system you can print   one of my stand-alone joysticks it's got usb  support and so you don't need to have your   playstation in there it's it's got all the  buttons you need and it's not flimsy at all and if you want a whose ass like this hey it's  3d printing just make it mirrored and make two   of them it should take you you know one day to  build one of these i also have models of this   sort of thing for all the popular gamepads out  there xbox and 360 switch find the download links   below the files come with no strings attached  literally you'll have to get your own string   for modeling the thing actually this time  i didn't go the route i did before where i   found a 3d model of the controller i wanted to  fix it to because i learned from my mistakes   before the 3d models available for free of  all these gamepad controllers actually don't   reflect reality well enough for you to be able  to design a mount around them so instead of using   cad i actually used a note pad and sketched  out just my best guess of what the cross   section of this gamepad might be and only  after that did i go to cad and make a simple   cheap mock-up of that shape in plastic and so  this is based off of that sort of mocking up   process another funny thing is i wanted to improve  upon the ball and socket joint design because   there was a lot of problems with them in the past  where the tolerances were too tight or too loose   so i looked to the world standard of plastic  ball and socket joints which is of course lego   so i got myself some lego pieces and checked  out how they did i think lego has about two or   three different sizes or standards of ball and  sockets but i went with the most sensible one i   hope you found that interesting and i hope  you have fun printing out one for yourself   until next time thank you for  watching and may the force be with you
