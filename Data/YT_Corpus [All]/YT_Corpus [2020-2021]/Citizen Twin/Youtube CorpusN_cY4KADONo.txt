 the league i was playing in didn't felt like i didn't have really fair teams so i didn't get the ball a lot so i decided to try a different sport and football was in season then so i decided to try and i actually liked it well i like that it's different not a lot of girls play it but i enjoy the sport like just playing with the ball and like it's fun to catch and run with it like after soccer like like she said it was like very unfair teams that we played in and i first tried dance and i didn't really like it so i got into more like tumbling and stuff and i really like that and i wanted to cheer on kylie so i tried it for two years it's kind of cool for like someone or like a girl to be on the football team because normally that's not like very usual and it's really exciting to see her play
