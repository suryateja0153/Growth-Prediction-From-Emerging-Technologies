now the second annual i want to know  what you did last summer internship showcase   event thank you for being here we have a great  student panel joining us today to share a little   bit about their experiences um in internships  in the last summer and even some before that   today there's going to be opportunities for  you to ask questions and interact with our   panelists i hope that you'll

keep an eye out for rebecca to get us started if  we could go around perhaps in the same order and   have each of you describe your internship in a few  sentences or maybe in 30 seconds tell us a little   bit more about the the work you've done and the  experience you've had so far um so we'll go back   to you tessa yeah um so i messed up i said studio  guild i met screen directors guild of ireland um   basically it's a union um they're a representative  body for directors of ireland and they lobby   and promote um directors welfare and so what i  do for them is i am a special projects manager so   every other thursday we host live q and a's with  different directors i send out mailchimps to our   audience to the directors to say like what's going  on different events they can do to get involved i   manage the social media and um i do whatever else  my boss tells me to do because there's a lot that   can fall under special projects but it's a lot of  fun it is unpaid but um because um there are five   hours ahead i've been working mornings and um  that's been working out pretty well for me so so i work for and i i've started in the spring  for college of arts and letters marketing team   and i've i moved over to the summer and i'm still  in the fall and we'll probably go for it further   into the spring as well um for them me and a  few other interns work on writing articles for   the college we maintain their social media  platforms and for the articles we'll write   about students faculty events on campus a lot  of stuff and this summer i actually was able to   do more digital work and help migrate our  old site to a new platform so that was   that taught me a lot i did i'm not a  techy person so that was great to learn   and understand and showed me that marketing  could be a part of my future and it is paid and   it's it's like a family there so that's really  fun and it's on campus you also get to learn more   about the college of arts letters and i thought  that was nice since it's our college so yeah um so being an editorial intern basically i  um i did a lot of editing and proofreading   and that was usually um like longer form projects  for um uh other parties being published by   our media and then i also did a lot of um article  writing which had to do with um i wrote for   michigan wine country and missouri wine  country funnily enough and it was like i   conducted interviews and i wrote and i was able  to publish while i was with them um and then the   other stuff i did was like research anything my my  managing editor asked me to do um it was unpaid um   and remote um it was i thought it was a really  amazing experience and anytime that i get to   publish more is is a really welcome uh opportunity so for mine i actually wasn't anticipating  on it being an internship but it's kind of   something that i took and turned it into  an internship of itself like i said i've   worked with new student orientation since last  summer so i started off as an orientation leader   and then they give like awesome opportunities to  move up in the department so i applied and i got   a position as a student coordinator um and like  i said i needed an internship and another one of   my co-workers had said that they used their job  as their internship so i kind of made it my own   and talked to my boss and she signed off on it  and um yeah what i did was just work with like   the new students coming in um i wasn't a leader  but i oversaw all the leaders and i kind of just   helped them and dealt with cranky parents when i  needed to talk to advisors when i needed to made a   lot of connections across camp campus as a whole  so it's been really good for making connections um and then at rgm wealth management um my main  responsibilities were growing their social media   content as well as their client communication  content um and for the social media i was   in charge of things like their linkedin their  facebook and writing and building their website   as well so there was a lot of marketing  involved and i was responsible for that as a career peer intern with college  of arts and letters i simply um review   and critique resumes as well as cover letters or  help students develop them for job opportunities   or just opportunities in general i also help  with planning events for the college of arts   and letters as it relates to um maybe like  career um seminars and panels just like this   um i have also done some overlap with helping  with cal nso and enrolling them in classes also the internship is paid and uh i would  also say that since i'm a senior that   it could pop up on handshake uh after the spring awesome very good so you might have noticed a  pattern with our students i i did ask them to to   confirm or share if they were doing paid or unpaid  internships i think there's lots of opportunities   out there and there's also lots of resources  especially for those unpaid internships that   msu and the college of arts and letters can help  offer funding if you find an unpaid internship   as a reminder you're welcome to submit  questions in the q a or if you'd like to   ask a question like you can indicate that in the  q a and and we can connect you to our panelists   another question i have to to perhaps continue our  conversation um could each of you share a little   bit about how you connect your work in english  or in film studies to the work that you've done   in your in your internships thus far and i would  say this is for anybody to go ahead and jump in i guess for me a huge one was  just like communication as a whole   um that's kind of what i focused on is being  able to talk to people and connect with   people as well as like communicating out with  emails and just any sort of like documentation   and making sure that everybody was kind of  just getting the instruction they needed   um so that's kind of where i connected  english and um you know my internship together um so currently um i'm in the fiction  filmmaking minor and for that i'm doing the   producing um of the short film that we make  and uh my internship has kind of helped like   understand how directors are working with  covet and guidelines that they have to follow   um as well as like different ways that they  stay organized or how they work on film sets   um how they communicate with their  actors different um just techniques   that you wouldn't uh think of if you weren't  on the job so um that's been pretty helpful with my major professional  writing it's a really broad major   but my internship showed me that my professional  writing could be brought into the marketing   world because i helped write articles which  then come toward my english major because i   didn't i wasn't sure if i'd be able to write as  much but i wanted to and our articles consist   of like interviewing students or faculty doing  research about events on campus interviewing   people who are running the events and it showed me  a different part of professional or p2w now it's   called professional public writing and it kind of  gave me a definition of that major which was is   always a hard thing to find if you are a p2w major  um and i feel that with the english it helped me   broaden my writing aspects and not just creativity  but more like telling a story in a different way um for me i think a really important part was  um i'm a like a fiction writer by trade and i   also write a lot of poetry so article writing  and more like journalistic types of writing   didn't wasn't something that  really came very easily to me   um so getting to experiment with those different  types and kind of working on um condensing   what i'm saying and that sort of thing was  really i felt was helpful just as a whole for my internship i had a lot of freedom to  write with their website there was no template   so i was able to do what i wanted to do however it  is a restrictive business so there's only certain   things i can say um on their website so everything  i wrote had my employer had to foresee so he had   to there were a lot of changes i had to make  or things that he liked but everything that i   wrote was to better attract new clients and to  best reflect or represent the business so i had   a lot of but i had a lot of freedom to write  and use my skills from english classes um and   i was also able to be creative such as coming  up with their tagline and things like that so   to kind of second what kelsey brought  up about writing concisely um i think uh   this internship has definitely been helpful  for me because when people are doing resumes   you have to speak um kind of in quick  statements and it's not always so structural   and um you know with the pre-law major you're  writing a lot of lengthy things and reading a   lot of lengthy things so this is a good practice  because when you actually get into law school   you'll find that people may do briefs or try to  cut a lot of information down in certain instances   so yeah this has definitely made  me uh a better writer overall awesome we have our first question  um from from the from the group of   attendees um i'm going to combine this with  another question so their question reads   what is the best place to look for internship  opportunities so if you have thoughts on   that we can go around the table but also you  might share how did you find your internship i found mine i was looking for one and was having  a really hard time i wanted to go through public   publication but i couldn't find one and  i my advisor was emailing out all these   opportunities so really look at your advisor  emails they might have a hidden gem in there   i had that and i went out for it and got it  so always read your advisor emails don't skim   through them i know you get a lot but i highly  recommend looking through them reading through   them and seeing if you are interested  in that internship or job opportunity um so i've had three internships over the course  of my college career so my first one i didn't have   any experience going in um i was a sophomore in  college so i did um an internship with home tv   which is based in okemos and i found them through  a google search um so sometimes just googling can   help you find things pretty simply enough and then  my second one i interned for traverse city film   festival um last summer and that one i found  through classmates so you can find like your   peers are good resources you can ask them where  they're interning what they're up to if you have   linkedin you can always see what other people  are up to um that's what i like to do and then   for my global internship i um studied abroad last  spring semester and that i was only there for two   months but i when i was there initially i was like  i don't really want to come home so i was supposed   to be in ireland in dublin um all the spring  and then for the entire summer i was going to   be in london and then that got cancelled so i  just found that through the study abroad page   and then the one i'm currently currently doing  i got an email about but it's the same format   of um like it's kind of through the study abroad  program but not remote that's a lot of words but i just think for me it's like super  important to realize that like   you're like what you're applying for doesn't  have to say it's an internship like you can   completely take like your job and turn it into  an internship um so that's just like a really fun   tip it's not something that i knew that i could do  beforehand so i was like panicking that i was like   i have a job already so like how do i find an  internship while also doing a job um so it was   just really nice to know that like i could turn  my job into an internship so i think that was nice   i would definitely add that um handshake is a  great msu resource where there's a lot of people   even alumni a lot of times looking for students  like us so that's a great resource um i would also   add um i was going to say like good old-fashioned  networking and going to events and things like   that but that's kind of been uh cut down due to  covet but a lot of times just reaching out to   people uh who you've become acquainted with really  helps i mean i've gotten some internships just   based off the fact that somebody remembered who i  was so uh definitely being outgoing is a huge um   component to landing internships that might not  necessarily be available to anyone um so yeah um my internship i did find it uh through a  google search i just happened to come across it   it wasn't listed on handshake or anything like  that it was just through the company's website   but another thing i would say is that um  professors were really helpful to me um   i had a couple of writing professors that  i kind of talked to through this process   and even if it's not you know having them if  they're not able to specifically give you um   like the actual information for uh an  internship they can also just be helpful in like   narrowing your search giving you an idea of  like what type of internship you're looking for   uh specific places you can look at um so again  like like other people have said using the the   resources and the people around you do really  want to help you out with that as well so um yeah for mine i originally started looking on  linkedin um and a few other websites handshake   and then i decided to check in  with my connection so i checked in   with my family at first and so i actually  found this internship through my mom   and from there got an interview  unfortunately got this opportunity   um but yeah so another probably piece of advice  is to check through like the people you know   um and your family as well because you never know  what opportunities you can find that way as well awesome um rebecca i want to have you jump in  um thank you for coming and joining us despite   the technical difficulties um if you would could  you introduce yourself uh say a little bit about   your major as well as your internship experience  thus far yeah um sorry guys technical difficulties   um uh yeah my name is rebecca holman i um i'm an  english major and i did the disney college program   so last semester i went away to go to walt disney  world where i worked as a lifeguard um and it was   one of the best experiences of my life i sort  of applied to it as like a sort of i knew it was   always something i wanted to do so i applied  for it as like a test run sort of thing and   just so i could get a feel of what the application  process would look like and then i got in somehow   um so it was very exciting um it was a great  internship and then i'm also the citizen scholars   intern i do a lot of social media stuff um and  things like that so i'm glad to meet you all awesome so our next question um do you have any  advice for someone applying for an internship   that can help make their application stand out yes so um what i would highly recommend is having  someone look over your resume and your cover   letter before you send it in because you might  think you have like the most magnificent resume   ever odds are you don't um i definitely had my  resume torn apart um but there's like resources in   cal alone that are really helpful so that's what i  did and there's like just different ways that you   should word things to sound more professional  and precise and um just like knowing how to   market yourself sometimes you just need a second  eye to like look over everything just a second   what uh tessa just said um spend a lot of time  on your bullet points um a lot of times people   don't realize that you should kind of tailor your  resume to the specific position or company that   you're applying for so a lot of times we figure  well why am i not getting any opportunities um   or call backs it's not because your resume is bad  but you haven't really done the due diligence of   um kind of speaking to what they're looking for  specifically so um yeah that's what i would say something i kind of learned i'm like applying  for jobs after graduation right now um so finally   getting my big girl job but i didn't know that  um companies actually use this system that like   looked for keywords within your resume um and then  if you didn't have it they kind of just like threw   your resume out um so i've been like looking at  job descriptions and fixing my resume each time i   apply for a new job and adding in like things that  they have in their job descriptions so if you like   do that then you have like more of a  chance of actually somebody like seeing it   so that's been really helpful alexia are you  talking about quicken loans by chance because   i learned that the hard way i have no idea how i  figured it out um somebody told me they're like   um you know like you don't have anything that  matches their job description and your resume so   they completely have gotten  rid of you that's a great point i guess for me um the the whole resume thing  that's very important and then if you do get   to like the interview step be personable with them  don't be like a robot kind of connect i connected   weirdly in weird ways like i have a twin and then  my employer now he has twin daughters so that was   like a personal connection we like connected on um  so try to don't overdo it where it's all about you   but see things recognize things and try to  make that connection with them so you're not   looking just answering the questions right  on that makes you not really interesting yeah i'm just a small thing kind  of just to agree with everyone   um i have been doing the same where um each  new thing i'm applying for i'm researching   um the specific job and what they're looking  for and i'm having a new copy of my my resume   each time to make sure that it's reflecting the  um the specific things that they're looking for um i'm gonna agree with everyone else as well um  especially when i was um filling up or writing my   resumes i was also looking for keywords reading  the description really carefully to make sure i   had a lot of those words in there and also  another thing is to not write too too much   information on one page just just put what's most  important to you what you think would best reflect   um the job and so when employers see too much they  might want not want to hire you for that reason i'm also just gonna volunteer devon  because i know he does resume reviews   so since devin's not gonna say  it himself i will say it for him   thanks rebecca yeah so i'll definitely also  probably uh give my information specifically   on how to book appointments to andrew rafter  but you guys are basically uh you guys should   probably have my job because these are all  points i made in the presentation today awesome um somewhat related to this  question maybe folks can elaborate   um if i don't have anything on my resume that  connects to the field that i want to go into   how do i break into my desired job or  internship without those experiences um so what i always like to do when i'm applying  for something that might be like not is especially   like what i have um familiarity in is to  tailor my resume um to this job so like even if   i don't have the exact skill that they're looking  for if i have like applicable other things i kind   of tailor like maybe you worked at like a grocery  store or something so then you have personable   skills that you can communicate with others in  a respectful manner just kind of tailoring your   skills that you already have and putting them into  a job that you think that they would benefit from and kind of going off that um for mine  i literally had like assistant coach   on there but seeing that like i was kind of in a  leadership role and like worked well with others   i think that helps because i had nothing with  marketing on my resume but the words that you   use in those bullet points like devin had said  before can show who you are as a as a worker   and that might draw them to you even if it doesn't  have a connection to what you're applying for and sometimes we'll kind of assume when we're  writing our resume because it makes sense to us   that they'll be able to draw certain  correlations but you shouldn't leave anything   um up to interpretation so sometimes we can  think to ourselves like okay well obviously if i   uh was a manager here that shows i have  leadership abilities but it's important   that you point out you don't want to leave  anything up to chance because you have to remember   you're in a pile of 50 if not 100 and you really  want to stand out and leave nothing up to chance   awesome thank you so much um our next question is  uh about letters of recommendation did any of you   have to get letters of recommendation for your  internships i'll say a couple head nuts couple   yeses a couple no's um for those of you who  said yes um say more about that who did you   ask and what was that process like so um for an  internship that i applied for but did not get   um i did have to provide a letters of  recommendation um one of them was that i   asked she uh her name is kate sanka she works for  the university and i went on a study abroad uh or   study away trip to la where we like did networking  and stuff and she was one of um the uh advisors   for that um and so i kept a close connection with  her and then i would also ask like professors   um if you have good connections with your  professors i think they're a really good   resource because they want to see their students  succeed so um those were the kinds of people i asked i didn't have to for my internship that  i have or a job that i have but i have had two   in the past and i think it's like really  important to or especially for like when i   was younger like coming in like my freshman  year i had to like really like think about   okay like i don't really have that many  connections with like professors and stuff   um so i even like looked back into high school  and like asked like teachers that i was really   close with um i had my coach that i'm still  like really close with and she still writes me   recommendation letters like up until like now um  and then just like previous bosses that i've had   is also super helpful um just making sure that  you don't end your job off on like bad terms   um and still like having that connection  with a boss is like really important as well yeah um for mine i ended up reaching out to  the professor who was in charge of my research   project that i was working on and that worked out  really well for me but um going through like that   application process was something where i kind of  thought to myself like okay like moving forward   when i'm having more classes i'm going to try  to like connect more with professors because i'm   generally a quiet person but it's something good  to keep in mind to make sure that you know if   you want to have those connections you want to  have people you can reach out to that you have a   um a personal connection with them so that if you  ask for a letter they can they can speak from like   experience and say things about you so yeah i  would also add that you should be very strategic   a lot of times we just think well we can only ask  people who um we've had a lot of interaction with   but sometimes if someone is  in a specific field or can   vouch for something that's a skill that  you need for that specific job or position   it might be better to get with them uh even if  you don't have as strong as a relationship if   you would with the other person so i would just  say uh use your discretion and be um about that i want to jump on something that kelsey had  mentioned talking about establishing relationships   with our professors because that's one of the  questions that just popped up how do you all   go about making connections with professors  as it relates to then being able to reconnect   with them and ask them for letters of support and  recommendation what tips or tricks do you have to   uh to make those connections well i'm  really bad at it i wish i did it more   because i'm a senior now and applying to grad  schools i had to pull stuff out of my butt   but i highly recommend going to office hours i  wish i went to more they're just times so like   even if you don't have anything to ask the  professor get to know the professor a lot of them   just want to sit down and get to know you like  have a cup of coffee with them in the morning have   a nice chat with them get to know them have them  know you so then they can remember who you are   and in your senior year if you need a  letter recommendation you can go to them um oh no go ahead   sorry so um for me this is kind of more for like  an in-person setting i guess because it's a little   bit different with um the pandemic and online  learning but i'm a chronically early person so   i would get to class like ridiculously early just  for no reason like i'm just an early person and   um so it would just be me and my professor and  then they're just kind of you're either forced   to talk to them or you just sit there in silence  for a weird amount of time so um yeah so i would   definitely just do that and then also i just  think it really helps if you participate in class   like um for me i just learn best when i'm talking  and asking questions and participating and so i   would um your professors remember who's  participating so i would recommend that um and mine was actually like perfectly  piggybacking off of yours um i was more   or i'm doing better at it now that we're  like the whole like zoom university thing   um because it's like easier for me to i use  like the private message function so like i   always like private message my professor so they  like see my name and they like know it's me asking   the question um so like just in terms of like how  we're living life now i guess that's like my big   tip is like messaging them privately like so that  they know that you have like a personal question   um because i know like sitting in a zoom room of  like 200 students can be like super intimidating   and you don't want to be that one person to like  turn your mic on and like have your background   noise and like talk and try to interrupt their  lecture um i also have been doing like when they   say something like i'll use like the clap  emoji or like i'll use like the thumbs up   like so that they know that i'm like engaged  um and in one of my english classes he like   actually is always like oh another thumbs up from  alexia like he like knows my name now just because   he like always sees that like i'm the one giving  like the reactions um so just in terms of like now   and how we're doing things right now i guess  like that has been really helpful for me um for me i would get um in some classes  if i needed help before after school um   i would talk to the teacher then and ask  them how they're doing things like that   or sometimes even if i was the last person on  a class i had teachers who would stop me and   ask me how i was doing and then i would  ask them about how they're doing as well   so that's how i kind of grew connections  with my teachers in that way as well um what are some things that you all learned from  your internship maybe things that you expected to   learn but maybe also things that you didn't expect  to learn through that just professional experience   so um with disney it's kind of odd because i  mean you know um it's kind of it lifeguard is   not immediate when you see a lifeguard you don't  automatically think oh yes she's an english major   um so um the skills i learned really while working  at disney were like you know teamwork and working   in a group and um i want to be a teacher someday  so classroom management um skills through you   know how to communicate um rules with people you  know i could basically say please stop running   uh on the pool deck in my sleep you know um  and learning how to communicate with people and   um things like that so even if the um  internship might not seem immediately   uh english major e it's always you can always  learn skills from it and learn new things   i'm not learning new things i went in thinking i  was just going to write articles post on instagram   all that well we were for our marketing team  we were shifting from a new website platform   so like i said before i'm not a techie person i  was very nervous and they asked in the interview   if i can deal with technology and i was like yeah  i know what i post on social media and then they   threw this at me so thankfully i had a lot of  people there to help and it was a new tool i   learned i know how to use wordpress and concrete5  and how to i could make my own website now so that   was a very good learning experience but also i  learned how to ask questions i don't like asking   questions because i feel like i'm a burden but  ask questions they are there to help you and help   you succeed not fail they want you to do good it's  their business so don't be afraid to ask questions   yeah i have to agree a lot with jenna but seeing  that we work for the same uh kind of organization   i can see a lot of the similarities uh for  instance when i was hired i was just thinking   well i'll see students every day uh they'll bring  in their resume i'll critique it send them back   that's it you know but it has been a lot more  than that uh presentations i do uh classroom   presentations um i've also uh had to work with  wordpress sometimes with the website for cal   um a lot of things having to do with uh  communication planning things so a lot of times   when we're applying for these opportunities you'll  end up growing a lot because you'll be doing much   more than is expected and that's not a bad thing  because um it's more for you to put on that   resume like we've already talked about so yeah  yeah one big thing for me that i really didn't   expect going into an editorial internship and  expecting to be writing and stuff like that was   the amount of um communication that was necessary  interviewing people and stuff like that and um you   know before this i was one of those you know jen's  ears that would rather do anything than make a   phone call so um it was definitely something that  like didn't come very easily to me at first but um   having that opportunity and like that motivation  to have to do what i i'm so thankful for because   um i mean that in general is just like a life  skill that i probably should have developed   a while ago but didn't have so it kind of um i  think was really helpful for me in the long run so for me it's been really interesting to see how  a film studies degree can be applicable to like   marketing and website um briefing sorry if you  hear scratching my cat is going insane right now   for whatever reason so that's great but um um  yeah so i've had like my internship currently   is like way away from like film theory and  that kind of like even film production like   i've been um sending out like mass emails i had  to create an infographic like i don't have a   graphic design background or anything like that um  i had to figure out how to create a website brief   because um our company is moving websites and  we're hiring people and i had to figure out   what we needed in a website and then i also  had to update our old website and like add   profiles so i had to figure out how to do that  so it's been like a lot of learning on the spot   which is nice but it's also kind of insane  but um it's like nice to have like um   these new skills that i did and like a new  confidence in myself and being able to do   things that i didn't know that i could do or that  was applicable through a film studies degree so um for me teamwork and flexibility  has definitely been like huge   um i did not foresee covet at all as i'm sure  none of us did but we had this whole program like   um i'm not sure if everybody knows but orientation  has changed um from aop to nso um so me coming in   as a student coordinator we had to completely flip  the program we got a new director and everything   um so that was like fun for me i was like oh yeah  like we get to rebuild the whole program and then   like um as soon as march hit we had to learn  that we had to rebuild the whole whole program   like again um but in a short amount of time like  we had like a month to like rechange the program   and shove it all on to the computer um when we had  already basically finished our summer plans um so   flexibility was just huge that's not something i  had planned at all and we had to work as a team um   which previous to that we were working in teams um  but this was more like i guess like relationship   type thing that we had to deal with like our  frustrations with each other and our frustrations   or frustrations coming from like students and  parents coming in um they don't really know who   to target so they come right after new student  orientation and um so just having to deal with   like i don't know anger and different emotions  that i never thought would be coming at me   was something that is actually really  rewarding in the end i feel like i can   communicate my feelings and thoughts a lot  better so it's been really beneficial for me um so going into my internship at first it was  really difficult because i knew nothing about   the business i knew nothing about financial  advising and i was kind of just told to start   working on their website so it was a lot at once  i had to research about the company and learn   a lot of new things i had to ask a lot  of questions to my employer and to other   workers there so they were a big help but there  was a lot of learning that needed to be done   as i was writing and building their website so  it was difficult but i did learn that you have   to keep working hard and stay motivated and  if there's research to be done you have to do   anything you can but as long as you're motivated  you'll eventually get where you want to be can any of you speak to any um  unique and interesting challenges   that you had faced on during your internship well i was in the office from the spring and  then all of a sudden was booted into my um   apartment so with kovid so learning and  adapting how to stay communicating through   like teams and email was a struggle because we  were all literally like six feet away from each   other in the building so and i had three other  interns with me that i could ask questions to   and my boss to make to clear this before posting  that so changing to covid was a big challenge and   remotely um but i learned time management better  i learned how to be patient with communication   and that no some someone would get back to me and  covet stinks but it does teach you good things for   the future because i might work remotely later  on in life and now i kind of know how to do it i would just add um yeah the time management  thing definitely especially since we're on   zoom i don't know why but for me it seems like  time management is harder since we're sitting   in the same spot for most of the day but also i  think the biggest challenge for me was leadership   so a lot of times um sometimes they'll ask  you to do something and lead perhaps a team   and sometimes that can be a little challenging  uh or you can be scared to do it when you're   working with your peers um however that is a good  thing because uh you know it shows that they're   they you know they value you or believe in you  however sometimes it can be hard to transition   from you know being your peer and then leading uh  people who you consider your friends or coworkers um for my job i had to learn a lot of new skills  really fast so um my program the first thing you   do is traditions and it's all happy and we're  like yay we love that you're working for the   disney company awesome here's your name  tag mickey mouse is gonna bring it to you   and it's great and then a couple days  later it's you're in lifeguard training   and it's very serious and you have to learn how to  you know pack a wound to do cpr you know in case   anybody like decides to die um so you um you're  learning all these new and different skills and   it's learning how to adapt to those skills  quickly um so trainings can be intense but   they provide a different challenge of you know  making sure you're learning new things quickly how   to learn those things um how to do that with time  management again um so yeah that was my challenge so my challenge has been um my boss really  likes the motto of um move fast and break things   um so she said that she'd rather have me like  send things out that maybe aren't like perfect   and that she would have notes on then to  not do anything at all and i see my boss   maybe once a day and sometimes i like  don't talk to her all in a day and   it's just kind of like i have to be completely  independent and responsible and make sure like   i'm staying on task and doing what she wants but  also like not having that communication and then   also being in a five hour time difference  um has been a little bit of a challenge   but it's taught me to be more confident in  myself and my ability to work independently mine was definitely the independence thing also  um i think i work really well off of like other   people and seeing them work hard makes me want  to work harder um i guess it's kind of like   a competitive thing too um but just like being  at home um i have like my dogs as a distraction   i have like it was so nice out it was like the  summer time i wanted to go outside like go to the   beach i wanted to lay with my friends like all my  friends were back home too so i just want to like   hang out with them um whereas like they gave us  a little bit more freedom being online because we   did have like those increments where we were just  like kind of waiting it out for like our students   to get done or waiting it out for like somebody to  contact you um so just making sure that i was like   staying on top of things and messaging people back  right away so they weren't getting frustrated um   was just like a really huge challenge for me  that i eventually just caught on to and was   really good at um just being on top of my tasks  was something that i had to um you know adapt to   rather than being right there with my tasks i had  to wait for them to come up to me on the computer yeah and i think um like learning to ask  questions and admit when you don't know something   is was even harder for me to do uh  being remote because i feel like you   know having these quick conversations with  people over zoom or just over email it was   it felt a lot harder to admit those things and  it might have been easier to just say yeah i   know how to do that and then i would be faced  with it i would have no idea what i'm doing um   so kind of learning that um the people there did  want to help and had no problem with me asking   questions especially since a lot of this was  like new stuff to me um just yeah having the   having the um motivation i guess to ask those  things and do the best job you can do with it um i agree with that i feel like questions are  really important um especially when i was at my   internship again i didn't know too much about um  the field at first and um so when i was writing   on the website i would ask my employer frequently  here and there if what i was writing was right if   um it looked good and if it would look good  to clients as well and so he would tell me   you know where i was wrong or where  it looked good what he liked and so   it was a big learning experience but um you  just have to have the confidence you have to ask   questions and don't be afraid because it's better  to do something right and then to be confused and   then do something wrong and have it cause an  issue so it's better to ask more questions awesome well we're coming close to the  end of our time together so i want to um   for our panelists give you maybe 30 seconds  or so to think about the following question   as we wrap up i'm really interested if you could  give a one or two sentence kind of one liner   of what's your advice for students as they're  approaching this next stage as they're looking for   internships and doing career planning what's  that that one quick thing that you would share   with them the quotable thing that we'll put  on our website after this webinar concludes   so i want to give you some time to think about  that but i also want to thank you for being   here and i want to recognize that our community  in english we have such a vibrant community of   great students and anytime we can get a group of  them together to share their experiences i think   is really awesome and i'm super excited and proud  to have this group with us today so i want to show   our attendees in the department of english we  do our best to show our gratitude for for our   peers and colleagues and study so all of you  on the panel we'll be getting um a version of   this electronic certificate that shows my  appreciation um for you joining us today so   anytime you show your leadership and and represent  for the department we're always going to shout you   out so that's going to be coming to your inboxes  soon um so if we could go around the around the   world one more time and have you all share um a  piece of partying advice that would be outstanding um i guess i would say that um all experiences  are something that you can learn from   um so you might get an internship  and be like i don't want to do this   in life that's okay because they're all here to  teach you a lesson in some way or shape or form for me i would say go for it i know it's scary   and you just kind of want to sit down and have it  come to you but you got to do the research you got   to go for it and know it's in your best interest  and it'll teach you to be more independent and   a better person yeah i would say um  when you're looking for opportunities um   it's really just a matter of putting yourself out  there you know never assume that um an opportunity   is like too big or too far beyond your level  whatever that means you know or anything like that   um give it a try the worst that's going to happen  is you're not going to get it but the the best   that's going to happen is you are going to get it  it's going to be a great new experience for you so yeah definitely just kind of voicing what  everybody else said um jump outside your comfort   zone you know apply to that internship that you  might not meet all the criteria for because at   the end of the day they could love like the one  thing that you said in your resume and just give   you a shot and you can just blow them away in  your interview so even if you don't have five   years experience like you could still have like  that one experience that you can really voice over   so i think yeah you can definitely go for it um  my advice is that when you're at your internship   um it's good not just to do what the test that is  given to you from your employer but at the end of   the day to go up to him or her and say is there  anything else i can do or is there anything else i   can help you with or learn um because you there's  the opportunity to gain so many more skills than   you anticipated so it's always good to learn these  things and ask to help um with more things as well um for me just be open to everything um  you can make magic no matter where you are um i would just say reach low medium and high  and do every can you can everything you can to   be the best applicant thank you all so  much for spending your evening with us   um thank you so much to our panelists for sharing  your wisdom and expertise on these things
