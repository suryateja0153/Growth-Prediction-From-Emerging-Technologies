 welcome minister tang it's such a pleasure to welcome you here and i know it must be very very early in the morning for you and we had a little connectivity issues but we're glad you were with us ladies and gentlemen if you're still in the audience thank you for being with us we now have the great privilege to welcome audrey tang who's the digital minister from the republic of china otherwise known to us as chai as taiwan she's a leading open source programmer and at age 35 became the youngest ever minister in the government of taiwan where her responsibilities include citizen engagement online the e-response to covet 19 and we're also with several technology companies she worked to battle disinformation from actors in taiwan's recent presidential campaign minister tang thank you so much for being with us hello um i'm audrey and really happy to be here and good local time everyone thank you i'm on east coast time but our west coast friends are all still watching because it's only 4 30 there which is great let me start by asking you a little bit about the sunflower movement you were involved in that movement in taiwan in 2014 it started with some protests against the ruling kmt for over the passage of a service trade agreement with mainland china can you explain how you got involved and what the movement really was and how that brought you into public service sure so um at the time the students occupied the parliament for three weeks in a demonstration for the um idea that we should deliberate more with the society like with the people not just for the people when deliberating important trade agreements such as the cross trade service and trade agreement or cssta and at the time the parliamentarians were refusing to deliberate as they would actually for any international treaty because for them it's not constitutionally a international treaty and so they tried to run it through and so in the three weeks that ensued i helped along with people from the conservative movement to ensure that more than 20 ngos deliberate each on one aspect of the cssta in the occupied parliaments for example there is one aspect that's uh whether we need to allow prc people's republic china government uh components in our then new 4g infrastructure so the clean path uh argument that we had on the street was half a million people and the consensus was no because there's no private sector companies um in prc and that's uh actually heeded as one of the rough consensus at the end of the occupy which the head of parliament ratified as it was a success at the end of that year the mayoral election or the mayor that supported this kind of open government deliberations one uh sometime without preparing operation speech uh and uh other mayor that did not uh well did not uh and so i was then uh recruited as a reverse mentor um that is to say people under 35 years old social innovators that work with existing ministers to design ways to deliberate such issues with the occupying parliament again necessarily but we can do so online and with the same sunflower technologies that's great well it's interesting that you've brought so many young people into politics in taiwan we're we're trying to do that here in the united states as well so maybe you can give us some pointers but of course since 2014 there's been a sea change in politics in your country including president cyan of the democratic progressive party won re-election in january of this year in a landslide um and it was partly i think because of her strong response to beijing's increasing pressures on taiwan there are many reports that in that election there was some disinformation campaign by the chinese and possibly by other actors of course that's particularly interesting to a u.s audience because as you know in 2016 russian actors were very active in our own election now we just heard from two experts yesterday laura rosenberger and rene de resta who's at stanford um that we're seeing that again in our own 2012 election it's not just the russians it's also the chinese we're seeing it in lots of different places in our own system the russian disinformation campaigns have been far more sophisticated than what you see from china and other actors to the point where they're so convincing with false personas and things that the russian ira actually got jack dorsey to retweet misleading information and donald trump jr what we see in the u.s from china is not quite as sophisticated how did you see that in your election which state actors were involved and tell me a little bit more about how that disinformation campaign unfolded sure so in taiwan um i'm glad you used the term disinformation because that's the term we use i never use the the f word uh right so um to describe news uh and uh this information time is defined as intentional untrue information that causes public harm so not like harming the image of the ministry which is just good journalism uh and because we never do uh administrative takedowns uh we just like in fighting the pandemic we never do lockdowns either uh and that is uh why we have to kind of race uh with the disinformation so whenever there's a piece of disinformation not even two hours after which uh the responsible ministries uh which have what we call hashtag officers participation offices that engage the public will roll out internet memes that are always very humorous very funny but also contains clarifications in a way that's more viral than the disinformation so that's humor over rumor uh and as for the disinformation campaigns that actually occurred during the presidential election well you see because we negotiated with facebook and other multinational social media companies to make sure that they conform to our norms of campaign donation and expense meaning that all the advertisement from the ass library that pertains to political or social issues need to be disclosed is full like targets the price paid and so on and it can only come from domestic sources not from foreign sources and so it's easier for us to do attribution which is always the hardest and so we also work with facebook so that when people flag something as possible this information there's also a lot of civil sector like colfax doctor message and so on um just like spam house as a spam fingerprint clearinghouse we also do at this information clearinghouse so last november there was a disinformation piece that i'll use to illustrate a point which says um hong kong sucks compensation exposed and i quote killing a police and earn up to 20 million unquote uh and that is a actual piece of this information making in the rounds i tell any social media it even has pictures to go with it except of course the picture is actually a reuters picture uh and that's how in fact czech sensa which is part of the international fact checking network traced this information um down to the joint jung valley the prc central political and law unit on their way board so it's not something that's covered it is a overt narrative that they just push on using local proxies and so on so instead of taking it down we just make sure that we attribute it yeah sorry to interrupt you mr sure can you um can we just dig in a little deeper you just said a lot about all the amazing things that i wish our government were doing that you're going to combat the disinformation but can you say a little bit more about how it actually works who do you see in the system are they trying to influence were they trying to influence your election directly or were they sowing general disinformation who do you think it was was it very sophisticated was it ham handed was it just flooding social media uh was it thinly disguised uh personas and bots or did you see something more all of them both all of the above uh well it would be easier uh if i can illustrate uh by sharing my screen which currently is not possible i guess in this format uh but i will just say in very broadly terms um i think there's a few things right as i just showed uh using our strategy of notice and public notice instead of taking down people learn generally that these are sponsored by well the the prc uh and they did not hide from it mostly they just posted publicly on their weibo account and a lot of the work that we see for example there was another piece of rumor that's making the rounds immediately before the accounting process but right after the voting finishes is that quote the cia made this special ink for ballots so no matter who you vote thai always wins so uh answering your question this is uh basically saying hey the cia doesn't do that i think no uh right uh and and but the point is that instead of um attacking the a candidate it's essentially attacking the democratic process it's undermining people's trust in the democratic process so no matter who wins we lose and i think that is um after all what the playbook is all about is to so discord in the democratic process itself and we counter it using radical transparency the counting process can be recorded and even live streamed by youtubers uh and we invite youtubers into the accounting stations and we because we use a paper only ballot um it's actually a kind of social ceremony uh with more than 70 percent uh percent of people going to the voting booth the counting uh process uh actually bring the youtubers a lot of views and so the fact-checking accounting and so on because it's a participation accountability there's less room for the conspiracy theories to spread because if there is invisible appearance disappearing you'll surely not miss it on the live stream that's amazing it's very interesting because it's there's just a cultural difference i'm guessing between the understanding of privacy in your country and what we have in the u.s a lot of these ideas that are brilliant ideas from my perspective that i think could work here in the us we wouldn't be allowed to do like you wouldn't let a youtuber into the accounting because it would be seen as an invasion of privacy um but tell me a little bit more about you said you're trying to fight it with humor and that you're taking it from the government now the u.s government is known for many things but not for its sense of humor so maybe you could teach us a little bit certainly so um but first of all before the sunflower movement the live stream was not allowed in the accounting process either actually recording uh unless you're a professional uh hired by one of the parties is was not allowed either so civic journalism is really the thing that becoming a new political norm after the sunflower occupy i'm not advising anyone to occupy their parliament by the way but it really is a very effective way uh and anyway so sorry back to the human over rumor so uh yeah uh i think uh the humor of a rumor strategy worked because we were forced to innovate that we cannot do takedowns so we look at uh how the conspiracy theories spread and outrage and now if you have seen the movie inside out literally in one person's minds control room one cannot feel simultaneously outrage and joy so if we bring joy into the political discourse then that makes people more deliberative instead of just you know anti-social social media and so one example during the pandemic there was a rumor a disinformation really intentional one that says quote because we're ramping up the facial mass production from 2 million a day to 20 million a day the rumor says that is the same material as tissue paper so we'll run out of tissue paper soon and so people would panic by and i mean it was a stressful time people do feel stressed and so outrage travel very fast like maybe it has an r value of three every hour every person on every share to three other people and so within a couple hours our premiere so jin chung here rolls out this internet beam which is brilliant and you see his backside his bottom wiggling it a little bit and a very large phone that says each of us have only one pair of botox and it's a wordplay in mandarin twin botox and twin stockpile sounds the same uh and so basically he's saying in this tissue paper package meme that there's no way that you can use all that uh tissue paper you stop out and then a table saying the tissue paper came from south american materials and the medical masks came from domestic materials and so right you just laugh about it meaning that you cannot feel outraged about this anymore you're vaccinated so to speak and and this went actually via like our value of five or more uh and so within a couple of days this conspiracy theory just died down and then we persecuted the three people that started this rumor turns out they were tissue paper resellers and is your um is your ministry behind these memes you guys put them together right so uh in 2017 uh we initially like trained the public servants uh higher level officials participation offices in this idea of hashtag engagement and mimetic engineering but it would not gain much currency until after the 2018 election where we see a lot of this information at the time facebook was not revealing the precision uh targeted uh advertisements during the election campaign and so that led to a lot of um social distrust because unlike our control unit which is a separate branch that publishes the donation expense who actually went into those facebook and other social media targeted advertisements is anybody's guess and so because of that this mimetic response this human over rumor started gaining currency and then we got all the social media companies on board google and twitter for example simply refused to run political advertisements during our presidential election so it's a norm shaping move and also i think uh very notable because we did not pass any law to do that just as we did not pass a law uh for the spawn either uh we relied on the civic sector's pressure uh that's the threat of social sanction to the social media companies interesting and you just mentioned micro targeting of ads which is such an issue in our election which is how you really dice and slice the electorate and give people the outrage that they crave as you said so are you saying that the social media companies in taiwan are not allowed to target that's exactly right and if they do i mean during election for political and social issues and if they do they must always review it the same way campaign expenditure is revealed that is to say revealing the money the target criteria in real time like is while it's airing in the ads library and even uh after it's aired and so lots of civic sector um watchdog groups and so on would publish any dark patterns and and that will actually lead to social section too so during the presidential election nobody tried not even the legislative candidates try any dark patterns wow very interesting let me um change subject just a little bit you brought it up with the masks and the tissue paper but you know taiwan has already had has also had a huge success um in containing the covid19 pandemic and as you know here in the united states we opened up briefly now we're all shut down again which is why i have a nice virtual background of aspen behind me rather than being in real aspen you have done something really amazing one i understand taiwan's central epidemic command center that was set up after sars in 2003 has been enormously helpful and then you used a digital fence system which sort of enforced people's quarantine can you talk about some of the um e-enabled ways that you help to contain the pandemic i like that word enable ways so the early response when taiwan responded last december was enabled by e-participation forums in taiwan we have this ptt which is the equivalent of reddit but it's owned by the social sector operated by students at national tournament university uh and uh when dr lee went along the prc whistleblower posted that there were seven new songs cases that got reposted immediately actually at the same hour as he got inquiries from his institutions and so while he was being quote harmonized unquote uh in the prc in wuhan um in taiwan it's making the rounds it's upvoted and our medical officers immediately noticed suppose an issue of order saying all passengers flying in from uh taiwan need to start health inspection and that was the first of january and so i think this is very important that the civil society has this absolute freedom of speech that they can talk about as far as outbreak in the public forum and that the government trust citizens enough to take it seriously treat it as if starts happening again something we've always been preparing since 2003 and the cec that you just mentioned is a live press conference that went on for 140 days or so until that we're like post pandemic now uh for i think four months now uh but four months ago they they were uh doing daily live streams answering all the journalists questions working with journalists and the um toll-free number 1922 is i think one of the most important piece because anybody can pick up their phone call it with a more than 90 pick up rate um and just inform anything that they see from the ground to the cecc which will then make into the rounds into the next day's life uh conference so just one example one day in april a young boy uh whose family called saying that my boy doesn't want to go to school because when you raise your mouth you don't get to pick the color and all he had was a pink medical mask uh and so that very next day so he is like i'll get bullied i'm a boy whatever so the very next day everybody in the cecc press conference started wearing pink medical masks making sure that everybody learns about gender mainstreaming and it's a social innovation and so this kind of fast response ensure that the boy now you know the most hit boy because only he had a color that heroes wear that builds the trust between the government and civil society and the digital offense that you just mentioned basically said anybody returning from thai from the abroad to taiwan they can choose either go to a hotel for quarantine that's how we keep the hotel business open uh or they can if they live in a larger home with their own bathroom and they don't share it with vulnerable group of people they can choose to place their phone or if they don't have a phone we hand them on into this digital quarantine uh and it's basically reusing this earthquake warning that we send people so if you if i'm flying into taiwan from and i have to foreign i have to put my phone in digital quarantine or you can choose the hotel or i mean it's your choice you either go to a physical currency in which case you're physically borrowed from from leaving or you go to your your own home but then your phone is put into the digital current scene there there's a choice between the physical and the digital but there is no choice of no currency well you can choose to break the quarantine i guess but then um you know you forfeit the 33 us dollar per day stipend and you have to pay back a thousand times more up to uh and so you will fund one thousand people's current team i'm sure uh but very few people did that uh and so it's an amazing system where culturally in the us it would just be impossible you know we're having people protesting against wearing masks and doors and things so well there's there's something taiwan can help there too uh i mean we very early on put out a poster again from the premiere uh that basically says the mosque idea to protect yourself from your own and washed hands and i think that idea travels much better than pretty much any other incentive design and we also make sure that we have a spokes dog that reminds people that which is less i guess controversial uh and so this is literally the spokes talk of the cecc and the dog says uh you know uh wear a mask to protect you from your own and washed hands and please use a soap and that's very important that's great we should tell dr anthony fauci to get a spokes dog i think that would help here as well i know we're we're our time with you is short i could keep chatting with you all more all evening all morning for you we have one question from christy campbell who's in the audience so if we could unmute christy that would be great just takes a few seconds for her to be able to unmute herself hi crystal hello i'm here great so um i actually work uh for a corporate company but deal on the media and one of the things that really struck me is that yes the humor and rumor but i'm wondering about the skepticism scale in taiwan because i think what we're finding here in the u.s we tend to be a trusting bunch if you see it on social media this concept of disinformation is almost hard to believe and i think this kind of recent political piece has been something to try and educate um a wider range around the fact that not everything you see not everything you read not everything you get in an email not everything that you see it texted you is true how did you break through that well we offered that too uh and it's uh in our k-12 curriculum actually uh and it's called critical and creative thinking uh but uh in i think there's a difference though uh in our category of curriculum we do not teach media literacy or digital literacy we teach media competence and digital competence and the difference is that instead of treating very young people primary schoolers as a consumer of information we treat them as producer of information indeed many of them maybe have more instagram followers than i do because i rarely post on instagram but anyway the the point is that they are uh potentially part-time journalists uh a lot of primary schoolers actually interviewed me as a kind of intern journalist and many of them actually fact-checked our president candidates back in the presidential election because the journalists invited everyone including primary schoolers to join them online to help transcribing doing newsroom work of checking the sources and so on to make sure that we can hold presidential candidates words to account and once you participate from the side of journalists from media producers i think one would then learn that journalism is about truthfinding together and that will create a much more symbiotic relationship with the journalistic branch instead of a you know adversarial relationship i think that's our main difference in terms of curriculum design how many people are participating in that program thousands and thousands if you're uh uh referring to the presidential candidates fact-checking interesting amazing um let me turn to hector fuentes you suddenly have a whole you've sparked a lot of questions so i hope you can stay with us for just a couple more minutes i don't have the heart stop actually great thank you hey can you hear me yes all right thank you uh mr tan hey oh mr stan i have a question for you uh i'm from venezuela and here the problem is actually the opposite is the government who is constantly misinforming and playing with information which role do you think can civil society play to ensure that the information we get is is is is worth is worth is trustworthy and and and how can we convey uh scepticism from civil society thanks yeah and that's that's what the sunflower movement is all about because people back then uh were fed up with this i still remember back in 2012 the first youtube advertisement done by the um cabinet back then uh the maengio um presidency uh was a economic booster plan promotion uh and in the advertisements you see four ordinary citizens of all different job costs uh and looking at the booster plan floating past them not understanding any words and they voice over says oh you don't have to understand just do it and so that's like brainwashing or something uh and i'm sure that they they mean it in a tongue-in-cheek way i mean with no lies but what people perceive when you see it on youtube is just that the government doesn't trust its people and so they're working very hard for the people but not with the people and certainly not after the people and so that's what the occupy is all about i'm not suggesting you to occupy i must say it again but on the other hand what we did before uh the occupy was essentially uh culture jamming is to take uh all the government ideas uh and digital services building in each and every digital service something that gov.tw a shadow website something that g0v.tw that delivers the same service but from a civic participation perspective so it's what we call fork the government no careful with the pronunciation uh so when we all fork the government um it offers alternative visions and we don't even have to push out advertisements as a gov zero movement because people would just then change one electric to one digit on their browser and get into the shadow government and moreover we always relinquish the copyright involved for example on the budget visualization on the air quality visualization and so on uh and so when the middle layer public service career public servants actually see it making rounds on the news they have a much better case to talk to the career politicians uh saying you know this something that's for free maybe we can do a reverse procurement and and that's reverse procurement culture really builds solidarity between the public servants on one side and the civic movements on the other kind of ignoring bypassing the top level politicians so that's something that you can consider as well these are such interesting ideas for us to consider and we're literally in the u.s government just nowhere on any of these so we may ask you to come over to train us let me turn to one last topic while we've still got you and that is in the u.s of course there's a huge worry now a national security worry about the technology race with china and the trump administration has very taken very tough line you know recently commerce department came out saying tsmc and other um semiconductor companies that where the chips are partly designed in the us can't sell to huawei and others semiconductors are a key strategic area for us how do you see that in taiwan do you think the u.s government is right to restrict these sales to huawei do you think when it comes to 5g core infrastructure i mean we had that deliberation six years ago except it's 4g but the consensus on the street remains true to this day actually even more true which is to say that there is no private sector company in the prc when needed be the the party can always through their party branches embedded uh in the large companies or even swap the leadership through non-market means uh and so at the time our consensus was that we need to just bond uh in a clean path from end to end all the 4g supply chain prc components i think we're the first one to do that on the national security council and national communication commission level and that's because the popular mandate from the occupy was so strong so in a sense we welcome us on board i guess in joining us in such uh considerations uh but we also would uh emphasize the the means about which we arrive to these conclusions as people with all the different stakeholder groups actually coming together and deliberate and so this was not seen as something president my angel unilaterally imposed on the market rather this is all the telecom operators all the experts all the people who are interested in cyber security and proficient in cyber security and so on coming in a public debate live stream to the entire country and they eventually after three weeks agree on that yeah you're absolutely right and it has been very unilateral from the administration here in the u.s i write about this a lot i have a lot of friends both on the west coast and east coast who do as well both to do exactly what you're saying is have real consultation with the private sector on rational restrictions rather than imposing them and then another idea that i'd want to get your take on is more and more of us i wrote articles on this i have friends writing them now to think through how do we coordinate better with our friends including taiwan south korea germany in some instances on these big technology issues so it's not each country unilaterally do you see any of that happening informally and if not would you be in favor of more of it between yes uh and and i think uh we've already had a u.s taiwan joint statement on countering kernel virus and that led to directly the cohack which you can interpret as coronavirus hackathon or collaboration hackathon your choice uh and then it led to actually a lot of really good ideas uh from like seven countries 53 teams uh and uh the idea is that we again use the same ai moderated conversation the police method to make sure that the different norms across uk germany hungary on one side canada usa on the other japan and taiwan uh in the middle i guess well that's how we the map and can arrive to the middle and so there were like different norms that were controversial but a good thing about ai-moderated conversation is that we can always settle on the things ignoring really the ideological differences and settling on the things that people have brought agreement on so like we just said okay these are the places where the us norm the european and taiwanese and japanese do not agree but these are the things that people do agree most of the time with most of their global neighbors on everything so uh the kohak hackathon led to uh innovations such as the log board which traces your own phones movement your temperature whatever but it doesn't transmit it anywhere it works entirely in airplane mode and when the contact tracers come to you you can with one click generate this one-time link that contains only the de-identified information that the medical offices need for to do their work without divulging more private details of your friends and family so that's privacy enhancing technology that's very helpful thank you let me just ask you one more since you're a former you know you're an open source coder you're about to still there's a new controversy now especially on the west coast of the us about artificial intelligence and open source as you know so many new things in ai are just put out immediately on open source because the field is developing so quickly now people say well the chinese mainland researchers often mine this information but they don't contribute in kind so we should stop permitting this how do you feel about that yeah there's uh i think not entirely everything is open source like the gpt3 model i believe is not yet open source uh the the huge transformer thing right uh and so i mean there's the source code part uh which is essential for academic research but there's also the data the model uh the actual trained material and things like that the processes and i think in taiwan we mandate uh open api in our procurement that is to say uh providing the accountability and value alignment for assistive intelligence products but we do not uh say that it has to be entirely open source because if we do that in the procurement laws and regulations uh people will just you know hide everything on the stack beneath it and just open source this very thin code above that which is not what we want to encourage we want to encourage people to get into the habits of seeing ai not as artificial but assistive intelligence and start with the design with the social norm in mind and in that sense then mining the social norms is not that big a problem because it's essentially qualitative data of what people would agree the ai to do that's value alignment and then you implement uh proving that you align to this value in a way that instead of internet of things you can build an internet of beings which is part of my job description anyway so so that will then uh make a more norm-based uh innovation and i think this dilemma only occurs when the private sector innovate as you said on breakneck speed but without taking those full social inputs in mind absolutely that's a very good answer thank you so much for taking the time to be with us i know it's very early for you and i hope at some point post covid we can welcome you in person either out at stanford where i am or an aspen thank you so much thank you live long and prosper thank you
