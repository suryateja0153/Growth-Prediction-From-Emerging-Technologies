 WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. WE ARE SO DELIGHTED TO SEE EVERYONE HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS AMY SCHULTZ AND ON THE FACULTY OF UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND KOLI IN THE FRONT OF THE ROOM HERE FOR THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR THE CENTER WHICH IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS. WE ARE DELIGHTED TO HAVE EVERYBODY HERE TODAY. I PARTICULARLY WANT TO WELCOME THE 200 SOME ODD PEOPLE JOINING US BY LIVE STREAM AND WEBINAR. YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED AN E-MAIL WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE LIVE STREAM AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING QUESTIONS WHEN WE GET TO THE Q AND A SECTION FOLLOWING THE SPEAKER. SEND THEM IN TO US. WE WILL HAVE SOMEBODY MONITORING US AND YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS OF THE SPEAKERS. WE KNEW WE WERE TAKING A REALLY BIG RISK TO ORGANIZE A SEMINAR IN FEBRUARY IN MICHIGAN. WE ARE REALLY PLEASED THE WEATHER IS WITH US. WE HAVE SUNSHINE TODAY AND EVERYBODY WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT HERE FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE AND ALSO PARTICULARLY WELCOME FOLKS WHO TRAVELED FROM OUT OF STATE -- OUTSIDE THE STATE TO MAKE IT HERE. HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM WERE ABLE TO ATTEND THE FILM PREMIERE LAST NIGHT? FABULOUS. IT WAS A WONDERFUL PREMIERE. THANK YOU TO TONY AND ALL OF THE OTHERS WHO WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING THAT HAPPEN. I THINK IT REALLY SET THE TONE FOR THE CONVERSATION WE ARE HOPING TO HAVE TODAY. I WANT TO -- BEFORE WE BEGIN I WANT TO DO AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT. THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WAS FOUNDED IN 1817 THROUGH A TREATY CALLED THE TREATY OF FORT MEEKS. THE THREE FIRES OF THE CAN -- CONFEDERACIES AND THE NEIGHBORING TRIBES WERE CONVINCED TO SEED PORTION OF THEIR LANDS IN THE HOPES THEIR CHILDREN WOULD BE EDUCATED IN THE UNIVERSITY BUILT ON THAT LAND. THE RELINQUISH MEANT OF THIS LAND DURING THIS HISTORICAL MOMENT CAME AT A GREAT COST TO THE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES WHO TURNED IT OVER. THE HOPE OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN HAS ONLY BEEN VERY PARTIALLY REALIZED. AS WE BEGIN TODAY'S CONVERSATION I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE, RENEW AND INFIRM THE AN SEES RAIL -- ANCESTRIAL TRIBE OF THE ANISHINABEG TO THIS LAND AND TO THIS UNIVERSITY. [APPLAUSE]. I ALSO WANT TO BEGIN WITH A FEW ADDITIONAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND A HUGE THANKS TO PEOPLE WHO MADE TODAY POSSIBLE. FIRST OF ALL TO OUR PLANNING TEAM, JODY, BRITNEY, MICHELLE MARCUS, MEREDITH, MELANIE PEARSON, CHRISTINA RICE, GENE AND ROBIN WILEY. THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO MAKING THE DAY HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE]. I ALSO WANT TO SHOUTOUT TO OUR POSTER REVIEWERS, RICK AND BARBARA ISRAEL FOR LOOKING AT THE POSTERS AND EVALUATING THEM. I ALSO WANT TO GIVE THANKS TO THE PINE RIVER SUPER FUND CITIZEN TASK FORCE THAT WAS THE IMPETUS BEHIND THIS CONVERSATION. THIS GROUP HAS BEEN WORKING ON THE PBV CLEAN UP, THE PBV CONTAMINATION FOR 40 YEARS? 45 YEARS. AND AS THEY BEGAN TO SEE THE EVENTS UNFOLD AROUND PFAS CONTAMINATION WE NEED TO TALK AND WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE AND WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU FOR BEING AN INSPIRATION BEHIND TODAY'S'S CONFERENCE. THE THIRD THANK YOU IS TO THE MLEAD STAKEHOLDER AND ADVISORY BOARD, A NUMBER WHO ARE IN THE ROOM TODAY AND INSTRUMENTAL IN PLANNING THIS TODAY AND SEVERAL WHO YOU WILL MEET THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN VARIOUS ROLES. FINALLY I WANT TO THANK OUR CO-SPONSORS FOR THE EVENT. THE M-LEEAD CORE CENTER AND EMORY UNIVERSITY, CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY, THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, THE GRAHAM SUSTAINABILITY INSTITUTE AND MEDICAL INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL AND HEALTH RESEARCH AND WE THE PEOPLE OF DETROIT WHO CONTRIBUTED TO MAKING THE DAY HAPPEN. LET'S GIVE THEM A HAND. SO OUR OVER ARCHING OBJECTIVE FOR THE DAY IS TO BRING TOGETHER SCIENTISTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE ALSO SCIENTISTS FOR DIALOGUE TO INFORM ACTION. IT IS A POINT THAT WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS IN GREATER DEPTH IN JUST A MOMENT. BUT I DO WANT TO JUST GIVE A HEADS UP. TOWARD THAT END, WE WILL HAVE A SERIES OF TALKS THIS OF VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES ON THE ISSUES WE ARE ENGAGED WITH TODAY, AND THEN IN THE AFTERNOON WE ARE GOING TO BE MOVING INTO SMALL BREAKOUT GROUPS TO DO FORWARD PLANNING AROUND WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT, AROUND A SPECIFIC SET OF ISSUES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A PRIORITY, FIVE ISSUES FOR THE BREAKOUT GROUPS, HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND STATE REGISTRIES, POLICY CHANGE, PREPARING THE NEXT GENERATION OF RESEARCHERS AND AGO TAU -- ACTIVISTS, COMMUNITY RESEARCHERS AND NATIONAL MOVEMENTS. WE ALSO ARE ANTICIPATING OTHER TOPICS MAY BUBBLE UP AS WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY. IF YOU HAVE A BURNING ISSUE YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONVENE, A GROUP TO TALK ABOUT LATER THIS AFTERNOON WE HAVE NEWSPRINT SHEETS OUT BY THE REGISTRATION DESK. PLEASE POST YOUR ISSUE ON THOSE NEWSPRINTS AT ANY POINT DURING THE DAY. AND THEN WHEN WE GET READY TO DO THE BREAKOUTS IN THE AFTERNOON WE WILL ADD THOSE TO THE LIST, AND THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO GO AND HAVE A CONVERSATION. I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. MEREDITH, DID I FORGET ANYTHING BUSINESS WISE? THEN I WILL YIELD THE FLOOR TO INTRODUCING OUR KEYNOTE SPEAKER.  AMY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY FOR ATTENDING TODAY. AS AMY MENTIONED THIS GREW OUT OF A PARTNERSHIP THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY THE PBV EXPOSURES IN MICHIGAN. IT WAS LEAD BY MICHELLE AND MELANIE WHO HAVE ESTABLISHED AN ABSOLUTELY EXEMPLARY PROGRAM OF COMMUNITY ENGAGED RESEARCH. THESE INVESTIGATORS ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING AND DETAILING THE HEALTH CONCERNS OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO TVB. PVB. BUILDING FROM THIS WORK IN 2018 AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE NIHS CORY SEARCH CENTER, THE MICHIGAN AND LEAD CENTER AND CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY DEVELOPED A COMMUNITY ENGAGED RESEARCH PROJECT THAT WAS TO GATHER AND ANALYSIS -- ANALYZE THE DOCUMENTS FROM THE INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO PVB THIS WAS AIMED AT IDENTIFYING ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH LITERACY THEMES AND DIRECT PROGRAMMING EFFORTS THAT COULD BE USED TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS. AND THEY HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB AT MOVING THIS WORK FORWARD. THIS HAS LEAD TO A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY MEMBERRING -- MEETINGS AND VARIOUS GROUPS INCLUDING THE MICHIGAN STATE LEGISLATURE AND HAS REALLY BROUGHT US TOGETHER TODAY. IT IS FROM THIS WORK WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE SYMPOSIUM TODAY AND WE CAN MAKE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE FOREVER CHEMICALS, PVB, PCB'S, P PFAS THAT IS AFFECTING PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I THANK THESE COMMUNITY INVESTORS AND PARTNERS FOR COMING TOGETHER AND DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF MOVING THE WORK FORWARD AND KEEPING THE COMMUNITY CONCERNS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE SCIENCE THEY ARE DOING. I WILL NOW TURN THE PODIUM OVER TO MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE MICHIGAN M-LEAD -- M-LEEAD CENTER.  GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO SUNNY ANNE ARBOR, ESPECIALLY TO OUR FRIENDS FROM THE SOUTH AND WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE VISITING FROM OUT OF STATE. WELCOME. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK AMY SHULTZ AND HER TEAM FOR ORGANIZING THIS AND OUR EMERY PARTNERS AND THE STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY BOARD. NOW IT IS MY DISTINCT PLEASURE TO WELCOME DR. LINDA, RETIRED DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND NATIONAL TOXICOLOGY PROGRAM FROM 2009 TO OCTOBER OF 2019 TO DELIVER OUR KEYNOTE ADDRESS. DR. BIRMBAUM IS A BOARD CERTIFIED TOXICOLOGIST AND SERVING AS A FEDERAL SCIENTIST FOR 40 YEARS. PRIOR TO HER APPOINTMENT, DR. BIRMBAUM SPENT 19 YEARS AT THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WHERE SHE DIRECTED ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH. A NATIVE TO NERMING, WHICH YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS WHERE MY PARENTS GREW UP, SHE RECEIVED HER M S&P HD IN MICROBIOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AND AUTHORED MORE THAN 700 PEER REVIEW PUBLICATIONS, BOOK CHAPTERS AND REPORTS. HER RESEARCH FOCUSES ON PHARMACO KINETIC AND BEHAVIOR OF CHEMICALS, MECHANISM OF ACTIONS INCLUDING ENDOCRINE PRODUCTION AND REAL WORLD EXPOSURES TO HEALTH EFFECTS. SHE HAS RECEIVED MANY AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS INCLUDING IN OCTOBER OF 2010 ELECTED TO THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES WHICH IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST HONORS IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH. OTHER AWARDS ARE TWO NIH DIRECTOR'S AWARD, THE WOMEN IN TOXICOLOGY AWARD, THE SOCIETY OF TOXICOLOGY PUBLIC COMMUNICATION AWARD AND THE EPA HEALTH SIGN ACHIEVE -- ACHIEVEMENT AWARD AND DIVERSITY LEADERSHIP AWARD. TO QUOTE HER LONG-FRIEND AND COLLABORATOR MICHELLE MARCUS, ONE OF THE GREATEST STRENGTHS OF DR. BIRMBAUM THAT -- THAT SHE BRINGS TO THE FIELD IS HER ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE FROM THE MOLECULAR TO THE POPULATION. ALTHOUGH TRAINED AS A TOXICOLOGIST SHE HAS EMBRACED ALL OF THE DATA RELEVANT TO PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH, AND DURING HER TENURE NIHS PROMOTED COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AT EVERY LEVEL. THE NIHS, P-30 MECHANISMS, FUNDS CORY SEARCH CENTERS AND REQUIRES COMMUNITY SCIENCE PARTNERSHIPS. THUS FUNDS CAN BE DEVOTED TO WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES, TO HOLDING INTERACTIVE COMMUNITY MEETINGS SUCH AS THIS ONE AND COMPENSATING COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR THEIR INPUT ON RESEARCH PRIORITIES. IN MANY WAYS THROUGH HER SUPPORT OF THE P-30 COURSE DR. BIRMBAUM ENABLED US TO BE HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME HER TO GIVE HER KEYNOTE ADDRESS. [APPLAUSE].  OKAY. LET'S SEE HOW I GET IT UP HERE. PERFECT. VERY GOOD. IT IS ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO COME BACK TO MICHIGAN. I DID SPEND EIGHT TO 10 YEARS CHAIRING THE SCIENCE BOARD FOR SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH STUDY ON DIOXIN EXPOSURE IN THE MID-LAND AREA. I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEING HERE QUITE A BIT. I HAVE BEEN HERE A COUPLE OF OTHER TIMES TO GIVE TALKS OR MEET WITH PEOPLE, BUT ALWAYS HAPPY TO COME. I WILL SAY IT IS GORGEOUS HERE. IT IS SNOWING IN NORTH CAROLINA. [LAUGHTER]. ANYWAY, WE SHALL SEE. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO TODAY IS REALLY DO A WHIRL WIND TOUR FROM PVB TO PFAS. I WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT LONG AGO -- WELL ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID WHEN I WENT TO NIHAS IN 1979 AS A YOUNG TENURE TRACK SIGN -- TEXT CYST IS I -- SCIENTIST. I STUDIED CONTAMINANTS OF THE PVB'S. AND THEY ARE THE DIOXIN-LIKE COMPONENTS OF THE PBB MIXTURE. BOTH THE ACUTE AND LONG-TERM AFFECTS BEING SEEN ARE REALLY RELATED TO THE RETEP -- RECEPTOR THAT WAS THE MECHANISM. THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST STUDY I DID RELATED TO THE PBB'S. MY FOCUS IS ON DIOXINS. IN THE 1980s AMONG OTHER STUDIES I DID I PUBLISHED THREE PAPERS. THE C-10, THE RELATIVE OF PFOA. THE QUESTION I WAS ASKING -- WE KNEW THESE CHEMICALS CAUSED AN INCREASE IN LIVER WEIGHT AND AFFECTED THE THYROID. I SAID THESE MUST BE DIOXINS. I SHOWED THEY WEREN'T. SINCE I WAS FOCUSING ON DIOXIN I WALKED AWAY FROM THIS AREA. SOMETIMES WE MAKE CHOICES THAT COME BACK TO BITE YOU. I AM BACK IN THE FIELD RIGHT NOW AND VERY, VERY EXCITED. I COULD SAY I'M SORRY I'M BACK IN THE FIELD. WHY IN THE HECK ARE WE ALL BEING EXPOSED, EVERY ONE OF US IN THIS ROOM TO THIS CLASS OF CHEMICALS. THIS IS JUST A COUPLE OF THEM. WE WILL GO THROUGH THEM. THESE ARE NEWSPAPER HEADLINES I PULLED OUT. I THINK THEY WERE THIS SUMMER. THOSE WHO WERE AT THE MOVIE LAST NIGHT, WHICH AT LEAST I MADE AFTER MY FLIGHT WAS TWO HOURS LATE FROM WASHINGTON. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FOAM THAT WE FIND IN THE -- THIS IS DOWNSTREAM FROM 3M. I AM GOING TO REMIND YOU THAT 3M STOPPED MAKING PFOS IN 2002. IT WAS A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT AND DUPONT. 3M WAS THE SOURCE OF PFOA THAT LEAD TO THE CONTAMINATION IN THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY, BUT DUPONT STOPPED MAKING IT IN 2012. THEY TURNED IT OVER TO KEMORSE WHICH IS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE CONTAMINATION WE HAVE IN NORTH CAROLINA. ANYHOW, THERE IS LAKE VAN ETON. THAT IS A PICTURE FROM SOME TIME LAST YEAR. AND THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE CLOVIS CITY WATER IN NEW MEXICO. WE SAW A FARMER FROM NEW MEXICO ON THE FILM LAST NIGHT. WE KNOW IF YOU LIVE NEAR A MAJOR AIR FORCE BASE, AND I WOULD ARGUE IF YOU LIVE NEAR ANY MILITARY BASE, ANY MAIN FIREFIGHTING STATION, ANY EMERGENCY VENUE YOU WILL FIND PFAS ALL-AROUND YOU. AND THE OTHER ONE WE HAVE OVER HERE IS DASH -- I'M SORRY I AM GOING AHEAD. AND THIS IS JUST IN ONE OF YOUR PAPERS RECENTLY ABOUT ALL OF THE PFAS IN THE SAGINAW RIVER. I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE SAGINAW FROM THE PCV'S THAT CONTAMINATE IT. WHY WOULDN'T WE THINK IT HAS THESE OTHER HER -- THESE OTHER PERSISTENT, ORGANIC CHEMICALS IN THE WATER? I WAS INTERESTED TO READ A MONTH AGO ABOUT HOW THE STATE OF PITCH -- STATE OF MICHIGAN IS SUING 17 CHEMICAL COMPANIES FOR PFAS CONTAMINATION. MAYBE A LITTLE LATE, BUT BETTER THAN NEVER. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE ACRO ANYMORE PFAS IS HORRIBLE. IT IS A HORRIBLE CHOICE. I ALWAYS NOW -- I SAY PFAS TO GET IN THERE AND THERE IS PFOS WHICH IS A SPECIFIC CHEMICAL. THIS IS A HUGE CLASS WHERE OVER 5,000 OF THESE CHEMICALS THAT HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY SYNTHESIZED. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE AREN'T MORE THAT TURN OUT TO BE BREAK DOWN PRODUCTS OF MUCH LONGER CHAIN OR BRANCH CHAIN MOLECULES BEING BROKEN DOWN IN THE ATMOSPHERE. SOMETIMES WHAT DO THEY GIVE US? PFOA, PFOS, AND YOU CAN NAME IT GOING DOWN. WE DON'T KNOW THE TOTALITY OF WHAT IS BEING MADE OUT THERE. WHY DO WE HAVE THEM? WE HAVE THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY, VERY USEFUL PROPERTIES. THEY ARE RESISTANT TO GREASE AND WATER AND OIL AND STALE REPELLENT. I BOUGHT A PAIR OF REALLY NICE SHOES, HIKING SHOES. ON THE BOX THERE IS A BIG SIGN THAT SAYS TOTALLY WATER RESISTANT. AND I SAID I DON'T WANT THEM. I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THEY ARE EXTENSIVELY USED FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION IN THE AFFF. WHAT WE MAY NOT HEAR IS ONLY THREE TO 6% OF AFF F IS PFAS. LIKE THAT'S OKAY WHEN YOU ADD TONS AND TONS AND TON. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THEY ARE PERSISTENT AND THEY ARE BIO CUMULATIVE. THEY ARE SO PERSISTENT IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY ARE CALLED FOREVER CHEMICALS. THE POINT IS THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO LEAVE THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY BARELY OCCUR IN NATURE. THERE IS NO NATURAL WAY TO BREAK THEM DOWN. THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO BREAK THE CARBON FLOR -- FLORINE BOND. WE HAVE BEEN UNIQUELY UNSUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT. ONCE THEY ARE MADE, WE WILL HAVE THEM IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHETHER THEY PERSIST IN OUR BODIES OR NOT. THINGS IN OUR BODY FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE SAFE. AND WE HAVE ALL OF THE SHORTCHANGE ALTERNATIVES. WHAT I HAVE ON THE BOTTOM HERE IS PFOS, AND PFOA AND THE SHORT CHAINS. TERRIBLE KNOW MEN CLAY SURE. NOMENCLATURE. IT MEANS YOU HAVE LONGER RUNS. YOU MAY HAVE FOUR CARBONS OR FIVE CARBONS OR YOU MAY HAVE THREE CARBONS AND AN OXYGEN AND THEN ANOTHER THREE CARBONS AND THEN AN OXYGEN AND ANOTHER THREE CARBONS. THOSE ARE SHORT CHAINS. THE IDEA IS THAT THESE WON'T LAST IN OUR BODIES. BUT THEY WILL LAST IN THE ENVIRONMENT. HOW ARE WE EXPOSED? I GAVE YOU A HINT. THEY ARE A DIVERSE GROUP OF CHEMICALS, AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND FOR 40 YEARS, GUYS. THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR 60 YEARS. THEY WERE REALLY FIRST MADE IN THE 1940s. THEY WERE MADE IN A LAB WHERE THEY WERE SYNTHESIZED. THEY ARE IN YOUR CARPET AND FABRIC. HOME DEPOT AND LOWES ARE TO LONGER PUTTING THEM ON THE CARPET. THEY ARE USED ON PAPER THAT IS USED ON FOOD. SO THE THING YOUR HAMBURGER IS WRAPPED IN WHEN YOU GET IT AT THE FAST-FOOD STOP. POTS AND PANS, JUST A WARNING. WHEN YOU GO TO WHEREVER YOU GO AND YOU SEE THESE NEW NON-STICK PANS AND THERE ARE BIG SIGNS ON THEM THAT SAYS NO PFOA. WHAT SHOULD THAT TELL YOU? IT HAS A SHORT CHAIN IN THERE. UNLESS IT SAYS NO PFAS, BEWARE. IT IS ON LOTS OF OUR CLOTHING. IT IS IN CARDBOARD PACKAGING AND FIREFIGHTING FOAMS, OF COURSE. ONE THING I WANT TO MENTION IS SO MUCH OF THE FOCUS LATELY HAS BEEN ON WHAT'S IN OUR WATER, OUR DRINKING WATER AND GROUND WATER. IT IS ALSO IN OUR FOOD. AND GUESS WHAT. IT IS IN OUR AIR TOO. THERE THERE HAS BEEN NO WORK DONE ON INHALATION. IF THINGS ARE INHALED THEY ARE GOING TO DIFFERENT PLACES IN OUR BODY AND DIFFERENT THINGS MAY HAPPEN TO THEM. THIS IS JUST A QUICK SCHEMATIC. YOU WILL SEE SOUTHERN LAND HARBOR -- I HAVE A POINTER HERE. A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE THERE. FORGET IT. I AM GOING BACK TO THE SLIDE SHOW. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET IT TO THE RIGHT PLACE. IF ONE OF MY GRANDKIDS WERE HERE THEY WOULD DO IT IMMEDIATELY. BACK TO PFAS EXPOSURE. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THE INDUSTRY IS MAKING IT. IT GOES TO AFFF. IT GOES IN LOADS OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND FROM THE DIFFERENT SOURCES IT GETS INTO THE WASTE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE STREAM AND WE GET EXPOSED. I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT WHO AMONG US HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS? IT IS OUR NEWBORN BABIES AND OUR IN -- INFANTS BECAUSE THESE COMPOUNDS CROSS THE PLACENTA AND ARE TRANSFERRED THROUGH BREAST MILK. BREAST IS STILL BEST, PEOPLE, PLEASE. STILL BEST TO NURSE YOUR BABY, BUT WHY SHOULD THAT HAVE TO BE SOMETHING YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS THE SAFETY OF YOUR BREAST MILK? I THINK AN IMPORTANT THING WHEN WE SAY WATER IS THE SOURCE OF EXPOSURE. THIS IS A STUDY THAT GOT THE ISSUE UP AND RUNNING AGAIN IN 2016 WHERE USING EPA'S OWN DATA FROM THEIR CHEMICALS OF EMERGING CONCERN NETWORK AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THERE ARE SIX MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY EXPOSED TO ELEVATED LEVELS OF PFAS. THAT'S A FUNNY DEFINITION. WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY ELEVATED? YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AND FIND THAT THEIR LEVELS OF DETECTION WERE VERY HIGH AT THAT POINT IN TIME. SO THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP SAYS IT HAS BEEN 110 MILLION PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO ELEVATED LEVELS IN THEIR DRINKING WATER WHEN YOU LOOK MORE CAREFULLY. THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS IF YOU LIVE OR IF YOUR WATER IS NEAR A PRODUCTION SOURCE OR A USE SOURCE IT IS GOING TO BE MORE ELEVATED. YOU HAVE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE STUFF THERE ABOUT THE INDUSTRIAL SITES AND FOR EXAMPLE IF AFF WAS USED -- AFFF WAS USED OR YOU LIVE NEAR A WATER TREATMENT PLANT. I WILL TELL YOU BIO SOLIDS OUT OF WATER TREATMENT PLANTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS WASTE IN MOST CASES. AT LEAST I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS TRUE IN NORTH CAROLINA. WHAT ABOUT CONTAMINATION DUE TO AFFF? THIS WAS A STUDY DONE THAT WAS A COMMUNITY-BASED STUDY. WHEN I WAS AT NIAHS WE RAN A PROGRAM CALLED TIME SENSITIVE AWARDS. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A CONTAMINATION INCIDENT AND IT TAKES YOU A YEAR TO GET FUNDING TO STUDY IT AND THEN IT IS GONE. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET IN THERE MORE QUICKLY. THESE ARE AWARDS THAT CAN BE DONE FROM 90 TO 120 DAYS. THIS WAS A STUDY DONE NEAR COLORADO SPRINGS. YOU KNOW THERE IS A LARGE -- THAT'S WHERE THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY IS AND THERE IS A LARGE AIR FORCE BASE. COMMUNITIES ARE HIGHLY CONTAMINATED. WENT IN AND DID A STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DASH THE COLORADO SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. HE WENT IN AND LOOKED AT -- HE MEASURED ADDITIONAL PFAS COMPARED TO -- IN ADDITION TO THESE. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS WHAT IS THE CONTAMINATION? PFHX S&P FOS ARE THE MAJOR CONTAMINANTS. THOSE ARE SIGNATURES FOR AFFF. THAT WAS IMPORTANT STUDIES. I TALKED ABOUT WATER AND I WANTED TO MENTION THE FAST-FOOD PACKAGING ISSUE. THIS WAS A STUDY WHERE THEY ACTUALLY MEASURED TOTAL CHLORINE USING A METHOD CALLED PIGGY WHERE THEY LOOK AT WHAT IS IN THE MOLECULE. TOTAL ORGANIC FLOR -- FLORINE. WE KNOW WE HAVE FLUORIDE IN OUR DRINKING WATER FOR OUR TEETH, BUT THIS IS ORGANIC FLUORIDE. THIS IS LOOKING AT SOLID SURFACES. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS IN YOUR DESSERT AND FOOD WRAPPERS ARE HIGHLY CONTAMINATED AND THE MOST CONTAMINATED. THEN THE SANDWICH AND BURGER WRAPPERS AND THEN PAPER BOARD. THIS WAS A STUDY OF 400 SAMPLES. THE GROUP WENT IN AND THEY ACTUALLY DID A TEST ON A SMALL SAMPLE ON THINGS AND WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MOST COMMON PFAS IN THEIR SAMPLES WERE PFOA AND THEN TWO SHORT CHAINS P PFHXS, AND PFBAS. I WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY BREAK DOWN TO GIVE YOU THE PFOA AND THE PFOS KINDS OF CHEMICALS AS WELL. THIS WAS AN INTERESTING STUDY THAT CAME OUT LAST SUMMER WHERE THIS WAS COMPARING THE LEVELS IN SERUM OF SOME OF THE , QUOTE, LONG CHAIN ONES. DS -- PFOS. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS IN MOST CASES THERE ARE ELEVATED LEVELS IN THE PEOPLE WHO ATE A LOT OF FAST-FOOD. THE DARK CIRCLES ARE AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THIS POPULATION. AND VERSUS NONHISPANIC WHITE AMERICANS. WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE THIS APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED ACTUALLY WITH THE AMOUNT OF FAST-FOOD CONSUMPTION. POSSIBLY THE AMOUNT OF FAST-FOOD AND FRENCH FRIES WERE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR IN THIS STUDY. WE ALL HAVE PFAS IN OUR BODIES. I STARTED OUT SAYING THAT. AND THIS IS NOT JUST IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. IT IS ALL OVER THE WORLD. I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU A SLIDE FROM ALASKA WHERE OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF PFAS. THESE THINGS LIKE ALL OF THE -- ALTHOUGH PFAS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE DYE YOCKS SINS -- DIOXINS. THEY DON'T STAY IN YOUR FAT. THEY BIND TO PROTEIN. FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THEY ARE IN OUR BLOOD. I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU DATA THAT MAKES US WONDER DO WE REALLY KNOW WHERE ELSE THEY ARE IN OUR BODY? ON  THESE THINGS TRAVEL. THEY ARE HIGHLY MOBILE. OUR PEOPLE AS WELL AS ANIMALS AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN ARE MORE CONTAMINATED. THESE THINGS UNDERGO GLOBAL DISTILATION SO THEY VOLUME TALL LIES AND THEN CLOSE DOWN. THE ARCTIC IS HIGHLY CONTAMINATED. THIS IS ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND WHILE PFOA AND PFOS ARE NOT MADE INTENTIONALLY IN THE U.S. ANYMORE, THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA. WE CAN TALK ABOUT MAYBE WHY THE OUTBREAK OF CORONAVIRUS AND COULD PEOPLE BE IMMUNO SUPPRESSED? THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE. THIS IS LOOKING AT THE LEVELS. SINCE IN THE U.S. THEY STOPPED PRODUCING PFOA AND PFOS INTENTIONALLY, IF YOU LOOK UP HERE WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THE LEVELS OF THOSE HAVE COME DOWN, BUT THEY STARTED TO PLATEAU WHICH IS JUST LIKE WE SAW WITH THE PCB'S. THEY ARE RECIRCULATING AND THERE IS NO CHANGE FOR SOME OF THOSE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN REGULATED AT ALL OR DRAWN MUCH ATTENTION. THIS IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY STUDY I KNOW THAT LOOKED AT AUTOPSY SPECIMENS. THIS WAS DONE IN NORTHERN SPAIN. I THINK THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE HERE IS LOOK AT HOW MUCH OF THE SHORT CHAIN PFBA AND PFXHS THERE ARE IN THE LUNGS. FOR EXAMPLE -- I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS IN THE KIDNEY BECAUSE THE KIDNEY IT MAY BE GETTING ELIMINATED THROUGH THE KIDNEY. LOOK AT THE -- LOOK AT THE BRAIN LEVELS FOR SOME OF THEM. WE NEED ANOTHER STUDY. SOMEBODY ELSE. I KEEP PUSHING. IF YOU DO A STUDY ON AUTOPSY SPECIMENS IT IS NOT CONSIDERED HUMAN RESEARCH. YOU CAN GET IT DONE SOONER. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE SAME LEVEL OF SCRUTINY. I THINK THAT IT IS INTERESTING. YOU CAN SEE THE PFOS IN THE LIVER IS ELEVATED. LOOK AT THE PFOA IN THE BONE. A RECENT STUDY FROM FINLAND DEMONSTRATING THE IMPACTS OF THESE KIND OF CHEMICALS, THE PFAS ON THE BONE. THIS WAS COMPARING SOME OF THE LEVELS IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE WORLD. WHERE HAVE YOU CONTAMINATION AND NOT. THE TOP GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE CH STUDY WHICH IS THE STUDY IN THE OHIO VALLEY. I HOPE MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN "DARK WATERS." IF NOT, I RECOMMEND IT. IT IS A STUDY OF HOW THE CONTAMINATION WAS REVEALED AND SATISFACTION WAS ACHIEVED FOR THE RESIDENTS IN THE AREA. WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT THE PFOA WAS ELEVATED. PEOPLE FORGET PFOS WAS ELEVATED IN THAT POPULATION. IT IS COMPARED TO NHANES IN 2015. AND HUGE CONTAMINATION IN THE VENICE AREA OF ITALY. IT IS A MAJOR CONTAMINATION SITE. THEY ARE DOING REALLY NICE WORK AND FOLLOWING UP THE POPULATION. YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS WAS SOME DATA THAT THEY SENT ME FROM DOING AN UPDATED HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND A BIO MONITORING OF THE POPULATION IN THE AREA. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS HOW HIGH THE LEVEL OF PFOA WAS IN THE POPULATION. THEY ARE SEEING IMPACTS ON CHOLESTEROL AND OTHER LEVELS. THEY ARE FOLLOWING CHILDREN AS WELL AS THE ADULTS IN THE POPULATION. INTERESTING ONE TO FOLLOW. THIS IS JUST SHOWING THAT -- THIS IS VERY INTERESTING DATA. GLORIA POSE IS THE WORLD'S GURU ON PFOA. THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PRO -- PROTECTION. THIS IS LOOKING AT THE BLOOD LEVELS. YOU CAN PREDICT THEM AS DRINKING WATER LEVELS RISE. MAYBE IT WAS IN THE FILM LAST NIGHT OR MAYBE THE DISCUSSION, CAN'T REMEMBER. BUT IF YOUR WATER IS NOT HEAVILY CONTAMINATED, YOU ARE GETTING YOUR PFAS FROM YOUR FOOD AND THE DUST IN YOUR HOUSE. IT IS COMING OFF YOUR CARPETS, ET CETERA. IF YOUR WATER IS CONTAMINATED, THAT'S YOUR MAJOR SOURCE. YOU CAN ROUGHLY USE A FACTOR ROUGHLY OF A HUNDRED TO GO FROM THE LEVEL OF WATER MULTIPLIED BY A HUNDRED AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU AN IDEA WHAT THE LEVEL MAY BE IN YOUR BLOOD. THAT'S A ROUGH CALCULATION YOU CAN USE. NOBODY HAS TO MEMORIZE THE LAUNDRY LIST AND IN THIS GROUP YOU MAY HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW BROAD AND WIDE THIS IS. I AM BUSY CALLING PFAS THE DIOXINS OR THE PCV'S OF THE 21st CENTURY. AGAIN, YOU HAVE A LARGE GROUP OF CHEMICALS, ACTUALLY LARGER THAN THE PCB'S OR THE DIOXINES THAT CAUSE A PLETHORA OF AFFECTS ON TISSUE OF MALES AND FEMALES AND MANY LIFE STAGES AND ACROSS THE KINGDOM. WHY WOULD ANYONE THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE? PUT IT THAT WAY. MANY OF THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN SEEN CLEARLY IN THE LARGE STUDY, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN A GROWING LIST OF OTHER INVESTIGATIONS. THE CANCER, TESTICULAR KIDNEY AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS THERE MAY BE OTHER CANCERS AS WELL. REMEMBER, CANCER IS -- YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BIG POPULATION AND YOU HAVE TO GET THE GOOD DATA. ULCER COLITIS, HIGH CHOLESTEROL, PREGNANCY INDUCED HYPER TENSION, THYROID RETENTION, HORMONE, LIVER, OBESITY,. I WILL SHOW YOU BRIEF DATA LOWER BIRTHRATE AND SIZE AND DELAYED PUBERTY, DECREASED FERTILITY, PROSTATE CANCER, OVARIAN CANCER, CHANGES IN BONE DENSITY AND I CAN ADD ON TO THIS. THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE LIST. THIS IS, I WOULD SAY, MOST OF THESE ARE PRETTY WELL DOCUMENTED IN MULTIPLE STUDIES. THE NTB DID A REVIEW OF THE PFOA AND THE PFOS THAT WAS PEER REVIEWED AND PUBLISHED IN 2016. AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THERE WAS CLEAR EVIDENCE IN MULTIPLE ANIMAL SPES -- SPECIES. I AM NOT JUST TALKING RATS. I AM NOT JUST TALKING MICE. I AM TALKING MONKEYS. AND THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE IN HUMANS. SOME OF THE HUMAN DATA IS SHOWN ON YOUR RIGHT WHICH IS THE SUPPRESSION OF THE ANTIBODY RESPONSE TO DIPHTHERIA. THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH IN OUT -- IN UTERO AND CHILDHOOD EXPOSURE. THESE ARE ACTUALLY STUDIES COMING OUT OF SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE FOLLOWED IT SINCE THE 1980s. ALMOST EVERY CHILD BORN IN THE ISLANDS AT THIS TIME. THEY LOOKED AT THE KIDS AFTER THEY GET AN ANTIBODY BOOSTER AND THEY LOOK SEVERAL MONTHS LATER AT H5 AND H -- AGE 5 AND AGE 7 AND EVEN AGE 13 AND THESE KIDS CANNOT MOUNT A NORMAL RESPONSE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? SHOULD WE ASK THE QUESTION? ARE SOME OF THE MEASLES CASES NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE WEREN'T VACCINATED, BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE? I THINK THOSE ARE QUESTIONS WE SHOULD BEGIN TO BE ASKING. I CAN TELL YOU. THESE RESULTS HAVE BEEN REPLICATED IN NORTHERN JAPAN AND SOME OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS HAVE BEEN SEEN IN SEVERAL OTHERS AS WELL. ON GOING EXPOSURE LINKED TO ABNORMAL GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN. THE WOMEN WITH THE HIGHER LEVELS ARE GAINING WEIGHT FASTER DURING PREGNANCY, AND THERE APPEARS TO BE AN ASSOCIATION WITH GESTATIONAL DIABETES RELATED ESPECIALLY FOR EXAMPLE TO PFO S&P FH EX-- PFOS, PFFS. GENERAL -- GENERAL STATIONAL DIABETES INCREASES THE RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES LATER ON. THIS IS ANOTHER STUDY LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PFOS CONCENTRATIONS AND THE RICK -- RISK OF TYPE 2 DIABETES. ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS IT LOOKS LIKE THE GREATEST RISK IS MAYBE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOWEST EXPOSURE. AND BASICALLY IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE -- AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. NOT EVERYBODY IS EQUALLY SUSCEPTIBLE. THERE IS A GENETIC BASIS AND WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN LIFE AND OTHER STRESSORS. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE YOU MAY SEE THE GREATEST EFFECT AT THE LOWEST EXPOSURE LEVELS. THERE ARE MULTIPLE STUDIES SHOWING ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PFAS AND TYPE 2 DIABETES. AND THIS IS AN INTERESTING STUDY SHOWING THAT -- I THINK THIS A DIFFERENCE. BOYS AND GIRLS ARE NOT THE SAME. I CAN TELL YOU YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS DOING STUFF IN THE LABS, IF I DIDN'T GET THE SAME RESULT WITH THE MALE AND FEMALE RAT I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE EXPERIMENT. NOW I KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING RIGHT WITH MY EXPERIMENT. IN FACT, THEY CAN RESPOND DIFFERENTLY. THE IMPORTANT THING IS BIRTH WEIGHT AND HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE, THERE IS AN INCREASE -- A DECREASE OF BIRTH WEIGHT AND INCREASE IN HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE. IT IS GREATER IN THE BOYS THAN THE GIRLS HERE. THERE ARE AFFECTS OBSERVED. THIS IS JUST -- I PULLED OUT SNIPPETS OF DATA. IT SHOWS THE INCREASE IN PFAA AND THAT IS THE RELATIVE OF PFOA. THESE ARE ALL DIFFERENT MEASURES OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN THE BRAIN. WITHOUT LOOKING AT MY NOTES I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT EACH ONE MEANS AND WHAT THEY CAN SEE IS THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE. THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER. THINGS CAN HAPPEN DUE TO EARLY LIFE EXPOSURE THAT YOU DON'T SEE IMMEDIATELY. IT CAN TAKE THREE YEARS, EIGHT YEARS, 20 YEARS, 40 YEARS BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE IMPACTS. BUT CLEARLY AN IMPACT ON BRAIN FUNCTION ON FOLLOWING -- ON CHILDREN IN EARLY LIE EXPOSURE. AND THERE ARE LOTS OF STUDIES WITH ULTRA KIDNEY AND THYROID FUNCTION. IT CAME OUT OF THE CH STUDY AND LOADS OF ANIMAL STUDIES. THIS IS A STUDY DONE IN A COMMUNITY IN OHIO AND IT IS UP STREAM OF WHERE THE CONTAMINATION OCCURRED. THERE WAS CONTAMINATION FROM OTHER SOURCES FROM TO THE ONLY PFOA, AND PFOS S AND WHAT THEY SAW WAS DECREASED KIDNEY FUNCTION AND THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN TSH. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN HUMANS WHEN THE THYROID GETS SCREWED UP, WHAT YOU TEND TO SEE IS CHANGES IN THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE. IN THE RATS AND MICE WHAT YOU TEND TO SEE IS A CHANGE IN CIRCULATING THYROXIN LEVELS. THE CHANGE IN THS SAYS THE THYROID IS BEING STRESSED. IT IS HAVING TROUBLE GETTING OUT SAY ENOUGH T4 IN ORDER TO FUNCTION NORMALLY. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT. THE OTHER POINT IS LAST NIGHT WE HEARD DISCUSSION ABOUT THE HALF LIFE OF THESE CHEMICALS. PFOA HAS A HALF LIFE OF TWO TO THREE YEARS AND PFOA HAS A HALF LIFE OF FOUR TO SIX YEARS. I SAY ROUGH BECAUSE THERE IS VARIABILITY IN PEOPLE. PFHXS APPEARS TO HAVE A HALF LIFE OF GREATER THAN 10 YEARS. NOT ONLY IN THIS STUDY, BUT A HIGHLY EXPOSED POPULATION IN SWEDEN BEING FOLLOWED. VERY, VERY LONG HALF LIFE FOR PFHXS. THE KEY QUESTION I SAY IS PFOA, PFOS, THEY ARE NOT BEING MADE. SOME IS STILL WITH US AND WILL BE WITH US FOREVER. WE NOW HAVE REPLACEMENTS. WE SHOULD BE ASKING THE QUESTIONS,ING ARE THEY PERSISTENT? I TOLD YOU IN THE ENVIRONMENT THEY ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE PERSISTENT. ARE THEY TOXIC? WE BETTER LOOK AT THAT. TOXICITY, MAYBE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACUTE AND LONG-TIME TOXICITY. ARE THEY WELL TAKEN UP? WHERE DO THEY GO? CAN WE GET RID OF THEM? I I WILL COME BACK TO THE ISSUE OF CAN WE GET RID OF THEM -- WELL, LET ME TELL YOU BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE SLIDES. CLR -- CHARCOAL FILTERS IF YOU KEEP CHANGING THEM CAN RAY MOVE IT FROM THE DRINKING WATER, THE PFOA AND THE PFOS. THE LONG CHAIN ONES, IT DOES NEXT TO NOTHING WITH THESE NEW SHORT CHAIN ONES. THE ONLY THING WE KNOW AT THIS POINT REALLY THAT CAN WELL REMOVE THE SHORT CHAINS ARE REVERSE OSMOSIS. REVERSE OSMOSIS, LIKE YOU CAN PUT IT UNDER YOUR SINK AND IN YOUR KITCHEN AND IT IS NOT HORRIBLY EXPENSIVE, BUT TO DO IT FOR YOUR WHOLE HOUSE YOU ARE TALKING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. THESE ARE SOME OF THE AFFECTS AND ALTERNATIVES TO PFOA AND PFOS ON THE LIVER. THIS IS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ACIDS AND THE SULFINATED ACIDS. YOU CAN SEE THE PFOS ALTERNATIVE HAS LOTS OF AFFECT ON CYT T.O. CINES -- CYTOKINES IN THE LIVER WHICH IS RELATED TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE CLEARLY EFFECTS THERE. CLEARLY AFFECTS THERE. THE ALCOHOLS BREAK DOWN TO GIVE YOU THE PFAS THAT AREN'T ALCOHOLS. THESE ARE PRESENT AS SIDE CHAINS ALONG POLYMERS. WHAT HAPPENS? THEY DON'T GET BROKEN DOWN, BUT THEY ARE CLEAVED OFF THE POLYMER. AND NOW YOU GET THE ALCOHOL THAT STAYS IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND IT CAN BREAK DOWN TO GIVE YOU THE SULFINATE. I THINK WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT, YES, POLYMERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE WELL BY LOGICALLY ABSORBED. I AGREE TO THAT. BUT TO USE POLLY NEITHERS -- POLYMERS YOU NEED MOLYMERS. YOU HAVE TO USE MY FAVORITE GENX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THOSE THINGS ESCAPE DURING PRODUCTION. AND SOME CAN BE REDUCED DURING BREAK DOWN. AND THEN WHAT DO WE DO WITH POLYMERS THAT DON'T GO AWAY WE AGREE WE DON'T WANT A LOT OF STYROFOAM BECAUSE IT WILL BE HERE A MILLION YEARS FROM NOW, SO WHY ARE WE NOW MAKING OTHER POLYMERS THAT WILL BE HERE CERTAINLY FOR AS LONG AS HUMANITY MAY SURVIVE. THIS IS A STUDY LOOKING -- HOW COME THAT DIDN'T COME UP? THERE IT IS. IT IS THE CLASS COMPARISON OF PFAS IN THE LIVER. THE NTP DID 28-DAY STUDIES IN RATS, SO SEVEN PFAS BOTH SHORT CHAIN AND LONG CHAIN ONES AND BASICALLY TO GIVE YOU THE TAKE HOMELESS SON THIS IS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ENZYMATIC RESPONSES. THE SHORT CHAIN DID AS THE LONG CHAIN DID, BUT YOU HAD TO USE MORE OF THEM. THEIR HALF LIFE IN THE BODY IS SHORTER. YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM A HIGHER DOSE. IF YOU GIVE THEM ENOUGH YOU GET THE SAME LIVER EFFECTS, YOU GET THE SAME THYROID EFFECT. THOSE ARE THE END POINTS THERE. CURRENTLY NTP IS LOOKING AT THE IMMUNE RESPONSE FOR THESE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE PFEA DOES THE SAME THING AS PFOA IN SUPPRESSING THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AT LEAST IN THE MICE WHERE THEY ARE BEING LOOKED AT. SO NTP HAS ALSO SAID, WAIT A MINUTE. THERE ARE 5,000 OF THESE CHEMICALS, PLUS OR MINUS. THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN TEST EVERY CHEMICAL THAT IS GOING TO BE MADE. THEY ARE LOOKING AT A CLASS KIND OF APPROACH THAT ON YOUR RIGHT IS FROM A PAPER WHERE THEY WERE TRYING TO GROUP THE PFAS INTO DIFFERENT CLASSES. NTP IS WORKING WITH THE EPA RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE TESTING MORE THAN 160 DIFFERENT CHEMICALS AND SEEING IF THEY CAN GROUP THEM BASED ON A VARIETY OF SHORT-TERM COMPUTATIONS TO GET AN IDEA IF THEY CAN DO THAT. THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING AT 10 DIFFERENT AFFF'S AS WELL. THE IDEA IS THIS IS FOCUSED RESEARCH. I COULDN'T LEAVE NORTH CAROLINA OUT OF THE EQUATION SINCE THAT'S WHERE I AM FROM. UP IN YOUR RIGHT HAND CORNER IS KIND OF A LITTLE MAP OF THE CAPE FEAR RIVER. YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE KEYMORE PLANT IS. IT IS KIND OF RIGHT BY -- LET'S SEE. C IS THE CITY OF WILMINGTON AND THE CITY OF 260,000 PEOPLE WHERE THEIR ENTIRE DRINKING SUPPLY WAS AFFECTED. THEY WERE DUMPING IT INTO THE RIVER. THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T DOING IT, BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY WERE. IN ADDITION THE RIVER HAS LOTS OF OTHER PFAS IN IT. IN FACT, WHEN MARK STREINER AND LEE FERGUSON AND THE OTHER CHEMISTS WENT IN AND TOOK SAMPLES FROM THE RIVER THEY COULD BELIEVE -- THEY COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR 20% OF THE PFAS IN THE RIVER. THAT'S ALL THEY COULD ACCURATELY DEFINE THAT THEY HAD STANDARDS FOR. THERE WAS LOTS OF STUFF THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WAS IN THE RIVER. IF YOU HAPPEN TO LIVE NEAR WHERE THE PLANT WAS, TURNS OUT THERE WERE ERROR MISSIONS. IF YOU HAD YOUR NICE GARDEN OR FARMS IN THAT AREA, THEIR PRODUCE WAS CONTAMINATED AS WELL. BUT ANYHOW, THE GROUP FROM NORTH CAROLINA STATE WAS WORKING WITH A GROUP -- ACTUALLY THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE STATE AND EASTERN CAROLINA UNIVERSITY GOT TOGETHER AND EVEN SOME FOLKS FROM DUKE. THERE IS A LOT OF RIVALRY IN NORTH CAROLINA. THEY GOT TOGETHER AND THEY DID A COMMUNITY STUDY WHERE THEY RECRUITED SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE FROM THE AGES OF 6 TO WHATEVER. NONPREGNANT WOMEN. AND THEY MEASURED -- THIS WAS -- THIS WAS -- BY THE TIME THEY GOT IN THERE IT WAS SIX MONTHS AFTER THE STATE HAD SAID YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS. AND SO THE LEVELS IN THE RIVER HAD DROPPED. THEY MEASURED GENX IN DRINKING WATER. THEY FOUND SOME IN THE WATER, BUT COULDN'T FIND GENX IN THE PEOPLE. GUESS WHAT. THEY FOUND OTHER THINGS IN THE PEOPLE. THEY FOUND NOT ONLY PFOS AND SOME PFOA, BUT THEY FOUND FOUR BRAND-NEW PFAS THAT HAD NEVER BEEN REPORTED IN PEOPLE BEFORE. SOME OF THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL SHORT CHAINS. YOU KNOW, THEY ARE ONES WITH EATER -- ETHER LINKS BETWEEN THE CARBONS. AGAIN SOME OF THESE DROPPED ONCE THEY STOPPED DUMPING IT INTO THE RIVER. AGAIN WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT THE LEVELS OF THE LEGACY PFOS, THE PFOA AND THE PFOS WERE FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN THEY WERE IN THE GENERAL -- AND NHANES WHICH IS THE GENERAL POPULATION AT THE SAME POINT IN TIME. THESE ARE A COUPLE OF MY STUDY THAT'S I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE -- I ALREADY TOLD YOU IF YOU SEE SOMETHING IN LOTS OF ANIMALS IT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN SOME PEOPLE. I THINK WHEN WE HAVE EP DEEM LOGICAL -- EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FINDING IT IS REPEATED NOT ONLY BY REPETITION, BUT IN ANIMAL DATA YOU GET THE SAME RESPONSES. WE ALL KNOW RATS ARE NOT PEOPLE. SOME PEOPLE MAY BE RATS, BUT THAT IS ANOTHER ISSUE. ANYHOW. [LAUGHTER]. IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE RETIRED, GUYS. ANYHOW, THIS IS A COMPARISON. SUE FENTON HAS BEEN DOING A SERIES OF STUDIES, DEVELOPMENTAL STUDIES USING MICE IN HER MODEL. THIS IS WHERE SHE IS EXPOSING THEM AND IT IS STARTING RIGHT FROM THE INITIATION OF PREGNANCY AND THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY AND LOOKING, FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE LEVEL IN THE LIVER AND LOOKING AT RESPONSES. WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE ARE THE LIVER LEVELS FOR EXAMPLE, THIS IS PFOA TO GENX. GENX IS RAP -- RAPIDLY ELIMINATED. BUT IT IS STILL THERE. YOU CAN SEE AN INCREASE IN GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN WITH THE GENX. YOU CAN SEE HERE WHETHER YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE STAW -- STATISTICAL APPROACH. YOU CAN SEE THE SAME THING WITH GENX WITH PFOA EVEN THOUGH THE LEVELS IN THE LIVER ARE LOWER. YOU COULD SAY IT IS HIT-AND-RUN, ALTHOUGH THESE ANIMALS ARE BEING DOSED EVERY DAY. IT IS GETTING IN THERE AND IT IS HAVING AN AFFECT AND CAUSING A RESPONSE. AND THEN AFFECTS ON MAMMARY GLAND DEVELOPMENT. SUE IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S EXPERTS ON RODENT MAMMARY GLAND DEVELOPMENT AND THIS IS THE DATA WITH PFOA WHERE YOU CAN SEE A DOSE RESPONSE AND AN INHIBITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAMMARY GLAND. THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE HIGHER. AS THE GLAND DEVELOPS THERE IS THE BRANCHING OF THE MAMMARY DUCTAL THAT'S GROW OUT TO EVENTUALLY GIVE YOU THE PLACES THAT CAN PRODUCE MILK. YOU CAN SEE AS YOU INCREASE THE PFOA DOSE THAT LEVEL GOES -- YOU GET LESS DEVELOPMENT. YOU CAN SEE THE SAME THING WITH GENX. AND SO AGAIN, GENX IS DOING THE SAME THING. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A SHORT CHAIN DOING THE SAME THING AS A LONG CHAIN. SO JUST TO REMIND YOU -- AND I FORGOT TO STICK BONE ON HERE. I MADE THIS A FEW MONTHS -- I SHOULDN'T SAY I MADE IT. THIS IS WHEN I WORKED. SOMEBODY MADE THIS FOR ME BEFORE I LEFT. IT IS PRETTY. YOU CAN TELL THE SLIDES I MADE , THE ONES I PULLED TOGETHER. THE POINT IS A MULTI-SYSTEM TOXICAN OR A FAMILY OF TOXICANS. I GAVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF COMMUNITY RESEARCH. THERE WAS ONE IN CAROLINA -- COLORADO AND NORTH CAROLINA. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY RESEARCH. YOU CAN'T DO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH UNLESS YOU WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY. THAT DOESN'T MEAN A HELICOPTER TRIP. THAT MEANS YOU GET IN FROM THE GET GO. THE COMMUNITIES, THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE LIVING IT. THEY KNOW THE QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. THE BEAUTY OF SOME OF THIS IS THE COMMUNITIES ALSO. IT IS NOT ONLY DO THE SCIENTISTS GROW, BUT THE COMMUNITIES GROW IF THEIR KNOWLEDGE AS WELL. SO AGAIN COMPLETELY ADVANCING THE RESEARCH GENERAL AND IT BUILDS THE CAPACITY OF EVERYBODY. IN OUR COUNTRY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE IS TERRIBLE. WE CAN HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER. WE REALLY CAN GET YOUTH INVOLVED. FREQUENTLY THEY ARE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIEN -- COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORES. ESPECIALLY WITH THE TEENAGERS WHO ARE TURNED ON. WE INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF THE FIELD AND THE DIVERSITY STRENGTHENS ALL OF US AS PEOPLE. YOU GET THE COMMUNITY INVOLVED AND EVEN WHEN GRANT FUNDING RUNS OUT, THE COMMUNITY IS STILL THERE. THEY ARE STILL INVOLVED. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT CULTURAL SENSITIVITY WHEN WE ARE WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES. OFTEN SOME OF THE INVESTIGATORS ARE NOT OF THE SAME RACIAL OR ETHNIC MIX OR SOCIO AND ECONOMIC MIX AS THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WORK. YOU NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN A COMMUNITY THERE IS VARIATIONS EVEN WITHIN A COMMUNITY. GENDER AND AGE. I MADE A JOKE THAT IF I HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY COMPUTER I WOULD GO TO MY YOUNGEST GRAND KID. PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT AGES WILL RESPOND DIFFERENTLY. WE HAVE DIFFERENCES IN LANGUAGE. SOME OF THAT -- EVERYBODY MIGHT SPEAK ENGLISH IN A COMMUNITY, BUT THEY DON'T MEAN THE SAME THING. WE HAVE TO WORK AT UNDERSTANDING THAT. AGAIN, WE HAVE TO LISTEN AS WELL AS SPEAK. THIS IS PICTURES OF A SMALL ISLAND NEAR THE INTERNATIONAL DATELINE. IT IS ABOUT 180 MILES SOUTHWEST OF NOME. I WAS THERE. I PAID A VISIT. THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST CONTAMINATED PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE CONTAMINATED IN PART BECAUSE THEY ARE PERSISTENT HUNTERS AND FISHERS. WHALES, SEALS. THEY USED TO BE CALLED THE WALRUS HUNTERS BECAUSE WALRUS WAS THEIR SPECIALTY. NOW BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- AND NOW I CAN SAY THAT -- [LAUGHTER]. THE WALRUS BASICALLY -- THE ICE, WHEN THEY WENT FISHING AND HUNTING FOR WALRUS, IT IS EARLY SPRING AND SOLID ICE IS NOT FAR ENOUGH SOUTH. THE WALRUS ARE LANDING UP AND BEACHING BY BARROW AT THE TOP OF ALASKA. THEY ARE NOT COMING FAR ENOUGH SOUTH. THESE PEOPLE ARE ALSO EATING THE FISH IN THE COUPLE OF STREAMS ON THIS ISLAND. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS. I HAVE TO SAY THIS. DURING THE COLD WAR THERE WERE TWO AIR FORCE BASES ON THE ISLAND THAT WERE LISTENING STATIONS FOR THE RUSSIANS. AND ON A CLEAR DAY, WHICH I HAVE TO BELIEVE DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN. WHEN I WAS THERE WE WERE IN NOME IN THE AIRPORT WHICH IS A SQUARE BOX FOR TWO DAYS BEFORE THE PLANES COULD FLY. WHEN YOU, YOU KNOW -- ON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN SEE RUSSIA. [LAUGHTER]. ANYWAY, SARA PAY -- SARA PALIN'S HUSBAND WAS ON SAINT LAWRENCE ISLAND. MAYBE SHE THOUGHT THE SUBURB OF ANCHORAGE SHE COULD SEE IT. THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. I WILL TELL YOU THE WORK THAT NIH HAS DONE WITH A COMMUNITY GROUP CALLED THE ALASKAN COMMUNITY AGAINST TOXICS WHERE THEY DEVELOPED LEADERSHIP ROLES AND THEY FUNDED GRANTS AND THEY TRAINED THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND THEY ACTUALLY WHEN I SAY YOUNG PEOPLE, TEENAGERS HAS GONE TO THE INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS ON POPS IN GENEVA, SWITZERLAND TO TALK ABOUT THEIR SITUATION. AND THEY ARE HIGHLY EXPOSED NOT ONLY, FOR EXAMPLE, TO PCB'S, BUT TO PFAS AS WELL. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SHOW ALL OF THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT IS GOING ON, BUT RELATED EXCLUSIVELY TO PFAS. WHAT I DID WAS HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE WORDS THAT I THOUGHT MIGHT HELP YOU GET SOME OF THE IDEAS OF WHAT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY GROUPS ARE DOING. THE UNIVERSITIES -- THESE ARE JUST ONES WORKING IN THIS AREA ON THE EAST COAST. WATER MAKING, PRESENTATIONS, HOLDING WORKSHOPS AND HOLDING COMMUNITY MEETINGS, DEVELOPING DATABASES, PROVIDING TECHNICAL EXPERTISE, WORKING UNDER MEDIATION APPROACHES, PARTNERING WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS, MEASURING PFAS IN WELLS, DEVELOPING INFOGRAPHICS AND WORKING WITH STATE REPRESENTATIVES AND FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES TOO, BEING ON THE RADIO, HAVING BOOTHS AT DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEETINGS -- KINDS OF COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND DOING COMMUNITY SCREENING WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT. SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS GOING FORWARD? WE ARE ALL EXPOSED TO PFAS. THERE ARE TOO MANY TO DO PROPER MIXTURE TOXILOGICAL-TYPE TESTING. THE PFAS ARE ALL PERSISTENT AND WE THINK THEY ARE ALL HIGHLY MOBILE. THEY ARE ON A LIFE CYCLE BASIS. THEREFORE WE WANT TO PREVENT PROBLEMS BY ELIMINATING NONESSENTIAL USES. IF YOU DON'T NEED IT, LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT. AND WE CAN HAVE LIMITS FOR CONTAMINATION. I ALREADY SAID WE CAN'T REMEDIATE A RIVER SYSTEM. WE CAN'T REMEDIATE THOUSANDS OF SQUARE MILES OF CONTAMINATED LAND, FOR EXAMPLE. THE KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT, I WANT TO KNOW, IS WHAT WE ARE MEASURING IN MY BLOOD, AND AT THIS POINT WE ROUTINELY MEASURE MAYBE 16 SOME GROUPS CAN GET MEASURED. THERE ARE 5,000 OF THESE. ARE WE MEASURE -- MEASURING 90% OF WHAT IS IN OUR BLOOD OR 10% OF WHAT IS IN OUR BLOOD? THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE. ONE PAPER WHERE PEOPLE TRIED TO LOOK AT THAT IN ONE POPULATION AND IT WAS 80%, GOOD, AND THEN ANOTHER POPULATION IT WAS 30%. NOT SO GOOD. I THINK WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT THESE TOTAL ORGANIC ANALYSIS. WE REALLY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF ESSENTIALITY. WHERE ARE THE CHEMICALS REALLY, REALLY NEEDED AND WHERE CAN THERE BE SAFER ALTERNATIVES? WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION BEFORE WE DO THE WHACK A MOLE APPROACH, ARE OUR SUBSTITUTES BETTER? WE ARE NOT CLEAR THEY ARE. AND AGAIN, HOW CAN WE ADDRESS PFAS? AS A CLASS, A SINGLE CLASS OR SUBCLASSES? THE IDEA OF ADDRESSING CHEMICALS AS A CLASS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THAT'S HOW WE TREAT DIOXINS AND THIS IS HOW WE TREAT PCB'S. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS A NOVEL CONCEPT. THE NATIONAL ACADEMY ON A REQUEST FROM THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION SUPINED THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THE HALOGEN FLAME RETAR DENSE AND TREAT THEM IN THE SAME APPROACH. YOU MAY HAVE TO BREAK THEM INTO SEVERAL CLASSES, BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY ONE. SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THE EVENT THAT MAY HAVE SHIFTED OUR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PARADIGM? DDT AND PERSISTENT PESTICIDES, THE SILENT SPRING SPH THAT LEAD TO THE CREATION OF THE EPA BY RICHARD NIXON IN 1970, THE CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR PLANT AND THE CONCERN WITH NUCLEAR POWER IN INDIA WITH THE TERRIBLE CHEMICAL CONTAMINATION WHERE THERE ARE, I MEAN, THOUSANDS. I THINK THERE WAS 30 OR -- 30,000, 40,000 THAT DIED QUICKLY. OR LIBBY, MONTANA, THE CONTAMINATION THERE. THE ONLY SITE IN THE NATION WHERE WE HAVE DEAD BODIES. UN -- UNEQUIVOCAL. I THINK WE WANT TO ASK OUR PFAS -- ARE THEY GOING TO APPROACH THIS? ARE THE UNDERSTANDINGS THAT WE ARE GETTING COMING OUT OF THE CH STUDY IN PARKERSBURG OR IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IN FAYETTEVILLE AND ALL OF THE MILITARY BASES, IS IT GOING TO MAKE US THINK DIFFERENTLY? IT IS ACTUALLY FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO THE MADRID STATEMENT CAME OUT THAT SAID WE CALL THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO COOPERATE IN LIMITED PRODUCTION AND THE DEVELOPING SAFER NONFLOURINATED AND SAFER ALTERNATIVES. IT WAS SIGNED BY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF SCIENTISTS. SO MY FINAL THOUGHT IS ONE WE SHOULD ALL ASK. WHY DO WE CONTINUE TO MAKE CHEMICALS THAT WILL NEVER GO AWAY? WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE CHEMICAL THAT'S ARE PERSISTENT. THANK YOU ALL. [APPLAUSE]. DO WE HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS?  [INAUDIBLE]. WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES FOR A FEW QUESTIONS.  I KEPT ON TIME. I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED. ANY QUESTIONS? HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM.  [INAUDIBLE QUESTION].  RIGHT.  [INAUDIBLE QUESTION].  YOU HAVE TO HEAT IT TO I HAVE HEARD GREATER THAN 1200-DEGREES AND I HAVE SEEN 1400 AND EVEN 1600. IF YOU GO ON EPA'S WEBSITE ABOUT INSIN RATION AND ASK CAN YOU USE INCINERATION TO GET RID OF PFAS, THE ANSWER IS THAT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARLY SHOW. SOME PEOPLE, THERMAL OXIDATION, THEY SAY IT CAN WORK. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH LIMITED AMOUNTS OF MATERIALS LIKE SAY GRANULAR ACTIVATED CHARCOAL COMING OUT OF THE FILTER. YOU CAN'T DO IT FOR A RIVER. YOU CAN'T DO IT FOR A LAKE. YOU ARE TREATING -- IT IS A LIMITED UTILITY. I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT THE GAC, THE GRANULAR ACTIVATED CHARCOAL, DOES NOT DO A GOOD JOB REMOVING THE SHORT CHAIN. A PAPER WAS PUBLISHED LAST WEEK AND COMING OUT OF HEATHER STAPLETON'S LAB ALONG WITH A BUNCH OF OTHERS SHOWING THAT IN FACT THAT THE -- THAT REALLY THE SHORT CHAINS ARE NOT WELL REMOVED BY THAT. I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK, THESE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE QUESTIONS. PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO PUT REVERSE OSMOSIS SYSTEMS IN THEIR HOUSE. SOME PEOPLE REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT IT UNDER THEIR SINK. I WAS FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT MY HOUSE. I HAVE A NEW REFRIGERATOR AND IT HAS A CHARCOAL FILTRATION SYSTEM BUILT INTO THE REFRIGERATOR. MY HOUSE IS ONE OF THE ONES THAT HEATHER SAMPLED. IT DOESN'T REMOVE A LOT OF WHAT IS IN OUR WATERS NOW. I AM BEGINNING TO SAY THAT I NEED TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. OTHER QUESTIONS? YEAH.  [INAUDIBLE QUESTION]. SHOW THAT THESE CHEMICAL CONTAMINATIONS CAUSE [INAIDABLE]. AND SOME STUDIES A COUPLE YEARS AGO CAME OUT AND SAID [INAUDIBLE] I CAN'T HELP THINK THERE WAS CONTAMINATION. I WAS WONDERING ON WHAT BASIS HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED THOSE CAUSES?  THERE ARE -- OKAY. THERE ARE SEVERAL EP DEEM LOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS THAT SHOW IT. THERE ARE A BUNCH OF EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL STUDY THAT'S SHOW IT AND MECHANISTIC STUDIES. THE PFAS ARE ACTIVATORS OF PPAA. IT IS A RECEPTOR WE HAVE IN OUR BODY THAT'S IS INVOLVED IN FAT PRODUCTION AND THE GENERATION OF MORE ADIPOCITES AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY WE ARE SEEING A PROBLEM WITH BONE DENSITY. THERE IS A SWITCH. YOU GO TO BONE OR ADIPOCYTES. THERE IS THAT SWITCH. I WOULDN'T SAY NECESSARILY THESE CHEMICALS ARE MAKING US FAT. I WOULD SAY THEY ARE INCREASING THE RISK FOR US TO BE FAT.  [INAUDIBLE QUESTION].  I HAVE ONE GENTLEMAN HERE AND THEN THE REMOTE ONE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I WAS ACTUALLY WONDERING WHAT MAKES THE CHEMICAL FALL OFF IN COOKING OR WEARING OUR JACKET.  SO THESE CHEMICALS ARE NOT CHEMICALLY BONDED TO THE SURFACE OF YOUR CLOTHES OR YOUR CARPETS OR COOKWARE. THEY ARE ADDED. FOR EXAMPLE YEARS AGO I KNOW PEOPLE SAID TO ME IF YOU HAVE TEFLON PANS, DON'T USE THEM ON A REALLY HIGH HEAT. THAT WILL INCREASE THE VOLATILIZATION FROM THE SURFACE. THEY JUST COME OFF. YOU DOFNT -- YOU DON'T HAVE A CHEMICAL BOND LINKING THE PFOA OR GENX -- AND GENX BY THE WAY IS A REPLACEMENT FOR PFOA, LINKING IT TO THE PRODUCT. THAT'S WHY WE FIND HIGH LEVELS IN DUST, HOUSE DUST FOR EXAMPLE. THE QUESTION FROM --  [INAUDIBLE QUESTION]. IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT. IT IS A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM. THIS IS THE ABSENCE OF REGULATION. IT HAS MADE IT SO MUCH WORSE. THERE IS NO FEDERAL REGULATION. THE EPA IN 2016 ISSUED A LIFETIME HEALTH ADVISORY WHICH MANY OF THINK IS WAY TOO HIGH. IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN HAVING NOTHING, BUT IT IS NOT A REGULATORY RULE. WHAT DEBBIE DINGLE WAS TRYING TO GET THROUGH IN THE LAST CONGRESS WAS GETTING PFAS LISTED AS SUPER FUN CHEMICALS, AS HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS AND THEY WOULD FALL UNDER THE SUPER FUN REGULATION. IT WOULD LEAD TO SOME KIND OF A REGULATION. THE ISSUE IS IS IN MY PERSONAL VIEW WE NEED TO REGULATE THESE AS A CLASS. I TALKED ABOUT BRIEFLY THIS TOPIC OF ESSENTIALITY. IT BASICALLY SAID LET'S LOOK AT PFAS AS A TEST OF THIS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THREE CLASSES. ITS USE IS NOT REALLY NEEDED. I DON'T REALLY NEED MY NEW HIKING BOOTS TO BE COMPLETELY WATER RESISTANT. OKAY? THAT'S OKAY. I DON'T NEED THAT. SO STOP USING IT. THE SECOND CLASS IS THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT USE. MAYBE IT IS AN INDUSTRIAL USE FOR SOMETHING THEY NEEDED TO MAKE. FIRST OF ALL, YOU BETTER USE IT SO IT DOESN'T ESCAPE INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, A CLOSED SYSTEM. SECOND OF ALL, MAYBE THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE AND I SHOULD SAY A SAFE ALTERNATIVE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN TESTED BEFORE IT GOES ON THE MARKET. SAY THERE IS -- SO YOU SWITCH TO THE SAFE ALTERNATIVE. AND THEN THE THIRD CLASS IS WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE. THERE MAY BE CERTAIN MEDICAL USES, FOR EXAMPLE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVES, BUT YOU CONTINUE IN THE THIRD CATEGORY. THAT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT COMPARED TO THE OTHERS THAT WE HAVE. I THINK THERE HAS GOT TO BE -- I AM A BIG BELIEVER THAT IT IS THE MARKET BASKET SPEAKS. WE'VE GOT TO GET PEOPLE ENRAGED, OUTRAGED ENOUGH TO SAY WE ARE JUST NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE. [APPLAUSE].  I WANT TO THANK LINDA ONCE MORE FOR A FABULOUS PRESENTATION AND A GREAT KICKOFF FOR THE CONVERSATION TODAY. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THOSE ON THE -- WHO ARE JOINING REMOTELY FOR SENDING IN QUESTIONS. WE HAVE HAD A REQUEST FROM THE REMOTE SPEAKERS TO HAVE THE SPEAKERS REPEAT THE QUESTION. I WILL REMIND YOU OF THAT. THEY CAN'T HEAR UNLESS IT GOES INTO THE MIC. OKAY. I WILL INVITE OUR NEXT PANELIST UP. AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE FRONT OF THE ROOM I WILL JUST DO A BRIEF INTRODUCTION. THE MICHIGAN CHEMICAL COMPANY WHICH WAS LATER RENAMED VALSICOL CLOSED ITS DOORS IN MICHIGAN IN 1978 AND LEAVING THE TOPIC LEGACY OF THREE SUPER FUN SITES IN OUR STATE. A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS STILL CONTAMINATED MORE THAN 40 YEARS LATER. IN 1973 THE CHEMICAL COMPANY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL DISASTER IN U.S. HISTORY. IT WAS NOT JUST THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, BUT IN THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. THEY SHIPPED FIRE RETARDANTS KNOWN AS PCB. INSTEAD OF A NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT, SO IT WAS MIXED IN WITH LIVESTOCK FEED. MILLIONS OF MICHIGAN RESIDENTS CONSUMED FARM PRODUCTS CONTAINING PVB AS A RESULT. DR. MICHELLE MAR COS AND JPM HAVE BEEN WORKING -- I HAVE HERE OVER 25 YEARS, BUT I THINK IT IS LONGER THAN THAT.  WE HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENTLY WORKING FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS AND PARTNERS MORE THAN 10.  THANK YOU. TO UNDERSTAND THE LONG-HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS OF THE CONTAMINATION AS WELL AS THE LONG-TERM ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS. I AM DELIGHTED TO WELCOME THEM TO THE PODIUM, AND THEY ARE GONNA TALK TO YOU A LITTLE ABOUT THEIR WORK. [APPLAUSE].  WHILE SHE IS DOING THIS, I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET PFAS UNDER THE SUPER FUN REGULATIONS -- SUPER FUND REGULATIONS TO ASK LEGISLATORS TO INCLUDE IN THAT BILL A REINSTATEMENT OF THE SUPER FUND TAX. THERE IS NO FUND ANYMORE. BECAUSE THERE WAS A SUPER FUND TAX ON CHEMICAL COMPANIES IT WAS A VERY SMALL TAX, BUT IT BUILT UP A FUND THAT COULD BE USED TO CLEAN UP SITES SUCH AS THE ONES WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHERE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY WAS ALLOWED TO GO HOME. I DON'T KNOW. DOD IS ASKING LIKE A NONRESPONSIBLE PARTY. I THINK IF YOU COULD GET THE SUPER FUND TAX REINSTATED AND HAVE AN ACTUAL FUND FOR THESE CLEAN UPS TO DRAW UPON, THAT'S A MONEY SOURCE, AND IT SHOULD COME FROM THE CHEMICAL COMPANIES. ONE PERSON TOLD US THAT THE SIZE OF THE TAX ON THE CHEMICAL COMPANIES WAS ABOUT EQUIVALENT TO A FAMILY OF FOUR ORDERING ONE CHEESE PIZZA A YEAR. IT IS NOT AN ONEROUS TAX. LET'S GET THAT DONE. ALL RIGHT. [UH PLACE]. [APPLAUSE]. ONE OF THE THINGS LINDA WAS TALKING ABOUT, HOW TO DEAL YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR WITH ALL OF THESE NEW CHEMICALS COMING ALONG. I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WE GO BACK EVEN FURTHER TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM AND START REQUIRING CHEMICALS TO UNDERGO THE SAME RIGOROUS RESEARCH AND TESTING THAT PHARMACEUTICALS GO UNDER BEFORE THEY ARE ALLOWED INTO THE HUMAN POPULATION. RIGHT NOW CHEMICAL COMPANIES CAN MANUFACTURE ANYTHING THEY WANT AND PUT IT OUT THERE. LATER WHEN WE COME AND SAY IT IS MAKING ME SICK, THEY WILL SAY, WELL HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT? YOU ARE EXPOSED TO SO MANY THINGS. WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING AND GET THE REGULATION THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THE RESEARCH AND DO THE TESTING AND MAKE SURE IT IS SAFE OR WHATEVER USE THEY NEED AND IT IS NOT GOING TO HURT PEOPLE. OKAY? ALL RIGHT. NOW THE SLIDES. HERE WE GO. HERE? I AM FROM ST. LOUIS, MICHIGAN, HERE. WE ARE THE GEOGRAPHICAL CENTER OF THE LOWER PENINSULA. IF YOU DRIVE NORTH ON 127 AND START SEEING A BUNCH OF WIND MILLS YOU WILL KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE LIVE. ST. LOUIS WAS KNOWN FOR ITS HEALING WATERS, IT WAS FOR MANY MANY YEARS. PEOPLE WOULD COME TO ST. LOUIS, MANY WELL-KNOWN SENATORS BACK IN THE 19th CENTURY WILL COME TO ST. LOUIS TO DRINK THE WATERS AND ALSO TO TAKE BATHES IN THEM AND TO HEAL WHATEVER ALED THEM -- AILED THEM. THE PICTURE ON THAT SIDE SHOWS AN OLD BOTTLE OF THE MINERAL WATER THAT WAS SOLD. HERE IS THE CHEMICAL PLANT WHEN IT WAS IN PRODUCTION. YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE IS A NEIGHBORHOOD ALL-AROUND AND THE RIVER RIGHT THROUGH THERE. AND THE BIG WHITE BLOTCH IS A CONTAMINANT OF SOME SORT GOING OUT TO THE RIVER. THE MICHIGAN CHEMICAL WAS MANUFACTURED ABOUT 250 DIFFERENT CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS IN THEIR LIFE SPAN. D -- DDT WAS ONE OF THEM. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE THINK DDT DISAPPEARED OUT OF AMERICA AFTER RACHEL CARSON'S BOOK CAME OUT. BUT I WILL SHOW YOU IN A FEW MINUTES THAT IT DID NOT. AT LEAST IN OUR TOWN. SO THEN WHEN MICHIGAN CHEMICAL BECAME VALSICOL CHEMICAL, IT CONTINUED MANUFACTURING OTHER THINGS -- IT STOPPED WITH THE DDT SOON AFTER THAT. BUT THEN IT GOT INTO PBB. AND SO THAT IS THE EPICENTER OF THE PBB DISASTER. AND THAT WAS THE LARGEST -- NOT ONLY AGRICULTURAL, BUT THE LARGEST FOOD CONTAMINATION ACCIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA UNTIL THIS DAY. HOPEFULLY THERE IS NOTHING BIGGER. THERE ARE ABOUT 9 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN ST. LOUIS AT THAT TIME -- OR MICHIGAN AT THAT TIME. IT GOT INTO THE FOOD CHAIN AS AMY TOLD YOU AND WE WENT TO THE STORES AND WE BOUGHT OUR HAMBURGER AND CHEESE AND EGGS AND MILK AND BUTTER AND IT ALL -- WE ALL GOT THE PBB IN OUR SYSTEM THAT WAY. SOME OF YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE GOTTEN IT THAT WAY. AND THEN LATER MICHELLE IS GOING TO SHOW HOW IT ISN'T JUST YOU WHO ARE EXPOSED. IT IS YOUR OFF SPRING. IT IS YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. THE BEST BOOK ON THE WHOLE PBB DISASTER IS THE POISONING OF MICHIGAN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU READ IT. AFTER THE PBB DISASTER, THE STATE OF MICHIGAN DECIDED THEY DID NOT WANT VALSICOL IN THE STATE ANYMORE. VALSICOL WAS ABLE TO WORK OUT A DEAL WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO LEAVE. THEY HAD TO PAY A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY TO BUY CLAY SO THE PLANT SITE COULD BE COVERED UP. THE 52-ACRE CHEMICAL PLANT SITE, EVERYTHING ON IT WAS DEMOLISHED. THE BUILDINGS, THE TOWERS AND THE PIPES AND THE RAILROAD TRACKS. IT IS ALL BURIED RIGHT THERE. A CLAY CAP WAS PUT OVER AND A CLAY WALL WAS PUT AROUND. SUBSEQUENT YEARS WE TANNED THERE WERE GAPS IN THE WALL 10 FEET WIDE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH GOOD IT DID. THEN WE WERE LEFT WITH WARNING SIGNS ON THE FENCE AND A TOMBSTONE OUT THERE WHICH SAID "DO NO -- DO NOT GO ON THIS PROPERTY BECAUSE OF THE CHEMICAL AND RADIO ACTIVE CONTAMINATION. IT WAS -- AS YOU SAW IN THE FIRST PICTURE, IT IS RIGHT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS DOWNTOWN. IT IS LIKE ONE BLOCK FROM DOWNTOWN. WE LIVED WITH THAT TOMBSTONE A LONGTIME. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT OUR GROUP AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST 22 YEARS, MY BOOK IS CALLED "TOMBSTONE TOWN" AND IT COVERS THE FIRST 16 YEARS OF OUR GROUP, AND IT TELLS THE STORIES, BUT IT GIVES OTHER GROUPS GETTING STARTED SOME IDEAS FROM WHAT WE WENT THROUGH OF HOW YOU CAN HANDLE DEALING WITH THE AGENCIES AND DEALING WITH A RESPONSIBLE PARTY. IT IS AVAILABLE ON AMAZON AND IT IS CALLED "TOMBSTONE TOWN." WE STARTED THE TASK FORCE IN 1998. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME AROUND. REMEMBER, THE FIRST TIME THE CHEMICAL COMPANY WAS THE -- THE CHEMICAL SITE WAS ALL JUST BURIED. AND THEN IT LEAKED INTO THE RIVER. FINALLY GOT EPA TO COME BACK AND DO TESTING OF THE SEDIMENTS. WATER SEDIMENTS ARE -- IF I REMEMBER RIGHT, AND SOMEBODY CAN CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG, BUT I REMEMBER THERE ARE 250 PARTS PER MILLION IN THE SEDIMENT. THEY WOULD CLEAN UP A BODY OF WATER OF DDT. AND OUT HERE IN THE RIVER AROUND THE PLANT SITE THERE WERE HOTSPOTS OF 32,000, 46,000 PARTS PER MILLION DDT. AND WHEN THEY STARTED DIGGING IT OUT IT WAS LIKE PURE PRODUCT IN SOME PLACES. THIS IS AFTER THAT BEAUTIFUL LAWN THERE IS PART OF THE BURIED CHEMICAL PLANT. THE FIRST JOB THAT WE GOT EPA TO DO WAS TO CLEAN UP THE SEDIMENT IN THE RIVERBED. THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE RIVER. WHERE THERE WAS DRY LAND THEY PUT SHEET PILING IN TO SECTION IT OFF. AND THE -- THEY DE WATERED THE PART THAT WAS NOT TOO POLLUTED ON TOP. AND THEN AS THEY GOT DOWN THE WATER WOULD BE PIPED TO THE SUR -- SURFACE TENT. IT WAS A TREATMENT PLANT. THEY WOULD TREAT THE WATER BEFORE IT WAS RETURNED TO THE RIVER. THEY BUILT THE ROAD ACROSS. THE TRUCKS WOULD GO OVER THERE AND THEY WOULD DIG OUT THE SEDIMENTS AND TRUCK THEM BACK AND LET THEM DRIP DRY. THE WATER WOULD GO THROUGH THE TREATMENT PLANT AND THEN THE TRUCKS HAULED THE DRIED OUT SETTLEMENTS TO HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES AROUND MICHIGAN. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LATER. WE ALSO HAD A LOW-LEVEL RATED -- RADIO ACTIVE PLANT THAT THEY BURIED THEIR FILTER CAPE AND OTHER THINGS EAST OF ST. LOUIS AND WE HAD TO WORK A LONG, LONG TIME, BUT WE FINALLY GOT THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION TO AUTHORIZE A CLEAN UP OF THAT AND THEY ARE PUTTING THESE SUPER SACS AND THE COMPANIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE THEIR OWN TRAIN CARS AND THE WASTE WAS TRAINED OUT TO UTAH WHERE THEY OWNED THEIR OWN LAND DOWN IN ROCK AND THAT'S WHERE IT IS BURIED. SO GUESS WHAT. WE HAD CONTAMINATION IN OUR DRINKING WATER WELLS. AND THE MAIN CONTAMINANT IS PCBSA WHICH IS A BY PRODUCT OF THE DDT MANUFACTURING. IT WAS A LONG BATTLE. THE CITY OF ST. LOUIS HAD TO TAKE NOT ONLY VALSICOL TO COURT, BUT ON VALSICOL'S SIDE WERE THE EPA, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TRUST WAS SET UP FOR THESE. THE DOJ ITSELF AND IT WAS SETTLED AND ST. LOUIS GOT 26.5 MILLION DOLLARS TO START FINDING NEW WATER SOURCE AND IT TOOK AWHILE BECAUSE ANY WELLS THEY DRILLED ANYWHERE NEAR ST. LOUIS KEPT DRAWING THE CONTAMINATED GROUND WATER. SO THEY ARE 10 MILES AWAY NOW AND THEY HAD TO PUT IN NEW WELLS 10 MILES AWAY AND IT IS PIPED ALL THE WAY TO ST. LOUIS. THERE WAS ABOUT 5 THIEF MILLION DASH DRASH THERE WHAT IT WAS ABOUT 55 MILLION AND THEY ARE NOT DONE WITH THAT YET. AROUND THE AREA THEY WOULD FIND DEAD ROBINS AND OTHER BIRDS IN THE LATE SPRING AND EARLY SUMMER. WE TRIED TO GET DEQ AT THAT TIME OR EPA TO DO A STUDY, AND THEY WOULDN'T. THEY HAD THEIR SET AGENDA. THEY WERE JUST GOING TO DO THIS. THEY WERE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. AND SO WE ACTUALLY USED SOME OF OUR MONEY AND HIRED A TOXICOLOGIST TO COME IN AND DO A STUDY. THE BIRDS WERE COLLECTED AND FOUND TO HAVE DIED OF ACUTE DDT POISONING. THIS IS 40 SOME YEARS AFTER RACHEL CARSON'S BOOK. OKAY. THAT MEANT THAT THE WORMS IN THE GROUND, THE SOIL, WAS STILL HIGHLY CONTAMINATED. AND SO THE TOXICOLOGISTS DID A DEAD BIRD COLLECTION, A STUDY OF THE DEAD BIRDS, AND THESE BIRDS CAME BACK HEALTHY FROM THE SOUTH AND THEY MADE IT. THEY BUILT THEIR NEST. A LOT OF THEM LAID EGGS AND EVEN HAD SOME BABIES HATCH. AND THEN THE PARENTS DIED SO EVERYBODY DIED. WE HAD TWO STREETS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH 0 NESTING SUCCESS AND IT WAS TO CREATE THE YOUNG. WE ARE ABLE TO GET 12 BLOCKS OF RESIDENTIAL YARDS DUG UP AND REPLACED WITH CLEAN SOIL. PBB AND DDT IN THEIR YARDS AT DIFFERENT PLACES WERE HIGHER THAN DIRECT CONTACT LEVEL. THEY WERE FENCED OFF WITH ORANGE SNOW FENCING SO THAT THE CHILDREN WOULDN'T GET IN THERE. THIS IS WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. THIS WAS A YEAR AGO AND EVERYTHING WAS BURIED, RIGHT, AT THE CHEMICAL PLANT, INCLUDING THE CHEMICALS. ALL OF THE WASTE PRODUCTS ARE DOWN THERE. THEY IDENTIFIED WITH TESTING AND SEVERAL HOTSPOTS ON THE PLANT SITE AND INSIN RATION IS OFTEN BEST FOR THEM TO JUST GET RID OF THEM. AND THEY DIDN'T -- THESE WERE SO VOLATILE AND SO DANGEROUS INCLUDING DDCP IF ANYBODY IS A CHEMIST AND KNOWS HOW DANGEROUS THAT ONE IS. AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF NAPLES WERE DOWN THERE. SO THEY WERE USED IN INSIN RATION. AND WHAT THEY DID IS PUT HEATING ELEMENTS DOWN IN THE GROUND 30 FEET DOWN TO THE TILL LAYER AND HEATED THE GROUND UP TO BOIL THEM AND THEN AS THE GASES COME UP AND THE LIQUIDS COME UP THEY ARE CAPTURED AND -- CAPTURED IN EX -- EX -- EXTRACTION WELLS. THE STAFF SHOWS WHERE THE STEAM WENT OUT. ALL OF THE BLUE TANKS ARE THE MASSIVE CARBON FILTER THAT'S ARE FILTERING THE WATER. THE WATER IS RETURNED TO THE RIVER WHEN IT IS DONE. THIS IS LOOKING DOWN ONE OF THE HEATING WELLS. I KIND OF LIKE THIS PICTURE. I WOULD GO AROUND AND TALK TO THE ROTARY CLUBS AND THE LION'S CLUBS AND ALL OF THAT. AND BEFORE POWER POINTS I WOULD HAVE THESE BOARDS AND I WOULD SAY HERE IS WHERE WE ARE WITH THE BRECKENRIDGE SITE AND SO ON. NOTICE THE HEALTH STUDY HAS RED INK AROUND IT AND A STAR. THAT'S BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET ANYBODY TO DO A HEALTH STUDY. WE TRIED. WE WERE TURNED DOWN TWICE. FIRST THEY SAID YOU NEVER HAD A HEALTH STUDY IN YOUR TOWN SO WE CAN'T COME AND DO A HEALTH STUDY. [LAUGHTER]. CDC AND ATSDR AND WE WOULD MAKE A LITTLE PROGRESS AND THEN IT WOULD FALL AND NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS ST. LOUIS IS 4500 PEOPLE. GRASHIT COUNTY IS 45,000 PEOPLE. A LOT OF THESE STUDIES NEED 100,000 PEOPLE. THEN THEY FOUND US AND WE FOUND THEM. THE EMERY RESEARCHERS WERE RESEARCHING PBB AND EVER SINCE 2013 WE HAVE TEAMED UP TOGETHER, AND IT IS VERY EXCITING TO BE ABLE TO REPORT TO THE COMMUNITY, YES, THE HEALTH STUDY WAS DONE. YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH THYROID CANCER IN THIS COMMUNITY. PEOPLE STILL WANT TO KNOW AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. THEY REALLY WANT TO KNOW. ARE HEALTH PROBLEMS DUE TO HAVING LIVED HERE AND RAISE OUR CHILDREN HERE? WE ARE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. THERE IS ONE QUESTION THEY ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW THAT WE HOPE IS GOOD NEWS INSTEAD OF BAD NEWS, AND THAT IS A POSSIBLE WAY TO HELP YOUR BODY ELIMINATE THE PBB AND THE DDT FROM YOUR SYSTEM. I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MICHELLE SO SHE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE].  SO THANK YOU, JANE. HOW DID I GET INVOLVED IN THIS QUESTION OF PBB'S? AND IT WAS IN THE EARLY 1990s, AND I GOT INVOLVED BECAUSE IT WAS A CONCERN OF CHEMICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT MIGHT BE IMPACTING OUR ENDOCRINE SYSTEM. I WAS AT EMERY UNIVERSITY WHICH MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE CDC. AND SO I BECAME INVOLVED AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AT THE CDC, AND AT THE TIME THIS BOOK HAD JUST COME OUT "OUR STOLEN FUTURE" BY THEO KOLL -- COLBURN WHO WAS A BIOLOGIST WITH THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION. SHE WAS NOTICING THAT THERE WERE ALL OF THESE REPORTS COMING IN OF IMMUNE FUNCTION PROBLEMS IN WILDLIFE POP -- POPULATIONS WITH FEMINIZATION OF MALE FISH AND REPTILES. THERE WERE BIG HEADLINES WHEN SOMEONE FOUND REDUCED PENIS SIZE IN ALLIGATORS, AND THAT GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION. AND THERE WAS REDUCED FERTILITY. THIS IS A FOLLOW ON TO RACHEL CARSON WHO REALLY WARNED US AGAINST DDT. 3* WHAT THESE AUTHORS WERE TELLING US ABOUT IS ALL OF THE SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS WE HAVE MADE SINCE THEN AND THIS SHOWS THE DRAMATIC RISE OF ALL OF THESE NOVEL, SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS THAT HAVE ENTERED COMMERCE IN THE LAST 50 YEARS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE CHEMICALS WERE SYNTHESIZED BECAUSE THEY HAD VERY IMPORTANT INDUSTRIAL USES. THEY WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE IN OUR BODIES. THEY GET THERE. WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE CONS -- WITH THE CONSEQUENCES. AT THE TIME, AS I SAID, THESE -- ALL OF THESE AFFECTS IN WILDLIFE WERE BEING NOTICED. AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE WERE TRENDS IN HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS THAT RELATED TO THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE, GIRLS WERE MATURING EARLIER, AND THIS TREND HAS CONTINUED. THERE WERE DECLINING SPERM COUNTS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE THAT WAS DOCUMENTED. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN URINARY AND GENITAL DEFECTS IN NEWBORN BOYS AND INCREASES IN BREAST AND TEST PARTICULAR -- TESTICULAR CANCER. DICK JACKSON WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AT THE TIME PUT TOGETHER A PANEL OF SCIENTISTS BOTH ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS AND CDC SIGN CYSTS -- SCIENTISTS AND ASKED US TO EVALUATE THE LITERATURE AND TELL THE CDC WHETHER THIS WAS AN IMMINENT THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH. WE CAREFULLY EXAMINED WHAT WAS KNOWN AND THESE ARE THE TWO REALLY BIG CHUNKS OF EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE. THERE WERE ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY STUDIES, BUT THEY WEREN'T REALLY LOOKING AT THE CRITICAL PERIOD OF EXPOSURE WHERE THEY MIGHT BE MORE VULNERABLE TO THESE CHEMICALS. SO WHAT WE SUGGESTED IS THAT WE NEEDED A HUMAN STUDY WHERE WE CAN DOCUMENT INDIVIDUAL EXPOSURE LEVEL. LOTS OF THINGS ARE HAPPENING OVER OVER TIME. IT IS NOT JUST AN INCREASE IN SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS. RATS AREN'T PEOPLE. WE WANT TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN PEOPLE. I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS PVB HORROR BECAUSE I WAS AT MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE BEFORE I WAS AT EMERY AND WORKED WITH THE GREAT IRVING SELICOFF WHICH FOUND CAUSES OF MESOTHELIOMA AND THE BINNINGS -- BEGINNINGS OF PBB. I SAID THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE EXPOSED TO PBB WHICH BASED ON THE ANIMAL STUDIES CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE IMPACTING THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM. IT SEEMS ACTING LIKE A WEAK ESTROGEN. WHAT WE WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE DEVELOPING CHILD IN THE WOMB. WE NOW ARE AWARE BECAUSE E-- OH MY GOODNESS. THREE MINUTES? OKAY. WE ARE AWARE THAT A MEDICATION THAT IS HARMLESS TO AN ADULT CAN BE DEVASTATING TO A DEVELOPING CHILD. AND THESE CHEMICALS THAT INTERFERE WITH THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM ARE LIKE UNREGULATED MEDICINES. WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE COMMUNITY AND HERE IS SOME QUOTES FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE IMPACTED. I DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING I WAS EXPOSED TO COULD BE PASSED TO MY KID. I DID POISON MY KID? WE DID LOOK AT EARLY PUBERTY. SURE ENOUGH WE FOUND THAT THE GIRLS EX -- EXPOSED IN THE WOMB AND THROUGH BREASTFEEDING BECAUSE THIS CHEMICAL IS STORED IN FAT AND BREAST MILL N HAS A HIGH FAT -- MILK HAS A HIGH FAT CONTENT. GIRLS EXPOSED IN THE WOMB AND THROUGH BREASTFEEDING HAVE AN EARLIER MENSTRUAL PERIOD. ON AVERAGE IT WAS A YEAR. IF I TALK TO THE SCIENTISTS IN THE ROOM, WHEN YOU SAMPLE A POPULATION, YOU MISS THE TAILS. YOU MISS THE TALES. YOU MISS THE PEOPLE. THIS FAMILY WAS NOT IN OUR STUDY. I PRESENTED THIS TO THE COMMUNITY AND A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND TOLD ME HER DAUGHTER HAD HER FIRST PERIOD AT 5. THESE GIRLS ARE NOW ADULTS. WE ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW MULTIPLE GENERATIONS. THEY HAVE A DOSE-RELATED INCREASE IN THE RISK OF MISCARRIAGE. THAT EXPOSURE DOSE IS THEIR MOTHER'S BLOOD LEVEL AT THE TIME SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH THEM. ONE OF OUR PARTNERS HAS SAID TO THIS DAY I GRIEVE FOR MY LOST CHILDREN. SHE HAD OVER 10 MISCARRIAGES. WE FOUND THYROID DISORDERS. AND NOW YOU WILL HEAR THESE ECHOES OF WHAT LINDA TALKED ABOUT WITH PFOS. ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS HAD SUFFERED WITH ABNORMAL THYROID FUNCTION FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE IT WAS DIAGNOSED. IT TURNS OUT HE HAD A HIGH PBB LEVEL. IF HE HAD KNOWN THAT HE WAS AN INCREASED RISK OF THYROID PROBLEMS, IF HIS DOCTOR HAD KNOWN, THEN HE COULD HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED MUCH SOONER AND COULD HAVE BEEN TREATED. I SHOULD ALSO SAY THAT THIS PARTICULAR PERSON WAS NOT A CHEMICAL WORKER. HE DIDN'T HAVE HIGH EXPOSURE BECAUSE HE WORKED OR LIVED NEAR THE CHEMICAL PLANT. HE HAD A FAMILY, AN UNCLE I THINK, WHO LIVED RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CHEMICAL PLANT. AS A CHILD THE KIDS WOULD GO AND PLAY ON THE PROPERTY IN PILES OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT WERE SAND. THEY WOULD THROW IT AROUND AND CLIMB UP AND CLIMB DOWN. IT WAS LACED WITH PBB. HE HAD VERY HIGH LEVELS OF PBB. WE ALSO FOUND THE BOYS EXPOSED IN THE WOMB -- SO WE SAID THE GIRLS MATURED EARLIER. THE BOYS ACTUALLY HAD MORE PROBLEMS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE URINARY AND GENITAL TRACT AND SLOWER GROWTH AND PUBITAL DEVELOPMENT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENDO SYSTEM IN -- ENDOCRINE SYSTEM AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE BALANCE OF ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE. BOTH SEXES MAKE BOTH HORMONES, BUT GIRLS MAKE MUCH MORE ESTROGEN AND BOYS MAKE MUCH MORE TESTOSTERONE. AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE A CHEMICAL THAT ACTS LIKE ESTROGEN, IT ACCELERATES THE GIRLS'S DEVELOPMENT AND IT SLOWS DOWN THE BOYS AND DURING THIS CRITICAL PERIOD WHERE THE MALE GENITAL TRACT IS DEVELOPING THE ESTROGEN CAN INTERRUPT THAT. WE ALSO FOUND -- WE AND OTHER INVESTIGATORS WHO LOOKED A -- AT FOUND INCREASED RISK OF LYMPHOMA AND DE JESS STIFF -- DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS AND CANCERS. IN ORDER TO LOOK AT CANCERS YOU NEED A VERY LARGE POPULATION. IN FACT WE RECENTLY GOT FUNDED TO LOOK AT CANCER AGAIN AND WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE LARGEST POPULATION POSSIBLE WHICH IS EVERYBODY THAT WAS ORIGINALLY ENROLLED IN THE REGISTRY. THE REASON WE ARE ABLE TO DO ALL OF THIS RESEARCH IS BECAUSE THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAD THE FORE SIGHT IN THE LATE 1970s TO ENROLL 5,000 PEOPLE IN A LONG-TERM REGISTRY. TO MONEY -- MONITOR HEALTH EFFECTS. NOBODY KNEW WHAT THE HEALTH EFFECTS WOULD BE. THAT'S HOW WE HAVE LEARNED EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU ABOUT SO FAR. NOW WE NEED TO DO THIS AGAIN TO UPDATE THE DATA AND PARTICULARLY NOW THAT THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS REACHING THE AGE WHERE THEY ARE DEVELOPING CANCERS. WE CAN GET A MUCH MORE AGO ESTIMATE. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO APPROVE OUR APPLICATION TO STUDY THE ENTIRE COHORT ONCE AGAIN FOR CANCERS AND FORMALITY -- AND MORTALITY. WE ALSO TRIED TO UNDERSTAND ON A MOLECULAR LEVEL, ON A BIOLOGICAL LEVEL HOW THIS CHEMICAL COULD BE CAUSING THE HEALTH EFFECTS WE ARE SEEING. I WILL MENTION EPI GENETICS. EPI GENETICS IS HOW GENES ARE REGULATED. YOU HAVE THE SAME STRAND OF DN IN EVERY -- DNA IN EVERY CELL OF YOUR BODY. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN SEND A BLOOD SAMPLE TO ANCESTRY.COM AND IT IS YOUR ENTIRE DNA SEQUENCE HOW DO THE CELLS KNOW TO DO THEIR SPECIFIC JOB? THE BLOOD CELLS MAKE DIFFERENT PROTEINS THAN THE HEART CELLS AND MUSCLE CELLS AND THE BONE CELLS. IT IS THROUGH THIS REGULATION OF WHICH GENES ARE TURNED ON AND TURNED OFF IN DIFFERENT CELLS. IT INCREASES THE ACTIVITY OF GENES. WE LOOKED AT WHAT DOES PBB DO TO THIS GENE REGULATION? WE FOUND IT STIMULATES THE SAME ESTROGEN DOES. IT IMPACTS IMMUNE FUNCTION AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WITH HIGH PBB EXPOSURE ACTUALLY HAVE ACCELERATED AGING AND THEIR CELLS ARE ACTING LON -- OLDER THAN THEIR CHRONOLOGICAL AGE. AND WE HAVE SEEN A CHANGE IN SPERM WHICH CHANGES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A FATHER'S EXPOSURE COULD IMPACT HIS CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. AND SO WE ARE DOING A STUDY RIGHT NOW OF THREE GENERATIONS WITH THE FATHER WHO IS EXPOSED AND NOT THE THE MOTHER. AMY IS GIVING ME THE EYE HERE. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT PFOS WAS NOT THE FIRST FOREVER CHEMICAL. DDT, DIOXINS, PCB'S, PBB'S, THEY ARE RESISTANT TO DEGRADATION AND THEY HAVE A LONG HALF LIFE IN HUMANS. WHEN I WAS A KID WE WOULD TALK ABOUT THROWING THINGS AWAY. THERE IS NO AWAY. THESE CHEMICALS ARE JUST MOVED FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER. IF WE KEEP MAKING THEM, THEY ARE JUST GOING TO PILE UP. WE FOUND THAT 40 YEARS LATER 60% OF THE PEOPLE WE TESTED STILL HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS. I WON'T EXPLAIN THE CHART, BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS. WE ARE DEVELOPING A CONTINUING MENTAL EDUCATION COURSE TO INFORM HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. WE ARE DOING AS JANE MENTIONED A CLINICAL TRIAL AND TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE SPEED THE ELIMINATION. AND WE ARE DOING THIS MULTI-GENERATIONAL STUDY. WE KNOW THE CHILDREN OF WOMEN EXPOSED ARE DIRECTLY EXPOSED IN THE WOMB AND FROM BREASTFEEDING, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN OF FATHERS EXPOSED? COULD THESE EPI GENETIC CHANGES BE PASSED TO THEIR CHILDREN? WHAT DID WE LEARN IN 40 YEARS OF RESEARCH ON THIS POPULATION? IT IS A FOREVER CHEMICAL TRANSFERRED FROM MOTHER TO CHILD. IT AFFECTS THYROID SYSTEM AND CANCERS AND THREE GENERATIONS HAVE IMPACTED AND IT CHANGING -- CHANGES THE WAY WE REGULATE OUR GENES. AND ONE MORE WORD ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP WHICH HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING FOR US. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS WORK THT FIRST PLACE? IT IS TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH. WHY AREN'T WE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITIES IMPACTED TO GIVE THEM THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PROTECT THEIR HEALTH? FOR EXAMPLE WE NEED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY COULD BE AT AN INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER SO THEY DON'T SAY OH I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY. MAYBE I WILL SKIP MY MAMMOGRAM THIS YEAR. DON'T DO IT. IF YOU LIVED IN MICHIGAN DURING THE TIME OF THIS DISASTER, BETWEEN 73 AND 75, YOU PROBABLY CONSUMED CONTAMINATED FOOD. ONE MORE THING WHICH IS THAT EVERY COMMUNITY THAT HAS DEALT WITH A TOXIC EVENT, A TOXIC CONTAMINATION HAS HAD TO FIGHT ALONE. WE ARE ALL HERE IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE WE NEED TO FIGHT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE]. AMY IS GOING TO TELL YOU THE REST OF THE DAY IS HOW DO WE DO THIS? HOW DO WE STRENGTHEN THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND HELP EACH OTHER? [APPLAUSE]  I WANT TO SAY WE ASKED THE IMPOSSIBLE OF OUR SPEAKERS TO TALK ABOUT A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. WE WILL OPEN THE FLOOR FOR THAT INCLUDING FOR FOLKS ON THE WEBINAR. AND JUST AS A REMINDER TO ASK OUR SPEAKERS TO REPEAT THE QUESTION INTO THE MIC.  [INAUDIBLE QUESTION]. YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT RESONATED. THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN MICHIGAN HAD THE FORESIGHT TO REGISTER PEOPLE. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT THE P -- PFAS, WE HAVE TO FIGHT TO GET -- [INAUDIBLE]. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS CHANGED? [INAUDIBLE] WHY ARE WE SEEING SUCH A SHIFT NOW VERSUS WHAT HAPPENED THEN?  I WILL REPEAT THE QUESTION. THE REASON WE HAVE LEARNED AND BEEN ABLE TO STUDY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE EXPOSED TO PBB IS BECAUSE THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAD THE FORE SIGHT TO ESTABLISH A REGISTRY. IT WAS SO THAT PEOPLE THAT WE COULD DO SURVEILLANCE ON THE LONG-TERM HEALTH EFFECTS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS CHANGED. I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE HASN'T BEEN AN ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PFOS EXPOSURE REGISTRY. THERE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHMENT OF A LEAD EXPOSURE REGISTRY IN FLINT. HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND NOT JUST THE IMPACT OF LEAD ON THE COMMUNITY, BUT WHETHER THE INTERVENTIONS TO TRY AND REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE LEAD ARE WORKING SO THAT WE CAN MITIGATE -- AGAIN THAT'S THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING. WE WANT TO PREVENT EXPOSURE AND IF THEY OCCUR WE WANT TO HELP MITIGATE THE TOXIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE EXPOSURE. IT IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. WHEN PEOPLE SAY WE DON'T KNOW THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF PFOS, BESIDES THE FACT THAT LINDA POINTED OUT THAT WE NOAH LOT ABOUT THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF PFOS, BUT WE WON'T KNOW UNLESS A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE HAVE THEIR LEVELS MEASURED AND FOLLOWED. THAT'S ON THE ONLY WAY WE WILL KNOW.  [INAUDIBLE QUESTION]. CANCER RESEARCH CAN OPEN UP THE REGISTRY TO THE ORIGINAL 5,000. DOES THAT MEAN YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE RECORDS OR ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR ACCESS TO THE RECORDS?  OKAY, THANK YOU. JAIME ANNE CROWLEY IS ONE OF OUR ADVISERS AND WE WORKED TOGETHER FOR 10 YEARS NOW. SHE ASKED, YOU KNOW, WILL WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE PBB REGISTRY? THE ANSWER IS WE DON'T YET KNOW. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR OVER A YEAR TO GET APPROVAL FROM THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO UPDATE THE CANCER DATA. AND THEY HAVE APPROVED THIS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST. AND WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE CANCER STUDIES DONE PREVIOUSLY, THERE WERE ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF CANCERS. I THINK IT WAS 10 LYMPHOMAS AND 12 GASTROINTESTINAL CANCERS. OUR LATEST BREAST CANCER STUDY HAD 51 CASES OF BREAST CANCER, BUT THAT WAS BASED ON DATA. CANCER WAS DIAGNOSED 20 YEARS AGO SO NOW IT GOT FUNDING AND WE NEED THE LARGEST POPULATION IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE MOST VALUABLE AND MOST PRECISE. AND WE ARE WAITING. WHAT IS WAITING FOR THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT? I DON'T KNOW. THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN US THE GO AHEAD TO DO THIS WORK THAT HAS BEEN FUNDED BY NIAHS AND BY EMORY UNIVERSITY IN ORDER TO UPDATE THE CANCER SURVEILLANCE ON THIS COHORT.  THANK YOU, MICHELLE AND JANE FOR A FABULOUS PRESENTATION. REALLY I THINK IT SETS THE STAGE AGAIN FOR THE WORK WE HAVE TO DO YET. PLEASE JOIN ME IN THANKING THEN. [APPLAUSE]. WE ARE RUNNING A FEW MINUTES BEHIND SCHEDULE, BUT WE HAVE A BREAK SCHEDULED FOR NOW. IF FOLKS ARE WILLING TO COME BACK -- IT IS 10:30 NOW. IF WE COULD RECONVENE HERE AT 10:40 AND THEN WE WILL GO ON WITH OUR MORNING'S PROGRAM. THANKS, EVERYBODY.  OKAY, FOLKS. IF FOLKS COULD START TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK IN AND FIND THEIR SEATS. I THINK WE WILL PICK UP AGAIN WITH THE REST OF THE MORNING'S PROGRAM. OKAY FOLKS, WE ARE GONNA GET STARTED AGAIN. I KNOW I DID THAT ALREADY, BUT IF FOLKS COULD MAKE YOUR WAY IN AND FIND YOUR SEATS AND I AM GOING TO QUICKLY INTRODUCE OUR NEXT PANEL. DO YOU WANT TO COME ON UP? I AM GOING TO QUICKLY INTRODUCE THE THE MODERATOR FOR THE NEXT STAGE OF THE MORNING'S EVENTS. BRITNEY IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY. SHE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ORAL HISTORIAN. AND AMONG OTHER THINGS SHE HAS BEEN DOING ORAL HISTORIES WITH RESIDENTS OF MICHIGAN WHO EXPERIENCE THE PBB CRISIS AND ITS AFTERMATH. SHE WILL BE THE MODERATOR FOR THE NEXT SESSION HERE.  OH, GOOD. IT IS ON THE. IT IS ON. I AM HONORED TO BE HERE IN THE COMMUNITY OF RESEARCHERS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO ADDRESSING LARGE SCALE CHEMICAL CONTAMINATIONS. NOT ONLY IN OUR STATE, BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK AND ADVOCACY AND EFFORTS. IT IS PHENOMENAL AND IT IS SO NECESSARY. I AM DELIGHTED TO INTRODUCE TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PLAYED A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN ADDRESSING CONTAMINATION IN THE 40 YEARS. FRIN SIS -- FRANCIS REPRESENTED FROM 1975 TO 1990 AND HE IS ACTUALLY THE RID, THE REPRESENTATIVE WHO HAS BEEN THE LONGEST SERVING REPRESENTATIVE IN THAT AREA IN MICHIGAN HISTORY. THAT'S A WONDERFUL THING TO HAVE AN ADD -- HAVE AN ADVOCATE SERVING THAT LONG. HE SPONSORED THE LEGISLATION THAT LOWERED THE PBB LEVELS INSTITUTED A PUBLIC HEALTH STUDY REGARDING THE HUMAN HEALTH IMPACT OF PBB AND PROVIDED LOW TO NO INTEREST LOANS TO PBB DISTRESSED FARMERS. I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO A NUMBER OF FARMERS WHO HAVE ACTUALLY MENTIONED HOW CRITICAL ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN TO THEM. AMONG MANY AWARDS, THE NEWSPAPERS NAMED HIM ONE OF MICHIGAN'S 10 BEST LEGISLATORS IN 1978. HE IS THE LEGISLATOR OF THE YEAR BY THE MICHIGAN ASSOCIATION OF REGENTS AND THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AWARD BY THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING REGION 1B IN 1989. HE IS A NATIVE OF CORONA, MICHIGAN AND A GRADUATE OF CORONA HIGH SCHOOL AND MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY WHERE HE EARNED A BA IN POLITICAL SCIENCE. HE DID HIS GRADUATE WORK AT MSU AND WAS A FELLOW AT THE ROBERT TAFT INSTITUTE OF GOVERNMENT AT MSU. IN ADDITION TO THE ACCOLADES HE IS A FORMER COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY. HE TAUGHT HISTORY, YAY, AND GOVERNMENT. HE WAS APPOINTED TO SERVE TWO YEARS ON THE LIBRARY OF MICHIGAN BOARD OF TRUSTIES AND MICHIGAN JUDGES RETIREMENT BOARD. HE SERVED ON THE STAFF OF THE U.S. SENATOR AND WAS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD AND PRESIDENT OF THE FRIENDS OF MICHIGAN HISTORY AND THE COMMANDER OF REGION 9 OF THE MILITARY. HE IS A DISTINGUISHED INDIVIDUAL. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. HE IS JOINED BY HIS SON, TONY, WHO IS AN ATTORNEY AND PARTNER IN THE FIRM THAT HE FOUNDED WITH BOB IN 1987. THE PRACTICE IS FOCUSED ON THE REPRESENTATION OF CORPORATE AND OTHER BUSINESS ENTITIES AND A NUMBER OF CONTEXT. TONY HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN ACTIVE THIS POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT. YOU WILL HEAR HOW HE HELPED HIS FATHER RUN CAMPAIGNS FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND WORKED FOR VARIOUS OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION FOR THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. HE ALSO IS A FORMER NEWS REPORTER AND RADIO ANNOUNCER WHICH I WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR. IN THE WAKE OF MICHIGAN'S PBB PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS TONY LEGISLATED A FANNER IS CANCER REGISTRY TO PROMOTE AND FACILITATE RESEARCH IN THE STATE. IN 2004 HE SERVED AS A LEGAL GROUP ADVISER TO THE GOVERNOR'S COMMISSION ON MENTAL HEALTH AND MOST RECENTLY THOSE WHO ARE HERE FOR THE DOCUMENT RELAST NIGHT -- DOCUMENTARY LAST NIGHT YOU KNOW HE IS INVOLVED IN ADVOCATING FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO ARE DEALING WITH PFOS CONTAMINATION. THANK YOU, TONY, FOR BEING HERE AS WELL. CAN I START WITH YOU? I WONDERED IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS PBB CONTAMINATION IN THE 1970s. IN PARTICULAR YOU ARE CREDITED WITH ENCOURAGING THE STATE TO LOWER THE PBB LEVELS AS WELL AS INITIATE A LONG-TERM HEALTH STUDY AND PROVIDE CRITICAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS. HOW DID YOU DECIDE TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES AND HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT IT?  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HOPE YOU CAN ALL HEAR ME OUT THERE. TO BE BRUTAL LEA -- BRUTALLY HONEST WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN NOVEMBER OF 1974 AND TOOK OFFICE THE FIRST OF JANUARY OF 1975 I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT PBB WAS. I COME FROM AN AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT. DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT IT IN THE CAMPAIGNS I HONESTLY TRIED HARD TO BE UP-TO-DATE ON THE ISSUES. I WAS UNAWARE OF IT. I WAS APPOINTED TO THE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHICH WAS CHAIRED BY A COUPLE OF OTHER DEMOCRATS, IF YOU WILL SO YOU KNOW WHAT MY POLITICS WERE. AND THESE TWO GUYS WERE FARMERS. ONE WAS A MAN BY THE NAME OF DON AND THE OTHER BY THE NAME OF PAUL PORTER. THEY WERE CO-CHAIRS OF THE COMMITTEE. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES ON THE COMMITTEE I BECAME KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE PROBLEM. HE TOOK THE LEAD IN OPENING UP THE PBB ISSUE. HAD A NUMBER OF PUBLIC HEARINGS ACROSS THE STATE AND WE HAD A LOT OF DIFFICULTY GETTING THOSE OFF THE GROUND FOR THE POLITICAL REASONS WE DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR HERE. IN ANY EVENT I ATTENDED THOSE MEETINGS AND LISTENED TO THE, QUOTE, EXPERTS, AND I LISTENED TO THOSE WHO WERE CONSIDERED NON-EXPERTS. AND THE ONES AFFECTED WERE TOLD THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AS I WENT ACROSS THE STATE AND LISTENED TO BOTH SIDES IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT THEY WERE TELLING THE TRUTH AND FRANKLY IT WASN'T THE EXPERTS. IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE BAD PEOPLE, BUT THEY WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR JOBS. THEY WERE INFLUENCED BY MONEY OR WHATEVER. ANYWAY, I WENT HEARINGS AND MY SON ATTENDED MANY OF THEM WITH ME. MY WIFE AS WELL. WHAT REALLY OPENED THE DOOR -- WHAT OPENED MY EYES, I SHOULD SAY, IS LISTENING TO THE ORDINARY FOLKS, IF THAT'S A PROPER TERM, TELLING ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS. IT WAS SUCH A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND NOBODY WAS LISTENING TO THEM. ON SUNDAYS WHEN THEY KNEW I WAS AT HOME, PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT CONSTITUENTS OF MINE WOULD COME TO MY DOOR AND COME COULD IN WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND TELL STORIES THAT WERE SO, SO SAD THAT I HONEST TO GOD CRIED MANY TIMES. I GOT VERY INTERESTED IN THE ISSUE. REPRESENTATIVE ALBOSTO WAS OBVIOUSLY LEADING THE PACK AT THIS PARTICULAR STAGE AND HE DECIDED TO RUN FOR U.S. CONGRESS. THERE WAS A SPLIT IN OUR PARTY AND THEN HE DECIDED TO TAKE UP THE FIGHT AND THAT'S HOW HE GOT INVOLVED. AS YOU ALL KNOW, AND YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEMS BEFORE, BUT I SAW THEM FACE-TO-FACE, AND I WANT TO TELL YOU IT HAD A PRO IMPACT ON ME. LISTEN TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSEDLY NOT THE EXPERTS. I'M TELLING YOU. IT HAD AN IMPACT ON ME, A BIG ONE, AND THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED.  I THINK THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU HELP TO AMPLIFY THOSE COMMUNITY VOICES. YOU REALLY HEARD AND RESPONDED TO THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HEARD. TONY, WERE YOU A YOUNG ADULT WHEN YOUR FATHER SPEAR HEADED THE ADDRESSING OF THE PBB CONTAMINATION. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT AFFECTED YOU AND IN PARTICULAR HOW IT MAY HAVE INFORMED YOUR DECISION TO WORK WITH CANCER REGISTRY NOW AND WITH PFOS.  THANK YOU. WHAT I SAW WHEN I WAS 18 YEARS OLD AND TRAILING AROUND WITH MY DAD IN THE STATE HE SAYS -- THE STORIES WERE JUST HORRIBLE. IT WAS REAL LIFE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUFFERING TERRIBLY. AND NOT ONLY IN MANY CASES THE FARMERS WHO WERE LOSING THEIR LIVELIHOOD, BUT THEY WERE ILL, AND THEY WERE SICK AND ON TOP OF IT ALL THEY WERE TELLING THEM THEY WERE CRAZY. HYPOCHONDRIACS AND PSYCHO SCHEMATIC. THE MOST DISGUSTING THINGS I COULD HEAR. ONE TIME I WENT WITH MY DAD TO CADILLAC FOR A HEARING. THE FARMERS ONE BY ONE STOOD UP AND STARTED TELLING -- I I MEAN IT WAS JUST AWFUL THINGS HAPPENING TO THEM. THE STATE FOLKS WOULD SAY OH WE DON'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING. I WAS NO EXPERT IN ANY REGARD, BUT IT MADE NO SENSE WHY PEOPLE WOULD GO UP AND HUMILIATE THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF A LARGE CROWD OF PEOPLE AND BE -- FOR GLORY? THEY WERE CALLED GLORY SEEKERS. IT WAS AMAZING. I REMEMBER THE STORIES. I REMEMBER ONE MAN IN OUTSIDE THE HEARING. ACTUALLY IT WAS IN THE RESTROOM. HE PULLED UP HIS SHIRT SLEEVES AND SHOWED ME THESE LUMPS AROUND HIS ELBOWS AND PULLED UP HIS PANT LEGS AND SHOWED ME LUMPS AROUND THE KNEES. HE SAID THOSE AREN'T IN MY HEAD. THAT STUCK WITH ME MY ENTIRE LIFE. IT WAS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR A YOUNG MAN TO BE ABLE TO SEE THIS. WE WENT TO ALL SORTS OF HEARINGS ALL OVER THE PLACE. 40 YEARS LATER TO FIND OUT THAT MY FAMILY HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY PFOS AND WE CAN'T DRINK OUR WATER? ALL OF THAT INFORMED EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE EVER SINCE. THAT PERSPECTIVE I THINK GUIDES EVERYTHING THAT I DO.  SO WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES LEFT. I WANTED TO ASK YOU BOTH WHAT YOU THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS YOU'VE LEARNED FROM BOTH THE PBB EPISODE AND PFOS MIGHT BE.  ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED THAT I AM NOT TOO HAPPY WITH IS WE DON'T LEARN MUCH. YOGI BERRA SAID IT BEST, IT IS LIKE DAY VAW -- DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN. FOR GOD SAKE, WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO AT LEAST DEAL WITH THIS SECOND ROUND OF, AS I CALL IT -- IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT FASHION THAN WE HAVE. AND IT SEEMS THAT WE WOULD HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE THAT -- THE EXPERTS ATTACKING THE OTHER EXPERTS THAT ARE TELLING THE TRUTH. AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT WE WOULD LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT POLITICAL ACTION. AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING I SEE THAT IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED TODAY IS HOW TO TAKE WHAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT YOU KNOW FROM THE EXPERTS AND HOW TO TAKE THAT AND TURN IT INTO A POLITICAL WEAPON IF THAT'S THE PROPER TERM, TO GET THE PEOPLE IN PUBLIC OFFICE WHO COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE TO DO SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T LEARNED HOW TO DO THAT. WE HAVEN'T LEARNED HOW TO DO THAT. WHERE ARE WE? AS ONE OLD MAN THAT USED TO COME INTO MY DAD'S STORE WOULD SAY, WHAT DO YOU HEAR FROM YOUR HEAD? AND FOR CRYING OUT LOUD IS PURE WATER AND PURE FOOD A POLITICAL ISSUE? IT IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. WE NEED TO TAKE PEOPLE -- TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE YOU BE EQUIPPED NOT ONLY TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE ITSELF, BUT TO DEAL WITH THE POLITICS OF THE ISSUE EFFECTIVELY. [APPLAUSE].  ALSO FOLLOWING ON THAT, I WILL MARK THAT MY'S -- MY FAMILY IS FROM A TINY PLACE IN ST. LOUIS. WE ARE WITH YOU. SAME SIZE. NO MEDIA, NO COVERAGE FOR SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE YEARS. WHEN I LEARNED THAT WE WERE IMPACTED I I KNEW IMMEDIATELY FROM THE PBB EXPERIENCE -- WHAT HAPPENED WITH PBB WAS ALL POLITICAL. IT WAS POLITICAL PRESSURE THAT FORCED THINGS TO HAPPEN. IT TOOK TOO LONG AS MY FRIENDS IN ST. LOUIS WOULD KNOW ALL TOO WELL, BUT THAT'S WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. I HEAR PEOPLE IN THE PFOS WORLD SAYING DON'T GET POLITICAL ABOUT THIS. I SAY BALONEY. IT IS ALL POLITICAL. THE ONLY WAY WE WILL MAKE THINGS HAPPEN IS TO FORCE LEGISLATION THROUGH CONGRESS, TO FORCE THE REGULATORS TO TAKE ACTION AND AS MICHELLE MARCOS SAID EARLIER, WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER BECAUSE WE ARE IN IT TOGETHER. LITTLE TINE -- TINY TOWNS, SEPARATELY WE ARE NOT MUCH, BUT TOGETHER WE ARE A POWER HOUSE. AND THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED FROM PBB, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ALL NEED TO LEARN AS WE MOVE FORWARD, PARTICULARLY THIS AFTERNOON WHEN WE CAN ALL GET TOGETHER AND POW WOW AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO TACKLE THIS STUFF. [APPLAUSE].  THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PAST WORK AND YOUR ON GOING WORK. I THINK WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME FOR SOME QUESTIONS.  [INAUDIBLE QUESTION] MY QUESTION IS WE KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE IS WIDESPREAD. HOW DO WE GET OUR LEGISLATORS TO MOVE? WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD, AND THEY SEEM TO IGNORE US. THEY NO LONGER WORK FOR US. IT SEEMS LIKE WE WORK FOR THEM. IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT SITUATION. THIS BIPARTISAN SHIP IS BREAKING US DOWN. THIS IS LIFE OR DEATH. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE WITH OUR OWN LEGISLATURES THAT WE HAVE ELECTED TO PROTECT US. [APPLAUSE].  I AGREE, THERESA. THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO TO GET OUR LEGISLATORS TO ACT. IT HAS BEEN A LONGTIME, AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. I AM WITH YOU THERE 10,000 PERCENT. IN OSCOTO WE WERE THERE 10 YEARS. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A PLAN TO CLEAN IT UP. ALL WE CAN DO IS TO COME TOGETHER, FIND THOSE PEOPLE IN THE LEGISLATURE THERE TO LISTEN. THEY ARE THERE. WINNIE FROM GRAND RAPIDS IS ONE OF MANY PEOPLE. CONGRESSIONAL FOLKS. YOU FIND THOSE LEVERS TO PULL AND JOIN TOGETHER AS COMMUNITIES AND WITH THEM TO PARTNER. WE HAVE DONE THAT IN OSCOTA. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH DETROIT. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING. LET'S GET TOGETHER AND TALK SOME MORE.  AND IF I MAY, AS INDIVIDUALS, YOU ARE FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU POLITICALLY. LET ME TELL YOU FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE. LET ME BACK UP ONE STEP AND SAY SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT IN LANSING. I AM NOT SURE I LIKE IT, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO A LEGISLATOR? GET RE-ELECTED. YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU USE IT. WHAT WORKED WITH ME PARTICULARLY WAS WHEN ORDINARY FOLKS WOULD COME TO MY OFFICE AND SIT DOWN AND TELL ME THEIR STORY. IF IT REGISTERED AS BEING LEGIT, IT STUCK THERE, AND I WAS TELLING EARLIER TODAY THOSE INDIVIDUAL VISITS MAY NOT SEEM THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU , BUT TO ME IT REGISTERED HERE, AND EVERY DAY WHEN I WENT ON THE FLOOR TO DEAL WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS SCHEDULED THAT DAY I WOULD LOOK AT THE LIST OF THINGS ON THE AGENDA AND I WOULD LOOK DOWN THERE AND SEE THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT OH A COUPLE OF MY CONSTITUENTS CAME AND TALKED TO ME ABOUT. I PULLED THE FILE AND TAKE IT TO THE FLOOR. LISTEN, IT HAD AN IMPACT. I BELIEVED THOSE PEOPLE. I ALSO KNEW IF I REPOND -- IF I RESPONDED TO THEM THEY WOULD MAYBE TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE MAYBE HELP ME GET RE-ELECTED. IT IS NOT AS TOUGH AS YOU THINK. I WAS TELLING SOMEONE EARLIER AND I WILL WRAP UP QUICKLY YOU KNOW, ALL OF THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION YOU GET IS IMPORTANT. YOU NEED TO HAVE A COUPLE OF MEETINGS TO TALK ABOUT HOW IT WILL BE EFFECTIVE POLITICALLY. THAT'S WHERE THE ANSWER IS HERE. THAT'S WHY WE KEEP SEEING THIS STUFF OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND PEOPLE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. YOU ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU THINK. BELIEVE ME.  I AM HERE TO TELL YOU -- [INAUDIBLE]. BUT I AM ALSO HERE TO TELL YOU THE FOLLOWING DETERMINATION CAUSED U.S. MILITARY BASES IS NOT JUST IN THE UNITED STATES -- [APPLAUSE]. IT IS A MASSIVE, MASS GLOBAL -- MASSIVE GLOBAL PROBLEM. ONE MILITARY BASE IN IRAQ WHICH WE HAD ACCESS TO BECAUSE THERE ARE 500 OF THEM, BUT WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN DISTANCE FROM MILITARY BASE AND OCCURRENCE OF BIRTH DEFECTS AND MERCOMIUM IN THE BLOOD OF CHILDREN. I WANT TO FORCE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO CLEAN UP THE MESS IT LEAVES ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE ANGER TOWARD THE UNITED STATES IS ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE'S LIVES HAVE BEEN TURNED AROUND AND DESTROYED BY THE FACT THAT THE U.S. IS PRESENT IN MULTIPLE PLACES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK [APPLAUSE].  I THINK THAT MOTIVATES US TO KEEP MOVING, AND OUR NEXT CONVERSATION IS -- BUS WHAT DID YOU CALL THEM? THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ANYTHING? IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO DO KNOW SOMETHING. THEY LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE IS IN LARGE SCALE CHEMICAL CONTAMINATION. I WANT TO INVITE FOLKS WHO ARE PART OF THE NEXT PANEL TO BEGIN TO MOVE UP TO THE FRONT. JUST TO FLAG FOR US, WE ARE REALLY IN THIS CONFERENCE USING PBB AND PFAS AS BOOKENDS FOR LARGE-SCALE CHEMICAL CONTAMINATIONS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHERS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN MICHIGAN AND WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES ON THE PANEL FROM DETROIT WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED LARGE SCALE BROWN FIELD CONTAMINATIONS THROUGHOUT THE CITY. I BELIEVE ISABON LEWIS IS HERE FROM FLIBT -- FROM -- YVONNE LEWIS IS HERE WHO CAN TALK ABOUT THE CONTAMINATION IN FLINT. I AM TURNING IT OVER TO ANGELA REYES WHO IS THE FOUNDING AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DETROIT HISPANIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION WOULD WILL MODERATE THIS NEXT SECTION.  THANK YOU, AMY. I HAVE THE HONOR OF MODERATING A PANEL OF ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING ON THE FRONT LINES OF LARGE SCALE CONTAMINATION. SO WE WILL BE HAVING A DISCUSSION AMONG THE PANELISTS, AND THEN THERE WILL BE TIME FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AFTERWARDS. LET ME GIVE YOU THE NAMES OF THE FOLKS ON THE PANEL. YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES A LITTLE MORE. THERESA LANDROM FROM 48217 WHICH IS THE FARTHEST SOUTH -- SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE CITY. AND EDWARD LAWRENCE FROM THE SUPER FUND CITIZEN TASK FORCE. TIM NAYER FROM THE CITIZENS ADVISORY BOARD. LAWRENCE REYNOLDS FROM FLINT WAS SICK WITH AN UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION. YVONNE LEWIS HAS GRACEFULLY AGREED TO STEP IN AT THE LAST MOMENT. YOU LIVE AND BREATHE THIS STUFF. YOU CAN FILL IN. SHE IS ALSO FROM FLINT, MICHIGAN AS A COMMUNITY RESIDENT AND THE FOUNDER OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN HEALTH CONSCIOUSNESS. DANELLE WILKINS FROM THE GREEN DOOR AND SANDRA FROM ROCKFORD, MICHIGAN, A RESIDENT FROM THEIR. A VERY ROBUST PANEL FROM ACROSS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME OF THESE ISSUES FIRSTHAND. FIRST I WOULD LIKE EACH OF THE PANELISTS STARTING ON THE FAR END TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND TALK ABOUT YOURSELF AND HOW YOU GOT INTO THIS WORK AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN FACING AROUND CHEMICAL CONTAMINATION.  CAN YOU HEAR ME? HOW DID I GET INTO THIS WORK? I ACCIDENTALLY BACKED INTO IT I THINK. MY STORY IS I AM FROM ROCKFORD, A LITTLE TOWN NORTH OF GRAND RAPIDS. MY HUSBAND AND I MOVED THERE IN 92 AND BOUGHT WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS THE PERFECT HOME SURROUNDED BY CHRISTMAS TREES. WHO DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE IN A CHRISTMAS TREE FARM? WE LIVED THERE FOR ALMOST 25 YEARS. IN DUO -- IN 2016 MY HUSBAND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE FOUR LIVER CANCER AND DIED SIX WEEKS LATER. IF ANY OF YOU LOST SOMEONE YOU KNOW IT IS DEVASTATING. IT IS LIKE TRYING TO TIE YOUR SHOES WITH ONE HAND. YOU CAN'T DO IT. BUT YOU TRY TO MOVE FORWARD. THEN THE DEQ CAME TO MY HOUSE AND SAID OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION WE WOULD LIKE TO TEST YOUR WATER FOR THIS THING CALLED PFOS. AND I THOUGHT, THEY ARE PROBABLY CHECKING FOR CHEERIOS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT PFOS IS. KNOCK YOURSELF OUT. I AM BOARD HERE. TEST MY WATER. THEY CAME BACK A FEW WEEKS LATER AND WHEN THEY CAME WITH A TEAM OF WORKERS IT WASN'T GOOD. I WORKED IN GOVERNMENT LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW IF MORE THAN THREE SHOW UP AT YOUR DOOR THEY ARE NOT HANDING YOU THE PUBLISHER'S CLEARINGHOUSE. THEY TOLD ME THE RATES IN THE GROUND WATER WERE 27,000 PARTS PER TRILLION. THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS AN ERROR BECAUSE IT WAS TOO HIGH. SO THEY TESTED AGAIN. IT CAME BACK AT 38,000 PARTS PER TRILLION. IT HAS TESTED AS HIGH AS 88,000 PARTS PER TRILLION. MY BLOOD IS TESTED AT 5 MILLION PARTS PER TRILLION. I AM 750 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON. THAT'S NOT AN AWARD. YOU DON'T GET A GOLD MEDAL FOR THAT. IT IS A FACT OF LIFE. WHEN THAT HAPPENED I AM AT MY NEIGHBORS' AND I AM AT MY CONGRESSMAN AND SAID THIS IS INSANITY. WE DON'T NEED TO LIVE LIKE THIS. THAT'S MY STORY.  THANK YOU.  GOOD MORNING. I AM THERESA LANDRUM AND FROM ZIP CODE 48217. WE ARE DEEMED THE MOST POLLUTED ZIP CODE IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. AND THAT IS BECAUSE I LIVE AMONG MORE THAN 33 HEAVY POLLUTING INDUSTRY AND I LIVE DOWN THE STREET FROM THE ONLY OIL REFINERY IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. I GOT INVOLVED IN 1985 UNKNOWINGLY. WHEN WE IN SOUTHWEST DETROIT LEARNED THE DETROIT COMPANY WAS SOLD AND THE NEW OWNER WANTED TO STORE TOXIC WASTE IN THE MINE SHAFTS OF THE SALT MINE. I WAS IN THE MASTER MECHANIC DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL MOTORS AT THE TIME. I HEARD ABOUT IT. I WENT AND ASKED QUESTIONS. PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THIS WAS GOING TO OCCUR. IT ALL RESULTED IN ME BEING ONE OF THREE PEOPLE TO GO BEFORE THE DETROIT CITY COUNCIL TO ASK WHY AND HOW CAN THEY ALLOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN. ONCE THEY STARTED TO NAME SOME OF THE CHEMICAL THAT'S WOULD BE STORED IN THE MINE SHAFT, IT WAS JUST MIND BLOWING. WE LIVE BELOW THE WATER TABLE. WE LIVE IN WHAT THEY CONSIDER A FLOOD ZONE. AND WE LIVE ON THE SIDE OF THE MOST CON -- CONTAMINATED RIVER IF MICHIGAN. IT IS A TRIBUTARY TO THE DETROIT RIVER AND LAKE SAINT CLAIRE WHICH IS OUR FRESH WATER SOURCE. WE WERE ABLE TO FIGHT AND TELL THEM THAT SALT WAS A CORROSIVE ONCE THE CHEMICALS WERE STORED THERE. AND IF WE HAD A RISE IN THE WATER TABLE AND IT FLOODED, THAT WATER COULD THEN LEACH INTO THE RIVER THAT WOULD GO THEREFORE TO THE DETROIT RIVER. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT PBB. I FIRST LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT PBB WHEN THERE WAS THE ISSUE WHEN THE LIVESTOCK WAS POISONED. WELL, I ALSO LEARNED AT THAT TIME THAT IN THE TRANSFORMERS THAT ARE ON YOUR LIGHT POLES AND IN THE BACK OF YOUR HOUSE, THAT HAD PBB IN IT. WE, IN MY COMMUNITY, HAD A SERIES OF ELECTRICAL FIRES WHERE EVERY TRANS -- TRANSFORMER DOWN ONE CITY BLEW UP. THE STUFF OOZED OUT INTO THE GROUND AND THEREFORE CONTAMINATED OUR ALLEYWAY AND OUR BACKYARD. UNLIKE SANDY, NO ONE CAME TO OUR HOUSE. NO ONE NOTIFIED US. WE WERE NEVER TESTED. AND JUST TO MOVE FORWARD I HAVE BECOME -- I WAS PUSHED, DRUGGED AND ROLLED INTO THE ENVIRONMENTAL GIST THIS MOVEMENT. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT. IT WAS OUT OF NECESSITY BECAUSE OF THE CHEMICALS WE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO FROM SURROUNDING INDUSTRIES. MY AREA IS NONATTAINMENT FOR SULFUR DIOXIDE AND OZONE. WE STARTED A COMMUNITY MONITORING GROUP AND WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST GROUPS TO GET A STATION FAIRY MONITOR. ALL OF THE TIMES WE WERE SAYING WE WERE EXPOSED AND WE WANT A HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND WE WANT A CANCER CLUSTER STUDY, AND WE WANT OUR BLOOD TESTED THEY TOLD US THERE WAS NO NEED FOR IT. LISTENING TO THESE STORIES TODAY AND WATCHING THE MOVIE LAST NIGHT, THIS IS THE SAME THING THAT OCCURRED TO US 40 YEARS AGO THAT IS STILL HAPPENING TO THIS DAY. THASES -- THAT'S HOW I BECAME INVOLVED. [APPLAUSE].  IT IS SO HARD TO FOLLOW THERESA. GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. I AM DONELLE WILKINS AND THE FOUNDER OF A DETROIT-BASED GROUP CALLED THE GREEN DOOR INITIATIVE. HOW DID I GET INVOLVED IF THIS WORK? WELL OVER 30 YEARS AGO I WAS WORKING IN THE SPACE OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY. I LIKE TO SAY I AM AN ADVOCATE WORKING WITH LABOR AND WAS REALLY MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY REALLY ENJOYED RETIREMENT AND IF THEY RETIRED AFTER WORKING MANY YEARS IN THE MOST DANGEROUS AND LOW PAYING WORK THEIR HEALTH FAILED. I AM ALSO THE DAUGHTER -- MY FATHER -- MY STEP-FATHER HAD WORKED FOR CHRYSLER, AND HE WAS IN HIS EARLY 30S AND ON HIS WAY FROM WORK AFTER DOING A LONG SHIFT AND HE HAS A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK ON THE WAY HOME. AS A RESULT HE THEN ENDED UP WITH -- IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND THAT ULTIMATELY ENDED HIS LIFE. WHICH ACTUALLY CAUSED MY FAMILY, MY MOTHER, TO BE A WIDOW OF SIX CHILDREN AND LEFT HER AS A SINGLE MOM. FAST-FORWARDING WHEN I GOT INVOLVED IN WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY STUFF IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I NEEDED TO FIND OUT WHY MY DAD LOST HIS LIFE SO EARLY IN HIS LIFE. AND WHICH REALLY LEAD ME TO BE APPROACHED BY SOMEONE FROM THIS INSTITUTION WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH MY WORK. THE FOCUS WAS ON BLACK WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THAT WAS RARE BACK THEN. HE SAID YOU ARE THE KIND OF PERSON WE NEED TO ATTEND THIS IMPORTANT MEETING THAT IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IN 1991. THE FIRST PEOPLE OF COLOR ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT A MASSIVE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY INCLUDING ALASKA, PUERTO RICO, HAWAII, THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, SAVANNAH, CHICAGO, DETROIT, NATIVE AMERICANS ALL CONVERGING ON WASHINGTON, D.C. TO REDEFINE THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT. TO INCLUDE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN INVISIBLE IN THAT WORK, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO EXPOSURE TO TOXINS. NOT BEING INVOLVED IN THE POLICY MAKING PROCESSES THAT WOULD PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS TO AFFORD THEM THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THAT WAS THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED TOO MANY DOUBTS, TOO MANY DEFORMITIES AND TOO MANY THINGS AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN AND THE DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES WHERE POLLUTING FACILITIES ARE LOCATED AS A RESULT OF RESIDENTIAL APARTHEID. THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN DICTATES WHERE YOU LIVE. AND TOO MANY TIMES LIKE IN THE CASE OF 48217, INDUSTRY GOES UP AROUND IT. UNTIL THE LIVES BECOME SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE IMHO -- WHO ENTERS THIS EARTH REGARDLESS OF THEIR ZIP CODE OR THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN, THE INCOME LEVEL, UNTIL THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS IGNORED, THAT HOBB -- THAT HONORS US AS HUMAN BEINGS, I AM DOING THIS FIGHT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND TO REVERSE THAT. I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THAT SPACE FOR WELL OVER 30 YEARS AND TRYING TO UP LIFT THIS WORK. I AM EXCITED ABOUT BEING IN THIS ROOM AND IN THIS SPACE TODAY. AS I ALSO VIEWED THE FILM AND LISTENED TO THE STORIES LIKE IT IS THE SAME OLD STORY. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING IT FOR A LONGTIME. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING IT BY OURSELVES. MOST PEOPLE SAY THAT'S A DETROIT ISSUE OR THAT'S A BLACK PEOPLE ISSUE. THAT'S NOT OUR ISSUE. THAT DOESN'T REFLECT THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE. IT IS NOT OUR ISSUE. WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND IT IS NOT OKAY WE CAN'T BREATHE THE SAME AIR AND DRINK THE SAME WATER AND FOR OUR CHILDREN TO BE IN SCHOOL BUILDINGS THAT ARE CONTAMINATED AND HAVE ISSUES AND LOCATED NEAR FREEWAYS. THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF ISSUES. HOW I GOT IN THIS? I AM A BORN ADVOCATE. IT IS MY JOB WHILE I AM IN THIS SPACE AND ON THIS EARTH I HAVE TO DO WHAT I CAN TO SPEAK MY TRUTH AND TO FIGHT FOR IT AND TO CHANGE LAWS. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ACROSS THE STATE. IT IS ABOUT TIME WE GET IT TOGETHER AND REMOVE THE FALSE BARRIERS AND THE FALSE WALLS LIKE RACISM TO SAY WE ALL DE -- DESERVE TO HAVE QUALITY OF LIFE. [APPLAUSE].  THANK YOU, EVERYONE. MY NAME IS TIM GARNER. I LIVE NEAR MOUNT PLEASANT, MICHIGAN WHICH IS IN ISABELLA COUNTY. I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS SOME 46 YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND WORKING ON OUR FARM. I THINK I AM THE ONLY ONE IN OUR HEART THAT WAS LIKE THERE WHEN THE ATOMIC BOMB DROPPED. OUR FARM WAS QUARANTINED AND ALL OF OUR ANIMALS WERE TAKEN -- WERE TESTED. THEY HAD FIVE PARTS PER MILL TO 23 AND 26 PARTS. EVERY LIVING ANIMAL ON OUR FARM HAD TO BE DESTROYED. THAT HAPPENED ON APRIL 12th OF 1975. THE FEED WENT OUT OF THAT PALLET MILL IN 1973 OR 1974. SO WE GOT CONTAMINATED, I BELIEVE, AT THE ONSET OF IT. SO FOR 18 MONTHS WE WERE MILKING OUR COWS AND SHIPPING OUR MILK TO EVERETT DAIRY AND THEY SUPPLIED ALL OF THE MYERS STORES IN MICHIGAN WITH MILK. NOW WHAT GETS REALLY COMPLICATED AND MIND BOGGLING. THEY QUARANTINED US IN APRIL. THAT MEANS NO ANIMAL COULD LEAVE THE FARM, NOTHING. HOWEVER, THEY QUARANTINED US FOR TWO WEEKS AND CAME BACK, THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE SAID, WELL, YOU MIGHT NOT GET A SETTLEMENT RIGHT AWAY. IT MIGHT BE A LONGTIME, AND WE KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SELL YOUR MILK, BUT WE'RE GOING TO TEST YOUR MILK. AS LONG AS IT STAYS LOW, .3 PARTS PER MILLION YOU CAN SELL YOUR MILK. SO THEY TEMPORARILY LET US MILK OUR COWS AND SELL THE MILK UP UNTIL JUNE 5th OF 1975. THAT'S WHEN EIGHT TRUCKS CAME AND THEY HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THE MILK TRUCK PUMPED IT OFF BEFORE THEY CAN LOAD THE CATTLE TO TAKE THEM TO THE AND I THOUGHT THIS CAN'T BE. IF THE CATTLE AREN'T FIT TO EAT, WHY ARE WE ALLOWING TO US SELL THE MILK. AND THE STORY WAS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT AND THIS IS SUCH AN UNUSUAL THING AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE HANDLE IT AND WE'RE GOING BY WHAT INFORMATION WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. THAT UPSET ME. SO FROM THAT POINT ON, I COLLECTED EVERY ARTICLE ON PBB. I WENT TO EVERY MEETING THAT WAS AROUND THERE. AND FARM WHERE WE BOUGHT OUR DAIRY PALLET, I DON'T THINK WAS FORTHCOMING AS MUCH AS THEY SAID. WHEN IT CAME OUT IN 74 WE WERE GOING TO THE ELEVATOR AND ASK THEM, DID WE GET ANY OF THIS FEED THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT AND THEY SAID OH NO, THAT'S JUST A SMALL ISSUE DOWN STATE. NO. YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT OR ANYTHING. AND THEY KEPT FEEDING THIS LINE TO US. WHAT DO YOU DO? UNTIL THE STATE INSPECTOR FROM THE MILK PLANT CAME IN. THEN IT GOT REAL SERIOUS. WE HAD TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN ORDER TO GET A RAPID ESCALATION OF OUR CLAIMS AND STUFF. AND THEN OF COURSE WE WENT THROUGH WHOLE PROCESS AND STUFF. AND AT THE SETTLEMENT WE ASKED WHAT ABOUT OUR HEALTH. DON'T EVEN BRING THAT UP. THAT'S OFF THE TABLE. NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT AN ISSUE. SO DON'T EVEN BRING IT UP. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET A DIME FOR IT. SO THEYTH STATE CAME IN AND HAD A TEAM COME IN. THEY CAME TO GRAND RAPIDS. MY FAMILY ENROLLED IN IT AND WE WENT DOWN ON A SATURDAY. IT WAS AN ALL DAY PROCESS. THEY TOOK MY BLOOD AND SOME FAT TISSUE. I TESTED 1.2 PARTS PER MILLION IN MY FAT TISSUE AND I HAD HALF POINT PARTIAL MILLION IN MY BLOOD. THAT WAS IN 1976. FAST FORWARD TO 2012 WHEN YOU GUYS STARTED IT UP. I GET A LETTER FROM THE ADVISORY GROUP AND I THOUGHT WHAT AN IDEA. WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING TOGETHER AND SEEING WHAT YOU CAN DO TO GET RID OF THE PBB IN YOUR BODY. GOUDA TO THE DOCTOR AND SAY THAT TO MY LOCAL DOCTOR AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THEY JUST TELL ME DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. SO WE GOT INVOLVED IN THAT AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT AS PART OF THIS THING, I ALWAYS SAID THERE IS ONE ELEMENT THAT THEY DON'T MEASURE THAT YOU CAN'T MEASURE IN PART MER MILLION AND THAT IS THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE IT DID TO FAMILIES. IT CAUSED DIVORCE. IT CAUSED PROBLEMS BETWEEN FAMILIES, BETWEEN BROTHERS. THERE IS A LOT OF ISSUES THAT NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT NEVER GETS REPORTED AND NEVER GETS EXPOSED. SO I COLLECTED ALL THIS INFORMATION. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY POUNDS OF INFORMATION I HAD BUT I DONATED IT TO SAMUEL LIBRARY. IF ANYBODY WANTS TO DO RESEARCH WITH THE ACTUAL ARTICLES AND STUFF THAT WERE WRITTEN AT THE TIME AND WHAT WAS SAID THEN IT'S AT CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY FOR EVERYBODY TO DO RESEARCH ON. I THINK THAT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] .  WE'RE TWIN CITIES OF MICHIGAN. AND I CAME HERE, I WAS NOT HERE WHEN WE HAD THE PBB. I LIVED IN CHICAGO. I VAGUELY RECALL SEEING IT ON TV CATTLE GETTING SHOT. I CAME IN 89 TO TEACH CENTRAL HISTORY AND PUBLIC POLICY. AND THOUGHT I'D BE DEALING WITH PLACES LIKE FLINT OR DETROIT WHERE THERE SEEMED TO HAVE A LOT OF SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. WE LIVED THERE A YEAR AND IN 1990 I WENT TO A CONFERENCE AT MIT ON PROBLEMS IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. AND THE FIRST MORNING OF THIS CONFERENCE I SAT IN THE FRONT CORNER CHAIR AND THE GUY RUNNING THE SESSION CAME IN AND SAID BEFORE WE START WHY DON'T WE INTRODUCE OURSELF. HE SAID WHY DON'T YOU SAY WHO YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU ARE FROM. I SAID ME NAME AND I'M FROM ELMA MICHIGAN. A GUY SAID IF WE WANT TO STUDY PROBLEMS IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, WE OUGHT TO GO TO THIS GUY'S HOMETOWN. I WAS LIKE I DIDN'T SAY FLINT WHERE THERE ARE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS CLEARLY OR DETROIT. AND THEN HE EXPLAINED FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES THE HISTORY OFVILLE SA COLE CHEMICAL , THEP BB INCIDENT. THE TOTAL SO ANYWAY, IT'S LIKE THIS IS AMAZING. I LIVE IN THIS PLACE AND SO I CAME BACK, STARTED A PROJECT WITH SOME STUDENTS. STARTED TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED 20 YEARS EARLIER IN THE PBB INCIDENT. AND AS WE DID THIS IN THE MID 90'S, WE FOUND OUT THERE WERE THESE JUST TRAGIC STORIES, AMAZING STORIES OF FAILURE OF THE POLICY PROCESS AND ALL OF THIS. AND TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, IN 1997EPA CAME BACK INTO TOWN HAVING FOUND HOW CONTAMINATED OUR RIVER WAS WITH DDT. THEY OFFERED REOPEN REMEDIATION WHICH THEY STARTED IN 1998. AND SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO HEALTH BECAUSE WE HEARD ALL THESE STORIES OF PEOPLE BEING CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF EXPOSURE, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS QUE WE DID IN 9 WAS FILE A MASSIVE GRANT PROPOSAL TO NEIHS. IT WAS DIFFERENT LEADERSHIP AT THAT TIME THAN MORE RECENTLY. WE WERE TURNED DOWN BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A COMMUNITY GROUP TO PARTICIPATE. WE WERE LIKE WE'RE A COMMUNITY GROUP. WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR WAS BIG NAME UNIVERSITIES, NOT TO MICK ON PLACES SOME OF YOU ARE FROM. THEY WANTED THOSE TO BE DOING PROPOSALS. THEY DIDN'T WANT A COMMUNITY INITIATING THIS. THERE WAS A QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT WHY HAVE THINGS CHANGED? THINGS HAD CHANGED ALREADY BY THEN COMPARED TO THE 70'S. MIGHT BISH WAS MUCH POORER AS A STATE WITH THE DECLINE OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND OTHER CHANGES. OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAD LOST AS SETS AND PERSONNEL AND MONEY. AND THEY HAD NO INTEREST IN SUPPORTING OUR HEALTH STUDY. IT IS SO TRAGIC. WHAT WE WERE PROPOSED TO USE INFANT BLOOD SPOTS AND ANALYZE FOR EXPOSURES TO PBB AND DDT. AND THIS WAS REJECTED BY NIEHS. AND THEN THE STATE WENT AHEAD AND DESTROYED THE OLD RECORDS. WE CAN'T EVEN DO WHAT WE WOULD HAVE WANTED TO DO THAT THE TIME. SO I GUESS I FOUND OUT FROM ALL THIS AND IT'S A MUCH LONGER STORY THAN WHAT I'M SAYING, HOW THERE REALLY IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM. THERE HAS BEEN ONE IN DEALING WITH THESE MAJOR ISSUES. ONE OBSERVATION THAT WE MADE AFTER A FEW YEARS OF FIGHTING FOR THIS. THERE IS A SORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD THINK GLOBALLY AND ACT LOCALLY. BECOME AN EXPERT ON YOUR LOCAL PROBLEM. IF YOU HANG ON THERE AND FOCUS LOCALLY, YOU ARE GOING TO BE BEATEN BY THE FORCES WAY BEYOND YOU WHO DON'T WANT ACTION AND HAVE MUCH MORE ASSETS. WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS BE EXPERTS ON YOUR LOCAL PROBLEM AND THEN FIGHT FOR AN ALLIANCE ACROSS THE BOARD TO CONFRONT THIS A.. AND WHEN YOU THINK IT'S NOT JUST GEOGRAPHICALLY. THE ECONOMICS OF OUR POLICY IS TOTALLY FLAWED. WE ARE NOT ASSUMING THE COST OF ALL THE SUFFERING FROM THE ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION, FROM THE LOST LIVES OF THE MISCARRIAGES. NONE OF THAT GETS FACTORED INTO TALKING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM. EVEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. YOU HAVE TO THINK GEOGRAPHICALLY ACROSS THE BOARD. I THINK YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE ECONOMICS, CONFRONT THE ECONOMIC MODEL THAT JUSTIFIES A LOT OF PEOPLE SUFFERING IN THE NAME OF WE NEED IT FOR GROWTH. I COULD SAY A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT BUT I BETTER STOP.  GOOD MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M I DIDN'T VONN LEWIS. I'M A 40 YEAR RESEARCHING DIDN'T OF FLINT. AS I SAT AND LISTENED EARLIER THINKING ABOUT THE CONVERSATION OF THIS PANEL AND WHEN DID I GET STARTED. I PROBABLY GOT STARTED AT BIRTH. I WAS BORN INTO A FAMILY -- I WAS BORN IN SAG NA MICHIGAN SO THE PBB CONVERSATION IS VERY REAL TO ME. WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM IMPACTS. 187 WAS A PIVOTAL POINT. I LEFT 15 YEARS AS A SALARIED EMPLOYEE WITH GENERAL MOTORS TO TRY FIGURE OUT WHAT I COULD DO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE MANY MY COMMUNITIES. THAT LED ME TO BEGIN WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FAITH COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND ACADEMIC PARTNERS. AND SO I REALLY DEVELOPED A PASSION TO SAY WHERE ARE THE VOICES THAT ARE MISSING FROM THESE TABLES. I WANT TO SAY THIS BEFORE I GO TOO FAR AND I FORGET THAT THE COMMUNITY VOICES ARE SO VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. THE LEAGUE EXPERIENCE BRINGS A LEVEL OF EXPERTISE THAT MUST BE HEARD WHICH REQUIRES LISTENING AND BEING AT THE TABLE, PART OF THE CONVERSATION AT THE TABLE. NOT JUST ON THE TABLE AS A MATTER OF DISCUSSION AND PART OF PROJECTS TO GET TO SOLUTIONS. THE NEED TO EXPERIENCE IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AS I WAS SITTING AT THE TABLES AND I WAS LISTENING TO SOME OF THE CONVERSATION, I WONDERED OFTEN WHO ARE WE TALKING -- WHO ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T REFLECT THE COMMUNITY THAT I LIVED IN. IT DIDN'T REFLECT THE PEOPLE THAT I KNEW. IT DIDN'T REFLECT MY LIVED EXPERIENCE. AND SO MANY YEARS LATER AFTER MANY ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS AND CONVERSATIONS, THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN HEALTH CONSCIOUSNESS WAS BORN. IN 1987 WAS MY FIRST EXPOSURE TO ANYTHING PUBLIC HEALTH AS A PROFESSION. IN 187 I LEARNED ABOUT HEALTHY PEOPLE 2000. AND THEN I LEARNED ABOUT HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010. AND THEN IN 2013 ITCHES LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020. AND I REALIZED AT THAT MOMENT THAT I LOOKED AT THE STATISTICS AND DATA RELATED TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN HEALTH AND HEALTH OUTCOMES, IT DIDN'T CHANGE VERY MUCH AT ALL EXCEPT FOR GETTING WORSE. AND I ATTRIBUTE THAT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE DATA MEANS. WHAT DOES IT REALLY SAY AND WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM IT? I ENCOURAGE AS WE HAVE IN THIS CONVERSATION HEAR THESE WONDERFUL VOICES, THESE PARTNERSHIPS ARE SO IMPORTANT. WE GET TO THE WATER CRISIS IN FLINT. AND IT IS NOT OVER BECAUSE FOR US IT WILL BE A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE MUCH AS WHAT YOU'VE HEARD HEAR. WE WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE WOMEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT WILL BE. WE TALK ABOUT A LOT THE RESEARCH THAT IS GOING ON AND HOW THIS RESEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED AN WHAT WILL IT REALLY MEAN TO THE RESIDENTS. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THOSE VOICE AT THE TABLE TO DETERMINE THE TYPE OF RESEARCH THAT WILL BE DONE. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE WANT TO HAVE ANSWERED. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID WAS START THE HEALTHY FLINT RESEARCH COORDINATING CENTER. THAT WAS TO BRING PARTNERS TOGETHER IN AN EQUAL WAY SO WE CAN ALL BE PART OF WHAT THE VERGE WILL BE. WE HAD RESEARCHERS COMING FROM EVERYWHERE. PEOPLE BEEN WANTING TO COME TO FLINT FOR A LONG TIME. IT IS NOT NEW TO FLINT. BUT THE RESISTANCE OF A COMMUNITY WHEN WE WERE TOLD THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK, COMMUNITY MEMBERS KNEW IT WAS NOT OK. AND INTENTIONALLY SAID IT ISN'T OK AND BROUGHT THE EVIDENCE. BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT CONSIDERED THE EXPERT OR THE SCIENTISTS, THE EVIDENCE WAS NOT RECEIVED OR ACCEPTED. BUT IT WAS CREDIBLE. THE OTHER THING IS OUR FLINT CENTER FOR EQUITY SOLUTIONS IS A COMMUNITY ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP WHERE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE AT EVERY PART OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, I HEARD IT SPOKEN ABILITY EARLIER, WE KNOW IN CERTAIN CASE COMMUNITY MEMBERS MIGHT NOT BE THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER HOW THEY CAN BE INVOLVED AND INCLUDED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS FOR THE BEST OR MOST OPTIMAL OUTCOME FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED. SPEAKING ABOUT THE FLINT WATER CRISIS. IT IS SO CHALLENGING TO THINK EVERY DAY NOT ONLY ARE YOU HAVING TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU TURN ON THE TAP CAN YOU USE THE WATER, THERE ARE OTHER CONTAMINANTS IN THE WATER THAN LEAD. LEAD GOT ATTENTION. AT TIMES IT FEELS LIKE LEAD IS OUR ACHILLES HE'LL. WHEN WE CAN REGULATE SOMETHING WE CAN SAY WE FIXED IT AND EVERYTHING IS OK. THERE IS NO SAFE LEAD LEVEL. THEN YOU ADD THAT TO PBB, MULTIPLE SITES THAT ARE CONTAMINATED BECAUSE GENERAL MOTORS DID LEAVE THEM. WE ARE THANK HALF THE REQUIREMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL DURING THE BANKRUPTCY CALLED THEM TO PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER TO REMEDIATE THOSE PROPERTIES. BUT IT'S STILL THERE AND THE RESIDENTS TO FACE EVERY DAY THE QUESTION WHAT DO WE DO TO HELP ENSURE WE DO OUR BEST TO PREVENT FURTHER COMPLICATIONS AND ALSO MEDIATE WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE FOR OUR FUTURE. THIS IS A LONG TERM CONVERSATION. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT ALL RIGHT NOW. BUT WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS. I ENCOURAGE YOU FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE REALLY AND I KNOW YOU ARE BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE INTERESTED IN MAKING A DIFFERENCE. BE SURE YOU ARE ENGAGING MEMBERS WHO ARE LIVING THIS EXPERIENCE IN THE CONVERSATIONS SO THOSE NUANCES THAT YOU WOULD NEVER THINK ABOUT COME FORWARD SO THETH CHANGE THAT IS NECESSARY CAN BE MADE. [APPLAUSE] .  I'M A LIFE LONG RESIDENT OF DETROIT AS WELL. I LIVE IN THE ZIP CODE ADJACENT TO TERESA. WE HAD ANOTHER CONTAMINATION WHERE EWE RAIN JERUSALEM PROBABLY IN THE RIVER JUST UPSTREAM FROM THE WATER INTAKE FROM THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT. WE ARE BEING TOLD THERE IS NO EFFECT ON THE HEALTH AND WATER IS FINE. I'M WONDERING, WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WERE YOU GIVEN WHEN THE CONTAMINATION OCCURRED IN YOUR COMMUNITY ABOUT YOUR HEALTH? DID THEY GIVE YOU ANY ADVICE ON WHAT YOU SHOULD DO FROM ANY OF YOU?  I'LL TAKE THAT ONE FROM MY COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE. THREE THINGS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED UP HERE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN GONE INTO. ONE IS SILOS. IT WAS JUST TOUCHED ON. WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN SILO AS CROSS MICHIGAN. GENERAL AND I WERE ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE ON A COMMITTEE FIGHTING TO BREAK DOWN THE SILOS OF THE NDEQ BECAUSE ONE HAND OVER HERE IS WORKING ON WATER, ONE IS WORKING ON AIR, ONE IS WORKING ON SOIL. NONE OF THEM ARE TALKING. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. SO WHEN WE ASK THE MDEQ TO COME IN AND LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO US FROM ALL THESE CHEMICAL COMPANIES, THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. WE WENT TO THE CONGRESS PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND TALKED TO THEM AND IT WAS AS IF THEY WERE SO DISMISSIVE ON CUMULATIVE IMPACT. NOBODY IS LOOKING AT POLLUTION ON A CUMULATIVE IMPACT NOR COLLECTIVELY ACROSS MICHIGAN. ANOTHER THING THAT IS SO HARD FOR ME TO GET GRASP ON IS IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE HIGH RATES OF CANCER THAT ARE OFF THE CHARTS. WE HAD TO DO A WHILE CROSS CAMPAIGN WHERE WE WENT TO THE PEOPLE AND WE ASKED THEM TO PUT A CROSS IN THEIR YARD FOR EVERYBODY THAT HAD CANCER PASSED FROM CANCER OR SURVIVED FROM CANCER. THE NEWS CAME OUT TO COVER IT. AND THEY WERE ASTOUNDED BECAUSE ONE FAMILY ALL EIGHT HAD CANCER. MY HOME THREE OF US HAD CANCER. I'M A CANCER SURVIVOR. 43 M MY MOTHER AND FATHER BOTH D FROM LUNG CANCER. ON MY BLOCK ALONE 12 PEOPLE. THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING IS WRONG. THEY SENT THE CDC IN TO DO A STUDY AND THEC DC WENT BACK AND SAID NO IMPACT. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? IT TELLS YOU YOUR LIFE IS NOTHING TO THEM. WE ARE CASUALTIES OF INDUSTRY'S GREED AND WE KNOW IT. ALL THESE RACISMS IS IMPACTING ALL OF THIS. RACISM ITSELF, SOCIAL RACISM, ECONOMIC RACISM AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE RACISM ARE HELPING US TO BE SILOED. WE HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN. WE HAVE TO COME AROUND FULL CIRCLE AND REALIZE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ST. LOUIS IS HAPPENING IN DETROIT MICHIGAN. WE HAVE A PROBLEM THAT THEY JUST CONNECTED RIGHT BACK TO MARATHON OIL REFINELY WHERE IT OOZED OUT OF THE GROUND. THREE COMPANIES WERE RESPONSIBLE IN 201. IN 201 IT WAS TRACED BACK TO MARATHON. THERE IS A CHALLENGE WITH THAT. THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS THIS. THE DOCTORS. OUR DOCTORS ARE NOT TRAINED TO IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED DISEASES. SO WHEN YOU SAY YOUR DOCTOR DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT PBB OR PFOS THEY ARE PROBABLY TELLING THE TRUTH. SO THIS COLLECTIVE DATA HAS TO BE EXPOSED TO THE MEDICAL FIELD AND WE HAVE TO DEMAND THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE WHICH IS USING OUR TAX DOLLARS, USE OUR TAX DOLLARS TO HELP US DETERMINE HEALTH IMPACTS FROM INDUSTRY. SO WE ARE BEING TOLD OH THERE IS NO IMPACT. THEN WE FIND OUT TWO OR THREE YEARS DOWN THE LINE WE HAVE TO FILE A LAWSUIT BECAUSE THEY LIED AND LIED AND LIED. WE WATCHED NO DEFENSE LAST NIGHT , THE D.C. OD I WISH WE COULD ALL GET TOGETHER AND COME TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY AND SUE THEM ABOUT OUR HEALTH. [APPLAUSE] .  I DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THAT. GOOD GRIEF. FOR US IN ROCK FORD WHEN THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE AND SAID 38,000 PARTS PER TRILLION, I SAID IS THIS DANGEROUS AND THEY SAID PROBABLY NOT. BUT THEN I NOTICED TWO PEOPLE GOT OUT AND STARTED BRINGING IN BOTTLED WATER. SO I THOUGHT WELL PROBABLY SO THEN. AND WE HAD TO REALLY FIGHT TO GET PEOPLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS SOME PROBLEMS. THEY HANDED US THE CDC SHEET THAT ANYBODY WHO HAS HAD ANY PFOS CONTAMINATION, IT GIVES YOU FROM THE STUDY THAT SAYS CLEARLY WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S TWO DROPS IN AN OLYMPIC SIZE SWIMMING POOL. SO TWO DROPS IS OK BUT THREE DROPS IS DANGEROUS. I'M NOT SLEEPING ANY BETTER IF THAT IS YOUR ANALOGY HERE. IT WAS THE SAME THING WITH INDUSTRY. OLIVER RHIANNA WORLDWIDE DUMPED TANNERY WASTE AT THE CHRISTMAS TREE FARM IN TROUGHS AND DUG AND DUG AND DUMPED TRUCKLOAD AFTER TRUCKLOAD AND WHEN IT OVERFLOWED IT WENT TO THE AQUIFER AND CONTAMINATED 25 SQUARE MILE OF MY COMMUNITY. WE HAD TO FIGHT TO ASK FOR BLOOD TESTING. WE ONLY GOT BLOOD TESTING WHEN WE GOT LEGAL ADVICE AND WENT OUT ON OUR OWN AND GOT THE BLOOD TESTING. THAT WAS AWFUL. WE STILL STRUGGLE WITH DOCTORS NOT KNOWING. SO YOU AS THE AFFECTED PERSON HAVE TO BECOME THE EXPERT WITH YOUR DOCTORS. YOU HAVE TO SAY IF YOU DON'T KNOW LET ME EDUCATE YOU. IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEN WE'RE GOING TO START LOOKING FOR THESE THINGS ON THE C8 STUDY JUST TO MAKE SURE I'M OK. I THINK WE AS IMPACTED CITIZEN (R) GOING TO NEED TO BE THE ONES THAT HELP THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE TO BE THE ONES THAT WORK WITH RESEARCHERS AT EMORY AND MSU AND SOME OF THE OTHERS AND ASK YOU TO BE OUR ADVOCATES BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE TO LISTEN TO US BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT SMART. THEY ASSUME. BUT THEY WILL LISTEN TO OTHER RESEARCHERS. SO WE NEED THEM TO BE OUR ALLIES. I SEE RESEARCHERS GOING I'M NOT SO SURE. HERE IS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU. WE CAN BE LOUD AND YOU CAN BE SMART AND THAT IS A DANGEROUS COMBINATION. [APPLAUSE] .  I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT ON WHAT THEY SAID WHEN THEY TELL YOU THAT THREE PARTS IS BAD AND TWO PARTS IS OK. WE COULD SELL OUR MILK AS LONG AS IT WAS .3. IT DEFIES LOGIC. AND YOUR CREDIBILITY IN THEM GOES OUT THE WINDOW. AT LEAST I DIDN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING THEY SAID AFTER THAT. MY THOUGHT IS IS IT IN THERE OR IT ISN'T IN THERE. THOSE ARE MEASUREMENTS THEY SHOULD TAKE FROM HERE ON OUT.  THE CONCEPT ABOUT SILOS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR WHAT DOE. THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH DIVISION. OUR SITE IN ST. LOUIS IS PRIMARILY BEING WORRIED ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE E.P.A. THERE IS A WHOLE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES IS MORE CONCERN TO THE PEOPLE THAN CLEANING UP THIS OLD SITE EVEN THOUGH THE OLD SITE IS A PROBLEM. IN A BIGGER WAY A SILO IS SILOING ECONOMICALLY. WE NEED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOBS. MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN ARE STRUGGLING. WE WANT JOBS BUT THAT TYPE OF ECONOMICS ANYBODY WHO COMES IN AND CREATES A JOB IS GOOD WHETHER THEY ARE MAKING DDT OR WHATEVER. THEN THE OTHER TYPE OF ECONOMICS IS WE CAN'T AFFORD THE COST OF CLEANUPS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE. THOSE TWO SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE SEPARATED. WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR CASE WE'VE DONE A DETAILED STUDY OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCE. THAT COMPANY NEVER PAID ALL ITS WAGES AND ALL ITS TAXES, NEVER EXCEEDED THE HALF BILLION DOLLARS WE'RE NOW PAYING TO CLEAN UP THEIR MESS. THIS IS NOT ECONOMICS. IT'S A LIE. AND WORST OF ALL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO CLEAN IT UP, THE OTHER LIE IS WE'RE MAKING OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS PAY FOR CLEANING THIS UP BECAUSE OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS RUNNING OFF A BIG DEFICIT. WE'RE NOT REALLY PAYING EVEN FOR THE SUPER FUND CLEANUP. WE ABOLLISHED THE SUPER FUND TAX. SO WE'RE MAKING OUR DESCENDANTS PAY FOR THE PROFITS, WE ALLOWED THE PROFITS TO GO TO THE FOUNDERS OF THE THE PLACES. THE GUY BECAME ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN CHICAGO. THE KIDS AND GRANDKIDS ARE PAYING ECONOMICALLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THESE. AND THERE ARE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES, WHO KNOWS WHAT THE COST OF THOSE. WE HAVE TOTALLY SILOED ECONOMICS AND WE NEED TO REBEL AGAINST IT. [APPLAUSE] .  I JUST WANT TO QUICKLY GO BACK TO THE TWO VERSUS THREEP PM. YOU ARE RIGHT. THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT LOAD OF CONTAMINANTS THERE. IS NO SUCH THING AS A SAFE LEVEL. CERTAINLY WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A POPULATION. LET ME JUST ADD THAT FOR THEPB B DISASTER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PARTS PER BILLION WHICH IS LIKE ONE DROP ANYWAY SWIMMING POOL, NOT OLYMPIC SWIMMING POOL BUT A REGULAR SWIMMING POOL. BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS YOUR BODY'S OWN HORMONES WORK AT THAT CONCENTRATION. THIS IS NOT NEGLIGIBLE. THIS IS HOW YOUR BODY'S HORMONES WORK.  THANK YOU.  I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO EVEN PINPOINT ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE GOING THIS AFTERNOON TO TALK ABOUT STRATEGIES. THAT THERE IS PRECEDENT AND WHILE WE'RE IN MICHIGAN WE'RE FOCUSND TO CRISIS HERE IN MICHIGAN. BUT THIS IS A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUE. THERE IS PRECEDENT FOR MAKING GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY DO THE RIGHT THING. WE HAVE SEEN IT THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WORK ALL AROUND THIS COUNTRY AND THE DEEP SOUTH. THE IMPACTS AND OTHER PLACES WE'VE SEEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE INTERNATIONAL WORK AT THE CLIMATE CHANGE, THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF PARTIES AND THE RESEARCH AND STUFF THAT IS GOING FORWARD AND ALL OF THAT. WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS IN ORDER FOR TO US MAKE AN IMPACT HERE, WE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL TO DO IT. NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, WE CAN LEARN THOSE LESSONS FROM WHAT FOLKS ARE SILT FOLKS HAVE SETOUT TO DO AND SOME ACHIEVED. IN OUR THINKING GOING FORWARD. LET'S NOT TRY TO LIFT US UP FROM GROUND ZERO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO. THERE IS PRECEDENT THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM. AND THEN WE CAN TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. BUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE IN THIS ROOM TOGETHER, THE FACT THAT WE'RE HERE, LET'S JUST DO IT OK. LET'S JUST DO IT. [APPLAUSE] .  I'D LIKE TO DRAW FROM WHAT YOU SAID IN TERMS OF NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL. I'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT WE PUT CONTEXT TO IT. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO WORK MAY BE GOOD. HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE CONTEXTLE DIFFERENCES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED N. OUR COMMUNITY WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WERE TOLD TO DO. MANY OF OUR PHYSICIANS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL PREGNANT WOMEN HOW TO HANDLE THE LEAD THING. WE WORKED WITH OUR MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND THEY SAID TO ENSURE PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT CONDITIONS, FUR A SENIOR, IF YOU ARE IMMUNE COMPROMISED. IF YOUR CHILD IS 0-6. IF YOU ARE PREGNANT AND BREASTFEEDING, DRINK ONLY BOTTLED WATER. THAT'S GOOD IN THE CONVERSATION. BUT HOW DO WE GET THE INFORMATION TO PEOPLE LIVING THE EXPERIENCE? SO MULTIPLE THINGS NEED HAPPEN WHERE THERE IS CONTINUED CONVERSATION WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENT WHERE THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING AT A POLICY LEVEL AND RESEARCH LEVEL. WHAT DO PEOPLE NEED TO DO EVERY DAY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT AND UNDERSTAND THE ADDITIONAL RISK THAT THEY MAY BE EXPOSED TO WHEN THEY HAVE THESE ISSUES. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE HOW DO WE GET PAST THE EXPOSURE VERSUS POISON CONVERSATION? IT IS WHAT IT IS. IF YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED AND IT'S A POISON, YOU'VE BEEN POISONED. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU ALL FOR SHARING YOUR AWESOME STORIES AND INSPIRING ALL OF US TO KEEP GOING IN THIS WORK. [APPLAUSE] .  THANK YOU TO THIS TREMENDOUS COMMUNITY PANEL. I THINK AS YOU GUYS PROBABLY HEARD, ANY ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS COULD HAVE FILLED THE WHOLE DAY WITH THEIR STORIES AND THE WISDOM THAT THEY BRING FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE. SO WE APOLOGIZE FOR MAKING YOU GUYS KEEP IT SO. SO AND WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION AS WE MOVE TO THE BREAKOUT GROUPS THIS AFTERNOON. PLEASE HOLD SOME OF THESE THOUGHTS IN YOUR HEAD AS WE CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE MOVE THIS WORK FORWARD COMING OUT OF TODAY. THANK YOU GUYS. I WANT TO T THANK YVONNE WHO STEPPED IN AT SHORT NOTICE TO BE PART OF THIS PANEL. SO THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] .  I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE OUR LAST SPEAKER FOR THE MORNING. AND REALLY DELIGHTED TO HAVE WITH US DR. COURTNEY KERRIGAN. SHE'S AN EXPOSURE SCIENTISTS WHOSE RESEARCH INVESTIGATING CONTAMINANTS FOOD, WATER, CONSUMER AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. IN ORDER TO PROTECT REPRECINCT AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH CAN IS THE FOCUS OF HER RESEARCH. SHE'S AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN NUTRITION AND PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY WHICH IS A MOUTH FULL AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY. SHE'S GOING TO BE TALKING WITH US TODAY ABOUT SOME REALLY EXCITING WORK THAT IS COMING OUT OF THE F E PFOS NORTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WORKING TO BUILD SOCIAL NETWORKS AMONG IMPACTED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY BEGINNING OF SOCIAL MOVEMENT. [APPLAUSE] .  JUST GIVE ME A SECOND. LET'S ALL BREATHE AND PREPARE FOR OUR INTERLUDE BEFORE LUNCH. SO THIS MORNING I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT NEW FOR ME. I USUALLY COME AND TALK ABOUTP FAS AND HEALTH EFFECTS. THIS MORNING I'M GOING TO SHARE THISTH STORY OF HOW I CAME TO HELP ORGANIZE THE CONFERENCE AT NORTHEASTERN AND HOW ITS UNIQUE STRUCTURE HELPED CREATE BADLY NEEDED MOVEMENT ON THE ISSUE OFP FAS DRINKING WATER CONTAMINATION. I FIRST STARTED IN THIS FIELD ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO. WORKING AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT AND RISK ASSESS COR. FOR TWO YEARS I LED A RESPONSE ACTION FOR A RURAL COMMUNITY WITH CONTAMINATION IN THEIR PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL WELLS. THEIR WATER CONTAINED A COMMONLY USED INDUSTRIAL SOLVENT. AT THE TIME IT WAS NOT LISTED. THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AS WELL AS A WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT IN THAT COMMUNITY. THE WRONGFUL DEATH WAS FOR A MOTHER WHO PASSED AWAY FROM KIDNEY FAILURE LEAVING BEHIND THREE CHILDREN. HER HOME HAD THE HIGH EGGS LEVELS IN THE COMMUNITY AND SHE HAD LIVED THERE HER WHOLE LIFE. I WAS UPSET WHEN I LEARNED IT TOOK 20 YEARS FROM THE TIME THE CONTAMINATION WAS DISCOVERED IN THE WATER IN THAT COMMUNITY TO THE TIME THEY TESTED THE WELLS WHICH WERE JUST DOWNSTREAM OF THE PLUME. DESPITE BEING DILIGENT TO STOP IS THE EXPOSURE ONCE THEY DID TEST FOR THOSE HOMES, NOBODY SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM WHAT IT MEANT FOR THEIR HEALTH. AND THEY HAD LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND THEY WOULD ASK ME. AND I THOUGHT THIS IS A LACK OF SCIENCE RIGHT. I LIKE SCIENCE AND I WANTED TO HELP. I ENROLLED IN A DOCTORAL PROGRAM. NOT LONG AFTER I STOPPED WORKING IN THAT COMMUNITY THE WOMAN WHO LIVED ACROSS THE STREET FROM THAT MOTHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LIVER CANCER. SHE HAD TO HAVE THREE QUARTERS OF HER LIVER REMOVED. I WAS UPSET BECAUSE AT THIS POINT IT WAS FOUR YEARS AFTER THE TIME THAT CONTAMINATION WAS DISCOVERED. I THOUGHT MAYBE IF SHE HAD RECEIVED MEDICAL MONITORING. THEY COULD HAVE CAUGHT IT SOONER AND IMPROVED HER PROGNOSIS. SO I ENTERED MY DOCTORAL PROGRAM WITH RESOLVE TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT KIND OF THING WOULDN'T CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. I WAS IN THE PROGRAM STUDYING ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIZING IN EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND I WORKED IN THE LAB OF C. TOM WEBSTER. AND HE WAS A SCIENTIST ON THE STUDY. HE STUDIED FLAME RETARDN'T. FLAME RETARDENS ARE CHEMICALS ADDED TO PRODUCTS TO HELP REDUCE THEIR FLAMMABILITY. SORRY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND MY NOTES HERE. I WAS UP AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING. THEY ARE ADDED TO PRODUCTS TO HELP REDUCE THEIR FLAMMABILITY. AT THE TIME OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT IT WAS NOT REALLY WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY CAN ESCAPE THESE PRODUCTS AND ENTER OUR BODIES AND THEY ARE BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE AT LOW DOSES. MY DISSERTATION RESEARCH FOCUSED ON CHARACTERIZING EXPOSURE TO FLAME RETARTENS INCLUDING FOR OFFICE WORKERS AND PREGNANT MOTHERS. DURING THAT TIME I DISCOVERED HIGH EXPOSURES OF FLAME RETARDENS IN GYMNAST BECAUSE THEY USE FOAM PITTS AND LANDING MT. I PUBLISHED A STUDY ON EXPOSURES IN SPRAY FOAM WORKERS. FLAME RETARDENS ARE A CLASS OF CHEMICALS WHICH ARE STRUCTURAL SIMILAR TOP BB'S. AND FLAME RETARDENS HAVE BEEN USED WIDE BILY FOR DECADES AND IN MANY PRODUCTS. FLAME RETARDENS ESCAPE THE TRUCK PRODUCTS AND ENTER OUR BODIES WHERE THEY CAN REMAIN FOR YEARS. THEY DO NOT MIGRATE IN WATER. AND SO AS FAR AS WE KNOW RIGHT NOW DRINKING WATER IS NOT AN IMPORTANT EXPOSURE PATHWAY TO PEOPLE FOR FLAME RETARDN'T. THEY ARE A EXAMPLE OF REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION. THERE WAS A LOT OF IMPRESSIVE SCIENCE GOING ON. LEADING CHEM LIST ONE OF MY MENTORS USED NON-TARGETED TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY REPLACEMENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE PROTECTED BY TRADE SECRETS SO WE COULD NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE AND WE HAD TO DO FANCY SCIENCE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS. TOOK A WHILE. THERE WERE GOOD TOXICOLOGY BUT THESE WERE COMING AFTER THEY WERE STARTING TO BE USED AND PEOPLE WERE BEING EXPOSED. WE WERE HAVING THESE FINDINGS AND WE WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT IT AND CONCERN IS BUILDING AND BUILDING. AND IT TURNED INTO FEELING LIKE A SCIENTIFIC ECOCHAMBER BECAUSE OUR SCIENCE WASN'T LEADING TO THE ACTION WE WERE EXPECT IT TO. SO THE REAL CHANGE BEGAN WHEN BLOOM CAME ON TO THE SCENE. SHE'S A CHEMIST TURNED MOUNTAIN CLIMBER WHO HELPED REMOVE FLAME RETARDN'T BACK IN THE 80'S. WHEN THEY PHASED IT OUT OF CHILDREN'S PAJAMAS SHE WAS MAD AND APPLIED HER BACKGROUND IN SCIENCE AND LEADING EXPEDITIONS TO ORGANIZE MEETINGS AND A MOVEMENT TO TRANSLATE THE SCIENCE INTO ACTION. AND REALLY THANKS TO BOTH HER AND OTHER SCIENTIFIC LEADERS LIKE HEATHER TO SHOW MANY PRODUCTS ARE NOW FLAME RETAR DENT FREE. AND IT A GOOD THING WE GOT MOVEMENT BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME SCIENCE CONTINUES TO GROW. I CONDUCTED A STUDY ALONG WITH HEATHER AND JOHN WHO IS HERE THAT IDENTIFIED ADVERSE EFFECTS OF REPLACEMENT FLAME RETARDANTS ON FERTILITY. ALSO DURING THAT TIME I WAS DOING A HORRIBLE COMMUTE TO BOSTON FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE WHICH IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO LIVE AND I SAW AN ARTICLE. ANDRIE IS A MOTHER OF CHILDREN WHO ATTENDED DAYCARE AT TRADE PORT WHICH IS A FORMER AIR FORCE BASE WHERE PFAS' WERE DETECTED IN THE DRINKING WATER. SO I REACHED OUT TO HER. WE WERE PRACTICALLY NEIGHBORS AND STARTED PROVIDING HER WITH TECHNICAL SUPPORT. I KNEW A LOT ABOUT PFAS SCIENCE BECAUSE OF MY WORK. I STARTED SHARING WITH HER THE KNOWNS AND UNKNOWNS. THERE ARE A LOCALITY OF KNOWNS. THERE ARE CLEARLY PROBLEMATIC. AN 900 PAGE REVIEW CAME OUT OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. I PROVIDED TECHNICAL SUPPORT INDIES KIM INSTANTLY TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO OUR STATE. WHEN I NOTICED QUICKLY WAS PEOPLE IN THE POSITION TO DO SOMETHING WOULDN'T ACT. WHEN I SHARED WITH ANDRIE AND SHE BROUGHT IT TO THEM, WE STARTED TO SEE MOVEMENTS. WHAT WE FOUND QUICKLY IS WORKING TOGETHER WE COULD ACHIEVE MUCH MORE THAN WE COULD ACHIEVE WORKING INDEPENDENTLY. AND IT ALSO BECAME CLEAR TO ME WHY COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT FOCUS OF MY TRAINING. THEY TALKED A LOT ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE VERY TRUE. THAT WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES HELPS IMPROVE YOUR LOGISTICS AND THE QUALITY OF YOUR SCIENCE. IT'S APPLICABILITY AND TRANSLATION TO ACTION. WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS IN SOME CASES IT NECESSARY TO GET ANYWHERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE HERE. ALSO A BIG EMPHASIS IN MING WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF LISTENING TO AND BELIEVING COMMUNITIES WHICH IS NOT UNLIKE RECENT ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BELIEVING WOMEN AND SURVIVORS. SO ANDRIE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE IN ORDER TO BE MORE EFFICIENT ADVOCATE AND SHE FORMED TESTING FOR PFAS AND ORGANIZED FOR TESTING OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT CAME BACK WITH IMPORTANT RESULTS. IT REVEALED PFHSX IS A MARKER. IT WAS CLEARLY ELEVATED IN THE POPULATION. THE AVERAGE IS AT THE BOTTOM AND BLUE THAT'S LIKE OUR GENERAL POPULATION. AT TOP ARE OTHER IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. IT ALSO SHOWED THAT IT WAS ELEVATED IN THE CHILDREN. EVERYONE THIS IS JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE CHILDREN DATA. ABOUT 40% WERE ABOVE THE 95 PERCENTILE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. IT TOLD THIS STORY IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONCENTRATIONS BY AGE YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU SEE AN INCREASE FROM 0-2 WHICH WHEN CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN ON PIECE AND DAY CARRY AND WHEN THEY WOULD BE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OFF THE TRADE PORT. THEN ONCE THE POPULATION HIT WORKING AGE YOU CAN SEE THE LEVELS INCREASE AGAIN. AND SO REQUIREMENT FOR BEING IN THE STUDY WAS YOU HAD TO EVER HAVE DRANK THE WATER. THE CHIRP THAT WERE SAMPLED WHERE YOU SEE LEVELS DECREASE REFLECT THE TIME AWAY FROM DRINKING THAT WATER. YOU CAN SEE A MARKER OF THE EFFECT OF DRINKING THAT WATER AND YOU CAN SEE DOWN AT THE BOTTOM F E PFNA WHICH IS NOT A BIG PART OF THEIR EXPOSURE. YOU DON'T SEE THAT INCREASE AND DROP AN INCREASE AGAIN. AROUND THIS TIME THE EPS CAME OUT AND IT WAS NOT REGULATORY. A LOT OF US WERE HAPPY TO SEE ANYTHING. BOB BROUGHT THE NEED TO HELP HIS ADMINISTRATION BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE. WE PUT TOGETHER A STUDY AT HARVARD THAT TO THE QUANTIFY NUMBER OF PEOPLE IMPACTED BY DRINKING WATER ABOVE THE HEALTH ADVISORY. THE 6 MILLION WAS AN UNDERESTIMATE. THIS IS SHOWING PEOPLE WITH LEVELS ABOVE 70 PARTS PER TRILLION. AND THERE IS BETTER DATA AND IT'S BEEN ZEST MATED OVER 110 AMERICANS CONTAINED PFAS. ANOTHER THING THAT WE DID WAS ORGANIZE THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE SOCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY OF PFAS. THIS IT WAS FIRST CONFERENCE AT NORTHEASTERN. I WAS INVIOLATED ALONG FOR THE RIDE. IT WAS THE BRAIN CHILD OF PHIL. I DIDN'T GET UP SPEAK A SCIENTISTS. I KEPT GOING WE NEED MORE SCIENTISTS TO TALK AND WE NEED TO HAMMER THEM WITH THE SCIENCE. IT WAS NOT UNTIL WE HAD THE FIRST CONFERENCE AND I SAW HOW IT WENT AND I LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE POWER AND IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING TOGETHER THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS. SO WE BROUGHT TOGETHER COMMUNITY LEADERS. WE USED MOST OF THE GRANT MONEY WE GOT TO PUT TOGETHER THE CONFERENCE TO FUND COMMUNITY LEADERS TO COME. WE BROUGHT TOGETHER GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS AND LAWYERS, LEGISLATORS, PRESS, ALL PEOPLE WHO WORK ON PFAS BUT NORMALLY AREN'T IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER AND DON'T HEAR EACH OTHER'S STORIES. THAT FIRST CONFERENCE I LEARNED MORE AND FOUND IT TO BE MORE ENGAGING THAN ANY CONFERENCE I'VE BEEN TOM I MOSTLY GO TO SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCES. BUT IT WAS IMPACTFUL TO ME. I THINK I HAD NOT ANTICIPATED THAT. THE SECOND TIME WE HELD IT WHICH WAS JUST LAST YEAR, WE INTEGRATED. WE HAD COMMUNITY PANELS. THE SECOND TIME WE INTEGRATED OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND DIFFERENT SECTORS ALL INTO SESSIONS TOGETHER SO THAT THEY WOULD WORK TOGETHER. AND THAT ALSO WORKED REALLY WELL. WE HAD A HUGE TURNOUT. WE HAD TO PUT PEOPLE IN OTHER ROOMS TO VIEW REMOTELY BUT COULD BE ON SITE. THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE GROUP THAT ATTENDED THAT. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE , THE ORGANIZATION OF THEP FAS COALITION. SINCE THE FIRST CONFERENCE THEY ARE DOING A BIO MONITORING HEALTH STUDY FOR SITES THAT HAVE PFAS IN THEIR BRINING WATER. I HAVE A PROJECT NOW ALONG WITH MY COLLABORATORS AT NORTHEASTERN LOOKING AT THE EFFECT OF PFAS ON CHILDREN'S IMMUNE SYSTEM. WE KNOW THEY AFFECT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THEY EFFECT IMMUNE SYSTEMS OF CHILDREN EXPOSED THROUGH CONTAMINATED WATER. PEOPLE CALL THE MICKURE A WITCH'S BREW BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SO MANY PFASES AND MANY OF THEM HAVEN'T BEEN STUDIED. THAT MIXTURE IS PART OF OUR QUESTION. WE DEVELOPED THE PFAS EXCHANGE IS CHILL FACTORS SAN ONLINE RESOURCE CENTER. COME CHECK OUT THE POSTINGERS IN THE NEXT ROOM. PFAS EXCHANGE.ORG IS THE WEBSITE. IT HAS USEFUL RESOURCES INCLUDING A DATA INTERPRETATION TOOL IS COMING. THERE IS ALSO CONNECTING COMMUNITIES COMPONENT SO IT LIST DIFFERENT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP YOU CONNECT WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES. WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT LATER. THIS IS WHERE I FELL ASLEEP. I MENTIONED 110 MILLION AMERICANS WITH IMPACTED WATER. THIS IS A MAP FROM EWG AND NORTHEASTERN GROUP THAT IS JUST TRYING TO VISUALIZE THE CONTAMINATION THAT'S BEEN FOUND. WE'VE SEEN EXPLOSION IN DISCOVERY OF CONTAMINATED SITES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. MICHIGAN IS LOOKING. HAS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSIVE MONITORING PROGRAMS OF ANY STATE IN THE U.S. THEY MONITOR OVER 2,000 PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE 80% OF STATE RESIDENTS. 170 ELEVATED LEVELS. 51 OF THOSE SO 3% WERE BETWEEN 10 AND 70 PART PER TRILLION. ONLY ONE OR TWO WAS ABOVE 70 PARTS PER TRILLION. PARCHMENT IS KIND OF DOWN ON THE BOTTOM LEFT. ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES BY KALAMAZOO. IT'S FROM HISTORIC USE OF PFAS IN A PAPER MILL. WE KNOW THAT PFASES HAVE BEEN USED IN TANNERY OPERATIONS. OBVIOUSLY IN AIRPORTS THAT USE AFFF. AND IN PLATING OPERATIONS. SO JUST TO NAME A FEW SOURCES IN THE STATE. AND I THINK SINCE I'VE GOT ON THE MICHIGAN I'VE FOCUSED MOST OF MY EFFORTS ON THREE PFAS IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE CONTAMINATION DISCOVERED HAVE DRINKING WATER INTERVENTIONS. VARIOUS DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE. IT'S PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS EXPENSIVE. THEY HAVE DO NOT EAT ADVISORIES, DON'T EAT THE FISH. DON'T EAT HOME GROWN AND PRODUCED FOODS. NOT TO EAT OR TOUCH THE FOAM. WE HAVE A POSTER ON THAT. WHICH I'M IN COLLABORATION WITH JENNIFER FIELD'S GROUP. RECENTLY STARTED A PROJECT CALLED PFAS UNITED WHICH IS A NATIONAL INVESTIGATION OF TRANSPORT AND EXPOSURE FROM DRINKING WATER AND DIET. THIS IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN MYSELF, CHRIS HIGGINS, JOHN, OWEN AND JANE AT NC STATE. AND SO WE ARE SAMPLING FOODS FROM PFAS IMPACTED AREAS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ESTIMATING EXPOSE YOUR FROM DRINKING WATER AND DIET TO INFORM FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS. WE'RE KICK OFF OUR FIELD EFFORT I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO CALL IT. WE NEED A GOOD NAME. WE ARE ENROLLING PARTICIPANTS FROM PARLIAMENT STARTING THIS SPRING. I'VE STARTED ORGANIZED AN EVENT AT THE EARTH SYMPOSIUM AT *SU. THIS YEAR IT'S KIND OF A DUAL SESSION FOLLOWED BY AN AFTERNOON WORKSHOP FOCUSED ON PFAS AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY GET TOGETHER AND ORGANIZE OURSELVES TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO BAR DRESS THE PFAS CONTAMINATION IN MICHIGAN. MSU LAUNCHED A PFAS CENTER SO WE'LL HAVE RESEARCHERS FROM THE CENTER AS WELL. YOU ARE ALL INVITED. I THINK I'M ABOUT OUT OF TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'LL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. [APPLAUSE] .  WE WH HAVE JUST A MOMENT FOR QUESTIONS. [INAUDIBLE] .  SO THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE AND WHETHER THERE IS ANY CONVERSATION IN OUR GOVERNMENT OR OUR UNIVERSITIES ABOUT ANY COMPANIES TO PROVE THAT SOMETHING IS SAFE BEFORE IT GOES ON THE MARKET. I'M SORRY I'M NOT A POLICY PERSON. I ALWAYS GET THESE QUESTIONS AND I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT THE BEST PERSON TO ANSWER THEM BUT I WILL TRY. I BELIEVE THAT TASKA REFORM WAS SUPPOSED TO CREEP TOWARDS THAT. SO THE EU IS IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE'RE ALL WATCHING. DO YOU WANT TO TAKE IT?  I'M NOT A POLICY PERSON. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IN OUR COUNTRY PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLES TOTALLY INTERPRETED BACKWARDS. IN OUR COUNTRY PEOPLE SAY PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE WOULD MEAN YOU ACT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE SAYS. THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE SAYS YOU ACT IN THE PRESENCE OF CONCERNING INFORMATION BUT WITHOUT CERTAINTY. AND SCIENCE IS NEVER CERTAIN. AND FRANK IS PROBABLY TURNING OVER IN HIS GRAVE.  THANK YOU COURTNEY.  THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] .  WE ARE GOING TO BREAK FOR LUNCH. DURING THE LUNCH WE'RE HAVING WHAT WE'RE CALLING A STROLLING LUNCH WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE FOOD SET UP IN THE ROOM ACROSS THE WAY HERE AND IT'S ALSO WHERE THE POSTERS ARE SET UP. SO PLEASE GO OVER THERE. LOOK AT THE POSTERS. CATCH PEOPLE THAT HAVE SPOKEN DURING THE MORNING THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE A FOLLOWUP CONVERSATION WITH. IN PARTICULAR I UNDERSTAND THAT DR. BARM SOME IS GOING TO BE LEAVING MICHIGAN EARLY TO BEAT THE WEATHER IN NORTH CAROLINA. SO SHE'S GOING TO BE LEAVING SHORTLY AFTER LUNCH. SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HER NOW IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY. TWO QUICK THINGS BEFORE FOLKS HEAD OUT. I MENTIONED EARLIER AND I'M GOING TO REITERATE, THIS AFTERNOON WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO BREAKOUT GROUPS TO WORK ON SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATED TO ACTION MOVING FORWARD. WE'VE PREIDENTIFIED A SET OF FIVE OF THOSE. THEY ARE IN YOUR PROGRAM. THERE IS NEWSPRINT BY THE REGISTRATION TABLE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE AS YOU LISTENED THIS MORNING HAVE ADDITIONAL IDEAS ABOUT THINGS YOU WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT. PLEASE GET THOSE UP THERE DURING THE BREAK IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT THAT. WE WILL BE MOVING INTO THE BREAKOUT GROUPS AFTER LUNCH AFTER WE HEAR FROM MONICA LEWIS PATRICK. MONICA, ARE YOU HERE? ALSO KNOWN AS THE WATER WARRIOR. SHE IS NOT TO BE MISSED. PLEASE GET BACK FROM LUNCH TO HEAR HER. WE ARE GOING TO REQUEEN AT 1:05. WE ARE GOING TO SHORTEN THE LUNCH BREAK TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME. WE APOLOGIZE FOR DOING THAT BUT WE WANT PEOPLE THE GET OUT OF HERE ON TIME. HAVE A GREAT BREAK.  WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED. IF YOU COULD FIND YOUR SEATS.  OK WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED. WE REALIZE IT WAS A SHORT LUNCH BREAK AND REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE SPEED EATING THAT WENT ON.  WELCOME BACK FROM LUNCH. AND THE VERY SHORT BREAK THAT WE HAD TODAY. SORRY ABOUT THAT. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP MOVING. IN PART BECAUSE ONE OF OUR NEXT SPEAKERS HAS TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER SHE'S SCHEDULED TO FLY OFF THE HOWARD UNIVERSITY FOR ANOTHER WATER CONFERENCE WHICH WE'RE DELIGHTED SHE SQUEEZED US IN TO HER SCHEDULE. WE WANT TO RESPECT THAT AND KEEP OURSELVES ON SCHEDULE TODAY. I'M REALLY, REALLY DELIGHTED TO INTRODUCE OUR NEXT SPEAKER. MONICA LEWIS PATRICK ALSO KNOWN AS THE WATER WARRIOR. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT HER. SHE IS COFOUNDER AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF WE THE PEOPLE OF DETROIT. A COMMUNITY COALITION THAT HAS BEEN WORKING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS TO CONDUCT COMMUNITY DRIVEN RESEARCH ON ISSUES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMUNITY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL RESEARCH EVIDENCE. THE ORGANIZATION WORKS TO INFORM AND EMPOWER THE PUBLIC ON CRITICAL ISSUES RELATED TO CIVIL RIGHTS, LAND, WATER AND ALSO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. WE ARE SO DELIGHTED TO HAVE HER HERE TODAY. SHE'S GOING TO BE COPRESENTING WITH ONE OF HER COLLEAGUES NADIA. A MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST WHO IS ALSO IN TRAINING TO BECOME AN ALLO PATHIC DOCTOR. SO MONICA CALLS HER DOCTOR DOCTOR. YOU GUYS ARE ALL IN FOR A REAL TREAT AS THEY TALK. THEY ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT MAPPING THE WATER CRISIS.  THANK YOU SO MUCH. COULD WE GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO AMY AND AN AMAZING JOB THAT'S BEEN DONE? [APPLAUSE] .  I CAN TELL YOU LAST NIGHT I LEFT AND I WAS IT WAS REALLY HEARTBREAKING TO JUST HEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING. IS TONI IN THE ROOM? ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO I HAD NEVER HEARD OF PFAS, NEVER HEARD THE PHRASE OR TERMINOLOGY. TONI AND I WERE IN A ROOM AT THE ALL ABOUT WATER CONFERENCE. I WAS THERE MAD AS HELL BECAUSE THEY WERE SHUTTING OFF WATER IN DETROIT. THEN TONI WAS TELLING ME WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND I GOT MAD ABOUT THAT. AS WE SAT IN CONFERENCES AND LECTURES THERE WAS A KINSHIP THAT HAPPENED. I SAID I WON'T EVER WORK ON WATER AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE I CAN'T BRING YOU TO THE TABLE. I'LL MIKE MAKE SURE EVERY TIME I CAN RAISE YOUR NAME I'LL LIFT IT. ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN SAY ABOUT TONI IS THAT EVERY TIME -- I'VE HEARD THE THEME THROUGHOUT THE DAY, ESPECIALLY FROM THE LAST PANEL IS THAT COMMUNITY IS THE EXPERT. COMMUNITY IS THE EXPERT. THAT IS MY FRIEND. I KNOW AIM AS TONI THE TIGER. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND OUT VERY QUICKLY IS THAT PEOPLE IGNORE COMMUNITY. THEY TREAT US AS THOUGH YOU ARE A CASUALTY OF A WAR. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND OUT IN DETROIT BECAUSE OUR ORGANIZATION IS YOUNG. I'M OLD BUT THE ORGANIZATION IS YOUNG. THE ORGANIZATION IS TEN YEARS OLD. IT'S ONLY BEEN A NONPROFIT FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS. BUT THE WORK WE'VE DONE HAS BEEN MONUMENTAL N.2014 WHEN AN AMAZING ACTIVIST BY THE NAME OF CHARITY HICKS BEGAN TO TELL US WE WERE GOING TO EXPERIENCE THE SHUTTING OFF OF WATER TO THE NAG ANY TUESDAY THAT HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND WE THOUGHT OK CHARITY IS BRILLIANT. MAYBE IT'S A MOMENT WHERE WE JUST DON'T GET IT. THEN AS DAYS AND MONTHS AND WEEKS WENT ON WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT CHARITY SET OFF AN ALARM AND WHAT THANKSGIVING WHEN WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF WAS A WATER WAR. WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN AS THERE HAD BEEN A MASTER NARRATIVE ACROSS MICHIGAN THAT SHUTTING OFF WATER WAS BECAUSE BLACK FOLKS DIDN'T PAY THEIR BILLS, IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP. NOT KNOWING HOW TO LEAD YOURSELF. NOT PREPARED TO GOVERN. SOME OF THE SAME THINGS I HEARD THIS MORNING. THE OTHER THING WE KNEW IS PEOPLE WERE GETTING SICKER AND SICKER. WHAT WE ALSO KNEW IS PEOPLE WERE LOSING THEIR CHILDREN. AND SO WHEN WE GOT A CALL SAYING THAT CHARITY HICKS HAD BEEN ARRESTED FOR JUST TRYING TO LET HER NEIGHBORS KNOW THAT THEY HAD BEEN SHUT OFF FROM WATER, I'VE GOT A GRANDMOTHER THAT IS SOUTHERN AND YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS PHRASE FROM THE NORTH. SHE SAID THINGS LIKE THAT STICK IN MY CRAWL. THAT'S WHAT IT DID FOR ME. I COULDN'T SLEEP. I COULDN'T EAT. JUST THE THOUGHT THAT ONE OF HER NEIGHBORS HAD JUST HAD A BABY THAT WAS PREMATURE AND THAT WOMAN WAS IN THREAT OF LOSING THAT BABY BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE RUNNING WATER IN HER HOUSE. THAT BECAME PERSONAL. SO AS WE BEGAN TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AROUND WATER SHUTOFFS, ONE WAS HOW DO WE ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT EVERY HUMAN LIFE SHOULD HAVE A PATHWAY TO CLEAN, SAFE AND AFFORDABLE WATER. BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD DECIDED THAT POOR FOLKS AND BLACK FOLKS DIDN'T DESERVE THAT SAME RIGHT. HOW DO WE EVIDENCE TO PEOPLE THE IMBALANCE AND THE INEQUITY AND THE INJUSTICE OF DENYING PEOPLE ACCESS TO CLEAN, SAFE, AFFORDABLE WATER? WHAT I KNOW IS THAT SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WON'T BELIEVE THE ACTIVIST, THEY MIGHT BELIEVE THE ACADEMICS. SO THERE WERE PEOPLE LIKE DR. NADIA GABEER AND EMILY WHO SAN ARCHITECT AND DESIGNER. SHE'S DOING A FELLOWSHIP AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BUFFALO THAT CAME INTO THE COMMUNITY JUST TO HELP US DELIVER WATER BECAUSE WE WERE TOLD AT THIS TIME WE WOULD ONLY NEED TO DELIVER WATER FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS. THERE WAS NO WAY OUR GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT RESPOND TO OUR CRISIS. THAT THREE WEEKS HAS TURNED INTO SIX YEARS. WE DELIVER ABOUT 150 TO 250-TONS OF WATER A YEAR. WE NOT ONLY DELIVER WATER IN DETROIT BUT WE DELIVER WATER IN FLINT. BEFORE FLINT BECAME A BUZZ WORD FOR MANY OF YOU, WE WERE WORKING IN FLINT TWO YEARS BEFORE MOST PEOPLE WOULD ADMIT THAT THIS CRISIS HAD OCCURRED. WE HAD BEEN DELIVERING WATER IN FLINT NOW INNER THREE YEARS. AND WE'RE STILL DELIVERING WATER BECAUSE OF FAILED LEADERSHIP BY GOVERNMENT, BY MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH WORKER, BY PERSONS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THAT WHAT IS COMING OUT OF YOUR TAP IS CLEAN AND SAFE. THEY FAILED. AND SO EVEN TO THIS DAY PEOPLE ARE PURCHASING BOTTLED WATER IN PLACE OF WATER RUNNING OUT OF THEIR TAP BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST IT. AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE SUPPORTING THE COMMODIFICATION OF BOTTLED WATER WHICH IS LENDING ITSELF TO THE PRIVATIZATION OF WATER. DOES HA MAKE SENSE TO YOU? IT DOESN'T TO ME. I'M JUST A COUNTRY GIRL. THIS IS NOT MY VOCATION. I DIDN'T CHOOSE WATER. WATER CHOSE ME. AND SO WHAT I KNOW BECAUSE MY NAME IS MONICA LEWIS PATRICK. WHEN I FIND A GOOD FIGHT, I GET IN IT. WE STARTED SOMETHING CALLED THE WE THE PEOPLE OF DETROIT COMMUNITY RESEARCH COLLECTIVE. TWO THINGS HAPPENED. ONE WE HAD FOUND OUT IN MICHIGAN UNDER EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT THAT IF WE PARTNERED WITH A UNIVERSITY THAT GOVERNOR SNIDER COULD USE HIS POWERS TO ACTION. RESEARCH FREERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT CONVENE WITH WE THE PEOPLE OF DETROIT ON SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED WITH AN ACADEMIC AND SCIENTIFIC LENS. THIS IS WHY THE TABLE HAS BEEN CREATED. GUESS WHO RUNS THE TABLE. NOT ACADEMICS, THE COMMUNITY. THE PEOPLE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO SAY AS WE'RE MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE IS THAT WHEN WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE AND CONTINUE TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS HEALTH CRISIS, WE COULD NOT GET ONE HEALTH DIRECT DIRECTOR OR SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO RESPOND TO THE FACT THAT IT IS ANNUAL EGREGIOUS ACT TO DENY PEOPLE ACCESS TO WATER AND THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO WATER. BUT DIDN'T YOU THINK IT WAS INTERESTING THAT NOT ONE UNIVERSITY, NOT ONE ACADEMIC IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN WOULD SPEAK UP FOR DETROIT? AND SO STUDENTS, YOUR STUDENTS HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN DECIDED THAT IT WAS EGREGIOUS. AND SO THEY BEGAN TO GO TO THEIR PROFESSORS AAS THEY WERE COMING AND VOLUNTEERING AND DELIVERING WATER WITH US AND SAID I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO GO TO A SCHOOL THAT HAS THE ONLY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN BUT WON'T SPEAK TO WATER SHUTOFF. IT'S BEEN ON THESE GROUND YOUR STUDENTS OVER 3,000 OF THEM ORGANIZED THEMSELVES TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH IMPACTS CONNECTED TO FOSSIL FUELS, CONNECTED TO WATER SHUTOFFS. SO EVEN SOMETIMES WHEN WE AS ADULTS HAVE NOT GOTTEN IT, OUR BABY VERSUS GOTTEN IT. THANK GOD FOR THE STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN BECAUSE THEY STOOD WHEN THE AM DEM I CAN AND THE UNIVERSITIES DID NOT. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO TELL YOU OFF THE RIFF. I WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO MICHIGAN STATE. DR. ELIZABETH MACK SAID THAT WE'RE RIGHT NOW SITTING IN ABOUT 11.9% OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION CAN'T AFFORD THEIR WATER. THIS RESEARCH WAS DONE ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO. WE ARE ON PACE IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS WHERE ABOUT 35.6% OF THE NATION WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR WATER. THIS IS NOT JUST BLACK FOLKS AND PEOPLE IN DETROIT. BUT THIS IS PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE NEXT ONE PLEASE. THE OTHER THING I NEED TO YOU KNOW IS THIS IS NOT DIVIDED ALONG POLITICAL LINES. WHAT WE HAVE FOUND ACROSS THE COUNTRY IF YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE CHICAGO. CHICAGO'S WATER RACE HAVE TRIPLED IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. TOLEDO HAVE DOUBLED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. IN DETROIT WATER RATES HAVE GONE UP OVER 120% IN THE LAST 12 YEARS. FOR COMMUNITIES THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THE POPULATION DWINDLE. WHERE YOU HAVE SEEN THE TAX BASE DWINDLE, THIS IS NOT THE PEOPLE'S FAULT. BUT IT BETTER BE THE PEOPLE'S FIGHT. WHAT WE CAME TOGETHER AND THIS IS DR. GLORIA HOUSE. SHE'S RETIRED FROM THIS INSTITUTION. ONE OF THE THINGS SHE TOLD US, SHE SAID NOBODY IS COMING TO SAVE US. NOBODY IS COMING TO SAVE US. SHE ENCOURAGED US ALONG WITH THE HONORABLE COUNCIL WOMAN WATSON. SHE SAID WE'RE THE MOTHERS AFTER ALL CIVILIZATION. WE HAVE TO LOVE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN ENOUGH TO TELL THE TRUTH. WHAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU TO DO IS ALL OF YOU HAVE BEEN TOUTINGS TUITIONS AND ACADEMY. YOU 58-HAVE ADVANCED DEGREES. CONVENE YOURSELF. THIS IS HOW THE COLLECTIVE STARTED. THE FIRST QUESTION THE COMMUNITY HAD IS ARE WATER SHUTOFFS REALLY HAPPENING? THIS RESEARCH ONLY A SMALL SEGMENT OF THE RESEARCH BECAUSE WE HAD TO SUE THE CITY OF DETROIT EIGHT TIMES TO GET EVEN THIS INFORMATION. NOW THIS IS DATA THAT USED TO BE READILY AVAILABLE AND MAILED TO YOUR HOUSES. WONDER WHAT HAS CHANGED? WE'RE MORE COMPUTERIZED BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ME THE SAME INFORMATION YOU USED TO MAIL TO MY HOUSE ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHUT OFF FROM WATER. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS MAP, YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE LOWER HALF IS RIVER FRONT PROPERTY AND DOWNTOWN. TWO OTHER SMALL CITIES. THE REST OF IT IS THE CITY OF DETROIT. NOW THEY WOULD LEAD TO YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S JUST POOR FOLKS. GUESS WHAT, EAST ENGLISH VILLAGE IS ONE OF THE MOST AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES. 30% OF THAT POPULATION WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD CAN'T SUSTAIN THEIR WATER ACCESS. DOES IT SOUND LIKE POOR PEOPLE NOT PAYING THEIR BILLS OR DOES IT SOUND LIKE THERE IS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE THAT IS CAUSING PEOPLE TO NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR BILLS? THE NEXT ONE PLEASE. THE OTHER THING AWE WANTED TO REMIND PEOPLE AS WE WERE UNDER THIS BANKRUPTCY THAT WAS DECONSTRUCTING OUR WATER DEPARTMENT, WE WANTED TO REMIND MICHIGAN WHO BUILT IT. WHO PAID FOR IT. AND SO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING HERE IS THAT YOU ARE SEEING THE MASSIVENESS OF THAT WATER SYSTEM. ONE OF THE THINGS I'LL SAY AND I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH -- WE'RE IN A RUSH TO BE ABLE TO PUSH THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY THE REGIONALIZATION OF A WATER SYSTEM AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PAY FAIR MARKET VALUE IT. THIS IS HOW YOU GOT HERE. WHAT YOU HAVE THAT IS THE CITY OF DETROIT. THIS SYSTEM RUNS ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP OF THE T WHICH IS FLINT. WE PROVIDE WATER TO 126 MUNICIPALITIES AND TOWNSHIPS. 40% OF THE STATE OF MICHIGAN GETS THEIR WATER FROM A WELL THAT THE RESIDENT OF DETROIT BUILT. IN 1955 THE WATER DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR AT THAT TIME SAID THAT IF WE ARE FORCED TO BUILD THIS SYSTEM OUT TO THE SUBURBS THAT THE CITY OF DETROIT WILL GO BANKRUPT. WE WERE LEGISLATED TO DO SO BECAUSE WE WERE THE ONLY CITY WITH THE BONDING CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE WERE CUTTING OFF OUR NOSE TO SPITE OUR FACE. WE WERE HEADED DOWN A PATHWAY WHERE THE ACTUAL RATE PAYERS WERE GOING TO BE PAYING WHOLESALE AND THE OWNERS WOULD BE PAYING RETAIL. SO WE PUT TOGETHER THIS AND IT WAS CRITICAL FOR US TO DEMONSTRATE AND VISUALIZE AS MUCH AS WE COULD BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A VERY DEVICIVE APPROACH TO HOW PEOPLE TALK ABOUT DETROIT VERSUS EVERYTHING ELSE. DETROIT AND THE REST OF THE STATE. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE IS THE DISCREPANCIES IN TERMS OF THE WHOLESALE RATES VERSUS RETAIL. THAT DEEP TURQUOISE BLUE WHAT DETROIT SELLS THE WATER TO THE MUNICIPALITIES THAT THE LEVEL. WHERE YOU SEE THE BLACK MARKING IS THE MARKUPS. THOSE MUNICIPALITIES AND TOWNSHIPS ARE MARKING THEIR WATER UP ANYWHERE FROM 100 TO 1,000%. GUESS WHAT THE NARRATIVE IS. WELL WE'RE PAYING FOR DETROIT'S BANKRUPTCY. WE'RE PAYING FOR FAILED LEADERSHIP. GUESS WHAT THAT DOES, THIS IS SOME OF THE CONVERSATION THAT TONI AND I HAD. IF WE DON'T PUT THE FACTS ON THE TABLE AND IF WE DON'T HAVE A CONVERSATION WHERE WE'RE BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER, THEN IT BECOMES EASY FOR OTHER PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STATE TO JUST DECIDE TO WASH THEIR HAND OF US AND TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT POLICIES THAT ARE BAD FOR US. IF WE GET IN ROOMS LIKE THIS AND BEGIN TO DEPUTIZE OURSELVES TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S ONLY AS MICHIGANERS OPERATING IN CONCERT AN CONSENSUS WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A BETTER MICHIGAN WHERE WATER IS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL. [APPLAUSE] I'M GOING TO JUMP OFF AND HAND THE MIC TO NADIA BECAUSE I WANT HER TO BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE HEALTH STUDY WORK WE'VE DONE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU SEE THESE TWO SLIDES HERE. ONE WE HAD OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE IS NOT ONLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN TERMS OF THE HEIGHT OF THE WATER SHUTOFF IN DETROIT. BUT THEY WANTED TO SHOW THE PARALLELS BETWEEN WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN FLINT AT THE SAME TIME. WHAT I THOUGHT WAS SO MAGICAL BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE GET SO STUCK IN THE TRAUMA AND THE FIGHT THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO SEE WHERE WE WERE WINNING. WHERE OUR WORK AND COORDINATION OF WORK WAS MAKING IMPACT. WHERE YOU SEE THEM BEGIN TO STEP BACK AS WE STUPID INFORMS MOMENTS WHERE THE CITY COUNCIL AND KEVIN CAME. WHERE COMMUNITIES SHIPPED AND RESISTED THAT. THEY BEGAN TO SOFTEN. THEY BEGAN TO PUT A MORATORIUM ON SHUTTING OFF WATER. AS KEVIN GOT CLOSER TO THE BANKRUPTCY HE RAMPED UP SHUTTING OFF WATER AGAIN. WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE COMMUNITY GOT TOGETHER AND THEY BROUGHT IN ACTIVISTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THEY BROUGHT IN THE NATIONAL NURSES UNION, NET GROUPS GOT INVOLVED. YOU SAW THE MOMENTUM BEGIN TO SHIFT AROUND THE CONVERSATION. SO THE CONVERSATION DIDN'T STAY AT POOR BLACK FOLKS DON'T WANT TO PAY THEIR BILLS. AS MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE CAME TO THE FOREFRONT THEY HAD TO SHIFT. SO THEN THE CONVERSATION BEGAN AROUND OK WE CAN'T GIVE YOU AFFORDABILITY BUT WE'LL GIVE YOU ASSISTANCE. WHAT WE KNOW AS ASSIST SEASONS CHARITY. IF I WANT TO HELP YOU I WILL, IF I HAVE A FEW DOLLARS I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. WHAT AFFORDABILITY SAYS IS I WILL CREATE A SUSTAINED PATHWAY TO ENSURE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO WATER. THAT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT. AND THEN THIS IS THE LAST ONE THAT I'LL END WITH IS THAT THIS IS THE ONE THAT BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES. BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE SOLD DURING THE GREAT HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY WAS THAT YOU COULD GET A CHICKEN IN EVERY POT, AS LONG AS YOU WORKED HARD YOU'D BE ABLE TO SEND YOUR CHILDREN TO COLLEGE, YOU'D BE ABLE TO MEET YOUR MORTGAGE AND PAY FOR YOUR HOUSE AND HEALTHCARE. MY GRANDPARENTS MOVED TO DETROIT IN 152. ONE OF THE THINGS WE TOOK A LOT OF PRIDE IN COMING TO DETROIT THOSE SUMMERS 13 GRANDKIDS THAT WAS COMING TO DETROIT WAS REALLY WHERE OUR FAMILY WAS ABLE TO GET A LEG UP. THEY WERE ABLE TO WORK IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY COMING OUT OF THE COALMINES OF VIRGINIA AND SO MY GRANDFATHER HAD 52 WAS HAVING 18 CHILDREN NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD OWN A HOME. SO FOR HIM LATER ON IN 67 TO BUY A HOME WAS LIKE HE HAD HIT THE LOTTERY. TO THEN TURN AROUND AND SEE IN 2014 YOU SAW OVER 15,000 HOMEOWNERS FORCED TO FORECLOSURE JUST ON WATER DEBT. THEY DIDN'T OH PROPERTY TAXES. BUT THEY COULDN'T AFFORD THEIR WATER BECAUSE THEY WERE ON A FIXED INCOME. AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THIS AND YOU LOOK AT IT AND COMPARE IT TO THE FIRST MAP WE SHOWED YOU ABOUT WATER SHUTOFFS, DO YOU SERRULATION? DO YOU SERRULATION? YOU VISUALLY SEE CORRELATION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO REMIND YOU SITS NOT JUST ABOUT ONE THING, IT'S ABOUT EVERYTHING. THAT THIS IS ESSENTIAL IN TERMS OF DISPLACING BLACK FAMILIES. IT'S BEEN CRITICAL IN TERMS OF SHUTTING DOWN SCHOOLS. IT HAS BEEN A COMPONENT OF PUTTING A DIVISION IN OUR COMMUNITY WHERE THERE ARE TWO DETROITS, THERE IS DOWNTOWN AND MIDTOWN AND THEN THERE IS THE REST OF EVERYBODY THAT IS AROUND TOWN. AND SO THIS IS SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT CAME TOGETHER. NADIA LED A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS OVER 40 RESEARCHERS CAME TOGETHER TO DO THE MAPPING , THE WATER CRISIS BOOK TO PUT DIGITAL EVIDENCE TO WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW WAS HAPPENING. [APPLAUSE] .  THAT IS AN IMPOSSIBLE ACT TO FOLLOW. I DO WANT TO THANK MONICA FOR INVITING ME AND PASSING THE MIC ALONG. IT'S PART OF THE PRACTICE AND WHAT I'VE LEARNED THROUGH DOING THIS TYPE OF WORK IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BUILD THESE PARTNERSHIPS IN A COMMUNITY RESEARCH COLLECTIVE THAT HAVE ALSO REALLY JUST STRENGTHENED THEAVES IN BRINGING OUR COLLECTIVE TALENTS TO THE TABLE. WHAT OUR GROUP HAS BEEN DOING IS BRINGING TOGETHER ACTIVIST, ACADEMICS, RESEARCHERS, DESIGNERS TO TRY AND DRAW ON THE EXPERTISE THAT WE LEARN WHEN WE ARE IN SCHOOL, ARE IN THE ACADEMY, INSTITUTIONS LIKE THIS. I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT WHEN WE DID THIS WORK. ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DRAW ON THE EXPERTISE OF PEOPLE WITH LIFT EXPERIENCE WHO RECOLLECTS ARE REALLY BEST ABLE TO POSE THAT'S WE SHOULD BE INVESTIGATING AND FOR WHOM THE DATA IS CREATED WITH IN THIS MODEL AND BELONGS TO. IT WAS IMPORTANT THIS DESIGNING AND SETTING UP THESE STUDIES. WE REALIZED, I DIDN'T PERSONALLY COME TO DO PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH. I'M ANTHROPOLOGIST. BUT IN WRITING ABOUT THE CULTURAL, SOCIAL, POLITICAL CHANGES THAT HAVE CREATED THESE CONDITIONS, IT IS REALLY HARD TO NOT HAVE ANY PRELIMINARY DATA. TO NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE A BASE LINE PICTURE OF WHAT IS GOING ON. WHEN I GOT HERE IT BECAME CLEAR NOBODY WAS DOING THAT RESEARCH. NOBODY WAS FOLLOWING UP. WE REALIZED QUICKLY IF WE DIDN'T ORGANIZE TO DO SOMETHING AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TOOLS WERE AT HAND, TRAIN OURSELVES, GO OUT THERE AND DO THE WORK, IT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THIS WAS ONE STUDY WE DID IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEMS WHO ARE ABLE TO GET INTERNAL DATA FROM THEIR HOSPITAL RECORD AND LOOK AT FOLKS WHO HAD COME IN BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A WATER RELATED ILLNESS. WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE THAT DATA WHICH MONICA MENTIONED WAS GOTTEN THROUGH YEARS OF LAWSUITS FROM THE CITY OF DETROIT AN MAP OUT THIS IS WHAT WE SHOWED YOU EARLIER WHERE SHUTOFFS WERE HAPPENING, CONTROL FOR THE SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX WHERE WE TALK ABOUT POVERTY, ACCESS TO HOUSING, TRANSPORTATION. SEE IF WILL IS A SPECIFIC CORRELATION BETWEEN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE SHUTOFFS WERE HAPPENING AND WATER RELATED HEALTH ISSUES. AND THEY DID FIND THAT PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE DISEASES THAT WERE WATER RELATED WERE ONE AND A HALF MORE TIMES LIKELY TO LIVE ON A BLOCK THAT WAS SHUTOFF. AND THAT SAME EFFECT TWENTY OTHER DIRECTION. SO THAT LIVING ON A BLOCK WITH WATER SHUTOFFS INCREASES YOUR LIKELIHOOD WITH GETTING DIAGNOSED WITH ONE OF THESE ILLNESSES. THESE DISEASES WE KNOW FROM THE FOUNDING OF PUBLIC ELECT ITSELF SPREAD. THEY ARE COMMUNICABLE. AND WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW THAT THESE HAVE MORE IMPACTS AMONG THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST SOCIALLY VULNERABLE. THIS IS ANOTHER STUDY WE DIDN'T DO BUT WANTED TO PUT OUT THERE BECAUSE OF THAT WORK WITH HENRY FORD. SOMEONE WITH MICHIGAN COMMUNITY HEALTH LOOKED THROUGH THEIR RECORD AND FOUND DOUBLE, IN ONE CASE TRIPLE RATES OF DISEASES THAT ARE NOT VERY PREVALENT IN THE UNITED STATES. COMMONLY TRUTH OF AS TRAVELERS ILLNESSES HAPPENING WITH THE EPI CENTER IN DETROIT AT THIS TIME. WE LOOKED IN THE TOOL KITS WE HAD AT HAND. WHAT COULD WE DO OURSELVES AND WE FOUND THIS TOOL KIT THAT THE CDC PUTS OUT. IT'S DESIGNED TO BE USED AFTER DISASTERS TO DO RAPID AND RELIABLE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. IT LAYS OUT A SAMPLING METHOD THAT YOU KNOW CAN BE RANDOM AND REPRESENTATIVE OF A CITY. IT THIS TWO STAGE CLUSTER SAMPLING METHOD WHERE YOU USE CENSUS DATA TO PICK OUT. WE HAD 30 CLUSTERS ALL OVER THE CITY OF DETROIT. THEN THE SECOND PHASE WE ENGAGED OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AT THIS TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE SAMPLING EVERY HOUSE DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER. WE WERE TEACHING DIFFERENT SURVEY PRACTICES AND METHODS. WE WERE DOING IT TOGETHER AND THEN GOING OUT IN TEAMS TO TALK TO FOLKS. WITH OUR SURVEY , THIS WAS AGAIN A CITY WIDE ASSESSMENT BECAUSE WE KNEW THE FIRST THING PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YOU IS JUST PICKED THE FEW PEOPLE THAT YOU KNEW AND TALKED TO THEM. WE WANTED TO HAVE REPRESENTATIVE DATA. AT THE TIME OF CONTACT, THIS IS ANY GIVEN DAY SOMEONE KNOCKS ON YOUR DOOR, 5% OF PEOPLE WHOSE DOORS WE KNOCKED ON WERE WITHOUT WATER WHEN WE MET THEM. WE WERE ABLE TO CONNECT ALL OF THEM TO THE WATER HOT LINE. WHICH IS PART OF PRACTICE OF DOING COMMUNITY BASED COMMUNITY LED RESEARCH. 17% OF HOUSEHOLDS WERE AT THAT TIME OR HAD BEEN SHUT OFF FROM WATER. MORE THAN A QUARTER WERE AT RISK OF BEING SHUT OFF. THEY HAD ACTIVE NOTICES FOR SHUTOFF. THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF TIME PEOPLE STAYED IN THEIR HOMES WITHOUT WATER WAS TEN AND A HALF DAYS. THIS WAS IMPORTANT. AT THE TIME THE CITY WAS SAYING IT WAS AN AVERAGE OF 24 HOURS AND PEOPLE GOT THEIR SERVICE RECONNECTED. THAT WAS CLEARLY NOT TRUE. THIS DOESN'T EVEN COUNT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO MOVED OR WENT AND STAYED AT THEIR SISTER'S HOUSE OR GOT OUT OF TOWN FOR A WHILE. THESE ARE PEOPLE JUST LIVING IN THEIR HOUSE AND MAKING DO WITH BOTTLED WATER. I'M GOING TO MOVE ALONG QUICKLY. AUTHORITY HEALTH PUT OUT THIS RECOMMENDATION THAT THE FOLLOWING GROUPS OF PEOPLE SHOULD BE PROTECTED BASED ON THEIR HEALTH VULNERABILITY FROM BEING SHUT OFF. HOW MANY HOUSES HAD INFANTS AND CHILDREN UNDER 18. MORE THAN 50%. ELDERS IN THE HOME, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, PEOPLE WITH CRITICAL MEDICAL NEED, 82% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS WOULD HAVE BEEN PROTECTED UNDER THE MORATORIUM THAT AUTHORITY HEALTH PROPOSED TO THE CITY OF DETROIT HAD IT BEEN RESPECTED. WE DID A SECOND SURVEY WHERE WE DUG DOWN DEEP AND WE WANTED TO SAY HOW CAN WE LOOK AT THE PSYCHO SOCIAL IMPACTS OF NOT HAVING WATER. WE DID A TWO PART STUDY. THE METHOD IS IMPORTANT. WE DREW ON THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE THE PEOPLE HAD DELIVERING WATER FOR YEARS, WORKING WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO CREATE A SURVEY THAT TALKED ABOUT HOW DO YOUR PRACTICES CHANGE. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE AT RISK OF SHUTOFF. AND THEN USE THIS STANDARD PSYCHO SOCIAL DISTRESS SCALE FROM HARVARD AND WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE SOMETHING GROUNDED IN LOCAL EXPERIENCE AND HAD A METRIC WHERE WE COULD COMPARE IT TO A VALID INSTRUMENT OF MEASURING MENTAL DISTRESS. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. AND WE ALSO FOUND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE SAFETY RELATED BEHAVIORS AND THE WATER STRESS OF PEOPLE WHO BOTH HAVE HAD THEIR WATER SHUTOFF AND PEOPLE WHO JUST FEAR THEY ARE AT RISK AND HAVE A LOT OF FINANCIAL STRESS. SO WE CONTINUE TO CALL FOR IMMEDIATE MORATORIUM ON ALL WATER SHUTOFFS. AND AFFORDABILITY PLANTA THANKSGIVING IS BASED ON HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND DOESN'T RELY ON ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. AND WE ALSO WHENEVER WE DO THIS, WE REPORT THIS DATA BACK TO COMMUNITY FIRST BECAUSE WE RESPECT IT WAS BUILT WITH THEM AND WHO THINKS TO THEM AND WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE INFORMATION. I'M GOINGTA HAND IT BACK TO MONICA.  MY QUESTION IS THIS. PEOPLE COULD NOT AFFORD THEIR WATER BILLS BECAUSE THE WATER COMPANY WAS CONSENTING USES ON FAMILIES THAT WERE ALREADY STRESSED. IT SEEPS LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY STRESSED WERE PUT UNDER MORE PRESSURE AS YOU SAID WITH THE HOME FORECLOSURES DUE TO THE TAX BILLS. HAS THE CITY BEEN OPEN TO TALK WITH THE WATER GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY TO TALK TO YOU GUYS ABOUT RELIEVING SOME OF THAT STRESS WITH THESE ADDED FEES AND TAXATION AS FAR AS DRAINAGE FEES. IF IT'S A TAX IT HAS TO BE APPROVED THROUGH LEGISLATION WITH CITY COUNCIL.  I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED FOR THE MISLEADING INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC. AND I THINK IN THAT EXPOSURE WHAT HAS HAPPENED RESEARCH LIKE WE DEMONSTRATED WHERE WE HAVE TRAVELLED AROUND THE COUNTRY AND GLOBE HELPING PEOPLE CONNECT THE DOTS HAS REALLY EXPOSED THEM. I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE NOW IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU CAN RUN FROM THE DATA. YOU CAN'T RUN FROM THE RESEARCH AND SO MY ORGANIZATION WE PEOPLE OF DETROIT HAS SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SENDING ME PLACES THAT WOULD COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO SHED A LIGHT. MR. BROWN AND THE WATER DEPARTMENT HAS SPENT A LOT OF MONEY PRING THIS ISSUE. AND THE MONEY THEY SPENT CREATINGP R THEY COULD HAVE TURNED THE WATER ON. WHAT WE KNOW IN DETROIT IT TAKES A MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP 1,000 FAMILIES. IF YOU HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES SHUT OFF FROM WATER, HOW FAR IS 2.5 MILLION GOING GO. NOW MR. BROWN IS TOUTING HE IS OUT THERE FIGHTING FOR MORE MONEY. BEFORE YOU TOOK OVER THE WATER DEPARTMENT THERE WAS AN ALLOCATION OF $5 MILLION TO HELP FAMILIES THAT COULDN'T AFFORD WATER. WHOEVER NEGOTIATED THE GREAT LAKE WATER DEAL DIDN'T HAVE DETROITERS IN MIND. THE THING I'M GOING TO SAY ABOUT WATER TOO. WHEN WE NEED ALMOST 6 TRILLION DAUGHTERS TO ADDRESS OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONGRESS ONLY ALLOCATED 1.74, THAT SHOULD TELL EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM THEY'VE STARTED DECIDING WHO IS GOING TO DRINK AND WHO WILL NOT. WE BETTER DECIDE IN THIS ROOM THAT EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO WATER AND THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE PATH TO GET THEM THERE. [APPLAUSE] .  MY QUESTION IS RELATED TO WHAT TERESA WAS SAYING. A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK THE CITY STARTED CHARGING DRAINAGE FEE. NOW YOU ARE PAYING FOR THE RAIN DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH IMPERVABLE SURFACE YOU HAVE. RECENTLY EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR WATER SHUTOFF HAVE BEEN GETTING A BILL FOR DRAINAGE. IF THEY DON'T PAY THAT, THEIR WATER IS SHUTOFF, WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE PEOPLE GETTING BILLS FOR DRAINAGE.  THE DRAINAGE BILL IS GOING TO DRIVE POOR PEOPLE DEEPER INTO DEBT. NOW THEY HAVE CHANGED THE PROCESS WHERE THE BILLS WERE ATTACHED TO THE PROPERTY. THE BILLS ARE NOW ATTACHED TO THE PERSON. NOW WHAT THEY DO IS THEY MAKE YOU AS YOU ARE ENTERING TO A PAYMENT PLAN OR TRYING TO GET A BILL IN YOUR NAME, YOU MUST PROVIDE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SO THAT BILL WILL FOLLOW YOU EVERYWHERE YOU GO. YOU'VE HAD PEOPLE COMING TO THE CITY TRYING TO BUY HOMES WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A 20,000, $40,000 BILL ATTACHED TO THAT PROPERTY AND SO THOSE PERSONS THINKING THAT THEY ARE BUYING INTO THE AMERICAN DREAM GETTING A HOME FOR $1,000 OR 2 OR 3. THEN FIND OUT AFTER THEY PURCHASE IT THEY NOW HAVE BEEN INDEBTED TO 20 AND 30 AND $40,000 OF UNPAID WATER BILLS. WHAT THIS IS DOING IS ACTUALLY MY MOTHER TOLD ME SOMETHING IN 2014. SHE'S A RETIRED MASTER SERGEANT FROM THE U.S. ARMY. SHE'S A RETIRED NURSE FROM THE V.A. AND SHE IS A COMBAT VETERAN. SHE STILL AT 75 YEARS OLD CAN BE CALLED UP BY HER GOVERNMENT. SHE TOLD ME THE 2014. SHE'S A NO NONSENSE LADY. I CUT UP. SHE DOESN'T. SHE SAID SHUTTING OFF WATER IS AN ACT OF WAR. AND SHE QUOTED THE GENEVA CONVENTION. SHE SAID YOU CAN'T SHUT OFF YOUR ENEMY IN TIMES OF WAR. YOU DECIDE NOW AND SHE WAS TALKING TO ME STRAIGHT. SHE SAID YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER SO I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU GOT TO DIE ON YOUR FEET OR KNEES. YOU HAVE ENTERED BUY WAR AND THEY WILL KILL ABOUT THIS WATER. I LIVE MY LIFE UNDERSTANDING THAT I AM RISKING EVERYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN MY CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WON'T BE ABLE TO DRINK. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT GET MINUTE AT NIGHT. THAT WAKE ME UP IN THE MORNING. YESTERDAY MORNING WE HAD A FAMILY OF 16 LIVING IN A FLAT WITH NO WATER WERE AND SANITATION. WE HAVE DATA AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL THAT SAYS 234 SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN THE LARGEST HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE THE STATE GOVERNMENT OF MICHIGAN TELLING US IT WAS I.V. DRUG USE AND SAME SEX PARTNERS WHEN WE KNOW THE SCIENCE SAYS THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF HEPATITIS A IS THE INABILITY TO WASH YOUR HAND AND HAVE PROPER SANITATION. I TELL MY GRANDCHILDREN ALL THE TIME. MOMMA YOU TRAUMATIZE BABIES ABOUT THIS WATER. I TELL THEM ALL THE TIME IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT YOUR GRANDMOTHER, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I DEPUTIZED MYSELF TO DEDICATE MY LIFE NOT JUST FOR BLACK BABIES AND BROWN BABIES BUT FOR EVERY HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET TO HAVE ACCESS TO WATER. WHAT WE FOUND OUT VERY QUICKLY IF DETROIT IS THAT IT WAS VERY EASY FOR PEOPLE TO DISMISS US AS BLACK AND BROWN AND POOR FOLKS. THEN WHEN WE UNITED OUR FIGHT AND STRUGGLE WITH FAMILIES, THE NAVAJO NATION, YOU HAVE WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN TRUCKING IN WATER FOR OVER A DECADE. WHEN WE CONNECTED THAT STRUGGLE TO FAMILIES IN PUERTO RICO THAT HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT OF OUR WAR GAMES IN THEIR BACKYARD FOR DECADES. WHEN WE CONNECTED IT TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING ALL AROUND THE GLOBE, IN IRELAND WHERE THEY ARE METERING THEIR WATER AND PEOPLE ARE RISING UP, WHAT WE KNOW IS WATER IS THE ONE THING THAT WILL UNITE US. EVERYTHING ELSE IS DIVIDING US. BUT IF WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT NONE OF YOU CAN MAKE IT. WITHOUT THIS LIFE SUSTAINING SOURCE. AND MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO TELL US WHEN WE WOULD FIGHT AS KIDS. SHE SAID GET IN THE ROOM AND I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO BUT YOU CAN'T COME OUT UNTIL YOU WORK IT OUT. I'M HOPING TODAY WAS A GET IN THE ROOM. AND I'M HOPING AMY DOESN'T LET YOU OUT UNTIL YOU WORK IT OUT. [APPLAUSE] I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT AS A CALL TO MOVEMENT. WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING WHEN WE PUT MONICA IN THIS PLACE IN THE LINEUP. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND THANK YOU NADIA YA FOR COMING WITH US. EVERYBODY TAKE A DEEP BREATH. WE ARE GETTING READY TO MOVE TO THE NEXT PORTION OF THE DAY. AND THIS IS MOVING US TO THE BREAKOUT GROUPS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO GET TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AMONGST OURSELVES ABOUT TOPICS WE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT. WE'VE IDENTIFIED FIVE TOPICS UP FRONT WE HOPE THERE WOULD APPROXIMATE INTEREST IN HAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT. THEY ARE IN YOUR PROGRAMS. YOU ARE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM REPRESENTATIVES IN THE ROOM ABOUT WHAT TOPICS ARE GOING TO BE TALKED ABOUT WITHIN THOSE. WE GAVE FOLKS OVER THE OPPORTUNITY TO FEED FEW ADDITIONAL TOPICS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFY. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW IS HEAR FIVE FAST FOOD FOR THOUGHT. WE LIFTED THAT TITLE FROM THE SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS INITIATIVE HERE IN THE SCHOOL. REALLY THE IDEA OF FAST FOOD FOR THOUGHT IS TO GIVE YOU A SENSE QUICKLY OF WHAT THE TOPICS ARE THAT ARE GOING TO BE COVERED IN THE BREAKOUT ROOMS AND WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO ROOMS ON THE NEC FLOOR UP. THE THIRD FLOOR UP AND SPEND THE NEXT HOUR AND A HALF OR SO IN DIALOGUE. I'M GOING TO INVITE THE FOLKS DOING THE FAST FOOD FOR THOUGHTS TO COME UP TO THE ROOM. WHILE THEY ARE MOVING PLEASE JOIN ME THE THANKING ONCE AGAIN MONICA LEWIS PATRICK. [APPLAUSE] WE'RE GOING DO THIS FAST.  HI EVERYBODY. I'M COMING DOWN ROAD FROM MICHIGAN DEER BORN. WE HAVE THREE MINUTES EACH TO TALK TO ENTICE TO YOU COME TALK TO US ABOUT ENGAGING YOUTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH. SO THESE ARE A LIST OF THINGS, SUPERFICIAL THINGS WE'VE LEARNED IN THESE LAST FEW SUMMERS. I THINK IF WE GET TOGETHER IN A SPACE WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT DOES THIS REALLY MEAN TO INSTITUTION LOSE AND LIFT UP YOUTH IN THESE CONVERSATIONS AND SEE WHAT THEY NEED FROM US TO DO THIS WORK. WHAT SKILLS AND HOW WE CAN FOLLOW THEIR LEAD. SO YOU CAN READ THESE BUT I WON'T READ THEM TO YOU. SIMONE THE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SIMILAR WORK IN FLINT.  THANKS FOR HAVING ME. I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT ADOLESCENCE ARE A KEY GROUP WE OFTEN DON'T HEAR FROM IN ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE AND THE CRISIS. PARTICULARLY THAT WAS THE CASE IN FLINT. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE YOUTH CAN SERVE AS EQUAL PARTNERS IN THE RESEARCH NOW. THEY CAN MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. I THINK MONICA JUST POINTED OUT THAT THE YOUTH SHE SAID YOUNG PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO SEE WHERE WE WERE WINNING. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO ADD BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES YOUTH ALSO FEEL DISENFRANCHISED BECAUSE WE DON'T HEAR FROM THEM. ONE OF THE THINGS THE FLINT GROUP IS DOING TO GET THE VOICE OF ADOLESCENTS, THEY HELD FOCUS GROUPS WITH 68 YOUTH IN 2016 TO GET A PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THEY VIEW THE FLINT WATER CRISIS. FROM THAT WE DEVELOP AID TRAINING PROGRAM SIMILAR TO NATALIE'S AROUND YOUTH PART PA TORI ACTION RESEARCH WHERE WE TRAINED THE YOUTH ON VARIOUS RESEARCH SKILLS BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE, ASSET MAPPING. PHOTO VOICE, ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENT, MEASUREMENTS, THEY WENT OUT WITH THEIR GLOVES AND DID THEIR THING. AND WE WANTED TO ASSESS THE EXTANT WHICH THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO WHICH THEY PERCEIVE HEALTH RISK IF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AS SOMEONE THIS MORNING I FORGOT HER NAME AS SHE POINTED OUT THIS MORNING THAT FLINT HAS A LOT OF ISSUES BOND BEYOND THE LED IN THE WATER. WE TAUGHT MORE THAN THE LED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED TO KNOW. IF EDUCATING THEMSELVES ON REDUCE THEIR RISK WITHIN THEIR CONTROL WHICH IS A KEY PIECE AND HAVING ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN PROPOSING CHANGE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WOULD ENHANCE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, INCREASE INTEREST IN SCIENCE CAREERS. WE HAD FOUR DAY OF TRAIN WHICH CAN YOUTH CAME OUT FOR ON A SATURDAY WHICH I WAS IMPRESSED BY. THEY WENT WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED ON SAME CURRICULUM. THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS FACILITATED THEIR FIELD WORK AND CAME BACK AND DID THEIR DATA ANALYSIS AND DECIDED ON THE STORY THEY WANTED TO TELL AND THEN SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE LESSONS AND QUOTES FROM THOSE YOUTH ECONOMY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. I LIKE THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  THANK YOU.  THAT GROUP WILL BE TALKING IN PARTICULAR ABOUT HOW TO MOBILIZE YOUTH AND PREPARE YOUTH AS THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS AND ACTIVIST. YOU DON'T HAVE SLIDE. YOU GO WHILE WE QUEUE UP THE NEXT SET OF SLIDES.  AS WE MOVE TO THE UPSTAIRS, THERE WILL BE PEOPLE UP THERE, TELL PEOPLE WHICH TOPIC YOU WANT AND THEY'LL HELP YOU FIND THE ROOM.  HI. TIME HEALTH OFFICER AT THE MID MICHIGAN DISTRICT HEALTH DEPARTMENT. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE TRUCKURE OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN MICHIGAN. I'M A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. I'M NOT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. MY JURISDICTION INCLUDES ST. LOUIS AND MIGHT BE WHICH WAS THE EPI CENTER OF THE PBBSTAIRS AND THAT'S HOW I GOT.  INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC. SWIM IF THEY ARE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE EXPERTISE AND WE HAVE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY OF OWNERSHIP AND ALSO BY INCLUDING THE EXPERTISE OF BOTH SIDES IT ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO STUDY BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION FROM BOTH SIDES AND IT INTEGRATES KNOWLEDGE SO IS NOT JUST RESEARCH FOR THE SAKE OF RESEARCH THERE'S ALWAYS AN INTERVENTION INVOLVED OR A POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS OR ACTION. SOME OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES IT BUILDS ON COMMUNITY STRENGTHS AND RESOURCES SO A NON-DEFICIT APPROACH EVERY COMMUNITY HAS THEIR OWN INHERENT SET OF KNOWLEDGES AND RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE AND YOU BUILD ON THOSE THINGS IT PROMOTES A COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP IT INCLUDES DECISION-MAKING AND RESOURCES SO THE COMMUNITY PARTNERS ARE ALSO REIMBURSED FOR THEIR TIME BECAUSE IT IS JUST AS VALUABLE AS ACADEMICS AND CO-FACILITATE THE CO-LEARNING AND CAPACITY BUILDING AND THEY WILL LEARN JUST AS MUCH AS COMMUNITY AND VICE VERSA AND WE ARE BUILDING EACH OTHER'S CAPACITY AS WE MOVE ALONG AND BALANCING THAT RESEARCH AND ACTION SO IS BENEFICIAL TO BOTH SIDES AND WE HAVE LEARNED TO DO THAT SO INCLUDING ACADEMIC PARTNERS TIME TO PUBLISH WE KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEM AND TO STAY IN THEIR JOBS AND WORK WITH US BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THERE IS ACTION BENEFITING THIS IS ALSO A CONTINUUM THAT SHOWS THE LEVEL OF POWER AND CONTROL ALONG WITH VARIOUS TYPES OF RESEARCH SO WE WOULD BE ALL THE WAY OVER THERE TO THE LEFT. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT SHOULD BE LEFT. AND THE INVESTIGATIVE RESEARCH IS AT THIS IN CP BR IS NEXT TO THE LEFT BAND THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM COMMUNITY ENGAGED RESEARCH THAT COMMUNITY MAY HAVE SOME LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT BUT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF CONTROL OVER THE DECISION-MAKING AND THIS IS JUST A QUICK EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS A POLICY CHANGE THIS WAS THROUGH THE COMMUNITY ACTION TO PROMOTE HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE THAT TO INFLUENCE POLICIES AND THE CITY LEVEL AND THE STATE LEVEL AROUND THINGS LIKE TRUCK ROUTES AND TRUCK AND MAKING SURE THERE ARE BUFFERS AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT INCREASED IN PARTICULAR WE WERE ABLE TO USE THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY BENEFITS AND BEING ABLE TO USE THE RESEARCH FOR POLICYMAKERS AROUND THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL BRANCH SO THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL A RAINBOW BUT THERE ARE SOME AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU COMBINE RESEARCH WITH COMMUNITY FOLKS AND OTHER FOLKS HAVE ALLUDED TO THAT IS VERY POWERFUL BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE DATA TO PROVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS TRUE BUT YOU ALSO HAVE CONSTITUENTS OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET REELECTED AND IT'S A VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND I THOUUT CP B BEING A TOOL FOR THE RESISTANCE. . [APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT.  GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I AM JENNIFER OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE SUSTAINABILITY INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WE ALSO HOUSE THE WATER CENTER LOT OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE OF OUR CENTER WE WILL BE FACILITATING THE DISCUSSION AND BREAK OUT THIS AFTERNOON ON POLICY CHANGE AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE LAST NIGHT SEEING A GREAT FILM, WE ALSO HEARD INSPIRING SPEECHES FROM SOME OF OUR REMARKS FROM SOME OF OUR MICHIGAN CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION AND REPRESENTATIVE DAN KILLED HE QUOTED PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHO SAID IN THIS AGE IN THIS COUNTRY PUBLIC SENTIMENT IS EVERYTHING WITH IT AND NOTHING CAN FAIL AGAINST IT, NOTHING CAN SUCCEED. SO WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PEOPLE OFF-LINE AND OVERFLOW ROOMS WE HAVE A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM HERE BUT IS ALSO THE CASE THAT PUBLIC SENTIMENT IS NOT BY ITSELF ENOUGH TO ENSURE GOOD POLICY OUTCOMES. DECISION-MAKERS TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS ALSO NEED ACCESS TO GOOD SCIENCE ON THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVES AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PEOPLE THEY ARE REGULATING. SO THIS BREAKOUT SESSION WILL BE A CHANCE TO TAKE STOCK ON THE POLICIES WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS AND HOW TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS RINGS ALONG THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. SO WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE SPEAKERS TODAY SOME OF THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE.I WILL MENTION A FEW THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THIS COMPLEX REQUIRES MULTIPLE RESPONSES AT THE LOCAL, THE STATE, THE FEDERAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. SOME I HAVE HEARD FROM GROUPS MICHIGAN SHOULD ESTABLISH STRICT DRINKING WATER STANDARDS AND THEY SHOULD REGULATE AS A CLASS OF COMPOUNDS NOT ONE ADULT TIME IN THE WALKABLE WAY. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SHOULD PHASE OUT P FAST AND FIREFIGHTING AND WE HAVE HEARD SOME PROFOUND IDEAS FROM LINDA THIS MORNING THAT WE SHOULD LIMIT IT TO JUST ESSENTIAL USES. THERE NEEDS TO BE PROOF OF ESSENTIAL USE AND WE HEARD A  TO REINSTATE THE TAX SO THERE WOULD BE FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES TO EXTEND SUPERFUND TO EXTEND THIS CATEGORY OF CHEMICALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS I HAVE HEARD AND THEY COULD BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THIS PROBLEM ANOTHER ONE IS TO FLIP THE PRESUMPTION, WHY DO WE REGULATE UNDER FDA SO YOU HAVE TO PROVE SOMETHING IS SAFE AND WITH CHEMICALS YOU CAN USE THEM UNTIL SOMEBODY COMES AND GETS OVER THE HURDLE OF PROVING THAT THEY ARE A PROBLEM. AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE CAN TALK ABOUT IN THIS BREAKOUT. AND HOW WE PRIORITIZE ALL OF THESE POLICY CHANGES WHAT IDEAS ARE MISSING FROM THESE LISTS, WHAT ARE THE OBSTACLES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION AND IN PART, WHAT KIND OF PROPOSALS ARE NEEDED TO BRING IN THE DATA COLLECTION AND TO MAKE SURE THE CONSTITUENTS AND ADVOCATES ARE BROUGHT ALONG WHAT ARE THE TACTICS AND STRATEGIES FROM OTHER MOVEMENTS LIKE CIVIL RIGHTS THAT WE CAN BRING TO BEAR. SO WHO SHOULD COUNTER THIS BREAKOUT SESSION? I THINK ALL OF YOU. [LAUGHTER] MY GROUP WILL BE IN THE KESSLER ROOM AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU THERE. [LAUGHTER] THE BREAKOUT ROOMS ARE IN YOUR PROGRAM. YOU CAN LOOK IN YOUR PROGRAM AND SEE WHERE YOUR BREAKOUT ROOM IS GOING TO BE.  AND FACILITATING A WORKSHOP ON BUILDING NATIONAL NETWORKS WHICH I FEEL UNQUALIFIED TO LEAD AND I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE ON THE SCIENTIFIC SIDE AND THE COMMUNITY SIDE AND I CAN SHARE THOSE EXPERIENCES AND THIS WORKSHOP AND WE ARE HOPING PEOPLE WITH EXPERTISE AND IDEAS WILL COME AND WATCH OUR GAPS AND UC NETWORKS ARE NEEDED AND HOW WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THOSE GOALS. WE WILL BE ON THE HENDERSON ROOM AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU. . [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE ASKED SOMEONE TO BE A POINT PERSON AND AVAILABLE AND MOST OF THEM AND THE IDEA OF THE BREAKOUT ROOMS AS EVERYONE HAS EXPERTISE HAS EXPERIENCE HAS WISDOM AND INSIGHT SO THE FACILITATORS ARE GOING TO LEAVE THE CONVERSATION AS MUCH AS TO CREATE A SPACE FOR THE CONVERSATION TO HAPPEN SO PLEASE GO WITH THAT IDEA WITHOUT INTENTIONALITY, SHARE YOUR IDEAS AND THE HOPE IS THAT WE WILL LEAVE THE BREAKOUTS HAVING IDENTIFIED A COUPLE OF KEY ACTIONS AND A COUPLE OF KEY RESOURCES THAT MIGHT MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I WANT TO SAY DURING THE BREAK OUT A COUPLE OF YOU DID WRITE ADDITIONAL IDEAS UP ON THE NEW SPRINT AND ONE OF THOSE WAS AROUND HELPING THE MEDICAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS BE BETTER PREPARED TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTALLY RELATED CONDITIONS AND DISEASES SO THERE IS SOME INTEREST IN THE BREAKOUT ROOM AROUND THAT. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THAT, TELL THE FOLKS UPSTAIRS AND THEY WILL HELP YOU FIND A SPACE FOR THAT CONVERSATION. THE OTHER CONVERSATION I WILL ENCOURAGED TO START WITH COURTNEY AND THE NETWORKING IS THAT CONVERSATION THAT BUILDS ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT JANELL AND OTHERS MADE EARLIER THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK TOGETHER ACROSS THE DIVIDE, THE SOCIAL DIVIDE THE ECONOMIC DIVIDE AND CREATE A MOVEMENT THAT TRANSCENDS THAT AND I THINK IT CAN START IN YOUR ROOM THERE MAY BE SOUND AND FEEL FREE TO BREAKOUT WHEN OTHER CONVERSATIONS START AND THE LAST THING I'M GOING TO SAY AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WILL RECONVENE AND THE MICHIGAN ROOM WE WILL HAVE FOOD THERE WE ARE MOVING THE POSTERS INTO THAT AND IF YOU DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THAT AND WE WILL HAVE BREAKOUTS SO WE CAN HAVE A DIALOGUE ACROSS THE GROUPS. CLEAR WHAT WE ARE DOING? . [INDISCERNIBLE] WHAT TIME IS IT NOW? WHAT TIME ARE WE SUPPOSED TO START TO? WHY DO WE MOVE IN FIVE MINUTES LET'S MOVE IN FIVE MINUTES AND LESS IN THE CONVERSATION AT MEREDITH, WHAT TIME DO WE HAVE TO MOVE? WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BACK IN THAT ROOM AT 3:30 PM.  SORRY PRESSSO AND YOUR CONVERSATIONS ON THE SMALL GROUP BREAKOUTS BY 3:30 PM. WILL THAT BE OKAY? NO? WE ARE ON TIME. WE ARE ON TIME. . [INDISCERNIBLE] [LAUGHTER]
