 [Music] this is diane recording part one of the atlantis project what is the atlantis project it's a project me and evie decided to create so we could tell you exactly what's happening here in north sag our home tomorrow we have to lead north sag before it's swallowed by the sea forever tonight we're going to tell you the whole story our story everything that has happened in the past year so to everyone out there who is listening young or old let us take you back one year to where our story begins i'm 13 years old i love science when i grow up i'll be a scientist not sure in what though i'm a sagok and my whole family are from north sag i guess the first thing i remember is coming home from school and seeing the flyer on the wall of marwah's shop marwal was a sagog and he was old enough to remember his own grandfather telling him stories about growing up in the sagog rebellion the flyers were everywhere you couldn't miss them i don't remember word for word what they said but i do remember big letters saying to the people of the north sag community town hall meeting this evening north sag is our home it's a seafront community in a country populated by the sagog people an ancient native tribe hundreds of years ago we built it on sand and cliffs and adapted to living on the sea's edge we used to live in forest huts made from the ground and surrounding nature it started when we were colonized by viking pillagers who came searching for food in the mountains on their journeys the elk is our spirit animal that means a deer and our ancestors use the elk to feed and clothe themselves once a year you'll see hunting parties going out to find one we have our own language sagog which we still speak to each other there's no religion really not in the way you think about it our religion is mother earth it sounds hard to explain but we belong to mother earth and not that mother earth belongs to us like in other western cultures we've adopted loads of western traditions of living over the years how we eat how we dress we sometimes celebrate our ancient traditions passed down to us from our ancestors we were preparing for the celebration of the rebellion the mustrogy which would happen in a few weeks time family time to sing and share stories on weekends is still really popular we do it a lot in our family me mama papa and my two baby twin sisters kathleen and malai on the night of the town hall meeting it was really hot the kind of july where everyone kept their doors and windows open mama and papa didn't think it was a good idea that me and my baby sisters went to the town hall so they went without us after dinner our old sagog neighbor margain offered to watch over us whilst mama and papa were out margain had a grandson called mikhail who i sometimes talk to but he was away with his parents on their holiday margain sat me next to her on a kitchen chair she brought outside for me when i sat down i asked her why she wasn't going to the meeting too everyone else was going megan said to me in her old comforting segogian sort of way i'm old bucho that's sagog for boy or lad i've lived through ferocious storms governments wanting our land for food oil merchants wanting to knock down my house rebellions of all kinds and i've survived them all whatever it is they're discussing in that town hall tonight i'm ready for it i'm like an old tree they can't move me i didn't have a clue what she was talking about she was ancient after all so i quickly ignored it the neighboring countries didn't allow our ancestors to speak our own language and use our own land for decades they stole our land from us and used it for their own people and farms there was this massive rebellion decades ago lots of fighting and blood and battles and now we have our culture and language back the town hall meeting finished late and so margin took us back to our house and put us to bed i could hear mama and papa thank megan outside when they came home later on i could hear their voices arguing trying to whisper so they wouldn't wake me and my baby sisters up but it wasn't really working it's not polite to eavesdrop on other people's conversations but i couldn't help it what was it that made them argue particularly after the town hall meeting i could only hear bits of what they were saying words mostly and some phrases words like we should go and commissioner for environmental protection and decommissioned whatever that meant i remember the word environmental when we learned in our science class about the world's changing climate and that we only had little time left to save the planet from total catastrophe we had two types of schools schools for the sago children where we spoke our language and other smaller schools for those who weren't born sagog and couldn't speak the language the next day was the last day of school and already people were arriving in northside for their holidays we were allowed to go home early because it was summer lots of foreigners from the neighbouring countries moved into north sag over the years using it for tourism or for retirement ancient sagog huts have morphed into airbnbs and hotels with hot tubs and barbecues they look like fun but all very fake it's like when i went to paris and a group of tourists walked around with berets on their heads thinking they looked french but they didn't look anything like french people whatsoever kids in northside did three things in the summer got an ice cream made dens in the upper woods or slid down the sand dunes but me i walked along the beach alone i didn't like it when my parents argued like they did the night before they've only ever argued like that when they've upset each other by the sea wall there was a group of protesters with signs that said save our town and save our planet there were always climate change protesters in the town for as long as i can remember in school they taught us a lot about the planet the seas the oceans the mountains how the planet is changing because of what we're doing to it but surely it had nothing to do with north sac i just knew it this is evie recording part one of the atlantis project summer holidays had just begun in north sag and there were people everywhere families were on their holidays in caravans and huts and hotels on the seafront loads of people swimming and on the beaches everyone seemed to be eating ice cream all the time we're not from north sag we're from the neighbouring country i moved to north sag with my mum and younger brother max about three years ago we'd seen the house we live in now loads of times before on holiday there that house was going to be ours and it was going to be our little holiday cottage on the cliff so mum brought us here to start a new life two years later the time of when we found out we would have to leave north sag we still don't have our holiday cottage it turns out it wasn't as easy as mum thought that summer me and my friend verity would play outside all day me and verity live around the corner from each other and went to the same school we didn't speak sagog like the sigis that means the sagog that's what we called them that first week of summer we'd made a new friend bridget she was there on holiday with her parents for the whole six weeks but she didn't have any brothers or sisters so she started hanging around with us when she saw us playing outside as the three of us were sprinting down past the sea wall past marvel's shop past the sagog neighbours sat outside the rows and rows of homes chatting to each other i saw a small group of protesters holding up signs they shouted at people trying to get their attention one of their signs was so big it was hard to unnotice it it said don't feed north sag to the sea as we round past the sea wall a helicopter swooped overhead and we ran with it along the beach shouting and waving as the strong breeze almost blew us away the protesters kept shouting there's 700 of us and save our planet and the planet needs us too they were all sigis there was this little girl stood with them when i ran past she stared at me and my friends like she was saying we won't talk to them segogies always do that because that's the type of people they are they stare and sarah anything that doesn't act or look or think like them so we just shouted as horribly as we could through our giggles as we ran past sigogi bridget mentioned something about her parents making this their last holiday to northsag because it would be underwater soon i didn't know what she was talking about she said that the sea was getting higher with every second and north sag would be the first town in the country to be underwater but as she was talking my creative brain already started to tick and became really excited by the idea that what if it did happen what would we do humans are pretty adaptable and we could learn to breathe underwater straight away we might grow scales and be stronger swimmers over time we'd build the biggest city and it would just be for us the people of north sag my favorite thing to do is make up new games on the beach sometimes we'd swap towels from tourists when they went swimming in the sea we made tourists so angry and that made us laugh but i'm a very creative person i always choose new games to play as i was basically the leader of our gang i got to be the leader of our game too that's when i made a new game atlantis i read a book about atlantis once in school the ancient lost city that sat at the bottom of the ocean how an ancient greek writer called plato wrote about it in 9600 bc and how a tsunami that means a big wave destroyed the advance of modern city swallowing it whole hundreds of search for the city but have never ever found it wouldn't it be cool if north sag was just like atlantis as the queen of atlantis i sat on top of a huge rock pool wearing seaweed around my head like a crown verity was a fish servant i ordered her about a lot asking her to swim around and protect our kingdom from any segogies she'd find bridget our new citizen and we test her to see if she could join the kingdom she'd have to see how long she could hold her breath underwater or how fast she could swim from verity to me and that's when i saw him sat alone on the rock pool i'd never seen him before he didn't go to the same school as us and that's because he was a segogi and we didn't like him we just didn't that's how it was if you weren't a suggy then they hated you too it's what we grew up with and right there he was on our rock pool without an invite to atlantis i had to make him leave i said to him segogies can't be in atlantis so while you're in our kingdom i don't know he looked at us he looked at bridget and verdi who were both giggling and egging me on to say more but mainly he looked at me i told him that i was the queen so it could exist if i wanted it to but there wasn't room for him i told him that we were the only subjects of our kingdom here he said to me that he was allowed to be here and that he was here before us he said atlantis doesn't exist it's not in our oceans what what did you say sorry i can't understand you because of your funny accent that was my strongest weapon that shut him up we sent him walking away whilst bridget and verity giggled even louder they looked up to me i was their queen and i felt like it i really did even as he walked away sulking and looking as if he was about to cry it felt amazing to be in control on friday evenings we always come together as a family around the dinner table and practice the tradition of the redunt a sagog ritual giving thanks to nature for the working week the eating is always the best part our ancestors would eat whatever they'd hunted ducks rabbits pheasant we don't do that anymore we just eat whatever was planned for that week papa said he was going to join a hunting party to look for elk for the mastragi celebration after what that girl said to me on the beach i needed the ritual that friday i needed my family around me papa kept telling me i had sad eyes and appeared to have lost my appetite he wasn't entirely wrong i was starving but thinking kept getting in the way of eating i told him what happened in every single detail so he put down his knife and fork and told me this listen diane we sagog people are a proud people don't forget our ancestors were here long before they were they borrow this land but we own it just always remember that sagogs have a saying the dying trees will expose their roots when falling to the ground he carried on eating but i couldn't ignore it he was right if we are going to survive as a people as a culture and be proud of that then we need to be confident and show the rest of the world that we are here to stay i tried to sleep but instead all i could hear were the voices of protesters still outside on the promenade shouting the kingdom of north sag is your kingdom they were dizzying hypnotic finally making me drift off to sleep that was until a helicopter louder than a bomb swept over our house and made me completely awake again this is diane ending part one of the atlantis project
