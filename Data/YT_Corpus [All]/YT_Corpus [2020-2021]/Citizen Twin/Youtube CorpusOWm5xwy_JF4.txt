 we're here to let you know that the 13 school district superintendents in collaboration with one another but more importantly in collaboration with Sacramento Public Health the Sacramento Health Department and their director dr. Peter B Linson have jointly made the decision to shut down all of our Sacramento public school districts for up to three weeks starting this Monday the shutdown is designed to number one help prevent the spread of the corona virus number two to let the district's make plans for the future when they reopen and do that in a way that is most beneficial for their students and their families and finally to have us have more information about the behavior of the illness so that we know what's ahead even after the three week shot down the three weeks shot down also means that it backs up against the Spring Break for eleven of the thirteen districts so if the districts stay closed for the three weeks and the extra week there's a four week hiatus when we hope and we pray that we know more about the virus and more about what it will take to to knock it down in in our community in the meantime we will be doing whatever we can to support students in their families most notably with nutrition programs lunch programs delivery and making available nutritious healthy lunch and in some cases breakfast for our young people and also doing whatever we can to help out with distance learning where possible and also programs in the community for students which we might be able to run particularly in collaboration with our great non for community this decision was a very difficult decision to make because anytime that you're dealing with school closures we recognize that we serve a community that really relies on our school district for more for more resurfaces beyond just education but we felt was necessary at this time to take this time off so that we as a district can better prepare ourselves to support our staff and students upon the return well we're going to provide nutritional services at all our high schools and middle schools along with one of our Elementary's in the region of Regency Park area so again difficult decision but felt that it was necessary so that we could do our part and hopefully slowing down the spread of Cova Dean you
