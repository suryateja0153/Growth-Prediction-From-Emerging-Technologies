 FOR EMANCIPATION PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ANNOUNCED AN EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION FOR A CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION HAILS AS A QUOTE, MAJOR ADVANCE. KELLY O'DONNELL HAS MORE. I'M PLEASED TO MAKE A TRULY HISTORIC ANNOUNCEMENT.  Reporter: THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED A NEW STEP FOR A CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT, A TEMPORARY EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION FOR CONVALESCE PLASMA JOINED BY THE HEAD OF THE FDA, THIS DECISION COMES AFTER INTERNAL SCIENTIFIC DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE FDA HAD ENOUGH DATA AND AFTER THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED FDA STAFF ON TWITTER OF DELAYING ACTION UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.  WE BROKE THE LOG JAM OVER THE LAST WEEK. IT'S MY OPINION, VERY POLITICAL REASONS. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH LIFE OR DEATH.  Reporter: THE PRESIDENT CAN TRY TO DISTRACT THE NEGATIVE PORTRAYAL OF HIS OLD ORE SISTER.

AND HEADED FOR NEW ORLEANS ON THE 15th ANNIVERSARY OF HURRICANE KATRINA.  JANESSA WEBB IS TRACKING THOSE STORMS THERE'S SO MUCH CHANGING  GOOD MORNING. WE DO HAVE A BIG-TIME CHANGE IN THE FORECAST I THINK NEW ORLEANS, YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR NOW EVEN THOUGH WE DO STILL HAVE THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY. YOU COULD STILL DEAL WITH SOME FLOODING RAIN BUT THIS STORM SYSTEM HAS TAKEN A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK. THERE IS NO ALERTS FOR PANAMA CITY TOTAL HAS SEE AND THEY ARE SEEING THE OUTER BANDS A LITTLE BIT OF HAIL CURRENTLY HAPPENING BUT THIS STORM SYSTEM HAS RUN INTO SOME DRIER AIR AND THAT'S ALLOWED IT TO KIND OF SHRED APART. WE'LL STILL WATCH IT AS THE FLOODING POTENTIAL AND STORM SURGE I THINK STILL COULD BE HEFTY ACROSS THE FLORIDA POOND BUT AS I SAID, NO ALERLTS BUT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE AS MARCO LIFTS TO THE NORTH AND WEST. BEHIND THAT IS TROPICAL STORM LAURA. WE'RE EXPECTING THAT TO INTENSIFY. THAT'S A LOOK AT THE BIG WEATHER STORY OF THE DAY NOW A CLOSER LOOK AT YOUR DAY AHEAD. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE GULF COAST ARE VERY WARM. 95 DEGREES FOR HOUSTON, A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE THIS AFTERNOON NO RAIN IN THE FORECAST AND THE STORM SYSTEMS THEY'LL START TO HEAT UP FOR CHICAGO THIS AFTERNOON INTO GREEN LEADING THE NEWS ON WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS 42nd BIRTHDAY, THE SPORTS WORLD REMEMBERED KOBE BRYANT A TOUCHING TRIBUTE TO HER LATE HUSBAND SAYING IN PART, I'M SO THANKFUL I HAVE PIECES OF HEAVEN HERE ON EARTH THANKS TO YOU.

ROGER GOODELL SAT DOWN FOR AN IN DEPTH ONE ON ONE ON THE POD CAST UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS WITH A BLACK MAN HE SAYS HE WISHED HE LISTENED TO COLIN KAEPERNICK  IF YOU WERE TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS YOUR REMORSE, APOLOGIZE TO KAEPERNICK, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?  WELL, THE FIRST THING I'D SAY IS I WISH WE HAD LISTENED EARLIER, KAP, TO WHAT YOU WERE KNEELING ABOUT AND WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO BRING ATTENTION TO WE'D INVITED HIM IN SEVERAL TIMES TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION, HAVE THE DIALOG. I WISH WE HAD THE BENEFIT OF THAT WE NEVER DID  THE COMMISSIONER GOES O THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN THIS WORLD TODAY. WE SEEM TO HAVE DEVELOPED A FUNDAMENTAL ABILITY TO APOLOGIZE TO ANYONE.  RUSSELL CROWE'S UNHINGED MADE ITS DOMESTIC DEBUT WHERE THEATERS HAVE STARTED TO SLOWLY REOPEN HERE. THE FILM POCKETED MORE THAN $4 MILLION OVER THE WEEKEND AND PLAYED IN ABOUT 1,800 VENUES MARKING THE WIDEST RELEASE YET SINCE THE PANDEMIC HIT AND THAT MOVE THAT POLICE USE TO END CAR CHASES FOUND IT'S CAUSED A STRING OF DEATHS AND INJURIES  Reporter: A YOUNG MAN IN A PICKUP TRUCK RUNS A RED LIGHT IN RURAL ARKANSAS AND REFUSES TO STOP FOR THE POLICE. THE HALF HOUR HIGH SPEED CHASE THIS APRIL ENDS IN A FIERY WRECK. THE TRUCK FLIPPING, LAUNCHING THE POLICE CRUISER INTO THE AIR, BUT IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. POLICE RECORDS SAY THE STATE TROOPER CAUSED THE CRASH BY BUMPING THE TRUCK AT 109 MILES AN HOUR. THE TROOPER WAS INJURED BUT THE DRIVER, 34-YEAR-OLD JUSTIN BATTENFIELD WAS KILLED  I DON'T BELIEVE IT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED HONESTLY AT THE RATE OF SPEED IT WAS GOING THEY HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE GOT BACK IN TOWN.  THERE'S A PIT MANEUVER.  Reporter: THE TROOPER USED THIS MOVE KNOWN AS THE PRECISION IMPLOEBLIZATION TECHNIQUE. AN INVESTIGATION PUBLISHED BY THE "WASHINGTON POST" FOUND THAT SINCE 2016 AT LEAST 30 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN INJURED WHEN POLICE USE THE PIT. 18 OF THOSE DEATHS CAME AFTER DRIVERS WERE SUSPECTED OF MINOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS SUCH AS SPEEDING, THE POST FOUND TEN KILLED WERE PASSENGERS AND FOUR WERE BYSTANDERS  IF USED PROPERLY IT IS A GOOD, SAFE MANEUVER AND IF USED IMPROPERLY AT HIGH SPEEDS IN THE WRONG AREA AGAINST THE WRONG VEHICLE IT'S DEADLY.  Reporter: THE MANEUVER WAS DEVELOPED DECADES AGO IN VIRGINIA WHERE OFFICERS NOW PRACTICE IT AT LOW SPEEDS ON A TRACK.  I MATCH THE VIOLATOR'S SPEED. ONCE I'M BESIDE HIM I MAKE CONTACT WITH THE TARGET AREA I'LL HOLD THAT CONTACT ON THE TARGET AREA UNTIL EVERYTHING IS SAFE AND THEN A GOOD FOLLOW THROUGH.  THEY PERFORM THE PIT ON THE STREET ABOUT 13 TIMES A YEAR AND NO ONE HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT  IF A BYSTANDER IS KILLED OR IF THE TARGET IN THE CAR IS KILLED THAT'S A FAILURE. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN LIKE THAT  THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF PIT, NO, SIR  SOME DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING NEW YORK STATE POLICE HAVE BANNED THE PIT WHILE OTHERS SUCH AS LAPD FORBID IT AT SPEEDS OVER 35 MILES AN HOUR BUT MANY LARGE POLICE AGENCIES ALLOW THE TECHNIQUE AT ANY SPEED THE "WASHINGTON POST" FOUND.  FAIRFAX COUNTY POLICE SAY THEY WOULD ONLY USE THE PIT TO STOP A D  A QUARTET OF GAME FOUR BROUGHT A BANG TO THE NBA PLAYOFFS CHECK THIS OUT  DONCIC PULLS UP IT'S GOOD!  LUKA DONCIC IS ONLY 21 YEARS OLD BUT HE IS QUICKLY BECOMING A LEGEND HE HELPED THE MAVERICKS TIE UP THEIR SERIES WITH THE CLIPPERS HE HAD A 41-TRIPLE DOUBLE. TWO TEAMS HAVE LEFT THE BUBBLE AFTER BEING SWEPT THE NETS GAVE UP A WHOPPING 150 POINTS IN THEIR FIRS THE TWIN STORMS BARRELLING TOWARD THE GULF STATES OFFICIALS IN NEW ORLEANS ARE URGING RESIDENTS TO PREP FOR BOTH IMPACTS JAY GRAY IS THERE FOR US GOOD MORNING  Reporter: GOOD MORNING, PHILLIP AND WE'RE ON BOURBON STREET RIGHT NOW USUALLY YOU'D HEAR SOME KIND OF MUSIC. THERE'S ALWAYS AN ENERGY HERE BUT THE ENTIRE FRENCH QUARTER UNUSUALLY QUIET. SOME BUSINESSES DON'T SEEM TOO WORRIED. LIKE THIS ONE JUST NEXT DOOR, THIS RESTAURANT COMPLETELY BOARDED UP WITH THE EFFECTS OF MARCOUX EXPECTED IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AND LAURA STILL LOOMING RIGHT NOW. THE BIG EASY A BIT UNEASY RIGHT NOW. WITH TWO TROPICAL SYSTEMS TARGETING THE LOUISIANA GULF COAST.  SO WE'RE GOING TO GET A RIGHT HOOK FROM MARCOU AND A LEFT HOOK FROM LAURA  SOME ARE BLOCKING OR BOARDING UP WHAT THEY CAN AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE THE ESSENTIALS TO RIDE OUT THE STORM.  STOCKING UP ON FOOD, AND TRYING TO PARK THE CAR IN THE HIGHEST POINT POSSIBLE WE CAN FIND. Reporter: OTHERS IN THIS AREA BELOW SEA LEVEL ARE HEADING FOR HIGHER GROUND.  WE CAN'T HANDLE A REGULAR RAINSTORM AND IT'S TIME TO GO.  MARCO COULD LOSE A LITTLE ENERGY THIS AFTERNOON. CURRENTLY IT'S TRACKING JUST WEST OF NEW ORLEANS LEAVING THE CITY ON THE DIRTY OR STRONG SIDE OF THE STORM LAURA IS A MUCH MORE POWERFUL SYSTEM THAT FORECASTERS SAY WILL INTENSIFY BEFORE CROSSING THE COAST.  IT'S EXPECTED TO BE A VERY STRONG CATEGORY 2. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT STRONGER AND BE A CATEGORY 3.  LASHING THE ISLANDS AS IT GROWS AND TAKES AIM AT THE GULF, EVIDENCE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE SYSTEM AND A SOBER WARNING FOR THOSE IN THE TRACK OF THE STORM.  Reporter: AND LOOK, THE TIME TO PREPARE HERE IS REALLY OVER AT THIS POINT. IN FACT, OFFICIALS WARNING OVERNIGHT THAT RESIDENTS WHO HAVE STAYED SHOULD HUNKER DOWN WHERE THEY ARE FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS OR SO.  AND ALL THIS HAPPENING AMID A GLOBAL PANDEMIC TO BOOT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.  OF COURSE THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE TRACK. LET'S TURN TO JANESSA WHO'S WATCHING THE TWO STORMS.  WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING MARCO START TO FALL APART BUT LAURA, WE ARE SEEING FLOODING RAIN ACROSS HAITI INTO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC THE PHOTOS ARE VERY DISTURBING AS THE FLOOD WAT WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE BREAKING NEWS STORIES THIS MORNING. IN WISCONSIN, A POLICE INVOLVED SHOOTING OF A BLACK MAN SPARKS PROTESTS AND UNREST. IN CALIFORNIA, THE WILDFIRES GROW PAST A MILLION ACRES AS THE DEADLY BLAZES CONTINUE TO GROW LARGER WITH UNPREDICTABLE WINDS. A MAJOR SHAKEUP AT THE WHITE HOUSE AS ONE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOST LOYAL ADVISERS STEPS DOWN DOUBLE TROUBLE IN THE GULF, AS MARCO AND LAURA, TWO MAJOR STORMS, THREATEN THE GULF COAST STATES WITH A ONE-TWO PUNCH. STREAMING BIG. THINSPIRING STORY OF A MAN WHO WAS A SECURITY GUARD AT A HOSPITAL AND NOW RETURNING WITH A BRAND NEW JOB. "EARLY TODAY" STARTS RIGHT NOW  GOOD MONDAY MORNING I'M PHILIP MENA.  AND I'M FRANCES RIVERA. WE BEGIN WITH THAT BREAKING NEWS A STATE OF EMERGENCY CURFEW HAS BEEN DECLARED FOR KENOSHA, WISCONSIN. OUTRAGED PEOPLE FILLING THE STREETS ONCE AGAIN AFTER A 29-YEAR-OLD MAN WAS SHOT BY POLICE VIDEO OF THE INCIDENT QUICKLY WENT VIRAL ONLINE. AND A WARNING, IT MAY BE DISTURBING TO SEE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE RECORDING, BUT A MAN IDENTIFIED AS JACOB BLAKE COULD BE SEEN MOVING TO OPEN A CAR DOOR AND MULTIPLE SHOTS ARE FIRED. BLAKE WAS AIRLIFTED TO A HOSPITAL A LOCAL AFFILIATE SPOKE TO HIS FIANCE  THE TWO MALE OFFICERS INSTANTLY DETAINED HIM, LIKE, PUT YOUR HANDS UP NEW YORK E QUS OR NONE OF THAT. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET DIDS CAN OUT OF THE CAR I'M LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE, HE DIDN'T DO NOTHING WRONG, JUST ASK SOME QUESTIONS FIRST BEFORE YOU PIN THIS MAN UP AGAINST THE CAR.  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SAYS OFFICERS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN PROVIDING FIRST AID. THE WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS INVESTIGATING THAT SHOOTING NOW TO BREAKING NEWS A TWIN NIGHTMARE HEADED FOR THE GULF COAST TWO TROPICAL STORMS TARGETING LOUISIANA JUST 48 HOURS APART. MARCO HAS WEAKENED DOWN, BECOMING A TROPICAL STORM. BUT AFTER WREAKING HAVOC IN THE CARIBBEAN, TROPICAL STORM LAURA IS GAINING STRENGTH. NBC METEOROLOGIST JANESSA WEBB IS TRACKING THEM FOR US. GOOD MORNING  GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. THIS JUST IN, MARCO HAS TAKEN KIND OF A DIFFERENT TRACK. I THINK THE NEXT UPDATE WE SEE FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER HAS IT GOING MORE INTO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. ALERTS ARE NOT OUT FOR THIS AREA, BUT TALLAHASSEE INTO PANAMA CITY, THIS IS TAKING MORE OF A NORTHERLY TRACK AND YOU'RE SEEING BANDS OF MOISTURE EVEN THOUGH LOUISIANA IS ON OUR RADAR, THEY WILL DEAL WITH THE STORM SURGE WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM RIGHT NOW, IT HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL SYSTEM. BEHIND THAT, WE HAVE A MAJOR HURRICANE THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BUILD. THAT IS TROPICAL STORM LAURA IS GAINING STEAM OVER THE ISLANDS YOU THINK IT WOULD START TO BE BROKEN DOWN DUE TO THE MOUNTAINS AND THE LAND INTERACTION THAT IT'S CURRENTLY SEEING. BUT IT WILL GO BACK INTO A WARM BODY OF WATER AND INTENSINTENSI. AND BY WEDNESDAY, POTENTIAL LANDFALL NEAR BATON ROUGE OR NEW ORLEANS. WE ARE EXPECTING A STORM SURGE OF 10 TO 12 FEET IN THAT AREA. WITH RAINFALL ACCUMULATION UP TO THREE FEET  SERIOUS SITUATION THERE JANESSA, THANKS FOR TRACKING THAT FOR US. NOW TO ONE OF THE MOST VISIBLE FACES IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. SHE SAID SHE'S STEPPING DOWN AT THE END OF AUGUST. KELLYANNE CONWAY IS PLANNING TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HER CHILDREN, SAYING IN PART, AS MILLIONS OF PARENTS NATIONWIDE KNOW, KIDS DOING SCHOOL FROM HOME REQUIRE A LEVEL OF ATTENTION AND VIGILANCE THAT IS UNUSUAL AT THESE TIMES THIS IS COMPLETELY MY CHOICE AND MY VOICE IT WILL BE LESS DRAMA, MORE MOMMA. HER HUSBAND ANNOUNCED HE TOO IS STEPPING AWAY FROM THE LINCOLN PROJECT TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO FAMILY MATTERS THE SEISMIC SHIFT FOR THE COUPLE COMES AFTER A TWEET STORM FROM THEIR 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, CLAUDIA CONWAY, WHO SAID SHE'S PUSHING FOR EMANCIPATION LET'S TURN TO THE MASSIVE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. THE SMOKE THERE IS SO THICK THE HAZE IS EVEN HITTING STATES IN THE MIDWEST. AND NOW MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY ARE BEING CALLED UP TO HELP. NBC'S STEVE PATTERSON IS THERE ON THE FRONTLINES.  WE'LL HAVE THAT STORY IN A MOMENT NOW TO NEW MEDICAL TREATMENT TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS. IT'S BEEN GIVEN EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION. SUNDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THE APPROVAL OF CONVALESCENT PLASMA, WHICH USES BLOOD FROM COVID-19 PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECOVERED BUT SOME ARE STILL QUESTIONING THE EFFECTIVENESS.  LOOKS LIKE WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THAT, AS WELL LET'S MOVE NOW TO PRESIDENT TRUMP FACING A NEW CONTROVERSY FROM WITHIN HIS OWN FAMILY IN A SECRET RECORDING, THE PRESIDENT'S SISTER, MARIANNE TRUMP BARRY, IS HEARD SAYING HE HAS NO PRINCIPLES, THAT AUDIO WAS FIRST OBTAINED BY "THE WASHINGTON POST," AND HAS SINCE BEEN OBTAINED BY NBC NEWS. LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE THIS REPORT NOW FROM JENNIFER JOHNSON. [ NO AUDIO ]  ALL RIGHT CLEARLY HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH OUR STORIES HERE LET'S GO BACK OVER TO METEOROLOGIST JANESSA WEBB WHO IS TRACKING THOSE TWO MONSTER STORMS IN THE GULF JANESSA?  LET ME SHOW YOU RADAR RIGHT NOW. CURRENTLY, SEEING MARCO AND THE FORECAST HAS REALLY CHANGED. JUST IN THE LAST HOUR. IT DEFINITELY HAS WEAKENED BACK DOWN TO A TROPICAL STORM SYSTEM DUE TO IT JUST BEING REALLY DISORGANIZED, YOU CAN SEE BANDS OF MOISTURE HITTING THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. BUT I THINK THE CENTER OF THIS STORM IS GOING TO GO MORE TOWARD THE NORTH. NO ALERTS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE ACROSS THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO GET AWARE, BECAUSE A STORM SURGE IS GOING TO BE HEIGHTENED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON AND INTO YOUR EVENING. AND ALSO WITH MARCO, IT'S STARTING TO MOVE AT A FASTER SPEED. SO FOR THE FORECAST FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER, IT SAID IT WAS GOING TO VEER MORE TO THE WEST, BUT I THINK THAT WILL CHANGE AT THE 5:00 A.M. UPDATE THEN ALL EYES WILL BE ON TROPICAL STORM LAURA I THINK THE INTENSIFICATION PHASE WILL START TO HEIGHTEN, GOING INTO THIS EVENING, INTO TUESDAY. AND THEN A POTENTIAL LANDFALL FOR YOUR WEDNESDAY NOW, WE'LL WATCH THE TRACK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, IS IT GOES BACK INTO THE GULF. IT'S A WARM BODY OF WATER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE UPPER 80s TO LOW 90s SO I THINK THAT RAPID INTENSIFICATION RAISEPHASE REALY STARTS TO HAPPEN SO ALL OF THE GULF COAST NEEDS TO BE AWARE. SHOULD HAVE ENERGY OFFICIALS TELLING YOU WHERE TO GO. AND UNFORTUNATELY, GUYS, THIS IS HAPPENING WITH CORONAVIRUS, AND PEOPLE NEED TO REALLY BE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS FROM MORGAN CITY TO NEW ORLEANS. LOOK AT THE STORM SURGE. THAT IS GOING TO BE AFTER THE STORM SYSTEM MAKES ITS WAY IN. THREE TO FIVE FEET ACROSS NEW ORLEANS INTO MORGAN SYSTEM THAT'S A LOOK AT THE BIG WEATHER STORIES. HERE'S A CLOSER LOOK AT YOUR DAY AHEAD. SO OUR TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE GULF COAST, 85 DEGREES AND THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THAT STORM SYSTEM TO GAIN A LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH ALSO, WATCHING THE SEVERE WEATHER THREATS FROM SALT LAKE INTO CHICAGO SO THESE STORM SYSTEMS, THEY'RE TRYING TO MATERIALIZE BUT HAVING A HARD TIME COMING TOGETHER. SO IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG 48 HOURS. GUYS  A WHOLE LOT TO WATCH. THANKS FOR THAT. THERE WAS A DEPUTY WHO HAD TO THINK FAST. THERE WAS A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO WENT INTO LABOR IN A 7/ELEVEN PARKING LOT. CHECK IT OUT  GOOD JOB. [ BABY CRYING CONGRATULATIONS IT IS A BOY.  SO HER WATER BROKE AND DEPUTY RICHARD ALLEN, JR.

I DO KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL SUFFER FOUR NOR YEARS UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THAT IS TERRIFYING  WE RELY ON THE PRESIDENT WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR COUNTRY'S LEADER TO FIX IT, BUT WE SEE ARE -- WE'RE SEEING IT'S NOT BEING FIXED.  ANYTHING TRUMP COULD DO TO EARN YOUR VOTE FOR 2020?  COMING AROUND SOCIALLY WOULD BE A HUGE STEP DEFINITELY  Reporter: SO TRUMP CAN'T JUST APPEAL TO THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THINGS THAT WILL BE HIS SET OF CHALLENGES BIDEN'S CHALLENGES WILL BE ENGAGING THEIR BASE OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS AND INCREASING THAT TURNOUT OF 71% FROM 2016.

THE OUTER BANDS ARE HITTING PANAMA CITY TO TALLAHASSEE YOU CAN SEE BY THE ROTATION OF THIS STORM SYSTEM, IT IS GOING MORE TO THE NORTH AND EAST SO WE'LL WATCH THIS FAIRLY CLOSELY AND THAT UPDATE IS GOING TO BE VERY VITAL I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE STORM SURGE ACROSS THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE, AS WELL THAT'S ROUND NUMBER ONE. THEN WE TALK ABOUT TROPICAL STORM LAURA. IT'S GOING OVER CUBA CURRENTLY AND MAINTAINING ITS STRENGTH AS IT GOES INTO THE GUFLT GULF, IT WILL CAUSE RAPID INTENSIFICATION AND GOES INTO A HURRICANE TOO BY TUESDAY EVENING.

WE DO HAVE A BIG-TIME CHANGE IN THE FORECAST I THINK NEW ORLEANS, YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR NOW EVEN THOUGH WE DO STILL HAVE THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY. YOU COULD STILL DEAL WITH SOME FLOODING RAIN BUT THIS STORM SYSTEM HAS TAKEN A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK. THERE IS NO ALERTS FOR PANAMA CITY TOTAL HAS SEE AND THEY ARE SEEING THE OUTER BANDS A LITTLE BIT OF HAIL CURRENTLY HAPPENING BUT THIS STORM SYSTEM HAS RUN INTO SOME DRIER AIR AND THAT'S ALLOWED IT TO KIND OF SHRED APART.

RUSSELL CROWE'S UNHINGED MADE ITS DOMESTIC DEBUT WHERE THEATERS HAVE STARTED TO SLOWLY REOPEN HERE. THE FILM POCKETED MORE THAN $4 MILLION OVER THE WEEKEND AND PLAYED IN ABOUT 1,800 VENUES MARKING THE WIDEST RELEASE YET SINCE THE PANDEMIC HIT AND THAT MOVE THAT POLICE USE TO END CAR CHASES FOUND IT'S CAUSED A STRING OF DEATHS AND INJURIES  Reporter: A YOUNG MAN IN A PICKUP TRUCK RUNS A RED LIGHT IN RURAL ARKANSAS AND REFUSES TO STOP FOR THE POLICE. THE HALF HOUR HIGH SPEED CHASE THIS APRIL ENDS IN A FIERY WRECK. THE TRUCK FLIPPING, LAUNCHING THE POLICE CRUISER INTO THE AIR, BUT IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. POLICE RECORDS SAY THE STATE TROOPER CAUSED THE CRASH BY BUMPING THE TRUCK AT 109 MILES AN HOUR. THE TROOPER WAS INJURED BUT THE DRIVER, 34-YEAR-OLD JUSTIN BATTENFIELD WAS KILLED  I DON'T BELIEVE IT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED HONESTLY AT THE RATE OF SPEED IT WAS GOING THEY HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE GOT BACK IN TOWN.  THERE'S A PIT MANEUVER.  Reporter: THE TROOPER USED THIS MOVE KNOWN AS THE PRECISION IMPLOEBLIZATION TECHNIQUE. AN INVESTIGATION PUBLISHED BY THE "WASHINGTON POST" FOUND THAT SINCE 2016 AT LEAST 30 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN INJURED WHEN POLICE USE THE PIT. 18 OF THOSE DEATHS CAME AFTER DRIVERS WERE SUSPECTED OF MINOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS SUCH AS SPEEDING, THE POST FOUND TEN KILLED WERE PASSENGERS AND FOUR WERE BYSTANDERS  IF USED PROPERLY IT IS A GOOD, SAFE MANEUVER AND IF USED IMPROPERLY AT HIGH SPEEDS IN THE WRONG AREA AGAINST THE WRONG VEHICLE IT'S DEADLY.  Reporter: THE MANEUVER WAS DEVELOPED DECADES AGO IN VIRGINIA WHERE OFFICERS NOW PRACTICE IT AT LOW SPEEDS ON A TRACK.  I MATCH THE VIOLATOR'S SPEED. ONCE I'M BESIDE HIM I MAKE CONTACT WITH THE TARGET AREA I'LL HOLD THAT CONTACT ON THE TARGET AREA UNTIL EVERYTHING IS SAFE AND THEN A GOOD FOLLOW THROUGH.  THEY PERFORM THE PIT ON THE STREET ABOUT 13 TIMES A YEAR AND NO ONE HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT  IF A BYSTANDER IS KILLED OR IF THE TARGET IN THE CAR IS KILLED THAT'S A FAILURE. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN LIKE THAT  THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF PIT, NO, SIR  SOME DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING NEW YORK STATE POLICE HAVE BANNED THE PIT WHILE OTHERS SUCH AS LAPD FORBID IT AT SPEEDS OVER 35 MILES AN HOUR BUT MANY LARGE POLICE AGENCIES ALLOW THE TECHNIQUE AT ANY SPEED THE "WASHINGTON POST" FOUND.  FAIRFAX COUNTY POLICE SAY THEY WOULD ONLY USE THE PIT TO STOP A D  A QUARTET OF GAME FOUR BROUGHT A BANG TO THE NBA PLAYOFFS CHECK THIS OUT  DONCIC PULLS UP IT'S GOOD!  LUKA DONCIC IS ONLY 21 YEARS OLD BUT HE IS QUICKLY BECOMING A LEGEND HE HELPED THE MAVERICKS TIE UP THEIR SERIES WITH THE CLIPPERS HE HAD A 41-TRIPLE DOUBLE. TWO TEAMS HAVE LEFT THE BUBBLE AFTER BEING SWEPT THE NETS GAVE UP A WHOPPING 150 POINTS IN THEIR FIRS THE TWIN STORMS BARRELLING TOWARD THE GULF STATES OFFICIALS IN NEW ORLEANS ARE URGING RESIDENTS TO PREP FOR BOTH IMPACTS JAY GRAY IS THERE FOR US GOOD MORNING  Reporter: GOOD MORNING, PHILLIP AND WE'RE ON BOURBON STREET RIGHT NOW USUALLY YOU'D HEAR SOME KIND OF MUSIC. THERE'S ALWAYS AN ENERGY HERE BUT THE ENTIRE FRENCH QUARTER UNUSUALLY QUIET. SOME BUSINESSES DON'T SEEM TOO WORRIED. LIKE THIS ONE JUST NEXT DOOR, THIS RESTAURANT COMPLETELY BOARDED UP WITH THE EFFECTS OF MARCOUX EXPECTED IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AND LAURA STILL LOOMING RIGHT NOW. THE BIG EASY A BIT UNEASY RIGHT NOW. WITH TWO TROPICAL SYSTEMS TARGETING THE LOUISIANA GULF COAST.  SO WE'RE GOING TO GET A RIGHT HOOK FROM MARCOU AND A LEFT HOOK FROM LAURA  SOME ARE BLOCKING OR BOARDING UP WHAT THEY CAN AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE THE ESSENTIALS TO RIDE OUT THE STORM.  STOCKING UP ON FOOD, AND TRYING TO PARK THE CAR IN THE HIGHEST POINT POSSIBLE WE CAN FIND. Reporter: OTHERS IN THIS AREA BELOW SEA LEVEL ARE HEADING FOR HIGHER GROUND.  WE CAN'T HANDLE A REGULAR RAINSTORM AND IT'S TIME TO GO.  MARCO COULD LOSE A LITTLE ENERGY THIS AFTERNOON. CURRENTLY IT'S TRACKING JUST WEST OF NEW ORLEANS LEAVING THE CITY ON THE DIRTY OR STRONG SIDE OF THE STORM LAURA IS A MUCH MORE POWERFUL SYSTEM THAT FORECASTERS SAY WILL INTENSIFY BEFORE CROSSING THE COAST.  IT'S EXPECTED TO BE A VERY STRONG CATEGORY 2. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT STRONGER AND BE A CATEGORY 3.  LASHING THE ISLANDS AS IT GROWS AND TAKES AIM AT THE GULF, EVIDENCE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE SYSTEM AND A SOBER WARNING FOR THOSE IN THE TRACK OF THE STORM.  Reporter: AND LOOK, THE TIME TO PREPARE HERE IS REALLY OVER AT THIS POINT. IN FACT, OFFICIALS WARNING OVERNIGHT THAT RESIDENTS WHO HAVE STAYED SHOULD HUNKER DOWN WHERE THEY ARE FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS OR SO.  AND ALL THIS HAPPENING AMID A GLOBAL PANDEMIC TO BOOT. ALL RIGHT.

BLAKE WAS AIRLIFTED TO A HOSPITAL A LOCAL AFFILIATE SPOKE TO HIS FIANCE  THE TWO MALE OFFICERS INSTANTLY DETAINED HIM, LIKE, PUT YOUR HANDS UP NEW YORK E QUS OR NONE OF THAT. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET DIDS CAN OUT OF THE CAR I'M LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE, HE DIDN'T DO NOTHING WRONG, JUST ASK SOME QUESTIONS FIRST BEFORE YOU PIN THIS MAN UP AGAINST THE CAR.  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SAYS OFFICERS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN PROVIDING FIRST AID. THE WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS INVESTIGATING THAT SHOOTING NOW TO BREAKING NEWS A TWIN NIGHTMARE HEADED FOR THE GULF COAST TWO TROPICAL STORMS TARGETING LOUISIANA JUST 48 HOURS APART. MARCO HAS WEAKENED DOWN, BECOMING A TROPICAL STORM. BUT AFTER WREAKING HAVOC IN THE CARIBBEAN, TROPICAL STORM LAURA IS GAINING STRENGTH. NBC METEOROLOGIST JANESSA WEBB IS TRACKING THEM FOR US. GOOD MORNING  GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. THIS JUST IN, MARCO HAS TAKEN KIND OF A DIFFERENT TRACK. I THINK THE NEXT UPDATE WE SEE FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER HAS IT GOING MORE INTO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. ALERTS ARE NOT OUT FOR THIS AREA, BUT TALLAHASSEE INTO PANAMA CITY, THIS IS TAKING MORE OF A NORTHERLY TRACK AND YOU'RE SEEING BANDS OF MOISTURE EVEN THOUGH LOUISIANA IS ON OUR RADAR, THEY WILL DEAL WITH THE STORM SURGE WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM RIGHT NOW, IT HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL SYSTEM. BEHIND THAT, WE HAVE A MAJOR HURRICANE THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BUILD. THAT IS TROPICAL STORM LAURA IS GAINING STEAM OVER THE ISLANDS YOU THINK IT WOULD START TO BE BROKEN DOWN DUE TO THE MOUNTAINS AND THE LAND INTERACTION THAT IT'S CURRENTLY SEEING. BUT IT WILL GO BACK INTO A WARM BODY OF WATER AND INTENSINTENSI. AND BY WEDNESDAY, POTENTIAL LANDFALL NEAR BATON ROUGE OR NEW ORLEANS. WE ARE EXPECTING A STORM SURGE OF 10 TO 12 FEET IN THAT AREA. WITH RAINFALL ACCUMULATION UP TO THREE FEET  SERIOUS SITUATION THERE JANESSA, THANKS FOR TRACKING THAT FOR US. NOW TO ONE OF THE MOST VISIBLE FACES IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. SHE SAID SHE'S STEPPING DOWN AT THE END OF AUGUST. KELLYANNE CONWAY IS PLANNING TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HER CHILDREN, SAYING IN PART, AS MILLIONS OF PARENTS NATIONWIDE KNOW, KIDS DOING SCHOOL FROM HOME REQUIRE A LEVEL OF ATTENTION AND VIGILANCE THAT IS UNUSUAL AT THESE TIMES THIS IS COMPLETELY MY CHOICE AND MY VOICE IT WILL BE LESS DRAMA, MORE MOMMA. HER HUSBAND ANNOUNCED HE TOO IS STEPPING AWAY FROM THE LINCOLN PROJECT TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO FAMILY MATTERS THE SEISMIC SHIFT FOR THE COUPLE COMES AFTER A TWEET STORM FROM THEIR 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, CLAUDIA CONWAY, WHO SAID SHE'S PUSHING FOR EMANCIPATION LET'S TURN TO THE MASSIVE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. THE SMOKE THERE IS SO THICK THE HAZE IS EVEN HITTING STATES IN THE MIDWEST. AND NOW MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY ARE BEING CALLED UP TO HELP. NBC'S STEVE PATTERSON IS THERE ON THE FRONTLINES.  WE'LL HAVE THAT STORY IN A MOMENT NOW TO NEW MEDICAL TREATMENT TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS. IT'S BEEN GIVEN EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION. SUNDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THE APPROVAL OF CONVALESCENT PLASMA, WHICH USES BLOOD FROM COVID-19 PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECOVERED BUT SOME ARE STILL QUESTIONING THE EFFECTIVENESS.  LOOKS LIKE WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THAT, AS WELL LET'S MOVE NOW TO PRESIDENT TRUMP FACING A NEW CONTROVERSY FROM WITHIN HIS OWN FAMILY IN A SECRET RECORDING, THE PRESIDENT'S SISTER, MARIANNE TRUMP BARRY, IS HEARD SAYING HE HAS NO PRINCIPLES, THAT AUDIO WAS FIRST OBTAINED BY "THE WASHINGTON POST," AND HAS SINCE BEEN OBTAINED BY NBC NEWS. LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE THIS REPORT NOW FROM JENNIFER JOHNSON. [ NO AUDIO ]  ALL RIGHT CLEARLY HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH OUR STORIES HERE LET'S GO BACK OVER TO METEOROLOGIST JANESSA WEBB WHO IS TRACKING THOSE TWO MONSTER STORMS IN THE GULF JANESSA?  LET ME SHOW YOU RADAR RIGHT NOW. CURRENTLY, SEEING MARCO AND THE FORECAST HAS REALLY CHANGED. JUST IN THE LAST HOUR. IT DEFINITELY HAS WEAKENED BACK DOWN TO A TROPICAL STORM SYSTEM DUE TO IT JUST BEING REALLY DISORGANIZED, YOU CAN SEE BANDS OF MOISTURE HITTING THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. BUT I THINK THE CENTER OF THIS STORM IS GOING TO GO MORE TOWARD THE NORTH. NO ALERTS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE ACROSS THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO GET AWARE, BECAUSE A STORM SURGE IS GOING TO BE HEIGHTENED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON AND INTO YOUR EVENING. AND ALSO WITH MARCO, IT'S STARTING TO MOVE AT A FASTER SPEED. SO FOR THE FORECAST FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER, IT SAID IT WAS GOING TO VEER MORE TO THE WEST, BUT I THINK THAT WILL CHANGE AT THE 5:00 A.M. UPDATE THEN ALL EYES WILL BE ON TROPICAL STORM LAURA I THINK THE INTENSIFICATION PHASE WILL START TO HEIGHTEN, GOING INTO THIS EVENING, INTO TUESDAY. AND THEN A POTENTIAL LANDFALL FOR YOUR WEDNESDAY NOW, WE'LL WATCH THE TRACK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, IS IT GOES BACK INTO THE GULF. IT'S A WARM BODY OF WATER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE UPPER 80s TO LOW 90s SO I THINK THAT RAPID INTENSIFICATION RAISEPHASE REALY STARTS TO HAPPEN SO ALL OF THE GULF COAST NEEDS TO BE AWARE. SHOULD HAVE ENERGY OFFICIALS TELLING YOU WHERE TO GO. AND UNFORTUNATELY, GUYS, THIS IS HAPPENING WITH CORONAVIRUS, AND PEOPLE NEED TO REALLY BE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS FROM MORGAN CITY TO NEW ORLEANS. LOOK AT THE STORM SURGE. THAT IS GOING TO BE AFTER THE STORM SYSTEM MAKES ITS WAY IN. THREE TO FIVE FEET ACROSS NEW ORLEANS INTO MORGAN SYSTEM THAT'S A LOOK AT THE BIG WEATHER STORIES. HERE'S A CLOSER LOOK AT YOUR DAY AHEAD. SO OUR TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE GULF COAST, 85 DEGREES AND THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THAT STORM SYSTEM TO GAIN A LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH ALSO, WATCHING THE SEVERE WEATHER THREATS FROM SALT LAKE INTO CHICAGO SO THESE STORM SYSTEMS, THEY'RE TRYING TO MATERIALIZE BUT HAVING A HARD TIME COMING TOGETHER. SO IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG 48 HOURS. GUYS  A WHOLE LOT TO WATCH. THANKS FOR THAT. THERE WAS A DEPUTY WHO HAD TO THINK FAST. THERE WAS A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO WENT INTO LABOR IN A 7/ELEVEN PARKING LOT. CHECK IT OUT  GOOD JOB. [ BABY CRYING CONGRATULATIONS IT IS A BOY.  SO HER WATER BROKE AND DEPUTY RICHARD ALLEN, JR.

I DO KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL SUFFER FOUR NOR YEARS UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THAT IS TERRIFYING  WE RELY ON THE PRESIDENT WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR COUNTRY'S LEADER TO FIX IT, BUT WE SEE ARE -- WE'RE SEEING IT'S NOT BEING FIXED.  ANYTHING TRUMP COULD DO TO EARN YOUR VOTE FOR 2020?  COMING AROUND SOCIALLY WOULD BE A HUGE STEP DEFINITELY  Reporter: SO TRUMP CAN'T JUST APPEAL TO THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THINGS THAT WILL BE HIS SET OF CHALLENGES BIDEN'S CHALLENGES WILL BE ENGAGING THEIR BASE OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS AND INCREASING THAT TURNOUT OF 71% FROM 2016.

Reporter: JOINED BY THE HEAD OF THE FDA, THIS DECISION COMES AFTER INTERNAL SCIENTIFIC DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE FDA HAD ENOUGH DATA AND AFTER THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED FDA STAFF ON TWITTER OF DELAYING ACTION UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.  THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HOLDUP, BUT WE BROKE THE LOG JAM OVER THE LAST WEEK, THAT'S MY VERY STRONG OPINION. THAT'S FOR POLITICAL REASONS THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS BUT LIFE AND DEATH.

A MAJOR SHAKEUP AT THE WHITE HOUSE AS ONE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOST LOYAL ADVISERS STEPS DOWN DOUBLE TROUBLE IN THE GULF, AS MARCO AND LAURA, TWO MAJOR STORMS, THREATEN THE GULF COAST STATES WITH A ONE-TWO PUNCH. STREAMING BIG. THE INSPIRING STORY OF A MAN WHO WAS A SECURITY GUARD AT A HOSPITAL AND NOW RETURNING WITH A BRAND NEW JOB. "EARLY TODAY" STARTS RIGHT NOW  GOOD MONDAY MORNING I'M PHILIP MENA.  AND I'M FRANCES RIVERA. WE BEGIN WITH THAT BREAKING NEWS A STATE OF EMERGENCY CURFEW HAS BEEN DECLARED FOR KENOSHA, WISCONSIN. OUTRAGED PEOPLE FILLING THE STREETS ONCE AGAIN AFTER A 29-YEAR-OLD MAN WAS SHOT BY POLICE VIDEO OF THE INCIDENT QUICKLY WENT VIRAL ONLINE. AND A WARNING, IT MAY BE DISTURBING TO SEE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE RECORDING, BUT A MAN IDENTIFIED AS JACOB BLAKE COULD BE SEEN MOVING TO OPEN A CAR DOOR AND MULTIPLE SHOTS ARE FIRED. BLAKE WAS AIRLIFTED TO A HOSPITAL A LOCAL AFFILIATE SPOKE TO HIS FIANCE  THE TWO MALE OFFICERS INSTANTLY DETAINED HIM, LIKE, PUT YOUR HANDS UP NEW YORK E QUS OR NONE OF THAT. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET DIDS CAN OUT OF THE CAR I'M LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE, HE DIDN'T DO NOTHING WRONG, JUST ASK SOME QUESTIONS FIRST BEFORE YOU PIN THIS MAN UP AGAINST THE CAR.  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SAYS OFFICERS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN PROVIDING FIRST AID. THE WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS INVESTIGATING THAT SHOOTING NOW TO BREAKING NEWS A TWIN NIGHTMARE HEADED FOR THE GULF COAST TWO TROPICAL STORMS TARGETING LOUISIANA JUST 48 HOURS APART. MARCO HAS WEAKENED DOWN, BECOMING A TROPICAL STORM. BUT AFTER WREAKING HAVOC IN THE CARIBBEAN, TROPICAL STORM LAURA IS GAINING STRENGTH. NBC METEOROLOGIST JANESSA WEBB IS TRACKING THEM FOR US. GOOD MORNING  GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. THIS JUST IN, MARCO HAS TAKEN KIND OF A DIFFERENT TRACK. I THINK THE NEXT UPDATE WE SEE FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER HAS IT GOING MORE INTO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. ALERTS ARE NOT OUT FOR THIS AREA, BUT TALLAHASSEE INTO PANAMA CITY, THIS IS TAKING MORE OF A NORTHERLY TRACK AND YOU'RE SEEING BANDS OF MOISTURE EVEN THOUGH LOUISIANA IS ON OUR RADAR, THEY WILL DEAL WITH THE STORM SURGE WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM RIGHT NOW, IT HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL SYSTEM. BEHIND THAT, WE HAVE A MAJOR HURRICANE THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BUILD. THAT IS TROPICAL STORM LAURA IS GAINING STEAM OVER THE ISLANDS YOU THINK IT WOULD START TO BE BROKEN DOWN DUE TO THE MOUNTAINS AND THE LAND INTERACTION THAT IT'S CURRENTLY SEEING. BUT IT WILL GO BACK INTO A WARM BODY OF WATER AND INTENSINTENSI. AND BY WEDNESDAY, POTENTIAL LANDFALL NEAR BATON ROUGE OR NEW ORLEANS. WE ARE EXPECTING A STORM SURGE OF 10 TO 12 FEET IN THAT AREA. WITH RAINFALL ACCUMULATION UP TO THREE FEET  SERIOUS SITUATION THERE JANESSA, THANKS FOR TRACKING THAT FOR US. NOW TO ONE OF THE MOST VISIBLE FACES IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. SHE SAID SHE'S STEPPING DOWN AT THE END OF AUGUST. KELLYANNE CONWAY IS PLANNING TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HER CHILDREN, SAYING IN PART, AS MILLIONS OF PARENTS NATIONWIDE KNOW, KIDS DOING SCHOOL FROM HOME REQUIRE A LEVEL OF ATTENTION AND VIGILANCE THAT IS UNUSUAL AT THESE TIMES THIS IS COMPLETELY MY CHOICE AND MY VOICE IT WILL BE LESS DRAMA, MORE MOMMA. HER HUSBAND ANNOUNCED HE TOO IS STEPPING AWAY FROM THE LINCOLN PROJECT TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO FAMILY MATTERS THE SEISMIC SHIFT FOR THE COUPLE COMES AFTER A TWEET STORM FROM THEIR 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, CLAUDIA CONWAY, WHO SAID SHE'S PUSHING FOR EMANCIPATION LET'S TURN TO THE MASSIVE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. THE SMOKE THERE IS SO THICK THE HAZE IS EVEN HITTING STATES IN THE MIDWEST. AND NOW MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY ARE BEING CALLED UP TO HELP. NBC'S STEVE PATTERSON IS THERE ON THE FRONTLINES.  WE'LL HAVE THAT STORY IN A MOMENT NOW TO NEW MEDICAL TREATMENT TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS. IT'S BEEN GIVEN EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION. SUNDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THE APPROVAL OF CONVALESCENT PLASMA, WHICH USES BLOOD FROM COVID-19 PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECOVERED BUT SOME ARE STILL QUESTIONING THE EFFECTIVENESS.  LOOKS LIKE WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THAT, AS WELL LET'S MOVE NOW TO PRESIDENT TRUMP FACING A NEW CONTROVERSY FROM WITHIN HIS OWN FAMILY IN A SECRET RECORDING, THE PRESIDENT'S SISTER, MARIANNE TRUMP BARRY, IS HEARD SAYING HE HAS NO PRINCIPLES, THAT AUDIO WAS FIRST OBTAINED BY "THE WASHINGTON POST," AND HAS SINCE BEEN OBTAINED BY NBC NEWS. LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE THIS REPORT NOW FROM JENNIFER JOHNSON. [ NO AUDIO ]  ALL RIGHT CLEARLY HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH OUR STORIES HERE LET'S GO BACK OVER TO METEOROLOGIST JANESSA WEBB WHO IS TRACKING THOSE TWO MONSTER STORMS IN THE GULF JANESSA?  LET ME SHOW YOU RADAR RIGHT NOW. CURRENTLY, SEEING MARCO AND THE FORECAST HAS REALLY CHANGED. JUST IN THE LAST HOUR. IT DEFINITELY HAS WEAKENED BACK DOWN TO A TROPICAL STORM SYSTEM DUE TO IT JUST BEING REALLY DISORGANIZED, YOU CAN SEE BANDS OF MOISTURE HITTING THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. BUT I THINK THE CENTER OF THIS STORM IS GOING TO GO MORE TOWARD THE NORTH. NO ALERTS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE ACROSS THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO GET AWARE, BECAUSE A STORM SURGE IS GOING TO BE HEIGHTENED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON AND INTO YOUR EVENING. AND ALSO WITH MARCO, IT'S STARTING TO MOVE AT A FASTER SPEED. SO FOR THE FORECAST FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER, IT SAID IT WAS GOING TO VEER MORE TO THE WEST, BUT I THINK THAT WILL CHANGE AT THE 5:00 A.M. UPDATE THEN ALL EYES WILL BE ON TROPICAL STORM LAURA I THINK THE INTENSIFICATION PHASE WILL START TO HEIGHTEN, GOING INTO THIS EVENING, INTO TUESDAY. AND THEN A POTENTIAL LANDFALL FOR YOUR WEDNESDAY NOW, WE'LL WATCH THE TRACK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, IS IT GOES BACK INTO THE GULF. IT'S A WARM BODY OF WATER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE UPPER 80s TO LOW 90s SO I THINK THAT RAPID INTENSIFICATION RAISEPHASE REALY STARTS TO HAPPEN SO ALL OF THE GULF COAST NEEDS TO BE AWARE. SHOULD HAVE ENERGY OFFICIALS TELLING YOU WHERE TO GO. AND UNFORTUNATELY, GUYS, THIS IS HAPPENING WITH CORONAVIRUS, AND PEOPLE NEED TO REALLY BE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS FROM MORGAN CITY TO NEW ORLEANS. LOOK AT THE STORM SURGE. THAT IS GOING TO BE AFTER THE STORM SYSTEM MAKES ITS WAY IN. THREE TO FIVE FEET ACROSS NEW ORLEANS INTO MORGAN SYSTEM THAT'S A LOOK AT THE BIG WEATHER STORIES. HERE'S A CLOSER LOOK AT YOUR DAY AHEAD. SO OUR TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE GULF COAST, 85 DEGREES AND THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THAT STORM SYSTEM TO GAIN A LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH ALSO, WATCHING THE SEVERE WEATHER THREATS FROM SALT LAKE INTO CHICAGO SO THESE STORM SYSTEMS, THEY'RE TRYING TO MATERIALIZE BUT HAVING A HARD TIME COMING TOGETHER. SO IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG 48 HOURS. GUYS  A WHOLE LOT TO WATCH. THANKS FOR THAT. THERE WAS A DEPUTY WHO HAD TO THINK FAST. THERE WAS A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO WENT INTO LABOR IN A 7/ELEVEN PARKING LOT. CHECK IT OUT  GOOD JOB. [ BABY CRYING CONGRATULATIONS IT IS A BOY.  SO HER WATER BROKE AND DEPUTY RICHARD ALLEN, JR.

I DO KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL SUFFER FOUR NOR YEARS UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THAT IS TERRIFYING  WE RELY ON THE PRESIDENT WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR COUNTRY'S LEADER TO FIX IT, BUT WE SEE ARE -- WE'RE SEEING IT'S NOT BEING FIXED.  ANYTHING TRUMP COULD DO TO EARN YOUR VOTE FOR 2020?  COMING AROUND SOCIALLY WOULD BE A HUGE STEP DEFINITELY  Reporter: SO TRUMP CAN'T JUST APPEAL TO THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THINGS THAT WILL BE HIS SET OF CHALLENGES BIDEN'S CHALLENGES WILL BE ENGAGING THEIR BASE OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS AND INCREASING THAT TURNOUT OF 71% FROM 2016.

THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HOLDUP, BUT WE BROKE THE LOG JAM OVER THE LAST WEEK, THAT'S MY VERY STRONG OPINION. THAT'S FOR POLITICAL REASONS THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS BUT LIFE AND DEATH.

KELLY O'DONNELL HAS MORE. I'M PLEASED TO MAKE A TRULY HISTORIC ANNOUNCEMENT.  Reporter: THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED A NEW STEP FOR A CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT, A TEMPORARY EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION FOR CONVALESCE PLASMA JOINED BY THE HEAD OF THE FDA, THIS DECISION COMES AFTER INTERNAL SCIENTIFIC DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE FDA HAD ENOUGH DATA AND AFTER THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED FDA STAFF ON TWITTER OF DELAYING ACTION UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.  WE BROKE THE LOG JAM OVER THE LAST WEEK. IT'S MY OPINION, VERY POLITICAL REASONS. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH LIFE OR DEATH.  Reporter: THE PRESIDENT CAN TRY TO DISTRACT THE NEGATIVE PORTRAYAL OF HIS OLD ORE SISTER.

AND HEADED FOR NEW ORLEANS ON THE 15th ANNIVERSARY OF HURRICANE KATRINA.  JANESSA WEBB IS TRACKING THOSE STORMS THERE'S SO MUCH CHANGING  GOOD MORNING. WE DO HAVE A BIG-TIME CHANGE IN THE FORECAST I THINK NEW ORLEANS, YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR NOW EVEN THOUGH WE DO STILL HAVE THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY. YOU COULD STILL DEAL WITH SOME FLOODING RAIN BUT THIS STORM SYSTEM HAS TAKEN A MORE NORTHWESTERLY TRACK. THERE IS NO ALERTS FOR PANAMA CITY TOTAL HAS SEE AND THEY ARE SEEING THE OUTER BANDS A LITTLE BIT OF HAIL CURRENTLY HAPPENING BUT THIS STORM SYSTEM HAS RUN INTO SOME DRIER AIR AND THAT'S ALLOWED IT TO KIND OF SHRED APART. WE'LL STILL WATCH IT AS THE FLOODING POTENTIAL AND STORM SURGE I THINK STILL COULD BE HEFTY ACROSS THE FLORIDA POOND BUT AS I SAID, NO ALERLTS BUT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE AS MARCO LIFTS TO THE NORTH AND WEST. BEHIND THAT IS TROPICAL STORM LAURA. WE'RE EXPECTING THAT TO INTENSIFY. THAT'S A LOOK AT THE BIG WEATHER STORY OF THE DAY NOW A CLOSER LOOK AT YOUR DAY AHEAD. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE GULF COAST ARE VERY WARM. 95 DEGREES FOR HOUSTON, A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE THIS AFTERNOON NO RAIN IN THE FORECAST AND THE STORM SYSTEMS THEY'LL START TO HEAT UP FOR CHICAGO THIS AFTERNOON INTO GREEN LEADING THE NEWS ON WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS 42nd BIRTHDAY, THE SPORTS WORLD REMEMBERED KOBE BRYANT A TOUCHING TRIBUTE TO HER LATE HUSBAND SAYING IN PART, I'M SO THANKFUL I HAVE PIECES OF HEAVEN HERE ON EARTH THANKS TO YOU.  AND NIKE RELEASED A VIDEO COMMEMORATING BRYANT REPRESENTING HIS TWO JERSEY NUMBERS IN THE NBA 8 AND 24. ROGER GOODELL SAT DOWN FOR AN IN DEPTH ONE ON ONE ON THE POD CAST UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS WITH A BLACK MAN HE SAYS HE WISHED HE LISTENED TO COLIN KAEPERNICK  IF YOU WERE TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS YOUR REMORSE, APOLOGIZE TO KAEPERNICK, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?  WELL, THE FIRST THING I'D SAY IS I WISH WE HAD LISTENED EARLIER, KAP, TO WHAT YOU WERE KNEELING ABOUT AND WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO BRING ATTENTION TO WE'D INVITED HIM IN SEVERAL TIMES TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION, HAVE THE DIALOG. I WISH WE HAD THE BENEFIT OF THAT WE NEVER DID  THE COMMISSIONER GOES O THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN THIS WORLD TODAY. WE SEEM TO HAVE DEVELOPED A FUNDAMENTAL ABILITY TO APOLOGIZE TO ANYONE.  RUSSELL CROWE'S UNHINGED MADE ITS DOMESTIC DEBUT WHERE THEATERS HAVE STARTED TO SLOWLY REOPEN HERE. THE FILM POCKETED MORE THAN $4 MILLION OVER THE WEEKEND AND PLAYED IN ABOUT 1,800 VENUES MARKING THE WIDEST RELEASE YET SINCE THE PANDEMIC HIT AND THAT MOVE THAT POLICE USE TO END CAR CHASES FOUND IT'S CAUSED A STRING OF DEATHS AND INJURIES  Reporter: A YOUNG MAN IN A PICKUP TRUCK RUNS A RED LIGHT IN RURAL ARKANSAS AND REFUSES TO STOP FOR THE POLICE. THE HALF HOUR HIGH SPEED CHASE THIS APRIL ENDS IN A FIERY WRECK. THE TRUCK FLIPPING, LAUNCHING THE POLICE CRUISER INTO THE AIR, BUT IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT. POLICE RECORDS SAY THE STATE TROOPER CAUSED THE CRASH BY BUMPING THE TRUCK AT 109 MILES AN HOUR. THE TROOPER WAS INJURED BUT THE DRIVER, 34-YEAR-OLD JUSTIN BATTENFIELD WAS KILLED  I DON'T BELIEVE IT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED HONESTLY AT THE RATE OF SPEED IT WAS GOING THEY HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE GOT BACK IN TOWN.  THERE'S A PIT MANEUVER.  Reporter: THE TROOPER USED THIS MOVE KNOWN AS THE PRECISION IMPLOEBLIZATION TECHNIQUE. AN INVESTIGATION PUBLISHED BY THE "WASHINGTON POST" FOUND THAT SINCE 2016 AT LEAST 30 PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND HUNDREDS HAVE BEEN INJURED WHEN POLICE USE THE PIT. 18 OF THOSE DEATHS CAME AFTER DRIVERS WERE SUSPECTED OF MINOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS SUCH AS SPEEDING, THE POST FOUND TEN KILLED WERE PASSENGERS AND FOUR WERE BYSTANDERS  IF USED PROPERLY IT IS A GOOD, SAFE MANEUVER AND IF USED IMPROPERLY AT HIGH SPEEDS IN THE WRONG AREA AGAINST THE WRONG VEHICLE IT'S DEADLY.  Reporter: THE MANEUVER WAS DEVELOPED DECADES AGO IN VIRGINIA WHERE OFFICERS NOW PRACTICE IT AT LOW SPEEDS ON A TRACK.  I MATCH THE VIOLATOR'S SPEED. ONCE I'M BESIDE HIM I MAKE CONTACT WITH THE TARGET AREA I'LL HOLD THAT CONTACT ON THE TARGET AREA UNTIL EVERYTHING IS SAFE AND THEN A GOOD FOLLOW THROUGH.  THEY PERFORM THE PIT ON THE STREET ABOUT 13 TIMES A YEAR AND NO ONE HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT  IF A BYSTANDER IS KILLED OR IF THE TARGET IN THE CAR IS KILLED THAT'S A FAILURE. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN LIKE THAT  THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF PIT, NO, SIR  SOME DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING NEW YORK STATE POLICE HAVE BANNED THE PIT WHILE OTHERS SUCH AS LAPD FORBID IT AT SPEEDS OVER 35 MILES AN HOUR BUT MANY LARGE POLICE AGENCIES ALLOW THE TECHNIQUE AT ANY SPEED THE "WASHINGTON POST" FOUND.  FAIRFAX COUNTY POLICE SAY THEY WOULD ONLY USE THE PIT TO STOP A D  A QUARTET OF GAME FOUR BROUGHT A BANG TO THE NBA PLAYOFFS CHECK THIS OUT  DONCIC PULLS UP IT'S GOOD!  LUKA DONCIC IS ONLY 21 YEARS OLD BUT HE IS QUICKLY BECOMING A LEGEND HE HELPED THE MAVERICKS TIE UP THEIR SERIES WITH THE CLIPPERS HE HAD A 41-TRIPLE DOUBLE. TWO TEAMS HAVE LEFT THE BUBBLE AFTER BEING SWEPT THE NETS GAVE UP A WHOPPING 150 POINTS IN THEIR FIRS THE TWIN STORMS BARRELLING TOWARD THE GULF STATES OFFICIALS IN NEW ORLEANS ARE URGING RESIDENTS TO PREP FOR BOTH IMPACTS JAY GRAY IS THERE FOR US GOOD MORNING  Reporter: GOOD MORNING, PHILLIP AND WE'RE ON BOURBON STREET RIGHT NOW USUALLY YOU'D HEAR SOME KIND OF MUSIC. THERE'S ALWAYS AN ENERGY HERE BUT THE ENTIRE FRENCH QUARTER UNUSUALLY QUIET. SOME BUSINESSES DON'T SEEM TOO WORRIED. LIKE THIS ONE JUST NEXT DOOR, THIS RESTAURANT COMPLETELY BOARDED UP WITH THE EFFECTS OF MARCOUX EXPECTED IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AND LAURA STILL LOOMING RIGHT NOW. THE BIG EASY A BIT UNEASY RIGHT NOW. WITH TWO TROPICAL SYSTEMS TARGETING THE LOUISIANA GULF COAST.  SO WE'RE GOING TO GET A RIGHT HOOK FROM MARCOU AND A LEFT HOOK FROM LAURA  SOME ARE BLOCKING OR BOARDING UP WHAT THEY CAN AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE THE ESSENTIALS TO RIDE OUT THE STORM.  STOCKING UP ON FOOD, AND TRYING TO PARK THE CAR IN THE HIGHEST POINT POSSIBLE WE CAN FIND. Reporter: OTHERS IN THIS AREA BELOW SEA LEVEL ARE HEADING FOR HIGHER GROUND.  WE CAN'T HANDLE A REGULAR RAINSTORM AND IT'S TIME TO GO.  MARCO COULD LOSE A LITTLE ENERGY THIS AFTERNOON. CURRENTLY IT'S TRACKING JUST WEST OF NEW ORLEANS LEAVING THE CITY ON THE DIRTY OR STRONG SIDE OF THE STORM LAURA IS A MUCH MORE POWERFUL SYSTEM THAT FORECASTERS SAY WILL INTENSIFY BEFORE CROSSING THE COAST.  IT'S EXPECTED TO BE A VERY STRONG CATEGORY 2. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT STRONGER AND BE A CATEGORY 3.  LASHING THE ISLANDS AS IT GROWS AND TAKES AIM AT THE GULF, EVIDENCE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE SYSTEM AND A SOBER WARNING FOR THOSE IN THE TRACK OF THE STORM.  Reporter: AND LOOK, THE TIME TO PREPARE HERE IS REALLY OVER AT THIS POINT. IN FACT, OFFICIALS WARNING OVERNIGHT THAT RESIDENTS WHO HAVE STAYED SHOULD HUNKER DOWN WHERE THEY ARE FOR THE NEXT 72 HOURS OR SO.  AND ALL THIS HAPPENING AMID A GLOBAL PANDEMIC TO BOOT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.  OF COURSE THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE TRACK. LET'S TURN TO JANESSA WHO'S WATCHING THE TWO STORMS.  WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING MARCO START TO FALL APART BUT LAURA, WE ARE SEEING FLOODING RAIN ACROSS HAITI INTO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC THE PHOTOS ARE VERY DISTURBING AS THE FLOOD WAT WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE BREAKING NEWS STORIES THIS MORNING.

A MAJOR SHAKEUP AT THE WHITE HOUSE AS ONE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOST LOYAL ADVISERS STEPS DOWN DOUBLE TROUBLE IN THE GULF, AS MARCO AND LAURA, TWO MAJOR STORMS, THREATEN THE GULF COAST STATES WITH A ONE-TWO PUNCH. STREAMING BIG. THE INSPIRING STORY OF A MAN WHO WAS A SECURITY GUARD AT A HOSPITAL AND NOW RETURNING WITH A BRAND NEW JOB. "EARLY TODAY" STARTS RIGHT NOW  GOOD MONDAY MORNING I'M PHILIP MENA.

OUTRAGED PEOPLE FILLING THE STREETS ONCE AGAIN AFTER A 29-YEAR-OLD MAN WAS SHOT BY POLICE VIDEO OF THE INCIDENT QUICKLY WENT VIRAL ONLINE. AND A WARNING, IT MAY BE DISTURBING TO SEE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE RECORDING, BUT A MAN IDENTIFIED AS JACOB BLAKE COULD BE SEEN MOVING TO OPEN A CAR DOOR AND MULTIPLE SHOTS ARE FIRED. BLAKE WAS AIRLIFTED TO A HOSPITAL A LOCAL AFFILIATE SPOKE TO HIS FIANCE  THE TWO MALE OFFICERS INSTANTLY DETAINED HIM, LIKE, PUT YOUR HANDS UP NEW YORK E QUS OR NONE OF THAT. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET DIDS CAN OUT OF THE CAR I'M LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE, HE DIDN'T DO NOTHING WRONG, JUST ASK SOME QUESTIONS FIRST BEFORE YOU PIN THIS MAN UP AGAINST THE CAR.  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SAYS OFFICERS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN PROVIDING FIRST AID. THE WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS INVESTIGATING THAT SHOOTING NOW TO BREAKING NEWS A TWIN NIGHTMARE HEADED FOR THE GULF COAST TWO TROPICAL STORMS TARGETING LOUISIANA JUST 48 HOURS APART. MARCO HAS WEAKENED DOWN, BECOMING A TROPICAL STORM. BUT AFTER WREAKING HAVOC IN THE CARIBBEAN, TROPICAL STORM LAURA IS GAINING STRENGTH. NBC METEOROLOGIST JANESSA WEBB IS TRACKING THEM FOR US. GOOD MORNING  GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. THIS JUST IN, MARCO HAS TAKEN KIND OF A DIFFERENT TRACK. I THINK THE NEXT UPDATE WE SEE FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER HAS IT GOING MORE INTO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. ALERTS ARE NOT OUT FOR THIS AREA, BUT TALLAHASSEE INTO PANAMA CITY, THIS IS TAKING MORE OF A NORTHERLY TRACK AND YOU'RE SEEING BANDS OF MOISTURE EVEN THOUGH LOUISIANA IS ON OUR RADAR, THEY WILL DEAL WITH THE STORM SURGE WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM RIGHT NOW, IT HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL SYSTEM. BEHIND THAT, WE HAVE A MAJOR HURRICANE THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BUILD. THAT IS TROPICAL STORM LAURA IS GAINING STEAM OVER THE ISLANDS YOU THINK IT WOULD START TO BE BROKEN DOWN DUE TO THE MOUNTAINS AND THE LAND INTERACTION THAT IT'S CURRENTLY SEEING. BUT IT WILL GO BACK INTO A WARM BODY OF WATER AND INTENSINTENSI. AND BY WEDNESDAY, POTENTIAL LANDFALL NEAR BATON ROUGE OR NEW ORLEANS. WE ARE EXPECTING A STORM SURGE OF 10 TO 12 FEET IN THAT AREA. WITH RAINFALL ACCUMULATION UP TO THREE FEET  SERIOUS SITUATION THERE JANESSA, THANKS FOR TRACKING THAT FOR US. NOW TO ONE OF THE MOST VISIBLE FACES IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. SHE SAID SHE'S STEPPING DOWN AT THE END OF AUGUST. KELLYANNE CONWAY IS PLANNING TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HER CHILDREN, SAYING IN PART, AS MILLIONS OF PARENTS NATIONWIDE KNOW, KIDS DOING SCHOOL FROM HOME REQUIRE A LEVEL OF ATTENTION AND VIGILANCE THAT IS UNUSUAL AT THESE TIMES THIS IS COMPLETELY MY CHOICE AND MY VOICE IT WILL BE LESS DRAMA, MORE MOMMA. HER HUSBAND ANNOUNCED HE TOO IS STEPPING AWAY FROM THE LINCOLN PROJECT TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO FAMILY MATTERS THE SEISMIC SHIFT FOR THE COUPLE COMES AFTER A TWEET STORM FROM THEIR 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, CLAUDIA CONWAY, WHO SAID SHE'S PUSHING FOR EMANCIPATION LET'S TURN TO THE MASSIVE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. THE SMOKE THERE IS SO THICK THE HAZE IS EVEN HITTING STATES IN THE MIDWEST. AND NOW MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY ARE BEING CALLED UP TO HELP. NBC'S STEVE PATTERSON IS THERE ON THE FRONTLINES.  WE'LL HAVE THAT STORY IN A MOMENT NOW TO NEW MEDICAL TREATMENT TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS. IT'S BEEN GIVEN EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION. SUNDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THE APPROVAL OF CONVALESCENT PLASMA, WHICH USES BLOOD FROM COVID-19 PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECOVERED BUT SOME ARE STILL QUESTIONING THE EFFECTIVENESS.  LOOKS LIKE WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THAT, AS WELL LET'S MOVE NOW TO PRESIDENT TRUMP FACING A NEW CONTROVERSY FROM WITHIN HIS OWN FAMILY IN A SECRET RECORDING, THE PRESIDENT'S SISTER, MARIANNE TRUMP BARRY, IS HEARD SAYING HE HAS NO PRINCIPLES, THAT AUDIO WAS FIRST OBTAINED BY "THE WASHINGTON POST," AND HAS SINCE BEEN OBTAINED BY NBC NEWS. LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE THIS REPORT NOW FROM JENNIFER JOHNSON. [ NO AUDIO ]  ALL RIGHT CLEARLY HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH OUR STORIES HERE LET'S GO BACK OVER TO METEOROLOGIST JANESSA WEBB WHO IS TRACKING THOSE TWO MONSTER STORMS IN THE GULF JANESSA?  LET ME SHOW YOU RADAR RIGHT NOW. CURRENTLY, SEEING MARCO AND THE FORECAST HAS REALLY CHANGED. JUST IN THE LAST HOUR. IT DEFINITELY HAS WEAKENED BACK DOWN TO A TROPICAL STORM SYSTEM DUE TO IT JUST BEING REALLY DISORGANIZED, YOU CAN SEE BANDS OF MOISTURE HITTING THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. BUT I THINK THE CENTER OF THIS STORM IS GOING TO GO MORE TOWARD THE NORTH. NO ALERTS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE ACROSS THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO GET AWARE, BECAUSE A STORM SURGE IS GOING TO BE HEIGHTENED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON AND INTO YOUR EVENING. AND ALSO WITH MARCO, IT'S STARTING TO MOVE AT A FASTER SPEED. SO FOR THE FORECAST FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER, IT SAID IT WAS GOING TO VEER MORE TO THE WEST, BUT I THINK THAT WILL CHANGE AT THE 5:00 A.M. UPDATE THEN ALL EYES WILL BE ON TROPICAL STORM LAURA I THINK THE INTENSIFICATION PHASE WILL START TO HEIGHTEN, GOING INTO THIS EVENING, INTO TUESDAY. AND THEN A POTENTIAL LANDFALL FOR YOUR WEDNESDAY NOW, WE'LL WATCH THE TRACK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, IS IT GOES BACK INTO THE GULF. IT'S A WARM BODY OF WATER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE UPPER 80s TO LOW 90s SO I THINK THAT RAPID INTENSIFICATION RAISEPHASE REALY STARTS TO HAPPEN SO ALL OF THE GULF COAST NEEDS TO BE AWARE. SHOULD HAVE ENERGY OFFICIALS TELLING YOU WHERE TO GO. AND UNFORTUNATELY, GUYS, THIS IS HAPPENING WITH CORONAVIRUS, AND PEOPLE NEED TO REALLY BE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS FROM MORGAN CITY TO NEW ORLEANS. LOOK AT THE STORM SURGE. THAT IS GOING TO BE AFTER THE STORM SYSTEM MAKES ITS WAY IN. THREE TO FIVE FEET ACROSS NEW ORLEANS INTO MORGAN SYSTEM THAT'S A LOOK AT THE BIG WEATHER STORIES. HERE'S A CLOSER LOOK AT YOUR DAY AHEAD. SO OUR TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE GULF COAST, 85 DEGREES AND THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THAT STORM SYSTEM TO GAIN A LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH ALSO, WATCHING THE SEVERE WEATHER THREATS FROM SALT LAKE INTO CHICAGO SO THESE STORM SYSTEMS, THEY'RE TRYING TO MATERIALIZE BUT HAVING A HARD TIME COMING TOGETHER. SO IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG 48 HOURS. GUYS  A WHOLE LOT TO WATCH. THANKS FOR THAT. THERE WAS A DEPUTY WHO HAD TO THINK FAST. THERE WAS A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO WENT INTO LABOR IN A 7/ELEVEN PARKING LOT. CHECK IT OUT  GOOD JOB. [ BABY CRYING CONGRATULATIONS IT IS A BOY.  SO HER WATER BROKE AND DEPUTY RICHARD ALLEN, JR.

I DO KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL SUFFER FOUR NOR YEARS UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THAT IS TERRIFYING  WE RELY ON THE PRESIDENT WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR COUNTRY'S LEADER TO FIX IT, BUT WE SEE ARE -- WE'RE SEEING IT'S NOT BEING FIXED.  ANYTHING TRUMP COULD DO TO EARN YOUR VOTE FOR 2020?  COMING AROUND SOCIALLY WOULD BE A HUGE STEP DEFINITELY  Reporter: SO TRUMP CAN'T JUST APPEAL TO THE ECONOMIC SIDE OF THINGS THAT WILL BE HIS SET OF CHALLENGES BIDEN'S CHALLENGES WILL BE ENGAGING THEIR BASE OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS AND INCREASING THAT TURNOUT OF 71% FROM 2016.

TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE GULF COAST VERY WARM, 95 DEGREES HOUSTON. A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE THIS AFTERNOON. NO RAIN IN THE FORECAST. THE STORM SYSTEMS WILL HEAT UP FROM CHICAGO THIS AFTERNOON INTO GREEN BAY. I DO WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT LAURA. COMING UP, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CUBA. SO MUCH TO WATCH. THANK YOU.  LEADING THE NEWS ON WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN HIS 42nd BIRTHDAY, THE SPORTS WORLD REMEMBERS KOBE BRYANT. HIS WIFE PAID TRIBUTE TO HER LATE HUSBAND SAYING IN PART, I AM SO THANKFUL I HAVE PIECES OF HEAVEN HERE ON EARTH THANKS TO YOU. NIKE RELEASED A VIDEO COMMEMORATING KOBE BRYANT. TODAY IS KOBE BRYANT DAY IN ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA, REPRESENTING HIS TWO JERSEY NUMBERS, 8 AND 24.  NFL COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL SET DOWN FOR AN IN-DEPTH ONE-ON- ONE ON THE PODCAST UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS WITH A BLACK MAN. ON IT, HE SAID HE WISHED HE LISTEN TO COLIN KAEPERNICK. IF YOU WERE TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS YOUR REMORSE, APOLOGISTS, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT I WISH WE HAD LISTENED EARLIER TO WHAT YOU WERE KNEELING ABOUT AND TRYING TO BRING ATTENTION TO. WE HAD INVITED HIM IN SEVERAL TIMES TO HAVE THE DIALOGUE, I WISH WE HAD THE BENEFIT OF THAT. WE NEVER DID. HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT PLAYERS KNEELING DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS BEING MISCHARACTERIZED, AND THAT THEY WERE EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO PEACEFUL PROTEST.  THAT IS WHAT WE ARE IN THIS WORLD TODAY, WE SEEM TO HAVE DEVELOPED THE FUNDAMENTAL INABILITY TO APOLOGIZE TO ANYONE. FIRST YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE EACH PERSON SPEAKING DURING THE HEARING, WHETHER IN PERSON OR REMOTE , AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR WEBEX SET TO ACTIVE SPEAKER VIEW. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS, PLEASE CONTACT COMMITTEE STAFF IMMEDIATELY. SECOND, WE HAVE A TIMER THAT SHOULD BE VISIBLE ON YOUR SCREEN WHEN YOU ARE IN THE ACTIVE SPEAKER WITH THUMBNAIL. MEMBERS WHO WISH TO PIN THE TIMER TO THEIR SCREENS SHOULD CONTACT COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ASSISTANCE. THIRD, THE HOUSE RULES REQUIRE THAT WE SEE YOU. SO PLEASE HAVE YOUR CAMERAS TURNED ON AT ALL TIMES. FOURTH, MEMBERS APPEARING REMOTELY WHO ARE NOT RECOGNIZED SHOULD REMAIN MUTED TO MINIMIZE BACKGROUND NOISE AND FEEDBACK. FACE, I WILL RECOGNIZE MEMBERS VERBALLY . MEMBERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SEEK RECOGNITION VERBALLY IN REGULAR ORDER. MEMBERS WILL RECOGNIZE SENIORITY ORDER FOR QUESTIONS. LASTLY, IF YOU WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED OUTSIDE OF REGULAR ORDER, YOU MAY IDENTIFY THAT IN SEVERAL WAYS. YOU MAY USE THE CHAT FUNCTION TO SEND A REQUEST, YOU MAY SEND AN EMAIL TO THE MAJORITY STAFF, OR YOU MAY UNMUTE YOUR MIC TO SEEK RECOGNITION. OBVIOUSLY, WE DO NOT WANT PEOPLE TALKING OVER EACH OTHER, SO MY PREFERENCE IS THAT MEMBERS USE THE CHAT FUNCTION OR EMAIL TO FACILITATE FORMAL VERBAL RECOGNITION. COMMITTEE STAFF WILL ENSURE THAT I AM MADE AWARE OF YOUR REQUEST, AND I WILL RECOGNIZE YOU. WE WILL BEGIN THE HEARING IN JUST A MOMENT WHEN THEY TELL ME THEY ARE READY TO BEGIN THE LIVE STREAM. CHAIRMAN MALONEY, YOU MENTIONED THE MASK. YOU DON'T HAVE ONE ON. I AM TALKING. IF YOU'RE TALKING, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR MASK OFF. I THOUGHT YOU SAID DURING QUESTIONS YOU HAD TO HAVE IT ON. TO COME IN THE ROOM, YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE MASK ON. AS YOU AND I KNOW, IT IS VERY HARD TO TALK WITH THE MASK ON. SO IT CAN BE REMOVED WHEN YOU ARE ASKING QUESTIONS. -- ,, THE COMMITTEE WILL COME TO ORDER. WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE CHAIR IS AUTHORIZED TO DECLARE A RECESS OF THE COMMITTEE AT ANY TIME. WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA, MISS ADAMS, AS WELL THE GENTLEMAN FROM ILLINOIS, MR. QUIGLEY, WILL BE PERMITTED TO JOIN THE COMMITTEE AND BE RECOGNIZED FOR QUESTIONING THE WITNESSES. IN ADDITION, THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA, MR. WALKER, WILL BE RECOGNIZED AT THE PROPER TIME TO INTRODUCE HIS CONSTITUENTS. I NOW RECOGNIZE MYSELF FOR AN OPENING STATEMENT. GOOD MORNING. I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME POSTMASTER GENERAL LOUIS DEJOY AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE POSTAL BOARD OF GOVERNORS, ROBERT DUNCAN, TO THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING. I THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. AND ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS, WE ARE HEARING FROM CONSTITUENTS ABOUT SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE DELIVERY OF MAIL, MEDICINES, FOOD AND OTHER SUPPLIES. THESE DELAYS ARE ESPECIALLY CONCERNING AND POTENTIALLY LIFE- THREATENING DURING THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS. THESE ARE NOT ISOLATED COMPLAINTS. THEY ARE WIDESPREAD. OUR OFFICES HAVE BEEN RECEIVING THOUSANDS OF CALLS AND EMAILS ABOUT THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS THESE DELAYS ARE HAVING ON OUR VETERANS, SENIORS, SMALL BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHEN WE ASK POSTAL LEADERS ABOUT THESE DELAYS, THEY DOWNPLAY THEM. THEY DISMISS THEM AS TEMPORARY . THEY DISCOUNT THEM AS MINOR, UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF REFORMS BEING PUT IN PLACE, BUT THEN WE SAW NATIONAL HEADLINES DESCRIBING THESE DELAYS IN MUCH MORE DETAIL. I HAVE A DOCUMENT HERE THAT LISTS HEADLINES FROM ALMOST EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY TALKING ABOUT THESE DELAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN MY HOME STATE OF NEW YORK, I QUOTE "MAIL IS DELAYED 5 TO 6 DAYS IN NEW YORK CITY, POSTAL WORKERS UNION SAYS." IN KENTUCKY, RANKING MEMBER HOME STATE, "POSTAL SERVICES COST-CUTTING IS FRUSTRATING KENTUCKIANS AND RAISING ELECTION CONCERNS." IN CALIFORNIA, THE HOME STATE OF OUR VICE CHAIR, " LIKE ARMAGEDDON, ROTTING FOOD, DEAD ANIMALS AND CHAOS AT POSTAL FACILITIES AMID CUTBACKS." THIS LIST GOES ON AND ON. LAST FRIDAY WHEN LOUIS DEJOY WAS CONFRONTED IN THE SENATE WITH THESE WIDESPREAD REPORTS, HE SAID HE FELT BAD ABOUT WHAT HE CALLED A DIP IN SERVICE. BUT THEN AFTER HIS TESTIMONY IN THE SENATE, WE OBTAINED AN INTERNAL POSTAL SERVICE DOCUMENT ENTITLED PMG BRIEFING. THIS IS A PRESENTATION PREPARED DIRECTLY FOR THE POSTMASTER GENERAL. IT IS DATA STILL MOST TWO WEEKS AGO, AUGUST 12. ACCORDING TO THIS DOCUMENT, THESE DELAYS ARE NOT JUST A DIP. THIS DOCUMENT WARNS THE POSTMASTER GENERAL OF SIGNIFICANT AND WIDESPREAD DROPS ACROSS THE BOARD. MARKETING, PERIODICALS AND OTHER CATEGORIES. THIS DOCUMENT SHOWS THAT THESE DELAYS ARE NOT A MYTH OR CONSPIRACY THEORY , AS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ARGUED. THESE DEEP DECLINES DID NOT START IN APRIL OR MAY WHEN THE CRISIS HIT US, BUT IN JULY WHEN LOUIS DEJOY CAME ON BOARD AND BEGAN MAKING HIS CHANGES. OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING THESE DELAYS AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, SUCH AS HIS DECISION TO RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF TRIPS FOR PROCESSING PLANTS TO DELIVER UNITS. PERHAPS MR. THE JOY THOUGHT HIS SWEEPING CHANGES WERE NOT CAUSE ANY DELAYS. IN MY OPINION, THAT WOULD BE INCOMPETENCE AT BEST. OR PERHAPS THIS WAS INTENTIONAL. MAYBE MR. DEJOY WAS WARNED HIS CHANGES WOULD CAUSE DELAY, BUT HE DISREGARD THOSE WARNINGS. THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY RECKLESS IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WITH LESS THAN THREE MONTHS BEFORE AN IMPORTANT ELECTION. OR PERHAPS THERE IS A FAR SIMPLER EXPLANATION. PERHAPS MR. DEJOY IS JUST DOING EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WANTED HIM TO DO ON NATIONAL TELEVISION, USING THE BLOCKING OF FUNDS TO JUSTIFY SWEEPING CHANGES TO HOBBLED MAIL. ALL OF THESE OPTIONS ARE BAD, BUT WHEN YOU INSTALL SOMEONE AS POSTMASTER GENERAL AFTER HE DONATES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO YOUR CAMPAIGN, WHEN HE RUSHES TO MAKE CHANGES WITHOUT CONDUCTING ADEQUATE ANALYSIS, AND WHEN HE WITHHOLDS KEY INFORMATION FROM CONGRESS AND DOESN'T LEVEL WITH US WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO ASK WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON , GIVEN ALL OF THIS, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS ALREADY OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONTROVERSIAL CHANGES. WE WILL BE ASKING MR. DEJOY SOME HARD QUESTIONS TODAY . WE WILL ALSO BE ASKING MR. DUNCAN, AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, ABOUT HIS OWN ROLE IN CHOOSING LOUIS DEJOY AS POSTMASTER GENERAL ABOUT HIS OWN ROLE IN INVENTING MR. DEJOY FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST, INCLUDING HIS OWNERSHIP OF STOCK IN MAJOR POSTAL SERVICE COMPETITORS AND YOUR OWN ROLE IN DELAYING UNDER YOUR WATCH. WHATEVER THE CAUSE OF THESE MASSIVE DELAYS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE. THEY DON'T WANT THESE CHANGES, THEY WANT THEM REVERSED. THEY DON'T WANT ANYONE, NOTHING BUT THE POST OFFICE, AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WANT IT POLITICIZE. THEY WANT TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEIR MAIL, THEIR MEDICINE, THEIR BALLOTS WILL BE DELIVERED ON TIME. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR WITNESSES, AND I NOW RECOGNIZE THE DISTINGUISHED RANKING MEMBER, FOR AN OPENING STATEMENT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. I APPRECIATE YOU CALLING THE HEARING TODAY ON THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE, EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO DO SO BEFORE WE ACTUALLY VOTED ON THE BILL SATURDAY. WE ALL AGREE THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE NEEDS TO BE REFORMED TO BETTER SERVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE ALL WANT THE POSTAL SERVICE TO BE AS EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE AMERICANS RECEIVE THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS ON TIME, SMALL BUSINESSES THRIVE AND MAIL- IN BALLOTS ARE DELIVERED IN A TIMELY FASHION. BUT MEANINGFUL REFORM IS GOING TO TAKE BIPARTISANSHIP, SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN VERY LITTLE OF IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. DEMOCRATS FABRICATED A BASELESS CONSPIRACY THEORY ABOUT THE POSTAL SERVICE AND HASTILY PASSED A BILL SATURDAY, BUT BEFORE HEARING FROM YOU, MR. DEJOY. PEOPLE HAD NO PRIOR COMMITTEE ACTION TO VET THE BILL, NO HEARINGS . BECAUSE OF THIS RUSHED PROCESS, THE BILL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ADMITTED BY THE DEMOCRATS BEFORE IT WENT TO THE RULES COMMITTEE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO THE HOUSE FLOOR UNDER A PROCESS THAT PREVENTED ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. THERE WAS NO REPUBLICAN INPUT, NOT AT ANY STEP IN THE PROCESS. JUST THIS MORNING WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE OPPOSES THE BILL THAT YOU ALL PAST SATURDAY. THEY READ THE BILL AND REALIZED THAT IT WILL MAKE IT HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO DELIVER THE MAIL . AT LEAST THIS LEGISLATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OBAMA YEARS AT THE POSTAL SERVICE. MORE DELAYS, MORE FINANCIAL LOSSES. THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS SHOWS DEMOCRATS ARE NOT SERIOUS ABOUT MEANINGFUL REFORM. THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT SUPPORT THE BILL, THE POSTAL SERVICE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE BILL, AND THE SENATE WILL LIKELY NOT TAKE UP THE BILL. THIS IS A POLITICAL STUNT. DURING THE DEBATE SATURDAY CHAIRWOMAN MALONEY UNVEILED A 60 PAGE POWERPOINT DECK SHE JUST RECEIVED OVERNIGHT FROM AN APPARENT WHISTLEBLOWER. MADAM CHAIR, I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU THAT YOUR RECORD WITH WHISTLEBLOWERS IS LESS THAN STELLAR. THE DECK IS DATED AUGUST 12, PROVING HE PLAYED NO ROLE IN THE CREATION OF YOUR BILL, WHICH WAS UNVEILED THE DAY BEFORE. IT CONTAINS DELIVERY PERFORMANCE DATA UPDATED SINCE THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE THIRD- QUARTER REPORT. IT SHOWS DELAYS IN JULY AND AUGUST. I'M VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM MR. DEJOY TODAY ABOUT WHAT HE HAS LEARNED ABOUT THE CAUSES OF THESE DELAYS . HOW MUCH OF AN EFFECT IS ONGOING WITH THE PANDEMIC AND INCREASED SICK LEAVE HAVING ON DELIVERY PERFORMANCE? HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO ANY TEMPORARY GROWING PAINS FROM EFFORTS TO MAKE THE POSTAL SERVICE MORE EFFICIENT AND SELF-SUFFICIENT? I SAY I AM INTERESTED IN THE RESPONSES BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS. I DON'T BELIEVE THE CHAIRWOMAN DOES EITHER. THIS IS WHY I HAVE REPEATEDLY SAID, MADDEN CHAIRWOMAN, THIS COMMITTEE IS DOING THINGS BACKWARDS. WHEN WE MAKE POLICY, IT IS OUR JOB TO UNDERSTAND WHY SOMETHING IS HAPPENING, HOW WOULD YOU FIND OUT WHY? YOU WOULD HAVE A HEARING ON THE TOPIC WITH THE POSTMASTER GENERAL. WHEN WOULD YOU HAVE THE HEARING? CERTAINLY BEFORE YOU PASS THE BILL. RETURNING TO TODAY, LET ME SAY THE POSTAL ISSUES ARE SOMETHING I'VE LONG HEARD ABOUT, A GREAT DEAL IN MY RURAL DYSTOPIC IDENTICALLY REMEMBER WHEN THE OBAMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, A MALE FACILITY IN PADUCAH WAS CLOSE, RESULTING IN LETTERS THAT WAS TAKEN DAY TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B NOW TAKING THREE DAYS. I ALSO HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE POSTAL SERVICE FOR MY GRANDMOTHER WHO SPENT HER ENTIRE CAREER, 27 YEARS, AS A RURAL MAIL CARRIER. MY HEART AND SYMPATHIES GO OUT TO THE POSTAL SERVICE FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AS HER GRANDSON AND THE CONGRESSMAN REX PRESENTING THE FIRST DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY AND IS A RANKING MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE, I WANT TO SEE THE POSTAL SERVICE RETURN TO BEING A VIABLE INSTITUTION, BUT I AM DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE HISTORICAL FRENZY WHIPPED UP BY MY COLLEAGUES ON THE LEFT OTHER FRIENDS IN THE MEDIA. LET'S LOOK AT THE MOST OFTEN REPEATED CLAIMS. DOES THE POSTAL SERVICE NEED A BAILOUT? NO, PACKERS DELIVERY HAS SHOT THROUGH THE ROOF. IT IS INCREASED REVENUE BY $1.5 BILLION. IT HAS NEARLY $15 BILLION CASH ON HAND AND CAN OPERATE UNTIL AT LEAST AUGUST 2021. IS THE POSTMASTER GENERAL SABOTAGING THE ELECTION BY REMOVING MAILBOXES AND SORTING MACHINES? NO. THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS MORE THAN ADEQUATE PROCESS CITY. IF EVERYBODY IN THE U.S. REQUESTED BALLOTS BY MAIL, THAT IS STILL LESS THAN A ONE DAY AVERAGE VOLUME. THE BLUE BOXES AND SORTERS WERE BOTH COMPONENTS OF LONG-STANDING PROGRAMS IN RESPONSE TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MAIL VOLUME. 33% REDUCTION OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS. FOR REFERENCE, UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA, APPROXIMATELY 12,000 BLUE MAILBOXES WERE REMOVED. WE DID NOT HEAR ONE WORD FROM THE OTHER SIDE WHEN HE DID THAT. THE MAIL SORTERS WERE ON TRACK TO BE REMOVED BECAUSE THEY WERE SITTING IDLE TAKING UP FLOOR SPACE FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES. IS THE POSTAL SERVICE SAY THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO DELIVER BALLOTS ON TIME? NO NO. WHAT THE POSTAL SERVICE IS DOING AND HAS FOR YEARS IS TRYING TO WARN STATES THEIR LAWS DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT THE POSTAL SERVICE CAN AND CANNOT DO. USPS CAN TREAT BALLOTS AS FIRST CLASS MAIL, BUT THEY CANNOT BREAK THE LAWS OF TIME AND SPACE . THE LETTERS THE DEMOCRATS CHARACTERIZE AS THREATS AND PROPAGANDA ARE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO PREVENT WEEKS OF UNCERTAINTY AND CONFUSION SUCH AS WHAT HAPPENED VERY RECENTLY WITH THE RACE FOR CHAIRWOMAN MALONEY AND THE CHARGES ABOUT OVERTIME, THOSE CAME FROM AN EFFORT TO REDUCE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OVERTIME AND EXTRA TRUCK TRIPS THE POSTAL SERVICE SPENDS EVERY YEAR. IF OVERTIME AND EXTRA TRIPS ARE NORMAL, IT MEANS SOMETHING IS WRONG AND YOU BETTER FIX IT. ON FRIDAY BEFORE THE SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE HEARING, MR. DEJOY ACKNOWLEDGE THE RECENT DIP IN SERVICE AND TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PERFORMANCE LAPSE. THE LOGICAL STEP IS TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS HAPPENED AND COME UP WITH A PLAN. EVEN THOUGH YOUR BILL WOULD PREVENT THAT, I HOPE THAT TODAY HELPS IN THAT PROCESS. I YIELD BACK. I THANK THE GENTLEMAN FOR HIS STATEMENT. I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO PLACE IN THE RECORD THE SERVICE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT POSTMASTER GENERAL BRIEFING , AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM THE POST OFFICE, DATA, RESEARCH, FACTS, AND IN THIS REPORT THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. THEY SHOW THAT UNDER THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE POSTMASTER GENERALS WORK, THE SERVICE SELL ANYWHERE FROM 6% TO 10% IN ALL THE MAJOR CATEGORIES. MY BILL MERELY FUNDS THE POST OFFICE AND RETURNS IT BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS SO THAT THE SERVICES CAN GET THE MAIL OUT TO THE PEOPLE DURING A PANDEMIC AND BEFORE A VERY IMPORTANT ELECTION. AFTER THE PANDEMIC, WE CAN REVISIT AND HAVE OTHER STATEMENTS AND WORK GO FORWARD, BUT LET'S NOT DISMANTLE THE SERVICES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE VETERANS, THE SENIORS, PEOPLE DESERVE TO GET THEIR MAIL AND A TIMELY WAY. MOST DISTRICTS ARE HAVING PEOPLE CALLING FRANTICALLY, WHERE IS MY MALE? WHERE ARE MY MEDICATIONS? SPAT FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. I'M PLACING THIS INTO THE RECORD. I NOW RECOGNIZE THE DISTINGUISHED CHAIRMAN OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS WHO HAS DONE A GREAT DEAL OF WORK IN THIS AREA, MR. CALMLY, FOR HIS OPENING STATEMENT. THANK YOU MADDEN CHAIRWOMAN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. I WAS PROUD TO COSPONSOR YOUR BILL THAT PASSED THE HOUSE WITH 26 REPUBLICANS SHOWING THE COURAGE TO ADDRESS AN EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE MOST ESTEEMED INSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT IN AMERICA. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION, CONSTITUTIONALLY, TO ENSURE THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN PART OF THE AMERICAN FABRIC SINCE 1775 HAS A FUTURE. THE POSTAL SERVICE IS NOT ONLY FIGHTING FOR ITS ECONOMIC SURVIVAL, IT IS FIGHTING TO MAINTAIN 120 YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICE READ OF ROTTEN PATRONAGE SYSTEMS THAT SERVE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND NOT THOSE WHO RELY ON MAIL EVERY DAY. WE ARE HERE TODAY TO SAVE THE POSTAL SERVICE. WE HAVE IN FRONT OF IS A NEWLY APPOINTED POSTMASTER GENERAL AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS THAT SELECTED HIM FOR THAT POST. WE HAVE A PMG WHO, SIX WEEKS INTO THE NEW JOB, IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND JUST WEEKS BEFORE A CONSEQUENTIAL NATIONAL ELECTION WHERE THE POSTAL SERVICE WILL PLAY AN UNPRECEDENTED ROLE, DECIDES TO ANNOUNCE A SWEEPING REORGANIZATION THAT HE ADMITS COULD SLOW DOWN MAIL AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY INFUSE UNCERTAINTY INC. CONFUSION INTO THE POSTAL SERVICE AND NEIGHBORHOODS ALL ACROSS AMERICA. HE ANNOUNCED THAT THESE AND OTHER CHANGES WITHOUT ENGAGING STAFF, UNIONS, TRADE ORGANIZATIONS, MAIL RECIPIENTS OR CONGRESS. IN FACT, CONGRESS WAS TOLD MR. DEJOY DID NOT YET FEEL PREPARED TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS WE MIGHT HAVE FOR HIM. YET, HE FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO FREEZE OVERTIME, DELAY MAIL DELIVERY AND ANNOUNCE SWEEPING ORGANIZATIONS. MR. DUNCAN, CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING THE RUBBERSTAMP. THE POSTAL SERVICE BOARD OF GOVERNORS IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO REPRESENT THE PUBLIC INTEREST, NOT THE PRESIDENT, IN THE POLITICAL PARTY AND NOT EVEN THE POSTMASTER GENERAL. TODAY THE POSTAL SERVICE EMPLOYS 650,000 PEOPLE. IT IS THE FOUNDATION FOR MORE THAN A $1.7 TRILLION MAILING INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS ANOTHER 7.5 MILLION PEOPLE. AT THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY THE U.S. POST OFFICE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN 77,000 PATRONAGE POSITIONS RIPE WITH GROSS INCOMPETENCE AND OFTEN EMBEZZLEMENT OF FUNDS. IT WAS RURAL AMERICA THAT USED ITS POLITICAL VOICE AT THAT TIME TO PROFESSIONALIZE THE POST OFFICE. INSTEAD OF TRAVELING MILES TO THE CLOSEST GENERAL STORE TO PICK UP MAIL FROM A POLITICAL HACK, RURAL RESIDENTS LOBBIED CONGRESS FOR FREE DELIVERY. AND INNOVATION THE FRONT MAIL DELIVERY TO EVEN THE MOST DISTANT OF HOMES AND BUSINESSES. THE MASSIVE GRASSROOTS LOBBYING EFFORT PUT THOSE WITH ACUMEN AND EXPERTISE INTO THE POST OFFICE AND REFOCUSED POLITICAL LEADERS AND WHAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO DO, SERVE THE PEOPLE, NOT THERE POLITICAL PARTIES. AS A NATION, THE PEOPLE TRANSFORMED THE POSTAL SERVICE. THIS HISTORY LESSON RESONATES TODAY. YET ANOTHER RECKONING FOR THIS COUNTRY AND THE POSTAL SERVICE. HERE AGAIN THE PEOPLE OF THE NATION HAVE STOOD UP LOUDLY AND CONSISTENTLY TO CONDEMN ATTEMPTS TO TURN A CROWN JEWEL OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, ONE OF THE MOST TRUSTED AGENCIES AMONG THE HUNDREDS THAT SERVE THIS NATION, INTO A HONEYPOT. WE CANNOT AND MUST NOT LET THAT HAPPEN. DURING THIS PANDEMIC, THE POSTAL SERVICE WAS A LIFELINE TO THE DELIVERY OF LIFESAVING PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, FOOD AND PANTRY STAPLES, STIMULUS CHECKS TO PAY RENT AND UTILITY BILLS, CENSUS FORMS AND EVEN SIMPLY COUPONS TO HELP STRUGGLING FAMILIES STAY OUT OF POVERTY. WHAT LEADER WOULD THINK THAT EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SLOWING DOWN MAIL IN A TIME SUCH AS THIS IS A GOOD IDEA? WHAT LEADER WOULD TAKE STEPS TO FREEZE OVERTIME FOR A WORKFORCE LITERALLY RISKING HIS LIFE EVERY DAY TO DELIVER MAIL TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS NATION? 40,000 POSTAL WORKERS HAVE CONTRACTED COVID- 19 OR BEEN QUARANTINED BECAUSE OF IT. 40,000. AS THE NEW PMG, MR. DEJOY HAS RECKLESSLY CUT HOURS AND DELAYED DELIVERY TIMES AND THE PURSUIT OF UNSUPPORTED OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY. IS NEVER ONCE ASKED CONGRESS TO HELP, DESPITE A TEAM OF MEMBERS READY TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND OTHER SUPPORT. THE CHAIRWOMAN AND I, ALONG WITH A COLLECTION OF HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS, ARE INVITED TO HELP THE POSTAL SERVICE WITH $75 BILLION IN SUPPORT TO A DEDICATED WORKFORCE TO INVEST IN A MODERNIZED AND GREEN POSTAL FLEET THAT DOESN'T EXPLODE. TO PAY FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS THAT CAN STREAMLINE COMMUNICATIONS FROM TRUCKS AND PLANES RUNNING LATE WITH IMPORTANT CROSS COUNTY OR INTERNATIONAL MAIL DELIVERIES. MR. DEJOY AND MR. DUNCAN HAVE FAILED TO WORK WITH CONGRESS TO GET THIS ENACTED. THUS FAR, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS RECEIVED $25 MILLION IN REVENUE STABILIZATION, THE POSTAL SERVICE, NOT A DIME. ON AUGUST 18 THE PMG ANNOUNCED HE WOULD PUT A HOLD ON SOME OF THE SWEEPING OPERATIONAL CHANGES, BUT HIS ANNOUNCEMENT DID NOT COMMIT TO REVERSING THE SERVICING CAPACITY CUTS ALREADY MADE. IT DID NOT INCLUDE AN AGENDA THAT SUPPORTED ELECTION MAIL BUT THE SUMMER STRENGTHEN COMMITMENT TO HELPING THE POSTAL SERVICE TO FILL ITS HISTORIC ROLE IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION. LASTLY, THE PMG IS STILL NOT ADVOCATING FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED TRUMP APPOINTED BOARD OF GOVERNORS UNANIMOUSLY CALLED FOR THAT PACKAGE. THAT A DEMOCRATIC IDEA, A REPUBLICAN DOMINATED BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDING IT. THE RECENT OPERATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES MR. DEJOY HAS MADE HAVE RESULTED IN DELIVERY DELAYS ACROSS THE COUNTRY , AS THE CHAIRWOMAN JUST SHOWED. THAT IS NOT OUR DATA, THAT IS YOURS, MR. POSTMASTER GENERAL. THESE DELAYS HAVE REAL IMPACT SEVERAL LIVES WITH REAL CONSEQUENCES. MOST DEVASTATINGLY, IT HAS DAMAGE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE POSTAL SERVICE IN A PRAIRIE BRIEF TIME. CONGRATULATIONS, MR. DEJOY. AN ESTEEMED INSTITUTION THAT NOW IF IN DOUBT IN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC MIND. I APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUES FOR PASSING THE DELIVERY FOR AMERICA ACT BILL BECAUSE WE NEED TO ACT NOW AND REVERSE THIS AND REASSURE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT THEY WILL GET THEIR MAIL ON TIME, AND THAT THEIR BALLOTS WILL GET THERE ON TIME AND BE COUNTED. THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. THIS IS THE FUTURE ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN MY LIFETIME. THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE TODAY. I YIELD BACK. MADAM CHAIR. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE A POINT THAT YOU DIDN'T NOTIFIER COMMITTEE THAT MR. CONNELLY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WOULD BE DELIVERING OPEN REMARKS. THAT IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS RUSHED PROCESS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT OUR RANKING MEMBER OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ALSO BE ALLOWED TO DELIVER OPENING REMARKS. ABSOLUTELY. THE STAFF TOLD ME THEY REACHED OUT TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF. IT IS GENERAL THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HAS THE JURISDICTION SHOULD SPEAK ON BOTH SIDES. I HAVE IN MY NOTES THAT THE RANKING MEMBER ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE OF GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS WILL ALSO BE GIVING AN OPENING STATEMENT. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DID REACH OUT. IN THE FUTURE, I WILL PERSONALLY CALL YOU MYSELF AND MAKE SURE IT GETS TO YOU. I WAS TOLD BY STAFF THEY TALKED TO YOUR STAFF THAT THEY HAD REACHED OUT TO YOU. OF THAT NOT GET TO YOU, I APOLOGIZE. WILL PERSONALLY CALL YOU EVERY TIME, BUT IT IS USUALLY THE STANDARD THAT WE MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE WITH THE JURISDICTION MAKES AN OPENING STATEMENT. I AGREE, AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRWOMAN DOING THAT. THAT IS IMPORTANT WHY WE NEED TO BE PREPARED AND NOT RUSH THINGS LIKE WE HAVE WITH THIS POSTAL REFORM BILL. MADAM CHAIRWOMAN. IF I CAN COME TO YOUR DEFENSE, IT HAS BEEN YOUR PRACTICES CHAIRWOMAN THAT WHEN IT IS THE JURISDICTION OF A SUBCOMMITTEE, YOU HAVE ALWAYS ALLOWED THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR AND THE RANKING MEMBER TO HAVE OPENING STATEMENTS. THAT IS PRACTICE. IT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SPRUNG ON US TODAY. I CAN THINK OF AT LEAST FOUR EXAMPLES. IT IS ACTUALLY THE PRACTICE OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE CHAIRWOMAN TO DO JUST THAT. MADAM CHAIR, IF I MAY, I AGREE IT IS PRACTICE. WE JUST WEREN'T NOTIFIED. IT WASN'T ON THE AGENDA ITEM THAT WE RECEIVED. WE APPRECIATE THAT. IS MY UNDERSTANDING HE IS PREPARED TO DELIVER AN IMPROMPTU OPENING STATEMENT. OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK MR. CONNELLY FOR POINTING THAT OUT AND ALSO POINTING OUT THE DOUBLE STANDARD THAT BUSINESSES SUCH AS THE AIRLINES AND OTHERS ARE RECEIVING FEDERAL AID IN THE HERE IS PACKAGE IN THE COVID RELIEF PACKAGE, BUT THE VITAL SERVICES FROM OUR POST OFFICE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE DEPEND ON, A LIFELINE TO AMERICANS ACROSS AMERICA, THEY DESERVE TO BE FUNDED TOO. I NOW RECOGNIZE THE DISTINGUISHED SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRMAN FOR GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS FOR AN OPENING STATEMENT. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I APPRECIATE THAT. YES, WE WERE NOT NOTIFIED OF THIS, BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS. AGAIN HERE WE ARE HAVING A HEARING AFTER A VOTE. I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. CERTAINLY, WE HAVE HAD MANY VOTES WITHOUT BOTHERING TO HAVE A HEARING, BUT I DON'T EVER RECALL HAVING A VOTE TO SO- CALLED FIX SOMETHING, AND THEN HAVE THE HEARING AFTERWARDS. THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED. TO ME I BELIEVE THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF POLITICAL MALPRACTICE ON THE SIDE OF THE DEMOCRATS. WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE POSTAL SERVICE AND MADAM CHAIR I'M GRAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE HERE IS ACT BECAUSE IN ITSELF, IN THE HERE IS ACT, I BELIEVE THAT IS THE UNVEILING OF WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO. THAT IS THEMSELVES TO FRAUDULENTLY INFLUENCE THE UPCOMING ELECTION . IN THE HERE IS ACT IS A REQUIREMENT FOR UNIVERSAL MAIL- IN BALLOTS. IN THE HEROES ACT IS THE REQUIREMENT IF BOTH STATES CANNOT BE INVOLVED IN REQUIRING VOTER ID. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF BALLOTS SENT OUT ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS ARE DECEASED, TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED, TO PEOPLE, WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE, AND STATES ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY VOTER ID IF THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR WAY, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE BALLOT HARVESTING TAKE PLACE. THIS IS WHAT IS AT STAKE. I AGREE WITH CHAIRMAN CONNELLY SAYING THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION. THIS IS WHAT IS AT STAKE. IF THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR WAY IN THE SELECTION, IT WILL BE FILLED WITH FRAUD, IT WILL BE FILLED WITH CONFUSION, IT WILL BE FILLED WITH LAWSUITS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IS IN THE HEROES ACT TO PRODUCE. IF THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR WAY. THANKFULLY, THAT BILL IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE ANY FURTHER THAN THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED SATURDAY BEFORE THE HEARING. THEN WE TALK ABOUT DELAYS THAT THE USPS HAS. WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD HEARINGS ON THE USPS SINCE I BELIEVE APRIL 2019. NOW ALL THE SUDDEN WE ARE CALLED IN FOR AN EMERGENCY OVER THIS WHOLE THING. WE HAD A BRIEFING IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR, NOT A HEARING, A BRIEFING, AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT BRIEFING WAS TO DISCUSS THE DELAYS OF THE POSTAL SERVICE DUE TO COVID-19. YES, THERE ARE DELAYS AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF USPS WORKERS WHO ARE NOT SHOWING UP FOR WORK DUE TO COVID-19. ARE WE SURPRISED THAT THERE ARE DELAYS? OF COURSE NOT. WE HAD A BRIEFING TO DISCUSS THAT JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. THE POSTMASTER GENERAL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COVID-19. HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ECONOMY, NOR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THOUSANDS OF HIS WORKERS NOT SHOWING UP. WE ALSO HAVE CITIES THAT ARE RIOTING. OF COURSE, THERE ARE DELAYS IN MANY OF THOSE CITIES, MINNEAPOLIS, PORTLAND, CHICAGO, LOS ANGELES, WHEREVER IT MAY BE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THE BAILOUT THE PAST ON SATURDAY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WAS POINTLESS. IT REFUSES THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ANY REFORMS. AND SO, WE HAVE A POSTAL SERVICE RIGHT NOW THAT HAS $14 MILLION CASH ON HAND, ANOTHER $10 BILLION AVAILABLE TO THEM WITH THE TREASURY, AND THEY CAN'T EVEN GET ACCESS TO THE $10 BILLION BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOO MUCH CASH ON HAND. AND AT, WE PASS A BILL FOR ANOTHER $25 BILLION, AND IN THAT BILL WE DISALLOW THEM FROM MAKING ANY CHANGES. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY WE KEEP THROWING AT THE POSTAL SERVICE IF WE DON'T ALLOW FOR REFORM TO TAKE PLACE, WHICH IS WHAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. WITH THAT, I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THIS HEARING GOING FORWARD. I FULLY ANTICIPATE A LOT OF POLITICAL FEAR FOR MY FRIENDS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AISLE. I DO ANTICIPATE THE CONTINUED ATTEMPT TO PORTRAY A CONSPIRACY THAT DOES NOT EXIST WHEN, IN FACT, IT IS THEIR OWN PARTY THAT I BELIEVE ARE FULLY COMMITTED BASED UPON THE HEROES ACT AND OTHER COMMENTS TO INFLUENCE THIS UPCOMING ELECTION USING FRAUDULENT METHODS. WITH THAT, MADAM CHAIR, I YIELD BACK AND APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I NOW RECOGNIZE MARK WALKER TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST WITNESS, WHO IS A CONSTITUENT OF HIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MALONEY AND RANKING MEMBER COMER. IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO AND INTRODUCE THE POSTMASTER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. MR. DEJOY HAS EARNED THE RESPECT OF BOTH CHARITABLE AND BUSINESS COMMUNITIES. SINCE ITS CREATION IN 2005, HIS FOUNDATION HAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, DUKE UNIVERSITY, THE HEALTH CENTER FOR CHILDREN, POLICE FOUNDATIONS, JUST TO NAME A FEW. I WAS ACTUALLY PRESENT WHEN MR. DEJOY WAS INDUCTED INTO THE HALL OF FAME FOR THE TRIADS JUNIOR ACHIEVEMENT BUSINESS LEADERS, THE WORLD'S LARGEST ORGANIZATION EDUCATING K-12 STUDENTS ON FINANCIAL LITERACY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. JUST THIS PAST WEEK I RECEIVED IN THE MAIL THE FAMILY CONTRIBUTION, THE SPONSORSHIP OF FAMILY SERVICES OF THE PIEDMONT WHICH SERVES 18,000 CHILDREN AND ADULTS, MANY BATTLING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES. MAYBE THE MOST IMPRESSIVE ACT BY THE FAMILY IS THE ONE ESTABLISHED FOR STUDENTS FROM TITLE I SCHOOLS. YOU SEE, I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET SOME OF THE STUDENTS WHO COME FROM SOME OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED AREAS. IT IS NOT SOMETHING HE FLAUNTS, IS JUST SOMETHING HE DOES. THROUGHOUT HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREER, LOUIS DEJOY HAS GARNERED A REPUTATION AS A GENIUS IN THE LOGISTICAL INNOVATION AND SUPPLY-CHAIN FIELD. IS THE CEO OF NEW BREED LOGISTICS HE TOOK A BROKEN TRUCKING COMPANY AND TRANSFORMED IT INTO A PROMINENT U.S. PROVIDER CREATING CLOSE TO 9000 JOBS. MAYBE THAT IS WHY HE WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPOINTED TO THE POSITION BY THE UPS PS BIPARTISAN BOARD OF GOVERNORS. MR. DEJOY HAS BEEN ON THE JOB ABOUT TWO MONTHS . HE IS BEING BLAMED FOR IMPLEMENTING REFORMS CONGRESS HAS PASSED. FOR EXAMPLE, BACK IN 2006, IT WASN'T MR. DEJOY WHO PASSED THE POSTAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENHANCEMENT ACT, IT WAS ACTUALLY CONGRESS. THE LEADING SPONSOR ON THIS BILL WAS THE ONE WITH THE BIGGEST PICTURE IN THE ROOM, FORMER CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE, HENRY WAXMAN. TODAY MR. DEJOY WILL BE VICIOUSLY ATTACKED WITH PREPACKAGED QUESTIONS AND ACCUSATIONS. WOMEN WERE EVEN SUGGESTING IMPEACHMENT. THAT IS ORIGINAL. HOW SAD IS IT WHEN THE CANCEL CULTURE HAS REACHED THE HALLS OF CONGRESS . THE MAN SITTING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY IS NOT TO THE DEMOCRATS OF HELLENIZED HIM TO BE. HE IS HERE TODAY BECAUSE HE SUPPORTED PRESIDENT TRUMP. WITH THIS CONGRESS, THAT MAKES YOU A TARGET. OVER THE PAST MONTH HIS FAMILY HAS ENDURED PROTESTS OUTSIDE THEIR HOME WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE BLOCKING STREETS AND FRIGHTENING NEIGHBORS. SADLY, AND THIS DAY AND AGE, AN INDUSTRY LEADER WITH A PASSION FOR SERVICE CAN BE PERSECUTED IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION FOR HIS APPARENT POLITICAL AFFILIATION. AT THE CIRCUS UNFOLDS TODAY, REMEMBER THAT LOUIS DEJOY IS A COMMUNITY MINDED PHILANTHROPIST, AN INDUSTRY- LEADING BUSINESSMAN, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, A MAN WITH A GOOD HEART DOING HIS BEST TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY. MR. DEJOY, I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. MANY OF YOUR ACCUSERS DIDN'T EXTEND THE SAME COURTESY, BUT UNLIKE THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE, LET'S HOPE THEY AT LEAST KNOW HOW TO MUTE THEMSELVES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I YIELD BACK. THANK YOU. THE SECOND WITNESS IS ROBERT DUNCAN, WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE POSTAL SERVICE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. HE WAS APPOINTED TO THE BOARD BY RESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN AUGUST 2018, AND HIS TERM EXPIRES IN DECEMBER 2025. PLEASE STAND AND RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND. DO YOU SWEAR, AFFIRM THAT THE TESTIMONY YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE IS THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND THAT THE WHOLE TRUTH SO HELP YOU GOD? LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT THE WITNESSES ARE AFFIRMED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. WITHOUT A JUNCTION, URINE STATEMENTS WILL BE PART OF THE RECORD. WITH THAT, MR. DEJOY, YOU ARE NOW RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.  GOOD MORNING CHAIRWOMAN MALONEY, RANKING MEMBER COMER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM PROUD TO BE WITH YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE 630,000 DEDICATED WOMEN AND MEN OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE. ON JUNE 15 I BECAME THE 75th POSTMASTER GENERAL. SINCE THAT TIME, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION TO THE POSTAL SERVICE BY OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, THE MEDIA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I WANT TO BEGIN BY ASSURING THIS COMMITTEE AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE IS FULLY CAPABLE AND COMMITTED TO DELIVERING BALLOTS SECURELY AND ON TIME. THE SACRED DUTY IS MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY. TO BE CLEAR, WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HANDLE AND DELIVER ELECTION MAIL IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE PROVEN PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES WE HAVE RELIED UPON FOR YEARS. NEVERTHELESS, I ENCOURAGE ALL AMERICANS WHO CHOOSE TO VOTE BY MAIL TO REQUEST THEIR BALLOTS EARLY AND TO VOTE EARLY AS A COMMONSENSE BEST PRACTICE. AS PART OF THIS CONVERSATION, THERE ARE MANY INACCURACIES ABOUT MY ACTIONS THAT I WISH TO AGAIN CORRECT. FIRST, I DID NOT DIRECTLY REMOVE BLUE COLLECTION BOXES OR THE REMOVAL OF MAIL PROCESSING EQUIPMENT. SECOND, I DO NOT DIRECT A CUTBACK ON HOURS ANY OF OUR POST OFFICES. AND FINALLY, I DID NOT DIRECT THE ELIMINATION OR ANY CUTBACK IN OVERTIME. I DID, HOWEVER, SUSPEND THESE PRACTICES TO REMOVE ANY MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT OUR COMMITMENT TO DELIVERING ELECTION MAIL. ANY FURTHER ASSERTIONS BY MEDIA OR ELECTED OFFICIALS IS FURTHERING A FALSE NARRATIVE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. LET ME DESCRIBE THE TWO ACTIONS I HAVE TAKEN IN 70 DAYS SINCE MY APPOINTMENT. I CAME TO THE POSTAL SERVICE WITH DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN SOLVING LARGE AND COMPLEX LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS. I PLAN TO USE THIS EXPERIENCE TO HELP LEAD THE OPERATING CHANGE REQUIRED FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE TO GROW AND EMBARK ON A PATH OF SUSTAINABILITY. ON THE DAY OF MY SWEARING-IN, THE POSTAL SERVICE INSPECTOR GENERAL ISSUED AN ASTONISHING REPORT ABOUT THE SCHEDULED DELAYS IN POSTAL SERVICE TRANSPORTATION AND THE SUBSTANTIAL COST ASSOCIATED WITH OUR WEAKNESSES IN THIS FUNDAMENTAL OPERATING PRINCIPLE. UPON REVIEW, I DIRECTED THE POSTAL SERVICE OPERATIONS TEAM TO DEVELOP AND EXECUTE ON A PLAN TO IMPROVE OUR ADHERENCE TO THE TRANSPORTATION SCHEDULE OF OUR OVER 40,000 TRIPS A DAY. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS GOAL. ON-TIME APPROACHES 98% AND WASTE OF EXTRA TRIPS DOWN BY OVER 70%. WHILE WE HAVE HAD TEMPORARY SERVICE DECLINED, WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED, WE ARE FIXING THIS. IN FACT, LAST WEEK SERVICE IMPROVED ACROSS ALL MAJOR MAIL AND PACKAGE CATEGORIES, AND I'M LASER FOCUSED ON IMPROVING SERVICE FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. THE SECOND OF TWO CHANGES I MADE AS POSTMASTER GENERAL WAS INSTALLING A NEW ORGANIZATIONAL REPORTING STRUCTURE TO BETTER ALIGN TALENT AND RESOURCES TO INSTILL GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PERFORMANCE AND TO FOCUS THE ORGANIZATION ON SERVICE AND GROWTH. THESE CHANGES, CREATING A NEW ON-TIME TRANSPORTATION NETWORK AND DESIGNING AN ENGAGE FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, WILL BE THE CATALYST FOR SIGNIFICANT PERMITS AND COST, PERFORMANCE AND GROWTH THAT I PLAN FOR THIS VITAL AMERICAN INSTITUTION. MATTER CHAIRWOMAN, THE WOMEN AND MEN OF THE POSTAL SERVICE HAVE DEMONSTRATED EXTRAORDINARY COMMITMENT TO OUR MISSION OF SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IN EVERY COMMUNITY IN AMERICA NEW WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO KEEP OUR EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS SAVE AS WE FULFILL OUR ESSENTIAL ROLE IN DELIVERING THE MEDICATIONS, BENEFIT CHECKS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE PUBLIC DEPENDS UPON. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC, THERE HAS BEEN A PUBLIC OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FOR OUR POSTAL EMPLOYEES AS THEY PERFORM THEIR ESSENTIAL SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE NATION. THIS IS A WELL- DESERVED TESTAMENT TO THEIR DEDICATION. CHAIRWOMAN MALONEY, RANKING MEMBER COMER, I HOPE WE CAN AGREE THAT THE FINANCIAL STATE OF THE FIGHT POSTAL SERVICE IS UNACCEPTABLE AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THIS COMMITTEE AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO RESTORE THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND TO IMPROVE THE WAY WE SERVE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU AND THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WE WILL NOW RECOGNIZE CHAIRMAN DUNCAN. YOU ARE NOW RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. HE WILL BE APPEARING REMOTELY. YOU ARE NOW RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. CHAIRWOMAN MALONEY, RANKING MEMBER COMER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS I'VE HAD THE HONOR TO SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL BOARD OF GOVERNORS. THROUGHOUT MY LIFE I HAVE LOOKED AT WAYS TO HELP STRENGTHEN AND SUPPORT INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. I SPENT FIVE YEARS ON THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BOARD. I SERVED ON NUMEROUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS IN KENTUCKY AND ON A FEDERAL LEVEL. WHEN I TOOK THIS POSITION, I DID SO BECAUSE OF MY ASPIRATION FOR THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND HIS PUBLIC SERVICE MISSION. I SPENT MY LIFE A RULE APPALACHIA. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THE POSTAL SERVICE IS TO COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. ALSO, THE POSTAL SERVICE PROVIDES IMPORTANT JOBS TO MORE THAN 630,000 AMERICANS , WHICH AT ONE TIME INCLUDED MY OWN GRANDFATHER WHO DELIVERED MAIL BY HORSE BACK IN EAST TENNESSEE. SINCE I JOINED THE BOARD, I HAVE MADE IT IMPORTANT TO MEET WORKERS AND SPEAK DIRECTLY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, UNION MEMBERS, UNION LEADERS. THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE DEEPENED MY UNDERSTANDING FOR AND OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC POSTAL SERVICE. STARTING ON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS ON THIS INSTITUTION , I KNOW IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY. WE REPRESENT THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THAT MEANS I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE SPECIAL ROLE IN OUR NATION. IT MEANS I CAN NEVER FORGIVE THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE PUTTING US AT RISK. THESE CHALLENGES SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE TO MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. ON TWO OCCASIONS I HAVE SENT YOU THE ANNUAL REPORTS OF PROGRESS. IN THOSE COMMUNICATIONS I WROTE THAT "THE POSTAL SERVICE BUSINESS MODEL IS BROKEN AND WILL ALWAYS PRODUCE LOSSES IN THE COMING YEARS WITHOUT CHANGE." THE POSTMASTER GENERAL MEGAN BREAK IN AND NOTIFY THE BOARD OF AN IMPENDING RETIREMENT BUT THE BOARD IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED WE WOULD BE FACED WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION WE WOULD MAKE AS GOVERNORS. THE SELECTION OF THE NEW POSTMASTER GENERAL. THE BOARD AGREED THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE NEEDED A TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADER, ONE THAT CAN HELP US BUILD AND FAITH LONG- STANDING CHALLENGES. THE POSTAL SERVICE IS AN AMAZING INSTITUTION, AND WE CAN DO A LOT TO MAKE IT BETTER. WHAT WE CAN DO IS INCREASE OUR EFFICIENCY AND CUT DOWN ON UNNECESSARY EXPENSES. WE CAN ALSO HELP ON MARKETABILITY AND MODERNIZATION WHILE REDUCING EXPENSES. BUSINESS AS USUAL IS NOT AN OPTION. THE BOARD IS ELECTED LOUIS DEJOY TO SERVE AS POSTMASTER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. HE IS THE FIFTH SINCE 1971 TO JOIN THE INSTITUTION FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE BELIEVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS AN ASSET. IN ADDITION, MR. DEJOY HAS DECADES OF EXPERIENCE WITH IMPROVING AND MANAGING SOPHISTICATED LOGISTIC CHANGE. FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS HE HAS A DEEP KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE INSTITUTION. THE BOARD HAS CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY TO PERFORM FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THIS ELECTION SEASON. FIVE YEARS FROM NOW THE UNITED STATES WILL CELEBRATE THE 250th ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN POSTAL SERVICE. THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY THIS INSTITUTION HAS DELIVERED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE HAVE A SACRED RESPONSIBILITY TO PRESERVE, DEFENDANT STRENGTHEN THIS ORGANIZATION FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. I NOW RECOGNIZE MYSELF FOR QUESTIONING. MR. DEJOY, WE HAVE ALL BEEN FLOODED WITH CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT THE DELAY IN THE MAIL. IN THE VOTE ON MY BILL DELIVERING FOR AMERICA ON SATURDAY, 26 REPUBLICANS VOTED WITH US, AND THEY EXPRESSED THE SAME CONCERNS. PEOPLE DISSENT PENNED ON THEIR MALE FOR THEIR MEDICATIONS, -- PEOPLE DEPEND ON THEIR MALE FOR MEDICATIONS . IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WE HAVE SEEN HEADLINES ACROSS THIS NATION FROM MANY STATES, MAJOR NEWS FROM OUR STATES ABOUT THE DELAY IN THE MAIL. IT HAS BEEN SAID IT IS A MAJOR INSTITUTION IN OUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE DEPEND ON IT. OVER THE WEEKEND WE OBTAINED THIS INTERNAL DOCUMENT . IT IS DATED LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO ON AUGUST 12. IT IS ENTITLED SERVICE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT FOR THE PMG, POSTMASTER GENERAL BRIEFING. YOUR OFFICE ALREADY CONFIRMED TO MY OFFICE THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS AUTHENTIC. LET'S GO THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF IT NOW. THIS DOCUMENT CLEARLY SHOWS MAJOR DEGRADATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD , BEGINNING IN JULY WHEN YOU STARTED YOUR CHANGES. HERE IS THE DOCUMENT FOR FIRST-CLASS MAIL AND OVERALL IT IS DOWN AN ASTONISHING 8% FROM THE BASELINE BEFORE YOUR CHANGES FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS. BEGINNING IN JULY. THE SECOND ONE, THE NEXT SLIDE, IS THE MARKETING MAIL. THAT IS DOWN A STUNNING 8.4%. NOW, THE NEXT, AND IT IS ON THE WALL WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT BETTER, THE NEXT PERIODICALS. THAT IS DOWN ALMOST 10%, DOWN 9.5%. MR. DEJOY, YOU AND YOUR AIDES HAVE REPEATEDLY DOWNPLAYED THESE DELAYS. YOU JUST DOWNPLAYED IT IN YOUR TESTIMONY. BUT THIS IS JUST A DISASTER FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEIR MALE. DON'T YOU AGREE? WOULD YOU TURN ON YOUR MIC? WE CAN'T HEAR YOU. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE DETERIORATION IN SERVICE AND ARE WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY. IN FACT, WE ARE SEEING A BIG RECOVERY THIS WEEK. IN FACT, THAT REPORT, I REQUESTED THAT REPORT PUT TOGETHER. ODDLY ENOUGH, WE DIDN'T HAVE A MEASUREMENT BRIEFING AT AN EXECUTIVE LEVEL LIKE THIS BEFORE MY ARRIVAL. WHERE THE WHOLE EXECUTIVE TEAM WAS INVOLVED IN LOOKING AT THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES. WE ARE FOCUSED ON FIXING IT. WE HAVE SEEN A NICE RECOVERY. WE WILL HAVE IT BACK -- MY GOAL IS TO GET IT, YOU KNOW, -- WE WERE NOT SEE METRICS BEFORE. WITH THIS FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE, WE HAVE A REAL GOOD SHOT AT GETTING TO THE STATED METRICS THAT WE ARE GOVERNED BY. YOU JUST TESTIFIED THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE JOB 70 DAYS. THIS IS ESSENTIALLY YOUR REPORT CARD FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME. IF ANY OTHER CEO HAD THIS KIND OF PLUMMETING RECORD IN HIS FIRST TWO MONTHS ON THE JOB, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY HE WOULD BE KEPT ON.  THAT IS AN UNFAIR ACCUSATION. MAY I CONTINUE? WHEN YOU TESTIFIED ON FRIDAY SENATORS ASKED YOU OVER AND OVER ABOUT THE STATUS OF THESE DELAYS. THEY ALSO ASKED YOU TO PRODUCE ANALYSIS ABOUT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF YOUR CHANGES. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO MENTION TO THE SENATORS THAT THIS DOCUMENT EXISTED . YOU COULD HAVE SAID, AS A MATTER OF FACT SENATOR, I JUST RECEIVED A DETAILED BRIEFING, AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE DATA SHOWS MAJOR DELAYS IN NEARLY ALL CATEGORIES. BUT YOU DIDN'T DO THAT. YOU DISMISSED OF THESE NATIONWIDE DELAYS AS "A DIP " AND YOU REFUSED TO TURN OVER ANY ANALYSIS . MY QUESTION IS, WHY DIDN'T YOU DISCLOSE THIS DOCUMENT AND ANY ANALYSIS TO THE SENATE WHEN YOU HAD IT AND THEY WERE ASKING FOR IT? THEY ASKED ME FOR IT ON FRIDAY . THEY ASKED ME FOR ANALYSIS OF MY DECISION. OF THE DELAYS. I WATCHED OF THE TESTIMONY. THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS FOR DELAYS BESIDES ADJUST THE ACTION THAT I TOOK TO RUN TRUCKS ON TIME. THERE ARE OTHER REASONS FOR THE DELAYS IN THE NATION. I WOULD SAY RUNNING TRUCKS ON TIME WOULD PROBABLY INCREASE DELIVERY, BUT FOR SOME REASON IMPACTED UP 5 TO 6 DAYS IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. ON AUGUST 14 THIS COMMITTEE SENT TO A 10 PAGE LETTER ALONG WITH THE CHAIRS AND RANKING MEMBERS OF THREE OTHER COMMITTEES, AND WE ASKED YOU TO PRODUCE ALL COMMUNICATIONS WORK ON QUOTING FROM THE LETTER, ALL COMMUNICATIONS, EVALUATIONS, ASSESSMENTS OR REPORTS REGARDING MAIL LEFT BEHIND OR DELAYED AS A RESULT OF THESE NEW POLICIES THAT YOU INSTITUTED. ,, DOCUMENTS TO US, BUT YOU DID NOT PRODUCE THIS ONE. AND SO MY PR QUESTION IS WHY DID YOU LEAVE THIS IMPORTANT INTERNAL DOCUMENT FROM THE POSTAL PROFESSIONALS THAT WAS DELIVERED TO YOU AND BRIEFED TO YOU TWO DAYS BEFORE THE SENATE HEARING? WHY DID YOU, WHY DID YOU LEAVE IT OUT? I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE REQUEST IN TOTAL OR HOW WE SUPPORTED IT. I'M SURE THE STAFF ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS AS THEY WERE ASKED. LET ME FOR THE RECORD CLEAR UP, THAT IS NOT A POLICY CHANGE. THAT IS A REQUEST THAT WE RUN OUR 40,000 TRUCKS A DAY ON SCHEDULE AND YOUR INTUITION IS RIGHT. YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE MAIL MOVED FASTER AND IT DID, A GOOD PORTION OF IT MOVED FASTER. WE'RE SITTING THERE LOOKING AT A REPORT THAT TALKS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 1 BILLION AND $3 BILLION WORTH OF ON T WASTED OUR TETRUCK TRIPS BEING OUT OF SCHEDULE. IT WAS AN EASY REQUEST THAT I SPOKE WITH ISSUE IN THE ORGANIZATION. MY TIME IS LIMITED AND THEN I'M CONCERNED WHY WE DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY OF THIS INFORMATION WE AND I HAVE TO JUST SAY THAT WE SENT OUR LETTER TWO DAYS AFTER YOU RECEIVED THIS BRIEFING AND THIS DOCUMENT. IT MUST HAVE BEEN FRESH ON YOUR MIND. THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR CONCEALING THIS AND WITHHOLDING THIS INFORMATION FROM THE COMMITTEE OR FROM YOUR TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SENATE WHEN YOU WERE EXPRESSLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INFORMATION IN THE DOCUMENT. URN FORTUNATELY THIS COMMITTEE RECEIVED IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE. SO MR. DEJOY, YOU'RE WITHHOLDING INFORMATION FROM US, CONCEALING DOCUMENTS AND DOWN PLAYING THE DAMAGE YOU'RE CAUSING. LET ME CLOSE WITH THIS. THIS COMMITTEE EXPECTS A FULL AND COMPLETE PRODUCTION OF ALL THE DOCUMENTS WE REQUESTED L NO LATER ON THIS COMING WEDNESDAY. AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO WITHHOLD INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO COMPLY YOU CAN EXPECT A SUBPOENA. I KNOW MANY OF OUR MEMBERED INTO ASK OUHOW YOU PLAN TO FIX THE PROBLEMS WITHIN WE WILL GET TO THOSE QUESTIONS NEXT. WITH THAT I NOW RECOGNIZE THE DISTINGUISHED RANKING MEMBER FOR HEFIVE MINUTE, FOR HIS QUESTIONS. VIRGINIA FOXX R WILL BE THE FIRST TO RESPOND. VIRGINIA FOXX FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIRMAN. I DO NOTE THAT YOU'RE GOING OVER TIME A GREAT DEAL. POSTMASTER DE GENERAL DEJOY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. SOME CLAIM THE AFTERNOON SOARATION PILOT AND YOUR CHANGES ARE DELIBERATING % EFFORTS TO SLOW DOWN MAIL AND HURT POSTAL SERVICE EMPLOYEES. IS THAT TRUE? NO, MA'AM. ARE YOU BANNING EMPLOYEES FROM CHARGING OVERTIME OR ARE YOU TRYING TO LIMIT UNPLANNED OVERTIME TO ENSURE THE POSTAL SERVICE'S VIABILITY? AT THIS POINT NO AND NO VI%TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. THANK YOU. POSTMASTER GENERAL DEJOY, AS A LOGISTICS EXPERTS, AND I BELIEVE REPRESENTATIVE WALKER OUTLINED YOUR EXPERTISE VERY WELL. WHAT DOES TITHE CONSISTENT USE OF UNPLANNED OVERTIME AND SEA NEED FOR EXTRA TRIPS MEAN IN TERMS OF THE EFFICIENCY OF OPERATIONS? WELL, BESIDES COSTING SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY, YOU KNOW, FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE IN IT TERMS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT ALSO DOES NOT KEEP THE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN BALANCE WHICH ALSO RESULTS IN DELAYS IN MAIL AND E QUILLISH' YUM IN PRODUCTION PROCESSES ACROSS THE NETWORK. CAN MORE EFFICIENT ON TIME OPERATIONS RESULT IN BETTER DELIVERY PERFORMANCE? ABSOLUTELY. DOES UNPLANNED VE OVERTIME HINDER THE POSTAL SERVICE'S ABILITY TO STAY FINANCIALLY VIABLE? ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, MY HUSBAND AND ? I HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME VERY, VERY Y INEFFICIENT SERVICES ON THE PART OF THE POST OFFICE IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. I'M NOT STGOING TO GO INTO THOSE DETAILS. I WANT TO APPLAUD YOUR APPROACH TO ACCOUNTABILITY AND WHAT WE KNOW FROM OUR % COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE IS THEY RUN AWAY FROM ACCOUNTABILITY IN EVERY CASE IN THE FEDERAL OM GOVERNMENT OR IN % ALLIED SERVICES LIKE THE POST OFFICE. SO LET ME APPLAUD YOU FOR PUSHING ON ACCOUNTABILITY. MR. DEJOY, THE POSTAL SERVICE IS NOT . %A GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT RECEIVES APPROPRIATIONS. IN FACT, IT IS LAW THE POSTAL REORGANIZATION ACT OF 1970 CREATED THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE AS AN INDEPENDENT AND SELF-SUSTAINING ENTITY. POSTMASTER GENERAL DEJOY, DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS YOUR DUTY TI% TO UPHOLD THIS LAW AND ENSURE THAT THE USPS IS SELF-SUFFICIENT? I DO. AND WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO MAKE THE USPS SELF- SUFFICIENT? LEGISLATION ? WITH REGARD TO OUR HEALTHCARE, MEDICAID INTEGRATION AND OUR PENSION REFORM. FLEXIBILITY FROM THE PRC. WE'RE IN THE 14th %FR%YEAR OF A TEN YEAR ANALYSIS POSTAL SERVICE ITSELF E IS A LIBRARY OF OIG REPORTS IDENTIFYING FLAWED PRACTICES AND BILLIONS AND % BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF COST WASTE THAT THIS COMMITTEE, NOBODY SEEMS TO PAY ATTENTION TO. AND THEN OUR POSTAL SERVICE, OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM ITSELF, HELPING FIX ME OURSELVES IN TERMS OF SERVICE AND COST. WE HAVE A PLAN NOW TO DO THAT AND PART IT HAVE INCLUDES RUNNING OUR TRUCKS ON TIME. AND THESE OIG REPORTS HAVE COME FROM DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTS AND REPUBLICAN AT A ADMINISTRATIONS BOTH, IS THAT CORRECT? YES, MA'AM. THANK YOU. IF YOU HAVE NO OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY, CAN YOU POSSIBLY MAKE THE POSTAL SERVICE SELF- SUFFICIENT. I THINK WE HAVE A PVERY, VERY GOOD SHOT. WE HAVE SOME NEW REVENUE IDEAS FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE ALSO.  I BELIEVE IN THE SIX DAY DELIVERY. I THINK THE CARRIER IS, THE CARRIERS, POSTAL CARRIERS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS WHAT BRINGS THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT AND THE APPROVAL RATING WE HAVE. WE HAVE PLANS TO, TO REALLY ENHANCE THAT RELATIONSHIP AND TO HELP OUR GROWTH.  THANK YOU AND RANKING MEMBER. I YIELD BACK. THANK YOU. I NOW RECOGNIZE CONGRESSWOMAN NORTON. CONGRESSWOMAN NORTON BY WEB X. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. THIS HEARING IS VERY NECESSARY TO CLARIFY MATTERS THAT WERE LEFT OPEN WHEN WE TOOK THE VOTE ALREADY ON THIS BILL. MR. DEJOY, AND BEFORE TESTIMONY YOU SUGGESTED D THAT THE CORONAVIRUS WAS HAVING, AND HERE I'M QUOTING, A SIGNIFICANT, A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN EMPLOYEE AVAILABILITY IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. N HE% COUNTRY. , ONE OF THE ITEMS UNDER CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED YOU WOULD BRING QUOTE, ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO BEAR.  THE 650,000 MEN AND WOMEN OF THE POSTAL SERVICE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO HAVING A SUCCESSFUL ELECTION IN OUR ROLE IN ELECTION. OVERTIME, EXTRA TRUCK TRIPS, POSTAL INSPECTION CHECKS, ROUNDS IN EACH POSTAL PROCESSING. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE RECORD THAT EXPANDED OVERTIME WILL BE ALLOWED IN THE TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION. MY NEXT QUESTION IS ON A, POSTAL SERVICE DOCUMENT WE RECEIVED THIS IS WHAT I SAID. I'M QUOTING NOW THE DOCUMENT EXPECTATIONS AND PLANS. OVERTIME WILL BE ELIMINATED. THERE YOU SEE IT BEFORE YOU. WE ARE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR OVERTIME AND IT IS NOT COST EFFECTIVE. MORE TO COME ON THIS. WE ASKED YOUR GENERAL COUNSEL AND HE CLAIMED THAT THAT CAME FROM A MID LEVEL MANAGER AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT OF POSTAL OFFICE POLICY SO I ASK YOU, WOULD A POSTAL MANAGER SENT THIS DOCUMENT WITHOUT SOME KIND OF WORD FROM YOU OR FROM THE TOP OF THE AGENCY? AND CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHO THIS WAS AND GIVE US AN -- THANK YOU. I HAVE PURPOSELY NOT TRIED TO FIND OUT WHO THAT WAS BUT THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT PEOPLE INTERPRET. TRIED NOT TO FIND OUT WHO THAT WAS? THAT'S RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW. THAT WAS NOT A DIRECTIVE FROM ME. THERE IS, THERE'S 50,000 MANAGERS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS I CHANGED THE ORGANIZATION QUICKLY AFTER THE ROLLOUT OF THE TRUCK SCHEDULE. SO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WHOEVER IT IS -- ISSUING THAT TO ALL YOUR EMPLOYEES? ABSOLUTELY. I WISH YOU WOULD GIVE THAT NAME WHEN YOU FIND IT TO THE CHAIR AS WELL. IN A STATEMENT ON AUGUST 18th, YOU STATED OVERTIME HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE APPROVED AS NEEDED. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND AS NEEDED WHAT THAT MEANS. CAN POSTAL MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES CONTINUE APPROVING AND USING OVERTIME AS THEY DID BEFORE YOUR TENURE BEGAN OR ARE THERE ANY CHANGES SINCE YOU TOOK OFFICE? SAME AS SOME PRIOR TO ME BEING HERE. HAVE YOU ISSUED ANY INTERNAL GUIDANCE TO THAT EFFECT AND WOULD YOU PROVIDE IT TO US PLEASE? I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR THE QUESTION. HAVE YOU ISSUED ANY INTERNAL GUIDANCE TO THAT EFFECT CONTINUING TO APPROVE AND USE OVERTIME? I NEVER ISSUED A GUIDANCE AGAINST THAT EFFECT. WELL WE'RE ASKING ARE YOU INTENDING TO ISSUE ANY GUIDANCE TO THE EFFECT? YES, I'VE TOLD THE EXECUTIVE TEAM, THE OPERATIONS TEAM, THEY KNOW THERE IS NO DIFFERENT PROCESS THAN PRIOR TO MY ARRIVAL. OKAY, THE GENTLEWOMAN'S TIME IS COMPLETED. MADAM CHAIR CAN I JUST ASK HE PROVIDE US, PROVIDE YOU ANY WRITTEN GUIDANCE ON OVERTIME. OKAY. TIME. I MAKE NOTE OF THAT REQUEST ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE. I NOW RECOGNIZE MR. GOSAR. YEAH, CAN YOU HEAR ME AND SEE ME? YES, WE CAN. OKAY. THANK YOU. WE CAN HEAR YOU. WE CAN'T SEE YOU. THERE YOU ARE. OKAY. MR. DEJOY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY AND I WANT TO CLEAR UP SOME OBVIOUS POLITICAL DISINFORMATION THAT THE MAJORITY IS PUTTING OUT. THEN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ACKNOWLEDGMENT THE DIP IN SERVICES. WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A FEW MINUTES. ON SATURDAY OUT ON THE HOUSE FLOOR MY COLLEAGUES SAID THE POST OFFICE WAS ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE. YOU HAVE OVER $10 BILLION CASH ON HAND AND ACCESS TO A $10 BILLION LINE OF CREDIT WHICH MAKES YOU FISCALLY VIABLE THROUGH AUGUST 2021. IS THAT TRUE? YES, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT ONLY IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WOULD THAT BE A GOOD POSITION TO BE IN WHEN I HAVE $135 BILLION IN LIABILITIES AND $2.5 BILLION A MONTH, A WEEK, BIWEEKLY PAYROLL AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHERS BUT YES, WE CAN GET THROUGH THE ELECTION AND WITH THE LOAN SHOULD WE TAKE IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD PAY IT BACK BUT SHOULD WE TAKE IT WE SHOULD BE FINE UNTIL MID 21. SO NOW ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GENERATING MORE REVENUE AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THAN YOU ALSO DID LAST YEAR AND YOU'RE PROCESSING MORE SUCCESSFULLY PROCESSED AN UP TICK IN MASS MAIL GOVERNMENT ITEMS SUCH AS STIMULUS CHECKS. WE'RE SEEING MORE REVENUE, MOSTLY DUE TO PACKAGE INCREASE, MAIL PRODUCTS ARE DOWN 15%. OR SO ON AVERAGE. BUT PACKAGE VOLUME IS UP SUBSTANTIALLY. PACKAGE VOLUME IS VERY COSTLY FOR US TO HANDLE IN OVER CAPACITY METHOD. SO NOW DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE MONEY ON HAND SUCCESSFUL, THAT YOU SAID THE MAIL VOLUME IS DOWN BY 15% AND THE HARD WORK OF THE OVER 600,000 POSTAL WORKERS THAT YOU CAN HANDLE THE ELECTION INCREASES YOU WILL POSSIBLY SEE? I WILL BE VERY, VERY CLEAR THAT THE 650,000 MEN AND WOMEN. WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR UNION LEADERSHIP, MANAGEMENT TEAM, EMPLOYEES, WE WILL BE ABLE TO HANDLE ALL ELECTION MAIL FOR THE 2020 ELECTION. SO NOW I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE SLOWDOWN RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS WEEK THE PRESIDENT OF THE PHOENIX POSTAL WORKERS UNION STATED SUFFERING FROM THESE PANDEMIC WORK FORCE STRAINS. NO PROCESSING MACHINES HAVE BEEN REMOVED DURING YOUR TENURE AND THE USE OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE PROCESS OVER 700,000 BALLOTS IN OUR RECENT PRIMARY ELECTION. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. HAVE YOU HAD SLOWDOWNS OR IMPEDIMENTS LIKE IN SEATTLE AND PORTLAND AND NEW YORK CITY AND CHICAGO BECAUSE OF THE RIOTING AND THE ANARCHY GOING ON? WELL, SIR, I MEAN ANY KIND OF RIOTING DOES PRODUCE DELAYS WITH ANY TYPE OF PUBLIC SERVICE SO I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC MEASUREMENT ON THAT. BUT I WILL SAY THIS THAT AS THE CORONAVIRUS CASES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE EXPANDED IT HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON OUR EMPLOYEE AVAILABILITY AND THE URBAN AREAS THAT ARE HOT SPOTS ARE, YOU KNOW THE AVERAGES IS DON'T PLAY OUT WHAT THE REAL PICTURE IS LIKE IN AREAS LIKE PHILADELPHIA WHERE EMPLOYEE AVAILABILITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW OUR NORMAL RUN RATES AND WHAT IT HAS BEEN IN THE PANDEMIC. WE ACTUALLY PEAKED, STARTED TO PIQUE IN TERMS OF AVAILABILITY ISSUES IN THE JULY TIME FRAME. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS. POLICY POLICY CHANGES TO THE POSTAL SERVICE ELIMINATION OF OVERTIME, PROHIBITING EXTRA TRIPS, REMOVING, IS THAT TRUE? THE EXTRA TRIPS AND THEY WEREN'T PROHIBITED. IT'S TRUE ON EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE EXTRA TRIPS. MY DIRECTION WAS WE NEED TO WORK ON GETTING OUR TRUCKS ON SCHEDULE AND MITIGATING OUR EXTRA TRIPS. WE STILL RUN 7, 800 EXTRA TRIP AS DAY AND WE STILL HAVE THOUSANDS OF TRUCK TRIPS THAT RUN LATE. IT WASN'T A FLAT DIRECTIVE. IT WAS WORK TO OUR PLAN. COME UP WITH A PLAN TO WORK THROUGH OUR PLAN. THE MANAGEMENT TEAM PUT THE PLAN TOGETHER AND EXECUTED ON THE PLAN. AND, SO EVERYTHING ELSE I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH. IT WAS A LONG STANDING PLAN ON COLLECTION BOXES AND SORTING MACHINES AND POSTAL HOURS. REALLY IN THE AREAS THEY WERE TAKING CARE OF THAT. SO ANOTHER QUICK QUESTION, IS THE PONY EXPRESS STILL AVAILABLE TODAY? I'VE BEEN HERE 70 DAYS, SIR. I'M SEARCHING FOR THE GOOD. I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET, NO. I THINK IT'S GONE. TECHNOLOGY HAS THIS, IT CHANGES AND ANY TRANSFER OF NEW IDEAS DOESN'T ALWAYS GO SMOOTHLY, DOES IT? I'M SORRY?  IT TRANSITIONS DON'T ALWAYS GO SMOOTHLY, YOU SHOULD HAVE A RECOVERY PROCESS. OUR RECOVERY PROCESS IS TAKING TOO LONG. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED IN A FEW DAYS AND IT'S NOT. SO THE IMPACT IS A LOT OF REASONS, A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPACTING OUR SERVICE. THIS IS ONE OF THEM ON THE FRONT END AND WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED IT UP QUICKER AND I THINK WE HAVE THE FOCUS ON IT NOW AND IT'LL RECOVER QUITE RAPIDLY GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES MR. CLAY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING. MR. DEJOY, ONE OF THE MOST DAMAGING RESULTS OF YOUR ACTIONS IS THE REPORTS WE HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM PEOPLE AND FAMILIES THE COUNTRY WHO ARE NOT GETTING THEIR MAIL AND MEDICATIONS ON TIME. EACH YEAR. THAT IS MILLIONS OF SHIPMENTS PER DAY. SIX DAY AS WEEK.  WE'RE HAVING A TECHNICAL PROBLEM RIGHT NOW WITH MR. CLAY. WE CAN'T HEAR YOU. IT'S BREAKING UP.  SHOULD WE GO FOR IT OR NOT? THIS PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN AGGRAVATED DURING THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS BECAUSE MAIL ORDER. MADAM CHAIR. MR. CLAY, WE'RE GOING TO HOLD UP ON YOU AND GO TO MR. LYNCH AND THEN GO TO A REPUBLICAN AND THEN GO TO YOU. CONGRESSMAN LYNCH YOU ARE NOW RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MR. MANY DEJOY FOR ATTENDING. MR. DEJOY, YOU'VE BEEN THE POSTMASTER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS RIGHT YOU? 70 DAYS. 70 DAYS. OKAY. SO I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS AND SINCE MY MOM AND TWO OF MY SISTERS, BUNCH OF MY AUNTS, COUSINS, IN LAWS ALL WORK AT THE POST OFFICE, SOME OF THEM ARE RETIRED, SOME OF THEM ARE STILL THERE. AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS YOU MIGHT SAY I'VE BEEN COMPELLED TO TAKE A KEEN INTEREST ON MATTERS AFFECTING THE POSTAL SERVICE. I'M ALSO A FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE IRON WORKERS UNION IN BOSTON SO YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF MY PERSPECTIVE. IT'S BLUE COLLAR, YOU KNOW, COMMON SENSE, GET YOUR WORK DONE SORT OF PERSPECTIVE. SO MR. DEJOY, AS THE POSTMASTER OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR THE LAST 70 DAYS, DID YOU KNOW THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS NEVER ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE IN A SITUATION THAT IT'S IN TODAY? THROUGHOUT THE POSTAL SERVICE HISTORY THERE'S BEEN A TRADITION OF RELIABLE DELIVERY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OUT OF ARTICLE 1, SECTION 8 OF THE CONSTITUTION. GOING BACK TO BEN FRANKLIN. THE PONY EXPRESS HAS BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE. I WAS ACTUALLY WATCHING A KEN BURNS SPECIAL LAST WEEK AND HE HAD THESE HEART WRENCHING LETTERS THAT WERE BACK AND FORTH FROM SOLDIERS DURING THE CIVIL WAR SO EVEN AT A MOMENT WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS AT WAR WITH ITSELF THE MAIL WAS DELIVERED. DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND THE SPANISH FLU OF 1918, THROUGH THE GREAT DEPRESSION, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK. A THOUSAND BANK FAILURES. THE MAIL WAS DELIVERED ON TIME. EVEN WITH THE SECOND WORLD WAR. INTERNATIONAL MAIL WAS DELIVERED ON TIME. JUST SO HAPPENS I WAS ELECTED ON 9/11, DAY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON OUR NATION. A GOD AWFUL DAY. SOME PEOPLE FORGET IN THE DAYS AFTER 9/11 WE HAD DIRECT ANTHRAX ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE. WE LOST TWO BRAVE POSTAL WORKERS DOWN ANOTHER THE BRENTWOOD FACILITY IN DC FROM ANTHRAX INHALATION. FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY THE POSTAL UNIONS CONTINUE TO SEND THEIR MEMBERS INTO THE POST OFFICE TO DO THEIR JOB TO KEEP THE COUNTRY RUNNING. SO TWO WEEKS AGO AFTER YOU'D BEEN POSTMASTER JUST A FEW WEEKS THAT ALL CHANGED. IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC THAT HAS KILLED 170,000 AMERICANS AND ON THE EVE OF A NATIONAL ELECTION AT A TIME WHEN THE CDC IS ADVISING PEOPLE NOT TO GATHER, LIMIT OUTSIDE CONTACT THE POSTAL SERVICE STARTED REMOVING 671 HIGH SPEED MAIL SORTING MACHINES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU STOPPED THE APWU FROM SORTING THE MAIL AND YOU STOPPED THE NATIONAL LETTER CARRIERS AND HANDLERS TO WORK OVERTIME TO DELIVER THE MAIL. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 240 YEARS IN OUR HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE YOU SENT OUT A LETTER EMBARRASSINGLY IN JULY TO 46 STATES THAT SAY THE POST OFFICE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT WE CAN DELIVER THE MAIL IN TIME FOR THE ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER. WE HAVE REPORTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE SERVICE HAS BEEN DELAYED AND THE MAIL IS PILING UP. YOU HAVE ENDED A ONCE PROUD TRADITION. FLOW AS A MEMBER OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WE HAVE A CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE IN THE CONGRESS. WE CONDUCT OVERSIGHT ON EVERY MATTER THAT IMPACTS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC. THERE ARE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO HAVE BEEN TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN A COUPLE DOZEN TIMES. THEY'VE BEEN TO YEMEN, SOMALIA, GAZA, YOU NAME IT. THEY LITERALLY GO TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO INVESTIGATE MATTERS THAT AFFECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT INVOLVES OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS IN UNIFORM. IN THIS MOMENT IT IS OUR POSTAL WORKERS WHO HAPPEN TO BE OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM. THEY ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS PANDEMIC. THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC THEY'VE RISKED THEIR OWN HEALTH AND SAFETY TO DELIVER OR TRY TO DELIVER MAIL, MEDICINES AND MAIL-IN BALLOTS TO EVERY AMERICAN HOME AND BUSINESS SIX DAY AS WEEK. AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE I'M SUPPOSED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. I'M TEMPTED TO ASK AFTER 240 YEARS OF PATRIOTIC SERVICE DELIVERING THE MAIL HOW CAN ONE PERSON SCREW THIS UP IN JUST A FEW WEEKS. NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU BRING PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERTISE. I GUESS WE COULDN'T FIND A GOVERNMENT WORKER WHO COULD SCREW IT UP THIS FAST. IT WOULD TAKE THEM A WHILE. THE PRESIDENT IS RUNNING THIS POST OFFICE LIKE A BUSINESS, LIKE HE SAID. HE'S RUNNING IT INTO THE GROUND AS HE HAS DECLARED BANKRUPTCY A FEW TIMES ON HIS OWN BUSINESSES. AND IN AN EFFORT TO APPLY THE FACTS, THE REAL FACTS, NOT THE ALTERNATIVE FACTS BASED ON WHAT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY DONE, ONE CAN ONLY REACH AS A FACT FINDER WE CAN ONLY REACH TWO CONCLUSIONS. ONE, EITHER THROUGH GROSS INCOMPETENCE YOU HAVE ENDED THE 240 YEAR HISTORY OF DELIVERING THE MAIL RELIABLY ON TIME OR THE SECOND CONCLUSION THAT WE COULD GATHER IS THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS ON PURPOSE. AND THAT YOU'RE DELIBERATELY DISMANTLING THIS ONCE PROUD TRADITION. THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME IS EXPIRED. THE GENTLEMAN MAY ANSWER A QUESTION. MY LAST QUESTION IS THIS. THANK YOU, SENATOR. WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING? WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S MY QUESTION. THANK YOU, SIR. THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIRED. I WOULD LIKE TO AGREE WITH YOU ON THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF OUR 650,000 EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE NATION AND THE HISTORY OF THE POSTAL SERVICE FOR THEIR, THE 250 YEAR HISTORY OF SERVING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. WILL YOU PUT THE MACHINES BACK? I'M PROUD TO LEAD TO THE ORGANIZATION. THE REST OF YOUR ACCUSATIONS. WILL YOU PUT THE MACHINES BACK? NO,LY NOT. YOU WILL NOT. WILL NOT. YOU WILL NOT. WELL THERE YOU GO. THERE I GO WHAT? MADAM CHAIR. ORDER, ORDER. THE GENTLEMAN MAY ANSWER THE QUESTION WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED. THE QUESTION IS MR. YOU PUT THE MACHINES BACK. THE ANSWER IS NO AND EVERY ACCUSATION YOU MADE OTHER THAN THE TRUCKS, ADHERE TO THE TRUCK SCHEDULE IS INACCURATE AND MORE MISINFORMATION. YOU WON'T PUT THE MACHINES BACK. YOU TOOK THEM OUT. MADAM CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR. MR. JORDAN IS NOW RECOGNIZED. CONGRESSMAN JORDAN. IS HE HERE? I BELIEVE THAT'S NOT THE ORDER. WHAT? NO, IT'S PALMER. CONGRESSMAN PALMER. I'M GETTING DIFFERENT SIGNS UP HERE. KEEPS CHANGING. CONGRESSMAN PALMER IS NOW RECOGNIZED. I THINK THE CHAIRMAN AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE FROM AUGUST 26, 2015 ALMOST FIVE YEARS TO THE DAY THAT THERE WAS A DECLINE IN FIRST CLASS LETTER DELIVERLY OF 18 TO 44% AND A 38% DECLINE IN THE PERFORMANCE OVER THE SAME TIME IN 2014. THIS WAS DURING THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. THE UNITED STATES POSTAL OFFICE IN 2012 STARTED CLOSING DOZENS OF MAIL SORTING FACILITIES FROM JANUARY TO JUNE OF 2015 THERE WERE 494 MILLION PIECES OF MAIL THAT DID NOT ARRIVE ON TIME. A 48% INCREASE IN DELAYED MAIL DELIVERY AND I'M SURE THAT THAT WAS INTENDED TO IMPACT THE 2012 ELECTION. YET THIS COMMITTEE DIDN'T SEE FIT TO LOOK INTO THAT. MR. DEJOY, THESE WILL BE YES AND NO FOR THE MOST PART. IS THERE ANY WAY THE POST OFFICE CAN KNOW WHETHER OR NOT BALLOTS THAT THEY ARE DELIVERING TO HOUSEHOLDS ARE TO ELIGIBLE VOTERS? ANY WAY FOR THE POST OFFICE TO KNOW THAT? NO, SIR. I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE THERE'S ANALYSIS OF DATA RELEASED BY THE U.S. ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION IN 2019 AND A RECENT U.S. CENSUS BUREAU'S FIVE YEAR AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY THERE WAS 378 COUNTIES NATIONWIDE THAT HAVE MORE VOTER REGISTRATIONS THAN CITIZENS LIVING THERE OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE. THESE ARE COUNTIES WHERE THE REGISTRATION EXCEEDS 100%. THERE ARE AT LEAST 18,658 EXTRA VOTERS. UNDER THE NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT OF 1993, JUDICIAL WATCH SENT NOTICE OF VIOLATION LETTERS TO 19 LARGE COUNTIES IN FIVE STATES. CALIFORNIA, PENNSYLVANIA, NORTH CAROLINA, VIRGINIA AND COLORADO. REAL CLEAR POLITICS REPORTED THAT LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAD AN ESTIMATED 1.6 MILLION INELIGIBLE VOTERS AND 38 STATES HAVE COUNTIES WHERE THE VOTER REGISTRATION IS OVER 100%. INCLUDING MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MARYLAND WHICH REPRESENTED MY DISTINGUISHED FRIEND. THE SAME ARTICLE CITED A 2012 PEW STUDY THAT FOUND THERE ARE 24 MILLION VOTER REGISTRATIONS NO LONGER VALID OR SIGNIFICANTLY INACCURATE. 1.8MILLION DEAD PEOPLE AND ANOTHER 2.75 MILLION IN AT LEAST TWO STATES. NEW YORK FOR INSTANCE IN THIS MOST RECENT PRIMARY THAT IMPACTED YOUR RACE HAD 84,000 BALLOTS, ALMOST A FIFTH OF ALL THE, OVER A FIFTH OF ALL THE BALLOTS I THINK CAST. 12,000 IN YOUR RACE THAT WERE DISQUALIFIED. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU, MR. DEJOY. IS THERE ANY WAY TO BE SURE THAT MORE BALLOTS THAN A HOUSEHOLD SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ARE NOT BEING DELIVERED? I'M SORRY, SAY THAT AGAIN? IS THERE ANY WAY FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A HOUSEHOLD IS GETTING MORE BALLOTS THAN THEY SHOULD BE? WE'RE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING THE MAIL. SO THE ANSWER IS NO THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW THAT. AND IF THERE WAS A WAY TO KNOW THAT I'M SURE THE POSTAL INSPECTORS WOULD GIVE OFF. LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN. ONCE IT CALLED YOU IT TELLS YOU. MADAM CHAIRMAN. I RESERVE MY TIME. ,  HAVE WE RESTORED THIS? THEY'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH TECHNICAL. WE'LL GIVE YOU EXTRA TIME. YOU HAVE EXTRA TIME. WE HAVE SOME TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. THANK YOU. I DO APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE. THANK YOU. THE CENSUS BUREAU REPORTS 11% OF AMERICANS MOVE EACH YEAR. VOTER REGISTRATION ACT PASSED IN 1993 SIGNED BY PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VOTED FOR BY MR. COOPER AND MR. CLAY AND MADAM CHAIRMAN MALONEY REQUIRES STATES TO PERFORM VOTER REGISTRATION MAINTENANCE. IT IS REALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAKE SURE THEIR VOTER ROLLS ARE ACCURATE AND THEY HAVE REMOVED DECEASED PEOPLE AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE OBAMA- BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DID NOT BRING A SINGLE SECTION 8 ENFORCEMENT ACTION DURING THEIR ENTIRE TERM. THAT MAKES THE POST OFFICE TASK OF ONLY DELIVERING BALLOTS TO ELIGIBLE VOTERS MORE DIFFICULT. MY POINT IS IS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO IMPACT AN ELECTION WHEN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS FOR THESE THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER HAD A REAL JOB OUT OF BUSINESS. WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE POST OFFICE SO WHAT HAPPENED IN 2015 DOES NOT CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. AND IT'S GOING, AND THE ACCUSATIONS ARE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO THROW THE ELECTION WHEN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT DONE ITS PART, PARTICULARLY DURING THE OBAMA- BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THE VOTER ROLLS ARE ACCURATE HAS MADE YOUR JOB MORE DIFFICULT. IT'S REALLY NOT YOUR JOB, IS IT? ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. NO, SIR. CAN WE COUNT ON THE POST OFFICE AND DELIVERY PERSONNEL TO NOT DELIVER MASS BALLOTS? STACKS OF BALLOTS TO AN ADDRESS WHERE THE DELIVERY PERSON KNOWS THERE'S NOBODY THERE, AN ABANDONED HOUSE, AN ABANDONED APARTMENT COMPLEX, A BUSINESS? WOULD THAT, THAT WOULD BE REPORTED, WOULDN'T IT? WE DELIVER MAIL TO THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED. AND IF DOZENSOVER HUNDREDS OF MAIL IN BALLOTS ARE DUMPED INTO BLUE MAILBOXES INSTEAD OF LEFT IN A REGULAR, WOULD IT MAKE SENSE TO REPORT TO THE POSTAL INSPECTORS TO MAKE SURE THOSE BALLOTS ARE LEGITIMATE? THERE ARE PROCESSES THE POSTAL INSPECTORS DEPLOY. I'M NOT FULLY AWARE OF WHAT THEY ARE RIGHT NOW, BUT THERE ARE PROCESSES THAT THE POSTAL INSPECTORS DEPLOY TO IDENTIFY ANY FRAUDULENT TYPE OF ACTIVITY WITHIN THE MAIL SYSTEM. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THIS ELECTION IS NOT TAINTED BY FRAUDULENT MAIL- IN BALLOTS. I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT I RARELY DO. WHEN MR. GOSAR MENTIONED THE RIOTS IN PORTLAND AND OTHER, SEATTLE AND OTHER PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY, THERE WAS A CHUCKLE FROM ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND I TAKE OFFENSE AT THAT. POST OFFICE IN MINNEAPOLIS. THERE WAS MAIL IN THAT POST OFFICE THAT WAS LOST. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT WERE LOST. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS IN THAT OFFICE THAT WERE LOST. IT IS A FACT THAT NOT ONLY IS THE MAIL DELIVERY DELAYED WHEN YOU HAVE ANARCHISTS LAYING SIEGE TO CITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. IT ENDANGERS POSTAL WORKERS. DELIVERY PEOPLE. IT MAY HAVE ENDANGERED PEOPLES LIVES WHO WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THEIR MEDICINE BECAUSE IT BURNED UP IN THE MINNEAPOLIS POST OFFICE. THAT'S NOT FUNNY. AND I HOPE THAT THE DEMOCRATS IN THIS COMMITTEE AND IN THIS CONGRESS WILL TAKE SERIOUSLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AMERICAN CITIES. I YIELD BACK. WE'RE STILL HAVING DIFFICULTLY CONNECTING WITH CONGRESSMAN CLAY. I NOW RECOGNIZE MR. COOPER. CONGRESSMAN COOPER. MR. DEJOY, HERE'S WHAT YOUR SO-CALLED REFORMS HAVE DONE TO MY DISTRICT IN 70 DAYS. A LADY NAMED E ELANA ROSIER PAID $5 TO SEND A CERTIFIED LETTER TO THE NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE. A DISTANCE OF 20 MILES. THE LETTER TOOK 12 DAYS TO ARRIVE. JUST THIS MORNING EXCELLENT REPORTING FROM NASHVILLE'S CHANNEL 5 TV PROVES THAT NASHVILLE'S MAIL TRUCKS ARE BEING FORCED TO LEAVE ON SCHEDULE EVEN WHEN COMPLETELY EMPTY. IMAGINE IT. 53-FOOT TRUCKS FORCED TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES COMPLETELY EMPTY DUE TO YOUR SO-CALLED REFORMS. HERE ARE THE TRUCK RECORDS. THAT'S NOT EFFICIENCY. THAT'S INSANITY. FOR ANYONE THINKING OF VOTING ABSENTEE, THE EFFECT OF YOUR POLICIES IS TO YUAN LATERALLY MOVE UP ELECTION DAY FROM NOVEMBER 3rd TO SOMETHING LIKE OCTOBER 27th. GO IF YOU FORCE MORE EMPTY TRUCKS ON THE HIGHWAY, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SINGLE HANDEDLY MOVE UP ELECTION DAY EVEN EARLIER. ACCORDING TO THE NPR ALREADY 550,000 PRIMARY BALLOTS, ABSENTEE BALLOTS WERE EJECTED IN JUST 30 STATES AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WAS LATE DELIVERLY. HOW DARE YOU DISENFRANCHISE SO MANY VOTERS WHEN YOU TOLD A SENATE COMMITTEE JUST LAST WEEK YOU HAD A SACRED DUTY TO PROTECT ELECTION MAIL. JEAN IT'S A FELONY FOR POSTAL SERVICE OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE TO DELAY DELIVERY OF MAIL. A POSTAL EMPLOYEE CAN BE FINED OR IMPRISONED UP TO FIVE YEARS FOR DELAYING THE MAIL BUT SOMEHOW YOU CAN DELAY ALL THE MAIL AND GET AWAY WITH IT? THEY CAN BE PROSECUTED BE YOU YOU CAN'T? EVEN IF YOUR ACTIONS ARE A MILLION TIMES WORSE. MR. DEJOY, DO YOU HAVE A DUTY TO OBEY U.S. LAW LIKE EVERY OTHER AMERICAN? I DO, SIR. WELL, PREVIOUS POSTMASTERS GENERAL HAVE BEEN PUNISHED FOR SMALLER CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAN YOURS. IN 1997 THE 70th MOST POSTMASTER GENERAL OF TENNESSEE HAD TO PAY $27,000 BECAUSE OF A $350,000 CONFLICT OF INTEREST. IF YOUR 30 MILLION CONFLICT OF INTEREST, 100 TIMES LARGER WERE TREATED LIKE YOUR PREDECESSORS, YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY A $2.7 MILLION FINE AND PROBABLY BE OUSTED FROM BEING POSTMASTER GENERAL. SO MR. DEJOY, ARE YOU ABOVE THE LAW THAT APPLIES TO OTHER POSTMASTERS GENERAL? IM, I DON'T AGREE WITH THE PREMISE. I'M IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS THAT I NEED TO HAVE. AND THERE'S NO IG INVESTIGATION AND I WELCOME THE RESULT OF THAT REPORT. MR. DEJOY, AS A DONOR FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN YOU WERE PICKED ALONG WITH MICHAEL COHEN AND ELLIOTT BRADY, TWO MEN WHO HAVE ALREADY PLED GUILTY TO FELONIES. DID YOU PAY BACK SEVERAL OF YOUR TOP EXECUTIVES FOR CONTRIBUTING TO TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN BY BONUSSING OR REWARDING THEM? THAT'S AN OUTRAGEOUS CLAIM, SIR AND I RESENT IT. I'M JUST ASKING A QUESTION. THE ANSWER'S NO. SO YOU DID NOT BONUS OR REWARD ANY OF YOUR EXECUTIVES OR ANYONE YOU SOLICITED FOR A CONTRIBUTION TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN? NO, SIR. NOT IN WHOLE OR IN PART? ACTUALLY DURING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN I WASN'T EVEN WORKING AT MY COMPANY ANY MORE. WELL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS ARE LEGAL SO ALL YOUR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS WERE LEGAL? I'M FULLY AWARE OF LEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. I RESENT THE ASSERTION. WHAT ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF? I'M ASKING A QUESTION. DO YOUR MAIL DELAYS FIT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN GOAL OF HURTING THE POST OFFICE AS STATED IN HIS TWEETS? I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS. I'M HERE TO REPRESENT THE POSTAL SERVICE. NOTHING TO DO WITH, ALL MY ACTIONS HAVE TO DO WITH IMPROVEMENTS OF POSTAL SERVICE. AM I THE ONLY ONE IN THIS ROOM THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT WE HAVE $10 BILLION A YEAR LOSS? AM I THE ONLY ONE IN THIS ROOM THAT THE OIG REPORT. MR. DEJOY, IS YOUR BACKUP PLAN TO BE PARDONED LIKE ROGER STONE? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HAVE TWO SECONDS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. I HAVE NO COMMENT ON THAT. MY TIME HAS EXPIRED. TIME HAS EXPIRED. REPRESENTATIVE, THE GENTLEMAN FROM FLORIDA IS RECOGNIZED FOR FIVE MINUTES. CONGRESSMAN STEUBE. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. FIRST OF ALL, SERVED IN IRAQ IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM TO COMPARE POSTAL WORKERS TO OUR MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS QUITE FRANKLY TO ME IS OFFENSIVE. LAST TIME I CHECKED POSTAL SERVICE DRIVERS WEREN'T GETTING THEIR VEHICLES BLOWN UP BY IEDs OR BEING SHOT AT AS THEY DROVE AROUND AND DELIVERED MAIL. TO TRY TO COMPARE OUR MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS WHO SACRIFICE ON THE BATTLEFIELDS TO OUR POSTAL SERVICE MEMBERS IS FRANKLY OFFENSIVE AS A PERSON THAT HAS SERVED. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THERE ARE DEMOCRATS THAT HAVE 100% POLITICIZED THE POSTAL SERVICE TO TRY TO STOKE FEAR WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED. IT'S A FAMILIAR THEME FOR DEMOCRATS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. A SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE WHEN ASKED ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND I QUOTE, ARE YOU SAYING SAY IT DIRECTLY IS THIS AN ATTEMPT BY THE PRESIDENT YOU BELIEVE TO INTERFERE IN THE ELECTION THE ANSWER WAS ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS USING THE POSTAL SERVICE TO INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTION. NONE, IN FACT, QUITE THE OPPOSITE. BUT DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FACTS. SO HERE WE GO AGAIN. SEEMS LIKE JUST YESTERDAY WE WERE HEARING HOW THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDED AND CONSPIRED WITH RUSSIA TO INTERFERE WITH THE LAST ELECTION AND WHEN THE FACTS CAME OUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT EVER OCCURRED. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A CONCOCTED NARRATIVE BY THE DEMOCRATS TO STOKE FEAR IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE JUST LIKE THE RUSSIA COLLUSION HOAX. FINANCIAL ISSUES HAVE PLAGUED THE POSTAL SERVICE FOR DECADES AND IS INST VASTLY IN NEED OF REFORM. MR. DEJOY JUST STATED A $10 BILLION LOSS A YEAR. BUSINESSES COULDN'T OPERATE THAT WAY. DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT REAL REFORM. IF THEY DID, THEY WOULD HAVE WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS IN CRAFTING A BILL. THEY WOULD HAVE WORKED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO ACTUALLY COME UP WITH REFORM THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PASS. THIS IS A POLITICAL STUNT THE NEWEST INTERFERENCE HOAX. I REPRESENT NINE COUNTIES IN FLORIDA AND JUST LAST WEEK WE HELD OUR PRIMARY ELECTIONS. FLORIDA SAW THE LARGEST TURNOUT IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR PRIMARY SINCE 1992. THAT WAS 18 YEARS. ABOUT 2.3 MILLION MAIL-IN BALLOTS WERE CAST, WHICH MADE UP ABOUT 59% OF ALL BALLOTS CAST. THERE WERE MINIMAL ISSUES WITH ADDITIONAL BALLOTS. THERE WERE NO ISSUES, IN MY NINE COUNTIES WITH ABSENTEE BALLOTS IN THIS DISTRICT THAT I'M AWARE OF. MR. DEJOY, WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED DURING THE FLORIDA PRIMARY LAST WEEK? YES, SIR. THE 2.3 MILLION MAIL-IN BALLOTS CAST IN IT FLORIDA ARE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT FOR ONE STATE. WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT LED TO THE POSTAL SERVICE BEING ABLE TO DELIVER THE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN IT MAIL-IN BALLOTS ON TIME? WHEN IT COMES TO BALLOTS THE POSTAL SERVICE, PRIOR TO MY ARRIVAL AND THE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION THROWS EVERYTHING IT HAS AT MOVING BALLOTS THROUGH THE SYSTEM. BALLOTS USUALLY IDENTIFY WITH SPECIAL MARKINGS AND EVERY EMPLOYEE IS VERY MUCH, AND MANAGER IS VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT BALLOTS MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THE PROCESS. SOMETIMES IN IT ADVANCE OF FIRST CLASS MAIL. SO THOSE PARTICULAR PROSES WERE DEPLOYED AND WILL BE DEPLOYED AS WE COME INTO THIS 2020 ELECTION. FLORIDA HAS, AM I CORRECT IN STATING FLORIDA HAS -- TIME FRAME FOR POSTAL SERVICE TO RETURN THE BALLOTS AS OPPOSED TO STATES THAT JUST ALLOW BALLOTS TO BE REQUESTED THE LAST MINUTE, THEREFORE DELAYING THEIR ABILITY FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE TO GET THOSE BALLOTS IN TIME. THANK YOU. THAT IS A BIG PART OF THE EFFORT OF THE POSTAL SERVICE. PRIOR TO MY ARRIVAL AND SINCE MY ARRIVAL AND THE PURPOSE OF SENDING OUT THE LETTERS TO ALL THE STATES WITH REGARD TO WHAT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE EVERYONE AWARE OF WHAT IS THAT WILL REALLY WORK. WE CAN PUT ALL THESE ADDITIONAL PROCESSES ON BUT IT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL IF IT WE HAD REASONABLE STANDARDS FROM THE ELECTION BOARDS THAT COMPLY WITH OUR PROCESSES TO ENABLE US TO DO IT MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. SO TO CLARIFY, DO YOU NEED ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DELIVER BALLOTS IN FLORIDA THIS NOVEMBER? NO, WE DO NOT, SIR. ARE THERE ANY LESSONS OTHER STATE CAN LEARN FROM THE WAY FLORIDA HANDLES OUR BALLOTS AND ABSENTEE VOTING? I'M NOT PARTICULARLY FAMILIAR WITH FLORIDA BUT OUR GENERAL COUNSEL HAS PUT OUT LETTERS WITH REGARD TO EACH STATE'S ELECTION GUIDELINES. WE HAVE A WEBSITE THAT'S JUST BEEN POSTED ON NORMAL PROCESS AND IN GENERAL I WILL SAY ON BEHALF OF 650,000 POSTAL WORKERS, GET YOUR BALLOT EARLY AND PLEASE VOTE EARLY AND THAT IS JUST COMMON SENSE. IF FLORIDA HAD A, YOU KNOW, FLORIDA HAD A GOOD PROCESS SO I'M SURE THEIR ELECTORAL BOARD PROCEDURES WERE GOOD. WE CAN'T DO THIS ALL BY OURSELVES. WE WOULD APPRECIATE EVERY STATE'S HELP IN REVIEWING THEIR STANDARDS AND TAKING ADVICE OF THE POSTAL SERVICE GENERAL COUNSEL AND WHAT'S ON OUR WEBSITE. THANK YOU. THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME IS EXPIRED. WE NOW RECOGNIZE MR. CLAY IF WE'RE STILL HAVING CONNECTION PROBLEMS WE WILL BE GOING TO MR. CONNOLLY. MR. CLAY. HI, MADAM CHAIR. HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW. YES, WE CAN. ALL RIGHT. LET ME, AND THANK YOU FOR CONDUCTING THIS HEARING. MR. DEJOY, LET ME START WITH A QUESTION. BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENTED YOUR CHANGES, DID YOU CONDUCT ANY ANALYSIS OF THE AFFECT YOUR CHANGES WOULD HAVE ON DELAYING PRESCRIPTION DRUG SHIPMENTS? THE DELIVERY OF THOSE SHIPMENTS TO YOUR CUSTOMERS? DID YOU ANALYZE THAT BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENTED THESE CHANGES? SIR, WE HAVE A WHOLE OPERATING ORGANIZATION THAT I ASKED TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN AND IT WASN'T A CHANGE, IT WAS COMPLY WITH YOUR SCHEDULES AND WHEN WE COULD COMPLY WITH OUR SCHEDULES. REREVIEWED THIS WITH EVERY REGIONAL AREA VP ON A DISCUSSION THAT THEY WERE READY AND THEY ROLLED IT OUT. I'M NOT THE COO. I'M THE CEO OF THE ORGANIZATION BUT I RECEIVED COMMITMENT THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ROLL FORWARD WITH THE PLAN TO COMMITTING TO OUR EXISTING SCHEDULE. OKAY, MR. DEJOY. LET ME SAY THIS. PRIORITIZING ON TIME TRUCK DEPARTURES MEANS LETTER CARRIERS LEAVE WITHOUT ALL OF THEIR PACKAGES. INCLUDING MEDICINE ON BOARD. CRITICAL MEDICINES LIKE REFRIGERATED INSULIN IS REPORTEDLY SITTING IN SORTING FACILITIES DAYS LONGER THAN EXPECTED. DID YOU EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF YOUR CHANGES ON MEDICINES LIKE INSULIN THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL STORAGE? SIR, AT NO TIME DID I SAY DON'T PUT THE MAIL ON THE TRUCKS WHEN THEY LEFT ON TIME. THIS WAS NOT A HARD DIRECT EVERYTHING MUST LEAVE ON TIME. WE STILL HAVE THOUSANDS OF TRUCKS A DAY THAT LEAVE LATE WITHIN, WITHIN, YOU KNOW, A CERTAIN TIME FRAME. SO THE WHOLE, AND THERE ARE STILL HUNDREDS OF EXTRA TRIPS. THE INTENTION WAS TO PUT THE MAIL ON THE TRUCKS AND HAVE THE TRUCKS LEAVE ON TIME. THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE IMPACTED ANYBODY. WHAT ABOUT THE IMPACT, MR. DEJOY, WHAT ABOUT THE IMPACT OF LETTING, OF HAVING IT SIT ON THE FLOOR SOMEWHERE AND IT MAY SPOIL OR WHATEVER. AT LEAST WE KNOW IT WILL BE DELAYED. DID YOU ALL GIVE THAT ANY CONSIDERATION? WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE'RE WORKING EXTREMELY HARD TO BRING THE SERVICE LEVELS BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE AND TO EXCEED THAT. WE WILL BE THERE SHORTLY. MR. DEJOY, WE WOULD LIKE A COPY OF ANY AND ALL ANALYSIS YOU CONDUCTED BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENTED YOUR CHANGES. WILL YOU PROVIDE THEM TO THIS COMMITTEE? I WILL GO BACK TO THE OFFICE AND SEE WHAT THE OPERATING TEAM HAS ON THAT AND WE'LL SEEK TO DO SO. AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, MR. DEJOY, DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG SHIPMENTS THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS DELIVERED LATE SINCE YOU BEGAN IMPLEMENTING THESE CHANGES AND WILL YOU PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE BY THE END OF THE WEEK? CAN YOU. I'M NOT AWARE OF WHAT WE HAVE ON SPECIFIC TYPES OF SHIPMENT. I'M SURE WE HAVE SOME. I WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AGAIN, I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THE CHANGES IS MISLEADING AND WHAT I ASK IS THAT THE TEAM FIND A WAY TO RUN THE TRUCKS ON THE SCHEDULE. THE INTENTION WAS WE PUT THE MAIL ON THE TRUCKS WHEN WE RAN THEM ON SCHEDULE.  MADAM CHAIRWOMAN, COULD I JUST ASK YOU. MR. LYNCH ASKED ME TO ENTER INTO THE RECORD SET OF DATA FROM THE AMERICAN POSTAL WORKERS UNION WITH RESPECT TO MAIL VOLUME AND THE REDUCTION IN ADVANCE, DELIVERY BAR CODE SORTERS, AUTOMATED FLAT SORTING MACHINE, HUNDREDS AND FLAT SEQUENCING SYSTEMS IN ITS MAIL PROCESSING FACILITIES. WITHOUT OBJECTION. I THANK THE CHAIR. MR. NORMAN FROM SOUTH CAROLINA IS NOW RECOGNIZED. MR. NORMAN. THANK YOU. MR. DEJOY, I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU. YOU'RE GETTING A BERATING UP HERE. CONGRESSMAN LYNCH GOING INTO A FIVE MINUTE DIALOGUE WOULD NOT GIVE YOU DIME TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. WAS YELLING OVER YOU. IT'S TYPICAL HOW THIS HEARING HAS GONE AND WHAT'S AMAZING TO ME IS THIS BILL HAD TO BE RUSHED OUT THIS PAST SATURDAY. DO YOU KNOW THAT 67 MEMBERS DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE TIME TO SHOW UP? IF YOUR WORKERS DON'T SHOW UP, WHAT HAPPENS? THEY DON'T GET A PAYCHECK AND THE MAIL DOESN'T GET DELIVERY. IT'S AN INSULT TO WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DO. A FALSE NARRATIVE THAT HAS NOT WORKED FOR THEM SINCE THIS PRESIDENT WAS ELECTED. THE MUELLER REPORT. THE IMPEACHMENT. NONE OF IT'S WORKING. NOW THEY'RE GOING FISHING FOR THIS. I APOLOGIZE TO YOU. LET ME GET SOME YES OR NO ANSWERS. ARE YOU AND THE POSTAL SERVICE ACTIVELY REMOVING MAILBOXES AT THE BEHEST OF PRESIDENT TRUMP TO UNDERMINE THE ELECTION OR HAS PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID KNEECAP THE POSTAL SERVICE? NO, SIR. WAS IT U.S. POSAL SERVICE GOING TO BE INSOL GENT BEFORE THE ELECTION IF YOU DID NOT RECEIVE THE $25 BILLION THAT DEMOCRATS INZITSED IN IT INCLUDING IN THEIR BILL? NO, SIR. IS THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE EQUIPPED TO HANDLE VOTING BY MAIL FOR THE NOVEMBER ELECTION? YES, SIR. ARE YOU UNLOCKING BLUE BOXES TO STOP THE MAIL? ANYTHING WITH BLUE BOXES HAS STOPPED. NO, SIR. CONGRESSMAN PALMER SHOWED PICTURES OF THE BURNED OUT MAILBOXES. AND THE CITIES ON FIRE. PORTLAND, CHICAGO, MINNEAPOLIS, SACRAMENTO, NEW YORK, WOULD THAT KIND OF SLOW THE POST OFFICE DELIVERY DOWN? THERE ARE CERTAIN ACTIONS AND PROCEDURES THAT WE HAVE FOR SITUATIONS FOR PUBLIC UNREST THAT WE DEPLOY. A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS UP TO AND INCLUDING GETTING OUR COLLECTION BOXES OUT OF THERE WHEN IT HAPPENS. BUT I DON'T KNOW ALL OF EVERYTHING THAT GOES WITH THAT. BUT YES, IT WOULD SLOW DOWN THE MAIL. IT'D SLOW IT DOWN AND THE SAFETY OF THE DELIVERING THE PERSON DELIVERING THE MAIL IS PRETTY MUCH AN ISSUE NOW. I'M SORRY? THE, THE PERSON DELIVERING MAIL AND THE BURNED OUT CITIES WOULD KIND OF BE A PROBLEM, WOULDN'T IT? ABSOLUTELY. OUR LETTER CARRIERS HAVE HAZARDOUS JOBS IN MANY CASES. WERE YOU CONSULTED ON THIS ALL IMPORTANT BILL WE HAD TO TAKE UP THIS PAST SATURDAY?  I THINK OUR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS PEOPLE HAD SOME INTERACTION TO COMMENT ON IT. YOU MADE A GOOD STATEMENT. YOU'RE NOT THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICE. YOU'RE THE CEO. YOU'VE BEEN ON THE JOB 70 DAYS. TO BE ACCUSED OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF IS SIMPLY NOT RIGHT. IT'S UNFAIR. I'M GLAD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GETTING A FRONT ROW SEAT TO WHAT YOU'RE HAVING TO ENDURE. I YIELD BACK. GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. MR. CONNOLLY IS NOW RECOGNIZED. MY, MY, MY, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'VE BEEN ON THE JOB 70 DAYS AND YOU'VE CAUSED THIS MUCH RUCKUS. AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THAT'S CALLED ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT'S WHY HE'S HERE TODAY. THAT'S WHY WE PASSED THE BILL. IF HE WASN'T CONSULTED IT'S BECAUSE HE WAS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BILL. DUBIOUS DISTINCTION NONETHELESS. MR. DEJOY, WHEN DID YOU TAKE OFFICE? YOU WERE IN OFFICE IN MAY BUT WHEN DID YOU ACTUALLY TAKE OVER THE JOB AS POSTMASTER GENERAL? WHAT DAY? JUNE 15th. JUNE 15th. AND YOU'VE SEEN THIS DATA. ON OR AROUND THIS TIME IS WHEN WE SEE A ROUGHLY 8% DECLINE IN IT SERVICE IN THE POSTAL SERVICE, WHICH MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY CORRELATES TO THE REORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES YOU UNDERTOOK. DO YOU THINK THAT'S A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION? I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES GOING ON WITHIN THE COUNTRY THAT IMPACT MAIL DELAY, INCLUDING THE ACTIONS THAT WE TOOK WITH REGARD TO TRANSPORTATION. I THINK THE ORGANIZATION, THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE WAS MADE BECAUSE OF THE POOR, WAS ACCELERATED BECAUSE OF THE POOR ROLLOUT. I UNDERSTAND. I THINK THAT. WE ALL LIVE IN A CONTEXT, DON'T WE, MR. DEJOY? YOU'RE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WORST PANDEMIC IN 100 YEARS. % IN 100 YEARS. , WORST PANDEMIC IN 100 YEARS. 50,000 POSTAL EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE GOTTEN THE VIRUS OR QUARANTINED BECAUSE OF IT AND SADLY A FEW DOZEN DEAD. AND WERE ON THE EVE OF A MASSIVE SHIFT TO VOTING BY MAIL. 76% OF ALL AMERICANS LIVE IN A STATE THAT CAN VOTE BY MAIL. 60 TO 70% INTEND TO VOTE BY MAIL AND ALONG COMES THIS. LET'S STIPULATE THAT YOUR MOTIVES WERE PURENG ANDES. YOU CAME AT THIS LIKE A NORMAL PRIVATE SECTOR CEO. YOU SEE SOME PROBLEMS AND YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY AND MAKE US WORK BETTER. WOULDN'T YOU THINK YOU MIGHT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONTEXT? IF YOU DIDN'T, AS A GOOD CEO, WHEN YOU SAW UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES, YOU WOULD TAKE MEASURES QUICKLY TO AMELIORATE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES, NAMELY SCARINGTE THE PUBLIC HALF TO DEATH ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THE POST OFFICE, LOTS OF DATA THAT IT AFFECTED THE DELIVERY OF MAIL. AS THE NEW POST MASTER GENERAL, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN AS THE GUY WHO DAMAGED THE REPUTATION OF THE POSTAL SERVICE AND GEARED VOTERS INTO BELIEVING THAT THEIR BALLOTS WILL NOT GET IN ON TIME BECAUSE OF YOUR SERVICE, DO YOU?  I I UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT AND WHEN WE LOOK IN TERMS OF THE CONTEXT, IT WAS THE SUMMER. MAIL VOLUME WAS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WAS NOT GETTING READY FOR THE PEAK SEASON. THE ELECTION IS THREE MONTHS AWAY. IT WAS A GOOD TIME TO START TO TRY AND ROLL THIS OUT. AGAIN, THE REQUEST WAS RUN YOUR TRUCKS ON TIME AND PUT A PLANNER ON YOUR TRUCKS ON TIME. THE IMPACT, LET ME JUST SAY THE IMPACT IS PROBABLY ABOUT -- FOR THAT, BECAUSE IF THE MAIL GETS PROCESSED AND A TRUCK LEAVES, THAT MAIL WILL MOVE ON THE NEXTT TRUCK OR THE NEXT DAY. SO LONG STORIES OF NINE DAYS AND SO FORTH, WERE NOT IMPACTED. THOSE SERVICE LEVELS, IF WE ADD ONE DAY.  FORGIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING BUT WE HAVE LIMITED TIME. YOU SAID TO SENATOR GARRETT KETOERS, YOU HAVE NO CONTACT WITH HIS TENURE, IS THAT CORRECT?  I HAVE HAD NO CONTACT WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE PRESIDENT. I HAVE SPOKEN TO STEVE MNUCHIN. I HAVE SPOKEN TO OTHER PEOPLE BUT I HAVE NOT -- I HAVE HAD NO CONTACT ABOUT THE POSTAL SERVICE.  DID YOU NOTOT TELL THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS THIS MONTH IN AUGUST THAT IN FACT YOU HAD HAD CONTACT WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO STOP THEIR ATTACKS ON THE POSTAL SERVICE FOR VOTING BY MAIL?  I HAVE PUT WORDS AROUND TO DISTANCE PEOPLE THAT THIS IS NOT HELPFUL.  YOU DID HAVE CONTACT WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN?  FOR A GOOD PURPOSE.  BUT YOU --.  WHEN YOU SAY THEN TRUMP CAMPAIGN -- I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN LEADERSHIP IN THAT REGARD. I HAVE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE THAT ARE FRIENDS OF MINE WHO ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAMPAIGN.  ONE OFTH WHICH WAS STEVE MNUCHIN HE IS SECRETARY OFOF TREASURE.  I KNOW.  I NEVER SPOKE TO STEVE ABOUTVE TELLING THE PRESIDENT NOT TO DO SOMETHING.  THANK YOU MR. DEJOY.  THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIREDLE BUT YOU MAY ANSWER THE QUESTION.  WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?  THE QUESTION WAS WHAT CONVERSATIONS DID YOU HAVE WITH SECRETARYY TREASURY STEVE MNUCHIN ABOUTEA T THE CONSEQUENCES ABOUT THE OPERATIONAL INEFFICIENCIES?  THE CONVERSATIONS WERE WHEN II CAME HERE, WET% HAD THIS NOTE THAT WAS KIND OF STUCK IN THE MUD AND I WORKED WITH HIM TO GET THE NOTE DONE. IT WAS REALLY, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND CONTROL COSTS AND GROW REVENUE AND IT WAS VERY HIGH LEVEL THING AND LET'S TRY AND GET THE DEAL DONE SO WE HAVE THE LOAN. THAT WAS IT.  THANK YOU. MR. JORDAN IS NOW RECOGNIZED.  THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. MR. DEJOY, WAS IT THE POSTAL SERVICE FAULT THAT IT TOOK SIX WEEKS AFTER THE JUNE 23rd CHAIR WOMAN MALONEY'S ELECTION TO BE DELAIRED THE WINNER, IS THAT YOUR FAULT?  I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS BUT I KNOW IT TOOK A LONG TIME.  BUT THAT WASN'T YOUR FAULT WAS IT?  NO.  WAS IT THE PUBLIC POSTAL SERVICE FAULT THAT NEW JERSEY WASTH STILL COUNTING PRIMARY BALLOTS LAST MONTH?  NO, SIR.  HOW ABOUT THE DEMOCRAT IOWA CAUCUS? WAS THAT THE POST OFFICE'S FAULT THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO WON THE DEMOCRATIC IOWA CAUCUS?  NO, SIR.  SO JUST A COUPLEUC OF FACTS I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR. YOU GOT $14 BILLION CASH ON HAND A $10 BILL KRN LINE OF CREDIT IS THAT RIGHT?  YES, SIR.  IN CHANGING OUT THE SORTING MACHINES AND REMOVING AND CHANGING OUT MAIL COLLECTION BOXES IS NOTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAS APPEND BEFORE, RIGHT? EVERY POST MASTER GENERAL WE% DO THOSE SORT OF THINGS, RIGHT?  YES, SIR.  IT'S NO DIFFERENT. BETWEEN 2011 AND 2016, I THINK 12,000 MAIL COLLECTION BOXES WERE REMOVED, CHANGED OUT BY THE O BUMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, ISN THAT RIGHT?  IT WAS A LOT.  YEAH, IT WAS A LOT. AND YOU DIDN'T ORDER A REDUCTION IN HOURS?  I DID NOT.  SOO WHY ARE THESE GUYS OUT TO GET YOU? WHAT IS IT?  I DON'T -- THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CONCERNS. I ASSUME THEY ARE LEGITIMATE.  YOU ASSUME THEY ARE LEGITIMATE. WHY ARE THEY OUT TO GET YOU? THEY HAD PEOPLE PROTESTING AT YOUR HOUSE LAST NIGHT. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR WEEKS. 90 SOME PEOPLE CALLING FOR YOU TO RESIGN. THEY PASSED A BILL BEFORE THEY EVEN TALKED TO YOU, BEFORE THEY HAD A HEARING. THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT THE CHAIR WOMAN WOULD NOT CONTACT THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF WHO HAD A BILL HE WORKED WITH THE PREVIOUS CHAIRMAN, A BIPARTISAN BILL TOS ADDRESS CONCERNS AT THE POST OFFICE. WHY ARE THEY AFTER YOU?  I DON'T KNOW.  YOU WERE APPOINTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS,D RIGHT?  YES, UNINANIMOUS, BIPARTISAN BOARD OF GOVERNORS.  UNANIMOUS, BIPARTISAN BOARD. DEMOCRATS THOUGHT YOU WERE THE RIGHT GUYAN FOROR TE JOB, RIGHT? .  YES, SIR WHY ARE THEY OUT TO GET YOU?  I HAVE NO IDEA. I DO HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT AMONGST THEGS EMPLOYEES AND PEOPLE IN AMERICA. I RECEIVE IT EVERY DAY.  GOT AN AMAZING RECORD IN BUSINESS. GOT ANRE AMAZING HISTORY OF COMMUNITY SERVICE. YOU HELP KIDS WITH THEIRE. EDUCATION, SERVE YOUR COMMUNITY, SERVE OUR COUNTRY AND THESEVE PEOPLE ARE OUT TO GET YOU. NONE OF THE FACTS -- AS THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SAID THIS IS ONE GIANT CONSPIRACY FROM THE DEMOCRATS. WHAT COULD BE THEIR REASON? WHAT COULD IT BE, MR. DEJOY? WE KNOW IT IS NOT BASED ON THE FACTS. WHAT COULD IT BE? MIGHT IT BE POLITICS? BE?T IT MIGHT IT BE THE ELECTION COMING UP? MIGHT IT BEON THE FACT THAT THEY ACTUALLY WANTT TO WAIT AND COUNT VOTES AFTER ELECTION DAY? MAYBE THEY WANT SIX WEEKS AFTER THE ELECTION MAYBE THEY WANT TO COUNTT VOTES SIX WEEKS AFTER ELECTION, THE BIGGEST ELECTION WE WILLAF HAVE, MAYBE THEY WANT TO BE COUNTING VOTES SIX WEEKS AFTER LIKE THEY DID IN THE CHAIR WOMAN'S RACE OR WEEKS AFTER THEY DID IN NEW JERSEY. OR MAYBE THEY WANT TORS WAIT FOREVER LIKE WITH THE DEMOCRATIC IOWA CAUCUSS S. MAYBE THE CONFUSION OF THOSENF ELECTIONS, MAYBEON THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. COULD THAT BE THE REASON, MR. DEJOY?  I DON'T KNOW WHAT MOTIVES PEOPLE TO HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS OF ME.  THEY HAVEER CALLED YOU ALL KINDS OF NAMES TODAY ALREADY. PROTESTING OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOUSE. THEY WERE THEIR LAST NIGHT?  YES, SIR.  DISRUPTING YOU AND YOURRU NEIGHBORS.  YES.  WHEN THE FACTS AS YOUNE TESTIFIED ARE NOT ANYTHING CLOSE TO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS, WHAT THEY SAID SATURDAY ON THE HOUSE FLOOR. WE KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. WE ALL KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. THIS IS ABOUT THESE GUYS WANTING CHAOS AND CONFUSION. I THINK THEY KNOW ON ELECTION NIGHT PRESIDENT%NONO TRUMP IS GOING TO WEN. THEY KNOW ON ELECTION DAY, THE VOTE COUNT ON ELECTION DAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING, TO WIN AND THEY WANT TO KEEP COUNTING SIX WEEKS, FOUR WEEKS, IOWA CAUCUS, WHATEVER. I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY DECIDED THAT OR IF THEY STILL HAVE. BERNIEST BIDEN, WHOEVER WAS RUNNING THEN. THAT'S WHAT'S THEY WANT. THEY ARE WILLING TO GOTH AFTER A GUY LIKE YOU WHO SERVED HIS COMMUNITY, HELPED KIDS WITH WITH EDUCATION, THEY ARE WILLING TO GO AFTER YOU. YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE JOB 70 DAYS AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TESTIFIED, NOTHING NEW, SAME THING DONE BY OTHER POST MASTER GENERALS. YET THEY ARE COMING AFTER YOU BECAUSE THAT ISR HOW MUCH THEY WANT TO GET THIS PRESIDENT. IT'S DISGUSTING. WE ALL KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. YOU KNOW TOO BUT YOU WON'T SAY IT. I THINK THAT SHOWS YOUR CHARACTER. I'LL SAY IT BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH. I YIELD BACK.  THE GENTLEMAN CONGRESSMAN CURSEA WARSY, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.  GOODD MORNING.  GOOD MORNING.  BEFORE BECOMING POST MASTER.OR GENERAL, I BELIEVE YOU APPROPRIATELY RESIGNED FROMAT BEING THE FINANCE CHAIR FOR THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION?  I DID.  I SAY YOU APPROPRIATELY RESIGNED BECAUSE IN YOUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY YOU SAID WE SHOULD KEEP THE NONPARTISAN POSITION OF THE USPS AND IN THIS CASE OCCUPYING A HIGH LEVEL POLITICAL POST AT THE SAME TIME YOU WOULD OCCUPY A HIGH LEVEL USPS POST WOULD CREATE AT LEAST APPEARANCE PROBLEMS IF NOT MORE, RIGHT?  YES, I ALSO THINK I COULDN'T HOLD BOTH POSITIONS.  YES, SIR. MR. DUNCAN, ARE YOU ON THE LINE , SIR? MR. DUNCAN?  YES, , CONGRESSMAN.  AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD,N. YOU ARE ONE OF THE HIGHEST RANKING OFFICIALS AT THE USPS, CORRECT?  AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, I AM A MEMBER OF THE PART-TIME BOARD THAT IS SENATE CONFIRMED BUT YOU ARE THE HIGHEST RANKING OFFICIAL AT THE USPS. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THATCI% YOU ARE ALSO ON THE BOARD OF TWO REPUBLICAN SUPERPACKS, NAMELY THE SENATEPU LEADERSHIP FUND AND AMERICAN CROSS ROADS, CORRECT?  YES, SIR. RO I JUST WENT TO THE USPS WEBSITE. I LOOKED AT YOUR BIO. I WOULD BEOK REMISS IF I DIDN'T POINT OUT THAT ON YOUR OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT BIO ON THE USPS WEBSITE, YOU SAID AS RNC CHAIRMAN, HE, NAMELY YOU, RAISED ON UNPRECEDENTED $428 MILLION AND GREW THE DONOR BASE TO $1 MILLION A RECORD AT THE TIME. THIS IS ON YOUR OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT U.S. BIO. MR. DUNCAN, I HAVEVE A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS Q FOR YOU. IN YOUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY, YOU MENTIONED THAT AN OUTSIDE RESEARCH FIRM CALLED RUSTLE REYNOLDS ASSOCIATES WAS CONTRACTED TO FIND THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB OF POST MASTER GENERAL, CORRECT?  CORRECT. CO YOU FURTHER NOTED IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT RUSSELL REYNOLDS REVIEWED 212 CANDIDATES AND THEN THEY NARROWED THE SEARCH TO 53 AFTER THEY REVIEWED THOSE PEOPLE'S BIOES AND BACKGROUNDS AND VETTED THEM, CORRECT?  YES, SIR.  INTERESTINGLY, ACCORDING TO DAVID WILLIAMS, THE FORMER VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND FORMER INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR 13 YEARS AT THE USPS AS WELL AS A PUBLISHED REPORT OVER THE WEEKEND, MR.R. DEJOY WAS NOT AMONG THE 53 PRESENTED TO THE BOARD. RUSTLE REYNOLDS CONSIDERED HIM AND DECIDED THERE WERE OTHER CANDIDATES BETTERR THAN HIM OR HE WAS NOT CONSIDERED AT ALL BEFORE PRESENTING THE 53 FINALISTS. WHICH WAS IT?  WE WEREST STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE POOL BEFORE WE HAD OUR FIRST ROUND INTERVIEWS AT THAT POINT. I UNDERSTAND. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST ROUND OF INTERVIEWS. ROUND OF 14. YOU DON'T DISPUTE IN YOUR ANSWER THAT MR. DEJOY DID NOT MAKE THE INITIAL CUT OF 53 FINALISTS PRESENTED TO THE BOARD BUT.  WE ARE IN THE PROGRESS OF THE CONVENTION, THE ROLL CALL IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DID. THEY DID IT ON THE FIRST NIGHT OFST THE CONVENTION AND DID IT VIRTUALLY BUT YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A DELEGATE FROM EACH STATE NOW THAT IS MAKING A PERSONAL VOTE, OFFERING DELEGATES TO THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINATION. MOST OF THE SPEECHES WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE MELON AUDITORIUM IN WASHINGTON D.C. THAT BEGINS TONIGHT. OUR CORRESPONDENT PETER ALEXANDER IS THERE%ES TO SET THE SCENE FOR US.  Reporter: GOOD DAY TO YOU. WE ARE TOLD THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL MAKE AN APPEARANCE IN EACH OF THE FOUR NIGHTS CULMINATING WITH HIS ACCEPTANCE ADDRESS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN, AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE BY A SITTING PRESIDENT. HE WILL APPEAR ALONG SIDE SOME OF THE FRONT LINE WORKERS WHO HE WILL THANK FOR THEIR SACRIFICE AND COMMITMENT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. WE SUGGESTS THE PRESIDENT WILL FOCUS ON A POSITIVE AND UPLIFTING MESSAGE WHICH IS A CHALLENGE GIVEN THAT 175,000 AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES DUE TO THE CORONAVIRUS. UNEMPLOYMENT INS. THIS COUNTRY STILL STANDS ABOVE 10% NOW. TIMAB SCOTT, THE ONLY BLACK REPUBLICAN IN THE SENATE IS EXPECTED TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE. THE COUPLE THAT WERE SEEN BRANDISHING WEAPONS OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOUSE AS PROTESTERS WALKED BY WILL BE SPEAKING. THE TRUMP FAMILY WILL BE FEATURED PROMINENTLY WITH AT LEAST ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY APPEARING EACH NIGHT. LESTER?  ALLLL RIGHT,IG PETER ALEXANDER, THANK YOU.

WERE YOU NOMINATED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR SELECTED BY A UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN BOARD? % I WAS SELECTED BY A UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN BOARD.  THANK YOU. A MINUTE AGO, MY COLLEAGUE MR., CONLEY MENTIONED YOU HAVE DONE 70 DAYS OF DAMAGE. YET MR.S CONLEY IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN HAS BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR 11 YEARS. GIVEN THAT THE COMMITTEE HELD A HEARING IN APRIL 2019 ABOUT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE USPS, WHY DOIO YOU THINK WE ARE HAVING A HEARING TODAY, 48 HOURS AFTER WE VOTED ON LEGISLATION BEFORE WE HAD A HEARING, WHY DO YOU THINKGI WE ARE HAVING A HEARING TODAY?  I DO NOT KNOW, SIR. BUT I WILL SAY THAT I'M SURPRISED THAT THE LACK OF ATTENTION TO THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE POSTAL SERVICE OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS.  SO YOU'RE SAYING THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE POSTAL SERVICENG IS NOTHING NEW? THIS IS SOMETHING THAT% WE HAVE KNOWN HAS BEEN COMING FOR A LONG TIME AND THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS LOST MONEY FOR AT LEAST 13 CONSECUTIVE YEARS?  I THINK 10 YEARS.  OKAY. MR. DEJOY, DOES THE UNITEDMR STATES POSTAL SERVICE DELIVER 8 BILLION PIECES OF MAIL A MONTH, GIVE OR TAKE?  YES, SIR.  AND DOES IT HAVE ABOUT $14 BILLION CASH ON HAND TO MANAGE THE AMERICAN POSTAL SERVICE FOR RIGHT NOW, IS THAT RIGHT?  YES, SIR.  IF EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN VOTED BY MAIL, WHICH WON'T HAPPEN, IT WOULD BE LESS THAN ABOUT 2% OF THE TOTAL MAIL DELIVERED IN A GIVEN MONTH, RIGHT? IN OTHER WORDS IS THE POSTAL SERVICE CAPABLE OF HANDLING ANY AMOUNT OF MAIL ATTACHED TO THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER?  WE ARE READY TO HANDLE THE ELECTION NOW, SIR.  MR. DEJOY, DO YOU BELIEVE THIS HEARING TO DATEIS SO FAR THIS MORNING OR AT ANY POINT TODAY WILL COVER ANY OF THE FOLLOWING? THE PPP EXTENSION TO ENSURE SMALL BUSINESSES CAN SURVIVE WHILE GOVERNMENTS ARE KEEPING BUSINESSES SHUT DOWN, THE THOUSANDS OF RESTAURANTS, THE THOUSANDS OF HOTELS, THE THOUS NDZ OF BARBER SHOPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE? IS ANYTHING IN THIS HEARING GOING TO DISCUSS XAE OF THAT TO THE BEST OF URKNOWLEDGE?  NO, SIR.  ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS PULLING UP ANY LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES THIS MONTH RATHER THAN GOING HOME BUT CALLING BACK CONGRESS TO HAVE A VOTE ON SATURDAY? ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT?  I HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING THE AGENDA OF CONGRESS THAT MUCH. I HAVEHA HAD MY OWN ISSUES TO DEAL WITH.  WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT. THERE HASN'T BEEN THAT MUCH TO FOLLOW, SO I APPRECIATE THAT. ARE WE DISCUSSING FOR EXAMPLE HUMAN TRAFFICKING? I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A HEARING ON SCOURGE ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR YEARS. WE ARE NOT HAVING A HEARING ON THAT TODAY. WE ARE HAVING A HEARING ON THIS TOPIC IS THAT RIGHT?  I THINKNK WE ARE STICKING TO POSTAL SERVICE MATTERS.  THAT'S RIGHT. MR. DEJOY, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE. I THINK THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS CLEAR. THIS IS A POLITICAL EXERCISE. THIS IS A SHOW. IT IS SEENPO. ON SOCIAL MEDIA, SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES, THE TECHNOLOGY, THE FACT OF%% THE MATTER IS WE ARE JAMMING THROUGH THIS FOR THEATER. WE ARERE DOING A HEARING ON A MONDAY AFTER A VOTE ON SATURDAY THAT HAS NO PRAYER OF BECOMING LAW. THA AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THIS. THEY WANT OF THE POSTAL SERVICE TO OPERATE. WE SHOULD HAVE HEARINGS ON THE POSTAL SERVICE AND WORK LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE IT. THERE AREATOV BIPARTISAN EFFORTS TO DO THAT. WE SHOULD ROLL OUR SLEEVES UP AND DO THAT WORK. I WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE PPP. I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH THESE FELLOWS IN JUNE TO PASS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION IN JUNE. WHY ARE WESL NOT DOING THAT NOW? WHY AREE WE NOT DOING THAT TODAY? THAT ISDO OUR JOB. PEOPLERE OUT THERE WHO ARE STRUGGLING. THEY CAN'T MAKE A CHECK, PAY MORTGAGES, WONDERING WHETHER THEY WILL HAVE THE REVENUE TO SURVIVE. THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BEOU WORKING ON MADAM CHAIR WOMAN. I WOULD POSIT THAT THIS IS A RACE FOR TIME FOR THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND THE AMERICANIT PEOPLE ARE SICK OF IT. WE SHOULD ALLOW THE POSTAL SERVICE TO GO BACK TO DOING THEIR JOB AND WE SHOULD BE DOINGOI OURS. WITH THAT, I FIELD BACK.  I THANK THE GENTLEMAN FOR YIELDING AND HIS COMMENTS. THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS DID PASS THE HEROES ACT ON MAY 15thS THAT FUNDED ALL KINDS OF HELP TO PEOPLE AND THAT IS SITTING ON MITCH McCONNELL'S DESK AS WELL AS THIS BILL. THEY HAVE A CHOICE. THEY CANEY STAND ALONE OR MOVE THE HEROES ACT.  MADAM CHAIR WOMAN.  SENATOR GRASSMAN YOU ARE NOW RECOGNIZED.  MADAM CHAIR WOMAN?  I HAVE DIABETIC CONSIT WNTS WAITING FOR INSULIN AND I HAVE CANCER PATIENTS WAITING FOR CHEMOTREATMENTHAIE BUT THIS REALLY GOT TO ME. RATS FEEDING ON ROTTED FOOD AS CUTBACKS AT CALIFORNIA'S MAIL CENTERS. THIS IS FROM BUSINESS INSIDER MAGAZINE. MR. POST ID MASTER GENERAL, WHY DO YOU CELEBRATE ON TIME DEPARTURE OF VEHICLES IF THE IT TEARIATION YOU REGRET HAS LEFTFT PACKAGES STACKING UP IN THE MAIL CENTER? SHOULD WE BE CELEBRATING VEHICLES GOING OUT ONE TIME IF THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE'S PACKAGES AND LETTERS ON THEM AND THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS?  SIR, WE ARE CONCERNED WITH EVERY LATE DELIVERY AND EVERY PACKAGE BUILD UP. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONTRIBUTING FACTORS AS TO WHY AND WHERE.  WE GO THROUGH --.  LETHR ME FINISH. WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. IT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OFS. DELIVERING THE MAIL AND IT IS A COST EFFECTIVE WAY. THE ALTERNATIVEY. IS TO RUN TRUCKS LATE AND RUN EXTRA TRIPS. EXTRA TRIPS WERE EMPTY ALSO. THOUSANDS OF THEM EMPTY.  I CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO FILIBUSTER HERE. PRESIDENT TRUMPE. CALLED THE POST OFFICE A JOKE, IS IT A JOKE?  POSTAL SERVICE IS NOT A JOKE.  MR. DEJOY, IF I WANT TO BECOME A LETTER CARRIER, MAIL HANDLER, POSTAL CLERK, WOULD YOU HIRE ME WITHOUT A BACKGROUND CHECK?  WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT I DO BELIEVE INCLUDES A BACKGROUND CHECK SO NO.  IT IS COMPELLED, RIGHT? EVERYONE HAS TO TAKE ONE EXCEPT? THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONE FOR YOU.  THAT'S NOT TRUE. I HAD BACKGROUND CHECKS. I HAD SECRET CLEARANCE, FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS, EVERYTHING.  OKAY. SO YOU WOULDBAKS BE WILLING TO RELEASE THE BACKGROUND CHECKS?  NO, WHY WOULD I RELEASE THE BACKGROUND CHECKS?  WELL,L, THAT'S INTERESTING. LET ME GO TO MR. DUNCAN. MR. DUNCAN, WOULD YOU ALLOW RUSSELL REYNOLDS TO., TURN OVER THE FILE FROM THIS PROCESS? MR. DUNCAN? OKAY. LET MEROMR COME BACK TO YOU MR. DEJOY. THE FORMER VICE CHAIRMANJO OF THE POSTAL BOARD OF VICE GOVERNORS, MR. WILLIAMS, WHO WAS ALSO THE INSPECTIVE GENERAL ALSO REPORTED THAT YOU DIDN'T COME THROUGH THE NORMAL RUSSELL REYNOLDS INTERVIEW PROCESS BUT YOU WERE GENERALLY THE PRODUCT OF DIFFERENTTH NOMINATIONS BY DIFFERENT POLITICAL PEOPLE. THE ASTONNISHING THING ABOUTNA% WHAT WE SAID LAST WEEK WAS WHENE YOU WERET FINALLY BROUGHT IN FOR THE FIRST INTERVIEW, YOU BASICALLY INTERVIEWED THE SELECTION PANEL RATHER THAN THEM INTERVIEWING YOU TO THE POIBT THAT ONE OF THE PANEL SAID THAT THEY BETTER ASK YOU A QUESTION SO IT COULDN'T BE SAID IT WASN'T A REAL INTERVIEW. YOU WEREA ALSO REPORTED SAYING THAT YOU WEREN'T SURE WHETHER YOU WANTED TOO ACCEPT THE JOB AND YOU NEEDED TO INTERVIEW THEM TO GET DETAILS. WHAT GAVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE THAT THE JOB WAS YOURS BEFORE MEETING WITH THE COMMITTEE?  I DID NOT HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THE JOB WAS MINE FOR THE ASKING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MR. WILLIAMS CONTENTION IS WITH ME.  HE WAS THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR 13 YEARS AT THE POSTAL SERVICE.  HE'S OFTEN PARTIC OF THE REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN STACKING UP THAT THIS COMMITTEE HASN'T DONE. IT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FORMER CHAIR FINEMAN CALLING SECRETARY MNUCHIN'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE ELECTION PROCESS UNPRECEDENTED?  STEVEN MNUCHIN HAD NOTHINGCT TO DO WITH MY SELECTION, OKAY? WAS CALLED BY RUS REL REYNOLDS?  DID YOU TALK TO SECRETARY MNUCHIN ABOUT TAKING THE JOB? THERE WERERE REPORTS THAT YOU HAD LUNCH TO TALK ABOUT IT.  IT IS TOTALLY INACCURATE AND OUTRAGEOUS. TE BEFORE THE JOB YOU NFSH TALKED TO HIM?  I TALKED TO HIM AFTER I TOOK THE JOB.  YOU NEVER SPOKE TO HIM BEFORE ABOUT HIS SOLICITING YOUR INTEREST IN THE JOB?  HE DID NOT SOLICIT ANY INTEREST. I KEPT MY INTEREST AS YOU. IDENTIFIED, I DID NOT KNOW I HAD AN INTEREST. I HAD A PERFECTLY GOOD LIFE PRIOR TO THIS. I WAS INTERESTED IN HELPING AND I WAS CALLED BY RUSSELL REYNOLDS OUT OF THE BLUE.  ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS AND I WILL BE INTERESTED WITH YOUR PERMISSION AND MR. DUNCAN'S PERMISSION TO SEE YOUR BACKGROUND CHECK IS WE IDENTIFY PATTERNS OF MISCONDUCT OR POTENTIAL CONFLECTS OF INTEREST. NF I HAVE NO PATTERNS OF MISCONDUCT IN MY BACKGROUND.  ONE OF YOUR BUSINESSES IS CALLED XPOPO LOGISTICS WHICH HAS CONTRACTS WITHICTH THE POSTAL SERVICE STRETCHING BACK B MANY YEARS. OKAY, WELL THE QUESTION IS THEY IDENTIFY PROBLEMS WITH CONTRACT PERFORMANCE AND BILLING PRACTICES IN THE CONTRACT FILE. WOULD YOU CONSENT% TO RELEASING THAT CONTRACT FILE SO EVERYONE CAN SEE WHAT YOUR BUSINESS IS? EVENDON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SPEAKING ABOUT.  ARE YOU NOT AWARE OF XPO LOGISTICS?  I AM AWARE OF XPO LOGISTICS.  DO YOU HAVE $30 MILLION INVESTED?  HE HAS GONE WAYOVER HIS TIME.  DO YOU HAVE $30 MILLION$3 INVESTED?  I HAVE A SIGNIFICANTVEAV INVESTMENT WHICH I VETTED BEFORE WITH THE ETHICS DEPARTMENT OF THE POSTAL SERVICE AND I WAS GIVEN SPECIFIC TYPES OF GUIDELINES THAT I NEEDED TO ADHERE TO. IT IS A VERY, VERY SMALL PART OF THE POSTAL SERVICE BUSINESS I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH. I COMPLY WITH ALLECTICAL REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE OUR OWN INVESTIGATION. I GUESS WE'LL GET TO EVERYTHING YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ANDCT. G WE WILL SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN.  MR. RASCONS, TIME HAS EXPIRED. , STRONG CATEGORY 2 OR MAYBE A CATEGORY 3 THAT COULD PUT THIS REGION TO THE TEST. OVERNI OVERNIGHT, THE OPENING ACT OF A HURRICANE DOUBLE THREAT.  YOU'RE GOING TO GET A RIGHT HOOK FROM MARCO AND A LEFT HOOK FROM LAURA.  LAURA CARVING UP CARIBBEAN ISLANDS AND CLAIMING THREE LIVES IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. BUT THE THREAT TO LOUISIANA IS MARCO. COASTAL RESIDENTS CLOG HIGHWAYS TRYING TO GET OUT OF TOWN. IN NEW ORLEANS, SHOVELS FILL UP SAND BAGS. RESIDENTS STOCK UP ON GROCERIES. YOU PUT YOUR GUARD DOWN AND THEN YOU ARE HIT BY THE MOTHER OF ALL STORMS.  THE HEAD OF EMERGENCY OPERATIONS SAYS THE BIG EASY HAS MADE BIG STRIDES SINCE KATRINA.  HOW DOES IT SUM PAIR TO 15 YEARS AGO?  WE HAVE A 2.5 MILE SEARCH BARRIER.  KATRINA'S 15 YEAR ANNIVERSARY THIS WEEK IS HITTING HOME FOR THOSE LIKE SIM PANE HUNTER WHO SAYS SHE LOST THREE COUSINS ON THIS STREET.  THEY TRIED TO GET OUT BUT THEY COULDN'T. THE WATER CAME TOO FAST.  OTHERS IN THE HISTORIC 9th WARD WORRIED EVEN WITH A REVAMPED LEVY SYSTEM THAT THERE WILL BE TROUBLE. EN A REGULAR DAY, THIS STREET WILL FLOOD WITH RAIN, SO.  NEW ORLEANS HAS INVESTED $15 BILLION IN A NEW LEVY PROTECTION SYSTEM BUT BETWEEN LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN WHERE I AM AND THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER, THIS ENTIRE CITY IS BELOW SEA LEVEL WHICH MEANS WITH LAURA EXPECTED TO DUMP MORE RAIN IN AN ALREADY SATURATED AREA, THAT COULD BE PRIME CONDITIONS FOR FLOODING.  SAM BROCK IN NEW ORLEANS, PEOPLE VERY ANXIOUS THERE.  WE WILL HAVE CREWS TRACKING BOTH STORMS. IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN TO NEW ORLEANS, THEY SAY IT IS NEVER THE WIND, IT IS THE RAIN OF THESE STORMS.  THAT'S RIGHT. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE PROBLEM EVEN WITH MARCO AS A TROPICAL STORM. IT IS STILL GOING TO BRING A LOT OF RAIN WITH IT. RIGHT NOW, MARCO IS 15 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE MOUTH OF MISSISSIPPI, 60-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS. NORTHWEST MOVING IN AT 10 MILES PER HOUR. LAURA IS BACK AROUND CUBA, 65-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS, MOVING WEST NORTHWEST AT 21. WE START WITH MARCO. IT WILL RAKE THE LOUISIANA AND THEN TEXAS COASTLINES AS A TROPICAL SYSTEM. DON'T LET THAT FOOL YOU. JUST BECAUSE IT IS A TROPICAL SYSTEM DOESN'T MEAN THERE WON'T BE IMPACTS. TWO TO FOUR FOOT STORM SYSTEM. TEN INCHES OF RAIN OR MORE POSSIBLE. LAURA COMES OUT THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING, LIMITED STRENGTHENING WHILE IT IS OVER CUBA. EARLY TOMORROW MORNING, OUT OVER THE GULF. HERE'S WHERE THE PROBLEMS DEVELOP. THIS IS WHY WE WILL SEE SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING. HIGH MOISTURE FOLLOWING MARCO'S PATH. WE WILL ALSO SEE A LOT OF HEAVY RAIN, WIND, LOCALLY 15 INCHES OF RAIN POSSIBLE. WITH THIS SYSTEM AND THE CONE, WE HAVE TO KEEP IT VERY, VERY CAREFUL. WE ARE LOOKING AT FIVE U.S. LANDFALLS SO FAR THIS SEASON. THE RECORD IS 6 BY SEPTEMBER 1st, WE WILL PROBABLY BEAT THAT THIS YEAR. HEAVY RAIN, SATURATED GROUND, ISOLATED TORNADOES, A LOT OF PROBLEMS. EVEN WITH THE TROPICAL STORM LIKE MARCO, DON'T LET THAT FOOL YOU, WE HAVE LAURA RIGHT BEMIND. AS WELL AS OTHER FIGURES WHO HAVE GAINED FAME ON THE RIGHT. AS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL AS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION KICKS OFF TODAY AMID THE WORST PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMY CRISIS IN GENERATIONS, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PROMISING A POSITIVE MESSAGE WHILE SIGNALLING HE WILL RAMP UP HIS ATTACKS ON JOE BIDEN.  I THINK WE WILL SEE SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY UPLIFTING AND POSITIVE. THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE IT TO BE. I THINK YOU HAVE TO DEFEND YOURSELF WHEN TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE LIES.  THE PRESIDENT AND HIS CAMPAIGN ALLIES ARE EXPECTED TO FAN THE FLAME OF CULTURE WARS BY SIEGING ON A PROTEST AGAINST RACIAL INJUSTICE. ON TAP THIS EVENING IS DONALD TRUMP, JR., THE COUPLE THAT POINTED GUNS AT PROTESTERS PASSING THEIROME, AND SENATOR TIM SCOTT, THE ONLY BLACK REPUBLICAN IN THE SENATE. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WILL BE PART OF THE GOP CONVENTION, EACH OF THE FOUR NIGHTS, CAPPED OFF BY HIS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH ON THURSDAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN, AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE FOR A SITTING PRESIDENT. THE NEWS FENDING OFF THE PRESIDENT'S ATTACKS. JOE BIDEN RESPONDING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP QUESTIONING HIS MENTAL FITNESS.  WATCH ME, MR. PRESIDENT, WATCH ME. LOOK AT US BOTH, WHAT WE SAY, WHAT WE DO, WHAT WE SAY, DO, WHAT WE KNOW, WHAT KIND OF SHAPE WE'RE IN, COME ON.  ON HIS ECONOMIC PLANS, BIDEN SAYS HE WILL NOT RAISE TAXES FOR ANYONE MAKING UNDER $400,000. KAMALA HARRIS BRUSHING OFF THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL SWIPES INCLUDING CALLING HER NASTY.  I THINK THAT THERE IS SO MUCH OF WHAT COMES OUT OF DONALD TRUMP'S MOUTH THAT IS DESIGNED TO DISTRACT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM WHAT HE IS DOING EVERY DAY THAT IS ABOUT NEGLECT, NEGLIGENCE AND HARM TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  AND INCOMPETENCE.  THE POLITICAL DRAMA MAY HELP DISTRACT FOR A PERSONAL ONE FOR A FAMILY. NEWLY RELEASED SECRET AUDIO RECORDINGS CAPTURE THE PRESIDENT'S OLDER SISTER, RETIRED FEDERAL JUDGE MARY-ANN TRUMP BARRY CRITICIZING HIS TIME IN OFFICE. NBC OBTAINED 15 HOURS OF RECORDINGS MADE IN 2018 AND 2019 BY THE PRESIDENT'S NIECE MARY TRUMP. THE AUTHOR OF A SCATHING TELL ALL ABOUT HER UNCLE.  YOU KNOW, THE CHANGE OF STORIES, LACK OF PREPATION, THE LYING, HOLY [ BLEEP ] BUT HE IS APPEALING TO THE BASE.  ALSO THIS MORNING, AS THE PRESIDENT AMPLIFIES HIS UNFOUNDED ATTACKS ON MAIL IN VOTING, THE MOST MASTER GENERAL LEWIS DEJOY WILL TESTIFY BEFORE A DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED HOUSE COMMITTEE. TWITTER FLAGGED ANOTHER TWEET BY PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT CLAIMED WITHOUT EVIDENCE THAT BALLOT DROP OFF BOXES ARE A VOTER SECURITY DISASTER AND ARE NOT COVID SANITIZED. OFFICIALS FROM BOTH PARTIES SAY THE DROP OFF BOXES IN MANY STATES HAVE NOT LED TO WIDESPREAD FRAUD AND ARE SAFE. PRESIDENT TRUMP UNVEILING A NEW STEP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID, ANNOUNCING THE FDA HAS ISSUED A TEMPORARY USE AUTHORIZATION FOR CONVALESCENT PLASMA.  THIS IS A THERAPY THAT TRANSFUSES STRONG ANTIBODIES FROM THE BLOOD OF RECOVERED PATIENTS TO HELP TREAT PATIENTS BATTLING A CURRENT INFECTION. IT HAS AN INCREDIBLE RATE OF SUCCESS.  THE FDA COMMISSIONER ALSO TOUTED THE MOVE.  THERE WAS A 35% INCREASE IN SURVIVAL WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT. WE ARE WAITING FOR DATA BUT THIS CLEARLY MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION.  IT HAS LONG BEEN USED TO TREAT OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND HAS SHOWN PROMISE IN TREATING COVID BUT THE NEW DECISION OF EMERGENCY USE COMES AFTER AN INTERNAL DEBATE AT THE FDA OVER WHETHER THEY HAD ENOUGH DATA TO AUTHORIZE SUCH A MOVE. IT COMES A DAY AFTER THE PRESIDENT WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE ACCUSED THE FDA OF IMPEDING CLINICAL TRIALS FOR POLITICAL REASONS, TWEETING SATURDAY, THE DEEP STATE OR WHOEVER AT THE FDA IS MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR DRUG COMPANIES TO GET PEOPLE IN ORDER TO TEST THE VACCINES IS THERAPEUTICS. PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT ON SUNDAY.  I THINK THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HOLD UP BUT WE BROKE THE LOG JAM OVER THE LAST WEEK, THAT'S MY OPINION, STRONG OPINION. THAT'S FOR POLITICAL REASONS. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS.  THERE WAS STRONG BACKLASH OVERNIGHT FROM DEMOCRATS, CONGRESSMAN JAMES CLIBURN RIGHTING THAT HE WELCOMED THERAPIES THAT WORK BUT ADDING, THAT HE IS TROUBLED BY THE PRESIDENT PUSHING UNPROVEN TREATMENTS. OBAMA ERA OFFICIALS ALSO QUESTIONING THE MOVE.  YOU CAN'T MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OUT OF THIS DATA. IT IS SUGGESTIVE BUT HARDLY A BREAK THROUGH AND HARDLY EVIDENCE.  NOW SCOTT GOTLY WHO IS THE FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER DEFENDED THE AGENCY SAYING HE FUNDAMENTALLY REJECTS THE IDEA THAT OFFICIALS WOULD IMPACT THE TIMING OF A DECISION BASED ON POLITICAL PRESSURE. WE SHOULD ALSO ADD THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THE FDA HAS GRANTED EMERGENCY YOUTH AUTHORIZATION DURING THE PANDEMIC. REM DESVEER WAS GIVEN A GREEN LIGHT IN MAY AFTER TRIAL DATA SHOWED THAT DRUG HELPED SHORTEN HOSPITAL RECOVERY TIME IN SOME PATIENTS. TRANSFUSED WITH CONVALESCENT PLASMA 70,000 PATIENTS. DR. MICHAEL JOYNER SAY DR. MICHAEL JOINER SAYS HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES AT THE MAYO CLINIC HAVE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK SINCE APRIL STUDYING WHETHER CONVALESCENT PLASMA IS EFFECTSIVE IN FIGHTING COVID-19.  I THINK THE DATA EARLY IN COVID-19 IS STRONG. I BELIEVE IT IS GETTING STRONGER. YESTERDAY THE FDA BASED IN LARGE PART BY THE MAYO LED RESEARCH DECIDED THE ANSWER WAS YES. YES, IT IS SAFE, AND YES, IT'S EFFECTIVE.  TODAY IS A VERY BIG DAY, A DAY WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO.  THIS IS THE BEST BIOLOGICAL SHOT ON GOAL WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE VACCINE CATEGORIES TO SHOW UP WITH OTHER OPTIONS.  HOW EFFECTIVE IS CONVALESCENT PLASMA? DR. JOINER SAYS FOR SOME PATIENTS IT CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE.  OUR DATA IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WHO WERE SICK ENOUGH TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL BUT NOT IN THE ICU. IF THEY ARE TREATED EARLY IN THE COURSE OF THE DISEASE, WITHIN THREE DAYS OF THE DIAGNOSIS, THEIR MORTALITY WILL FALL FROM 12% TO 13% TO 7% OR 8% FOR A RELATIVE RISK REDUCTION OF ABOUT 30% TO 40%.  AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT?  THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT IS ENCOURAGING.  LAST MARCH, CLAUDIA GARCONO FOUND HERSELF IN THE SWEET SPOT OF PATIENTS THAT DR. JOINER IS REFERRING TO. AFTER THREE ROUGH DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL, HER GROWN SON CALLED.  MOM, GREAT NEWS, THEY THINK YOU CAN HAVE THE PLASMA. AND I WAS LIKE, DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO THAT? IT IS LIKE A TRANSFUSE, I'M NOT SURE.  TERRIFIED SHE WOULD BE PUT ON A VENTILATOR, SHE AGREED. 30 HOURS AFTER HER TRANSFUSION I REMEMBER TAKING THAT FIRST DEEP BREATH, YOU KNOW. I FELT LIKE I HAD OXYGEN. I FELT LIKE I WON THE LOTTERY.  IT SOUNDS LIKE ALMOST A MIRACLE.  EXACTLY. I IMMEDIATELY TOLD MY SON. AND I SAID I THINK THE PLASMA DID IT.  WHAT ABOUT T PATIENTS ALREADY ON VENTILATORS?  A NUMBER OF INTENSIVE CARE DOCTORS HAVE TALKED ABOUT GIVEN CONVALESCENT PLASMA IN THE ICU SETTING AND HAVE SAID WE TRIED BUT IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM EFFECTIVE.  I THINK IT WOULD BE REFLECTED IN OUR RESULTS THAT EARLY USE IS BETTER.  DR. R. SCOTT WRIGHT JOINED THEM. HE WAS STUDY LEADER FOR THE PLASMA RESEARCH, A VETERAN OF TWO DECADES OF CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH AT MAYO. WHAT DOES HE THINK OF THE FD A DECISION?  I THINK THE FDA HAS MADE AN EXCELLENT DECISION. I THINK THEY PUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH INTEREST OF THE NATION FIRST. I RESPECT THEM FOR THAT. I TRUST THEIR JUDGMENT.  SO TO THOSE WHO THINK THE PRESIDENT FORCED THE FDA TO DO THIS, YOU WOULD SAY YOU DON'T BUY IT?  NOT AT ALL. I DON'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE TO DAY OF ANY POLITICAL INFLUENCE.  SO I PRESSED THE DOCTORS.  REPRESENTATIVE MASSY, YOU ARE NOW RECOGNIZED. OVERNIGHT, EXHAUSTIVE FIREFIGHTERS LOCKED IN A FIGHT TO CONTAIN WILDFIRES SCORCHING SWATHS OF CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN 14,000 FIREFIGHTERS WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO CONTAIN SOME OF THE LARGEST FIRES IN STATE HISTORY. OFFICIALS NOW WORRIED ABOUT THE THREAT OF FRESH RED FLAG WARNINGS THAT COULD START A NEW EXPLOSION OF RAGING FLAMES.  HOW WORRIED ARE YOU ABOUT FEBRUARY 2012? OKAY. I WANT TO READ EXCERPTS FROM THE PRESS RELEASES AND ASK CHAIRMAN DUNCAN TO RESPOND TO THEM. IN 2011, THE POST OFFICE ANNOUNCED, AS AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY IN 2010, THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS MADE THE DECISION TO MOVE MAIL PROCESSING OPERATIONS FROM THE ASHLAND PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITY TO THE CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA FACILITY. WHAT THIS MEANS IN EASTERN KENTUCKY, WHEN WE MAIL OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR, THE ENVELOPE GOES TO CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA BEFORE IT GOES BACK TO OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR. I WANT TO READ FROM THIS OTHER PRESS RELEASE FROM THE POST OFFICE, THE KENTUCKY ANNA DISTRICT. AS A RESULT OF STUDIES BEGAN FIVE MONTHS AGO, THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS MADE THE DECISION TO MOVE ALL MAIL PROCESSING OPERATIONS FROM BOWLING GREEN, KENTUCKY MOVED TO NASHVILLE, COMPTON, KENTUCKY, ELIZABETH TOWN, KENTUCKY, LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY, SECOND LARGEST CITY LOST THEIR MAIL PROCESSING FACILITY IN 2012. HUBIC KENTUCKY MOVED TO LOUISIANA. SO THIS WAS IN 2012. THIS WAS AN ELECTION YEAR AND THIS WAS WHILE OBAMA WAS PRESIDENT AND BIDEN WAS VICE PRESIDENT. I WANT TO READ A QUOTE FROM CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER MEGAN BRENNAN AT THE TIME. THE DECISION TO CONSOLIDATE WAS AN URGENT NEED TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PROCESSING NETWORK TO ELIMINATE UNDERUTILIZED INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS NECESSARY IF THE POSTAL SUFBS TO TO REMAIN VIABLE TO REMAIN USEFUL TO THE NATION. NOW THE DEMOCRATS HAVE COOKED THUP THEORY THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE IS GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPRESSING VOTES AND THE MEDIA IS COMPLICIT IN THIS. THEY HAVE SHOWN VIDEO OF MAIL SORTING EQUIPMENT BEING MOVED OUT OF FACILITIES. WELL, HERE I JUST MENTIONED 10 FACILITIES IN KENTUCKY THAT WERE SHUT DOWN IN AN ELECTION YEAR. I WANT TO ASK CHAIRMAN MIKE DUNCAN, MR. DUNCAN, DO YOU BELIEVE THIS IN 2012 WAS PART OF A CONSPIRACY TO DISENFRANCHISE VOTERS IN THE 2012 ELECTION WERE PART OF A CONSPIRACY TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GETTING THEIR MEDICARE OR SOCIAL SECURITY T CHECKS?  CONGRESSMAN, I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF A CONSPIRACY THAT COULD KEEP PEOPLE FROM VOTING OR COMBETING SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS. AS A RESIDENTS OF THE AREA, I KNOW IT HAS ADDED DAYS TO SENDING AND RECEIVING A LETTER.  AND I BELIEVE YOU KNOW THAT CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER MEGAN BRANNON, SHE WAS THE CEOO IN 2010 AND THEN BECAME POST MASTER GENERAL. DO YOU QUESTION HER MOTIVES IN THE COURSE OF THESE OPERATIONS?  NO, I WORK CLOSELY WITH MEGAN BRANNON WHEN SHE WAS CHIEF OF THE ORGANIZATION. SHE HAS GREAT INTEGRITY. SHE HAS BEEN AN OPERATIONS PERSON, WAS A LETTER CARRIER, SHE WORKED HER WAY UP.  AND SHE HAS A BUSINESS DEGREE FROM M.I.T. I WOULD ADD. THIS WASN'T AER PART OF A CONSPIRACY THEN. IT WAS PART OF REALIGNING THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THE U.S. CUSTOMER. I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY HIGHLIGHTING SOME IRONY AND HYPOCRISY. POST MASTER GENERAL DEJOY, HOW LONG WILL THE POST OFFICE BE FUNDED IF THERE IS NO TRANSFERS OF CASH TO THE POST OFFICE. HOW LONG CAN YOU OPERATE?  SIR WOULD YOU TURN ON YOUR MIC, PLEASE?  LATE 2021.  OKAY. LATE 2021. SO AT LEAST FOR ONE MORE YEAR. I HOPE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE AWARE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CEASES TO BE FUNDED ON SEPTEMBER OF 30th OF YEAS YEAR. WE ARE HOLDING A HEARING WHILE THE POST OFFICE IS FUNDED FOR ANOTHER YEAR. WE ARE NOT EVEN IN TOWN BECAUSE SPEAKER PELOSI ISN'T CONCERNED THAT GOVERNMENT FUNDING ENDS ON SEPTEMBER 30th. EVERYTHING BUT THE POST OFFICE SHUTS DOWN ON SEPTEMBER 30th AT MIDNIGHT IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING. ALSO, ONE OTHER ELEMENT OF IRONY AND HYPOCRISY, OUR GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN 95% OF VOTER PRECINCTSES IN THE STATE AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO BLAME THE POST OFFICE FOR DISENFRANCHISING VOTERS. WITH THAT, I YIELD BACK.  GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. WE RECOGNIZE CONGRESSMAN RUDOLPH NOW.  THANK YOU. LET'S LEVEL. FOR THE BIG HEADED INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. LET ME SUM IT UP. FIRST, MAIL IS BEING DELIVERED LATE AT THE EXPENSE OF PEOPLE WHO NEED PRESCRIPTIONS, AT THE EXPENSE OF SMALL BUSINESSES WHO NEED SUPPLIES TO STAY IN BUSINESS OR REOPEN FOR BUSINESS, FOR SOCIAL SECURITY RECIPIENTS AND VETERANS WHO NEED THEIR BENEFITS. THAT'S THE FIRST REASON. THE SECOND REASON IS WE HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO SAYS MAIL IN BALLOTS ARE FRAUDULENT AND IF HE DOESN'T WIN THE ELECTION IT IS BECAUSE IT'S FRAUDULENT. WE KNOW THAT IS A LIE AND THE LIE CONTINUES TO BE CONTINUED BY MEMBERS IN THIS COMMITTEE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE . WE KNOW OF A MEMO FROM DEJOY TO SIX STATES THAT THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT MAIL IN BALLOTS TO BE RECEIVED IN TIME. AND WE ARE HERE BECAUSE THE POSTAL SUFBS HAS REQUESTED FINANCIAL HELP FROM THIS INSTITUTION. LET ME TURN TO MY QUESTIONS. UNLIKE ANY PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS A UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATION TO DELIVER MAIL IN ANY ADDRESS IN THE UNITED STATES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT IS PROFITABLE OR NOT. THE POST OFFICE HAS A RIDICULOUS MANDATE TO PREFUND IN TEN YEARS TIME, 75 YEARS OF RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRIVATE OR PUBLIC INSTITUTION. MR. DEJOY IN YOUR TESTIMONY, YOU STATED THAT YOU ARE AGAINST THE REFUNDING MANDATE. THE TRUMP APPOINTED BOARD OF GOVERNORS POSTAL WORKERS AND SEN PORZ ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE AGAINST THAT MANDATE. AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS A BIPARTISAN BILL SITTING ON MITCH McCONNELL'S DESK THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE PREFUNDING MANDATE AND FREE UP TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE. HERE'S SOME FREE BUSINESS ADVICE, PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL MITCH McCONNELL. BECAUSE ONE VOTE AND ONE STROKE OF A PEN BY THIS PRESIDENT WOULD FREE UP BILL YPZ OF DOLLARS FOR THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE TO ACCOMPLISH THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVITALIZE THAT ORGANIZATION FOR DECADES TO COME. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS PLAN. IT IS STANDARD PRACTICE AS AN EXECUTIVE TO COME IN, MEET WITH YOUR TEAM AND DEVELOP A PLAN BEFORE EXECUTING CHANGES. THIS WAS THE PLAN RELEASED IN MAY BEFORE YOU BECAME POST MASTER GENERAL. DID YOU MAKE ANY WRITTEN MODIFICATIONS TO THIS PLAN SINCE YOU HAVE TAKEN OFFICE?  FIRST OF ALL, YOU ARE INCORRECT ON MY POSITION ON THE PREFUNDING OF THE HEALTHCARE. I KNOW YOU SUPPORT IT.  YES, I SUPPORT IT.  I SAID THAT, YES. BUT HAVE YOU MADE ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THE BUSINESS PLAN?  I'M WORKING ON MAKING MODIFICATIONS OF THE PLAN.  IN FACT ON AUGUST 13th, DEVELOPING A STRATEGIC PLAN TO ACHIEVE FINANCIAL STABILITY. IS THAT A PLAN YOU ARE WORKING ON?  IT IS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. I MUST SAY WE DO NEED TO IDENTIFY THAT LEGISLATION ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE BE SELF SUSTAINING AND IT HAS NOT.  THAT'S WHY GETTING RID OF THE PREMANDATE IS SO IMPORTANT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE WORKING UNDER A WRITTEN PLAN OF SOME KIND. IF YOU HAVE MADE ANY WRITTEN MODIFICATIONS IN MEMOES TO TEAM MEMBERS, WILL YOU PROVIDE THIS COMMITTEE WITH THAT INFORMATION SO WE KNOW HOW YOU HAVE MODIFIED THIS FIVE YEAR PLAN?  WHEN WE COME OUT WITH A PLAN --.  SURELY YOU HAVE DOCUMENTS FLOATING AROUND, RIGHT? YOU CAN GIVE US A DRAFT CAN'T YOU?  I WOULD NOT --.  CAN'T GIVE US A DRAFT? WE JUST GOT A DRAFT SHOWING YOU ARE DOWN 10% NATIONAL AND IN BATTLEGROUNDS EVEN MORE. CAN YOU GET THAT INFORMATION TO US AS REQUESTED?  PROBABLY NOT.  LET ME ASK YOU THIS. LET'S TURN TO THE IMPACT YOU HAVE HAD WITH THE INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS THAT SHOW SENIOR MANAGERS NOT TO EVEN PLUG IN THE PREVIOUSLY DISCONNECTED MACHINES WITHOUT APPROVAL FROM HEAD QUARTERS. MAIL PROCESSING EQUIPMENT, BOXES WILL REMAIN WHERE THEY ARE. WILL YOU TELL THE AMERICAN PUBLIC RIGHT NOW THAT USPS EMPLOYEES CAN PLUG IN DISCONNECTED MACHINES.  I'M AWARE OF THE DIRECTIVE YOU ARE SPEAKING ABOUT.  IT IS INTERNAL COMMUNICATION FROM USPS. YOU WILL ALLOW THEM TO PLUG IN MACHINES TO DO THEIR JOB?  I'M NOT GOING TO AGREE TO SOMETHING THAT I'M UNAWARE OF.  THIS IS LIKE TELLING THEM YOU CAN'T PLUG IN THE BLENDERS TO DO THEIR JOB.  THERE MUST BE A RAENZ IF THE ORGANIZATION.  BUT YOU ARE THE HEAD OF THE UNION. THE BUCK STOPS WITH ME.  THE BUCK ON WHAT MACHINE GETS PLUGGED IN? THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS.  THE FACT THAT YOU ARE DOWN 10% NATIONALLY.  THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AN UNPLUGGED MACHINE.  WE NOW RECOGNIZE CONGRESSMAN PROCRANA. EXCUSE ME, CONGRESSMAN HIES.  THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I WILL JUST BRING UP, IF I MAY, THE FACT THAT YOU ALLOWED MR. RASCON TO GO SIGNIFICANTLY OVER HIS TIME WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CUTTING OFF MR. ROY. IT IS NOT GOING UNNOTICED. I THINK MR. ROY'S POINT REGARDING THE HEROES ACT, THAT IT WAS $3.4 TRILLION OF SWAMP SPENDING AND DID NOT EVEN EXTEND THE PPP WHICH WAS WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. BUT WHAT THE HEROES ACT DID INCLUDE WAS UNIVERSAL MAIL IN BALLOTS, NO VOTER I.D. FOR ALL OF THOSE BALLOTS. THE HEROES ACT WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT COVID HELP AND RELIEF DID NOT EXTEND PPP BUT IT DID HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF VOTING REFORM IN IT THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US INTO THE CONVERSATION HERE TODAY. MR. DEJOY, I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME, WOULD YOU NOT, THAT THE SANCTITY OF THE VOTING BOX, BALLOT BOX, IS A PARAMOUNT ISSUE FOR AMERICANS? WOULD YOU AGREE?  YES, SIR.  I'M SURE ALL OF US WOULD. NOW IN 2017, THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION BY THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL THAT CONCLUDED THAT THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE IMPROPERLY COORDINATED WITH THE POSTAL WORKERS UNION IN SUPPORT OF HILLARY CLINTON. THE INVESTIGATION WENT ON AND STATED THAT IT WAS A SYSTEMATIC VIOLATION OF THE HATCH ACT THAT WAS INVOLVED. MANY POSTAL WORKERS HAD HAD TO -- WERE REQUIRED TO WORK OVERTIME TO MAKE UP FOR THE ABSENCE OF ALL OF THAT. IT IS ALSO VERY INTERESTING THAT THE UNION WE ARE REFERRING TO, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS, WHICH JUST TEN DAYS AGO, ENDORSED BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT. LET ME ASK YOU, HOW MANY FRAUDULENT VOTES ARE NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE CONSIDERED TOO MANY?  I DON'T KNOW, SIR. I GUESS ONE.  I WOULD SAY ONE. WE DON'T WANT FRAUDULENT VOTES. THERE IS NO REASON FOR US TO HAVE THAT. YOUR PREDECESSOR, MISS BRENNAN COMMITTED TO FULLY IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS, ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OSC TO AVOID FUTURE HATCH VIOLATIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU, WHAT KIND OF CHANGES HAVE YOU MADE TO PREVENT THESE TYPE OF VIOLATIONS FROM TAKING PLACE IN THE FUTURE?  CONGRESSMAN, THAT IS NOT A FOCUS THAT I HAVE HAD IN MY 70 DAYS BUT I WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATUS OF THAT INITIATIVE AND GET BACK TO YOU.  OKAY. I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU GETTING BACK WITH US. THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF USPS WORKERS ARE FAITHFUL WORKERS. THEY ARE HONEST DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS. THAT BEING SAID, WHAT THE OSC HAS IDENTIFIED IS WITHOUT QUESTION MANY CASES, POLITICAL BIAS. AND IN FACT -- JUST LAY THIS OUT, WHEN YOU HAVE A UNION THAT CONSISTS OF 300,000 WORKERS AND THAT UNION COMES OUT AND ENDORSES A CANDIDATE IN THIS CASE, BIDEN, AND THEN THAT UNION IS SUPPOSED TO BE EXPECTED TO ACCURATELY HANDLE AND DELIVER BALLOTS TO BOTH PARTIES FAIRLY, DOES THAT RAISE ANY CONCERNS FOR YOU AT ALL?  SIR, I RESPECT EVERYBODY'S RIGHT TO SUPPORT CANDIDATES AND DONATE TO CANDIDATES. I HAVE DONE SO MYSELF FOR 20 YEARS. IN MY MIND IT DOESN'T RAISE ANY AWARENESS OF CONCERN WITH REGARD TO POSTAL WORKERS. THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS 650,000 PEOPLE. WE WILL HAVE LIKE THE REST OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY, WE WILL HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE LAWS. BUT FOR THE MOST PART I BELIEVE IN THE ABILITY TO DONATE. HOPEFULLY WE HAVE JUDGES THAT WILL GIVE IT A FAIR CALL. IF THEY GIVE IT A FAIR CALL, WE WILL WIN THIS ELECTION. THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN TAKE THIS ELECTION FROM US IS IF THIS IS A RIGGED ELECTION. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS ELECTION. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS. [ APPLAUSE ] .  I'M JUST SAYING, WE CANNOT HAVE THESE LIVE -- SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM UNIVERSAL, I LIKE THE WORD LIVE -- SENT TO EVERYONE, PEOPLE WHO NEVER ASKED FOR THEM. YOU'RE SITTING THERE AND YOU GET A BALLOT. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. IT WAS JUST GIVEN IN THE POLLS BECAUSE THE POLLS TRY TO TREAT US WEIRD. RASMUSSEN DID WELL, A FEW OF THE OTHERS DID WELL. THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT I LOOK AT, THE ONES THAT DID WELL LAST TIME. IF YOU LOOK AT IT, EVERY SINGLE VOTE THAT THEY HAVE, EVERY SINGLE VOTE IS GOING TO BE LOOKED AT. A MAN OR A WOMAN IS SITTING WAITING FOR NOTHING, WATCHING TELEVISION AND NO ENTHUSIASM BECAUSE THE POLLS ARE SAYING I'M UP BY MASSIVE NUMBERS, NOT JUST A LITTLE, I'M WAY UP ON THE ECONOMY. BUT I'M UP BY MASSIVE -- WHEN I SAY I'M UP, I'M TALKING ABOUT WE'RE UP. IF YOU COULD. I'M UP ON MASSIVE NUMBERS. OUR VOTERS ARE SAYING, I'M VERY ANGRY ABOUT THIS, I'LL GO TO THE POLLS DIRECTLY AND VOTE. THEIR VOTERS ARE HERE IS THE BALLOT, IT JUST GOT TO YOU. IT HE SAYS, WHAT THE HELL AM I GOING TO DO WITH THIS THING? YOU HAVE SOMEONE KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR. HEY, HAVE YOU GOT YOUR BALLOT? WILL YOU SIGNING? IF YOU WANT. HERE IT IS. GET OUT OF HERE. THAT IS THE MOST HONEST WAY OF DOING IT. THAT IS UNFAIR. THAT IS UNFAIR. NOW THEY TAKE THE ENTHUSIASM THAT OUR PARTY HAS, AND WE HAVE TREMENDOUS ENTHUSIASM. WE HAVE RECORD ENTHUSIASM. WE HAVE A BASE, THE LIKES OF WHICH NO ONE HAS SEEN, INCLUDING THESE PEOPLE. WHAT A FANTASTIC STORY THAT TO THIS WEEKEND, A FANTASTIC COVER STORY THIS WEEKEND. EVERYBODY HERE IS GOING TO VOTE. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS BASE. THEY DOWN. THEY HAVE NO ENTHUSIASM. FRANKLY, BERNIE SANDERS, THERE'S MUCH MORE ENTHUSIASM FOR HIM. BERNIE SANDERS, AGAIN, HE'S THE GREATEST LOSER I HAVE EVER SEEN. THIS GUY CAN THESE AND BE SO HAPPY. HILLARY CLINTON, I WANT TO USE NICE LANGUAGE. STARTS WITH THE WORD ESSAY, AND SEE -- THEY WILL SAY THAT I USED BAD LANGUAGE IN NORTH CAROLINA. BERNIE SANDERS GOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. IS THAT OKAY? BY HILLARY CLINTON. WORSE. BY THE DEMOCRATS. POCAHONTAS, ELIZABETH WARREN GOT OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN. ONE DAY, SHE TRIED THE SUPER TUESDAY VOTE, BERNIE SANDERS WOULD'VE WON EVERY SINGLE STATE, AND WENT BY A LITTLE BIT, SHE DID NOT DO WELL. SHE TOOK THOUSANDS OF VOTES AWAY. IF YOU HAD THE PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTES BACK, THAT MEANS THAT BERNIE WOULD HAVE ONE EASILY. I'M GLAD HE DIDN'T, HE HAD A MUCH MORE ENTHUSIASM, HE WOULD HAVE HAD A MUCH SMALLER BASE THAN OURS. I HAVE TO SAY THIS, EQUALLY ENTHUSIASTIC, THIS BASE DOESN'T LIKE JOE BIDEN. THEY DO NOT LIKE JOE BIDEN. WE WILL GET A LOT OF VOTES. PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED. I KNOW HOW OTHER COUNTRIES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US. I UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT BERNIE SANDERS PEOPLE REALLY FEEL, I UNDERSTAND TRADE. I HAVE DONE U.S. McA. I GOT TO READ AT THE NAFTA. THE CHINA TARIFFS -- CHINA HAD THE WORST YEAR THAT THEY HAVE HAD IN 67 YEARS, PRIOR TO THE PLAY. THE WORST YEAR THAT THEY HAVE HAD IN DECADES. WE HAVE HAD THE BEST YEAR WE HAVE EVER HAD. WE TOOK 1 BILLION FROM CHINA. WE NEVER TOOK INTENTIONS FROM CHINA. FROM CHINA, 25 YEARS. NOT ONLY OBAMA, BUT FOR 25 YEARS, CHINA WAS TAKING IN ANYWHERE BETWEEN 200 BILLION, WITH A B, AND $550 BILLION, FROM THE UNITED STATES. I GIVE THEM ALL THE CREDIT. NUMBER ONE FOR BEING SMART, AND, THE REPRESENTATIVES -- CHINA, WE BUILD CHINA. WE GAVE THEM THREE, FOUR, $500 BILLION PER YEAR. BEFORE THAT, BEFORE THE WTO, AND THEN GETTING INTO IT, CHINA WAS FLATLINED. CHINA, IT WAS AFTER THAT HAPPENED, THAT THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF US. WE DID NOT HAVE PEOPLE. BIDEN WOULD BE THE WORST OF ALL OF THEM, HIS SON TOOK OUT 1 1/2 BILLION DOLLARS, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. GIVE ME A BREAK. CHINA WILL OWN OUR COUNTRY, IF THIS GUY GETS ELECTED. SO -- WE HAVE A BIG ONE COMING. JUST TO FINISH THE ENTHUSIASM, THEY TAKE THE ENTHUSIASM NOW OUT OF THE EQUATION, BECAUSE THEY WILL GO KNOCK ON EVERYBODY'S DOOR. WILL YOU SIGN THIS? NO ONE KNOWS WHO IS SIGNING IT. NOW THEY WILL WANT TO HAVE IT WHERE THE SIGNATURE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE VERIFIED. THE SIGNATURE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE VERIFIED. THEN, THEY ARE GOING TO PLAY THE GAME THAT WE ARE NOT PATRIOTIC. WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS USING COVID-19 TO STEAL THE ELECTION. THEY ARE USING COVID-19 TO DEPRIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL OF OUR PEOPLE OF A FAIR AND FREE ELECTION. DON'T LET THEM GIVE YOU THE POST OFFICE STAFF. THE POSTAL SERVICE, THEY DO A GREAT JOB. THEY LOSE A LOT OF MONEY. IF THEY CHARGED AMAZON AND THESE COMPANIES, A COUPLE DOLLARS MORE A PACKAGE, THEN AMAZON WOULD HAVE TO PAY, NOT THE CUSTOMER, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? THEY WOULD START DOING VERY WELL. LET THE POST OFFICE TO DO IT, AND THEY CAN LOSE A FORTUNE. THAT IS WHAT AMAZON SAYS. OF COURSE, I JUST TELL IT LIKE IT IS. RIGHT? WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE -- WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE DURING THE FIRST THREE AND HALF YEARS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. NOT EVEN GETTING PUSHED BACK, I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS. FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS. WE HAVE DONE MORE -- LET'S SAY LIKE THIS, WE CAN SAY, SOMEONE WANTING A WAR. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION HAS IN OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE SECURED OUR BORDER. WE BUILT OUR WALL, WHICH WILL BE FINISHED SHORTLY. WE BROUGHT BACK MANUFACTURING. WE HAVE DEFEATED THE ENTIRE ISIS CALIPHATE, AND KILLED OUTBACK DADDY. WE ALSO KILLED THE GREATEST BIGGEST TERRORS OF THE CYST OF THE BIGGEST TERRORISTS. WE APPOINTED 300 NEW JUDGES, BY THE END WE WILL APPOINT 300. IT UNHEARD OF NUMBER. THAT IS BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS VERY NICE AND HE GAVE ME 142 OPENINGS. HISTORICALLY, HISTORICALLY, WHEN YOU BECOME PRESIDENT, THEY SAY THIS IS HOW MANY JUDGES, AND YOU'LL SAY NONE. THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT, IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING. FEDERAL JUDGES. I HAVE APPOINTED -- WELL, WE WILL HAVE APPOINTED 350 BY THE END OF THE FIRST TERM. I SAT DOWN AND I SAID, HOW MANY JUDGES DO I GET TO APPOINT? THEY SAID, 142. HE THOUGHT THAT HILLARY WAS GOING TO WIN. THAT'S RIGHT. THE REPUBLICANS DID NOT MAKE IT EASY. WE ENDED UP WITH 142 JUDGES. THEN, WE WILL END UP WITH 302 GREAT SUPPORTING COURT JUSTICES. REMEMBER THIS, I AM DEMANDING A LIST. LET'S PUT UP A LIST OF THE JUDGES THAT HE WILL TAKE OUT, LIKE I DID. WE WILL TAKE A MEDICAL LIST, WE WILL BE ANNOUNCING A LIST WITH THE JUDGES THAT WE HAD AND WE MIGHT ADD A FEW MORE. THEN YOU WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE STAND. HE CANNOT DO IT. THE RADICAL LEFT WILL DEMAND THAT HE APPOINTS SUPER RADICAL LEFT, WILD AND CRAZY JUSTICES GOING INTO THE SUPREME COURT. YOUR AMERICAN DREAM WILL BE DEAD IF THAT HAPPENS. IT WILL BE DEAD. BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT, I HAVE HAD TO, SOME PRESIDENTS HAVE HAD NONE. I HAVE HAD TWO AND A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, AND, THE NEXT ONE COULD HAVE TWO, THREE, FOUR, EVEN FIVE. WHETHER YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE SECOND AMENDMENT, OR MILITARY, THIS IS SO IN YOUR TENT. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS AND YOU HAVE TO WIN THE ELECTION. WE BROUGHT BACK MANUFACTURING. WE REBUILT OUR MILITARY. WHEN I CAME, ISIS WAS ALL OVER. THE PRIME MINISTER OF IRAQ WAS IN LAST WEEK, AND HE SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DEFEATING ISIS. I SAID, ME OR THE UNITED STATES? WHEN YOU CAME INTO OFFICE, IT WAS A MESS. THEY WERE ALL OVER IRAQ AND SYRIA. YOU DEFEATED THEM, AND I SAID, GOOD, TELL THAT TO THE MEDIA PLEASE. HE SAID I WILL, SO LET'S SEE IF HE DOES. WE HAVE PASSED THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND REGULATION CUTS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE REPLACED THE WORST DEAL, EVER MADE, NAFTA, WITH A GREAT DEAL THAT WILL KEEP OUR COMPANIES HERE. IT WILL BE TREATING US VERY NICELY. I WOULD NOT SAY THE OTHERS COUNTRIES WERE THRILLED WITH IT, BUT THEY WERE HAPPY ENOUGH. A LOT OF OUR BROKEN AND BAD TRADE DEALS WERE GETTING $40 BILLION FROM JAPAN. WE FIXED A HORRIBLE DEAL THAT WAS MADE WITH SOUTH KOREA. 250,000 JOBS.  SHE WAS RIGHT. THE JOB SENT TO SOUTH KOREA, NOT US. SHE SAID IT WOULD PRODUCE 250,000 JOBS, AND IT DID, TO SOUTH KOREA. WE STOOD UP TO THAT I LIKE NO ONE HAS EVER STOOD UP BETWEEN THE TERRACE. THE TERRACE AND THE TRADE DEAL, DO NOT FORGET, WHEN I MADE THAT THE INK WAS NOT TO DRY BEFORE THE CHINA VIRUS POURED INTO OUR COUNTRY. IT HAS DONE VERY WELL. IN THE PAST WEEK THEY HAD THE LARGEST ORDER OF CORN, THE LARGEST ORDER OF SOYBEANS, AND, THEY ARE DOING THINGS. THEY ARE VERY SMART. A LOT OF PEOPLE, THEY SEE MY ATTITUDE, AND THEY SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO ORDER. THEY SAY THE OPPOSITE. I GOT A CALL LAST WEEK -- SIR, ACTUALLY -- HERE -- I GOT A CALL, THEY ORDERED THE LARGEST ORDER OF CORN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. TWICE. TWICE. THE LARGEST ORDER OF CORN. THE LARGEST ORDER OF SOYBEANS. SOMEONE ELSE WOULD SAY THAT RUNNING A COUNTRY -- WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. HE'S NOT SAYING NICE THINGS. CHINA IS VERY SMART. THEY ORDER MORE CORN THAN WE HAVE EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. THEY WERE MORE SOYBEANS THAN WE EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE, AND NOW FARMERS ARE CALLING ME UP, SAYING FARMERS, SIR, CHINA LOVES THEM. PLEASE DON'T BE TOO DIFFICULT. WE DO TOO GOOD OF A JOB SOMETIMES. WE ACHIEVED AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. WE ARE NUMBER ONE AND THE WORLD. I SAW WHERE THESE PHONIES -- THEY WANT TO GO TO WIND ENERGY. I THINK THEY JUST WANT TO CLOSE UP THE COUNTRY. THEY ARE TAKING AWAY OUR STRENGTH. THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING. SOLAR CAN DO IT. IT IS SO FUN. VERY EXPENSIVE. BUT, HOWEVER, THEY WANT TO GO TO OTHER FORMS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY. I THINK THAT THAT IS OKAY. IT IS NOT GOING TO POWER THESE MASSIVE FACTORIES. HYDROELECTRICITY, I LOVE. IT IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES. I LOVE IT, I HAVE TO TELL YOU. YOU DON'T SEE IT TOO MUCH. THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THAT YOU CANNOT BUILD A DAM THERE. WE CAN. WE HAVE DONE THINGS THAT NO ONE THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE, LIKE THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. WE GOT THAT APPROVED. THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE. THEY WERE BOGGED DOWN, RIGHT? WE HAVE THINGS OF THAT TODAY SAID YOU COULD NOT GET DONE. WE HAVE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, AND THEY SAID WE WANT TO BAN FRACKING. NO FRACKING. HOW DO YOU THINK THEY WILL DO IN TEXAS, OKLAHOMA, LOUISIANA, AND NORTH DAKOTA? THERE IS NO FRACKING. THEY WANT NO FOSSIL FUEL WHATSOEVER. NO GAS, NO OIL, NO NOTHING. THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING. NOW, THEY ARE GETTING KILLED. THE POLE JUST CAME OUT, AND TEXAS WAS NOT HAPPY. THEY WANT NO GUNS. THEY WANT TO KNOW OIL. THEY WANT TO KNOW GOD, GUNS, OR OIL. NO OIL, NO RELIGION, NO GAS. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL DO TOO GOOD IN TEXAS. GEORGE WASHINGTON COULD COME BACK FROM THE DEAD, AND HE COULD BE THE VP CANDIDATE, LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, AND YOU WILL NOT WIN THE STATE OF TEXAS IF YOU HAVE NO OIL, NO GUNS AND NO RELIGION. YOU WILL NOT WIN TOO MANY PLACES. WE ELIMINATED OBAMA CARE IS HORRIBLE AND VERY UNFAIR INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WHICH KNOCKED OUT OBAMA CARE. IT'S KNOCKED OUT OBAMA CARE. WE HAD PROTECTED YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. WE CUT DRUG PRICES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 51 YEARS. WE HAVE DRUG PRICES -- I DID A THING -- WE PAY THE SAME AS THE LOWEST PRICES WITH THE BEST DEAL. THE DRUG COMPANIES ARE GOING CRAZY, AND, I SAID I WENT TO MARK MEADOWS -- I SAID, MARK, THEY ARE KILLING ME. THEY WANT NOTHING BUT CASH. BIG PHARMA, THEY CALL IT THAT FOR A REASON. THERE IS STILL ONE THAT GIVES POLITICIANS A MORE THAN BIG PHARMA. NOT EVEN CLOSE. I SAID, IF YOU WILL NOT NEGOTIATE A FAIR DEAL THEN WE WILL GO TO THE BIGGEST GUYS. THEY SAID DON'T DO THAT. YOU KNOW -- WE HAVE COUNTRIES OUT THERE THAT ARE PAYING A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT OUR PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO PAY. IF YOU HAVE A COUNTRY LIKE GERMANY OR ANY OTHER, AND THEY MAKE -- EITHER WAY -- THE UK -- ALL OF EUROPE, CANADA PAYS 50 PERCENT. 50 PERCENT LESS. PEOPLE LEAVE OUR COUNTRY, AND THEN THEY COME BACK HOME. THIS IS THE BENEFIT. REBATE, INSTEAD OF MONEY GOING TO THE MIDDLEMAN, IT WOULD BE THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THEY GET SO MUCH, THEY GET MORE THAN FRANKLY THE DRUG COMPANIES. NOW IT GOES TO PEOPLE, AND I INSTITUTED A FAVORITE NATION CHIP. IT IS SIMPLE, YOU HAVE THE IDEAL. WHATEVER THE LOWEST PRICE AND THE WORLD, WE ARE THE BIGGEST PURCHASER OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE WORLD BY FAR. WHATEVER THE LOWEST PRICE IS, THAT OTHER COUNTRIES PAY -- ANY OTHER COUNTRY PAYING $.10 PER PILL, AND WE PAY $2.50, IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION. BELIEVE ME. BUT HAPPENS IS THAT THAT DOES NOT WORK, SO THEY WILL GO UP, AND WE WILL COME DOWN. FAVORITE NATION'S , I WANT TO PAY THE LOWEST PRICE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WE WANT THE FAVORITE NATION'S -- THEY HAD A HEART ATTACK. I SIGNED IT. THEY DID NOT BELIEVE ME. THEY HAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ADS, AND -- SAYING I BELIEVE IN SOCIALISM. THE SOCIALISTS, SOME OF THE SOCIALIST COUNTRIES GET THE LOWEST PRICE. THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE WITH SOCIALISM IS I WANT THEIR PRICE. THAT IS THE ONLY THING. OTHER THAN THAT, OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. YOU CAN GET CUT, YOU CAN GET CUT. USA, USA, USA!  YOU COULD GET CUT 50, 60, OR 70 PERCENT. MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN LESS THAN THAT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES. WOULDN'T IT TO BE A KICK IN THE [NULL]? IF A LOST AND SLEEPY JOE AS PRESIDENT, I AM THIS THING KICKS IN, SOON, 30 OR 40 DAYS, PEOPLE WAKE UP WITHOUT THE ELECTION, BIDEN HAS DONE A GREAT JOB. WHAT A GREAT PRESIDENT -- LADY JOE WOULD SAY I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT FAVORITE NATIONS. NO ONE HAD THE GUTS TO DO IT. I WAS TOLD BY POLITICIANS, DON'T DO IT. I SAID WHY? I KNOW WHY. YOU NOW. THEY ARE POLITICIANS AND THEY HAVE BEEN HELPED OUT, AND WE WOULD HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT TOO. YOUR NUMBERS WILL COME DOWN, AND I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THAT. AND NO ONE BUT ME -- WILL EVER SAY IT. THE OTHER THING THAT I HAVE DONE, ASIDE FROM VERY STRONGLY DETECTING YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, WHICH WAS NOT EASY -- IT WAS NOT EASY. BY THE WAY, THEY WILL TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY I SURE AS YOU ARE STANDING OR SITTING THERE. IT WILL TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY. EITHER THAT OR OBLITERATE THE SECOND AMENDMENT AREA THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS WHEN YOU LOOK AT PORTLAND, AND YOU SEE HOW WEAK THE DEMOCRATS ARE. THE GOVERNOR, THE MAYOR, HOW PATHETIC. THEY WRITE EVERY NIGHT. WE ARE SAYING LET US COME IN AND SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS. WE WILL SOLID FOR YOU AND ONE HOUR, LIKE WE DID IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA. FIVE OR SIX NIGHTS. LET US COME IN. WE WILL SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM. THEY ARE USED TO IT. THIS IS THE WAY THE WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD BE IF YOU LET SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN. THIS IS THE WAY OUR WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD BE. WE PROTECTED YOUR PRE- EXISTING CONDITIONS VERY STRONGLY. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT. WE GOT RID OF THE HORRIBLE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE THAT COST EVERYONE A FORTUNE. EVERY REPUBLICAN IS SWORN TO PROTECTING YOUR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU WILL NOT HEAR THAT TERM.  WE PASSED ACCOUNTABILITY, AND BE A CHOICE. WE MOBILIZED THE LARGEST RESPONSES SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR. WE ARE DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB WITH THE CHINA VIRUS. I WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT. WILL ANYBODY BE LISTENING ON THURSDAY NIGHT? JUST VERY QUICKLY, IN THE SECOND TERM AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS, WE WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR MILITARY. WE BUILT THE STRONGEST MILITARY BY FAR. IT WAS DEPLETED. IT WAS DEPLETED LIKE YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE. WE HAVE THE BEST JETS AND ROCKETS AND EQUIPMENT AT ANY TIME. TANKS WERE MADE IN OHIO. TANKS MADE IN OHIO. I THINK USUALLY WITHIN THE FIRST 10 MONTHS, THEY WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES. ALL MY LIFE AS A POLITICIAN, YOU LIKE TO LOWER TAXES. THIS IS THE ONLY ELECTION WHERE THEY SAY WE WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES. THEY WILL QUADRUPLE YOUR TAXES. THERE ARE ALL OF THESE PROJECTS, THEY WILL NOT GET BUILT. THEY WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES. THEY WILL RAISE YOUR REGULATIONS. THEY WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD A HIGHWAY. A LONG TIME, IN SOME CASES TO GET APPROVAL TO GET A HIGHWAY, RIGHT? IT MAY GET REJECTED, AND WE WILL KNOW QUICKLY. WE WILL NOT TAKE 17 YEARS FOR THE HIGHWAYS. THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD. SOME OF THEM GO IN CIRCLES, THEY -- LET'S BEEN 37 MILLION. A LOOK. YOU HAVE TO BE SMART. YOU HAVE TO BE SMART AND WIN THE ELECTION. ALSO, CREATE TAX CREDITS FOR COMPANIES THAT BRING OUR JOBS BACK FROM CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AND THOSE TARIFFS ON COUNTRIES THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US FOR YEARS AND YEARS. I HAVE DONE IT. WE HAVE COUNTRIES THAT TERRIFY US AND WE DON'T TARIFF THEM. IT IS SIMPLE. IT IS CALLED RECIPROCAL. THEY TARIFF US, WE TARIFF THEN. WE ARE GOING TO FULLY FUND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HIRE MORE POLICE. WE ARE GOING TO GO WITH SCHOOL CHOICE. WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON SCHOOL CHOICE. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES -- THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING BETTER, DO NOT FORGET, IT WAS US TOGETHER THAT GOD CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM DONE. THE GREATEST THING FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY. AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES CAME, AND THEY SAID WE CANNOT BELIEVE IT, OBAMA DID NOT EVEN TRY. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT I GOT FUNDED BY HISTORICALLY BLACK A COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY. I GOT BEEN FUNDED. THEY WERE NOT FUNDED. THEY WERE FOUR YEARS -- THEY DID NOT KNOW IF THEY WOULD BE AROUND FOR A YEAR. THEY CAME INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND I SAID, WHY DO YOU GUYS KEEP COMING BACK? YOU HAVE TO COME BACK EVERY YEAR. WE HAVE THE LOW TERM FINANCING AND LONG-TERM FUNDING. NO ONE HAS DONE MORE FOR THE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY, NOBODY. NO ONE HAS DONE MORE FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER DONE AS MUCH AS ANYONE -- I SAY IT, SINCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. A CRIMINAL U.S. REFORM, OPPORTUNITIES WITH TIM SCOTT OF SOUTH CAROLINA. HE IS A GREAT SENATOR AND A GREAT GENTLEMAN. TIM SCOTT IS FANTASTIC. THINK OF IT. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, OPPORTUNITIES SICK, UNIVERSITIES -- WHAT WE HAVE DONE, IT HAS BEEN AMAZING. PRIOR TO THE VIRUS, THE GREATEST JOB NUMBERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY, AND THE AGING COMMUNITY -- I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. WE WILL GET RID OF THE SANCTUARY CITIES AS SOON AS WE CAN, SO THAT THEY CANNOT PROTECT THEM. NASA HAD TO CRASH GOING THROUGH THE WORD. IT HAD GRASS GROWING THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE RUNWAY. IT WAS A DISASTER. NOW IT IS THE NUMBER ONE SPACE CENTER ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. YOU SAW THOSE SHIPS GOING UP. A LOT OF RICH PEOPLE LIKE ROCKETS GOING UP. WE SAY LET'S LEASE THEM ARE BEAUTIFUL LAUNCHING AREAS AND SEND THE ROCKETS AND LET THEM PAY FOR IT. WE WILL LAND ON MARS. WE WILL GO INTO MARS AND WE WILL BE THE FIRST. I JUST WANT TO AGAIN, I WANT TO THINK -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. YOU ARE INCREDIBLE LAWYERS AND YOU HAVE INCREDIBLE STRENGTH. YOU HAVE UNBELIEVABLE INTELLIGENCE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GREATER, THE INTELLIGENCE OR THE PATIENT'S , BUT LET'S ASSUME IT IS THE INTELLIGENCE. WE HAVE THE GREATEST THE BASE OF SUPPORT ANYWHERE, AT ANY TIME, AND ELECTION, AND PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO FIND OUT. THEY FOUND IT OUT IN 2016. I WILL BE HONEST. THIS ELECTION, WE HAVE A FAR GREATER ENTHUSIASM IN THE SELECTION, THEN WE HAVE A LEVEL THAT WAS A RECORD. THEY SAID, WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE COMING FROM? RIGHT AMERICANS HAD NEVER VOTED. THEY DID NOT LIKE WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WILL NEVER FORGET, CONGRESSMAN FROM TENNESSEE CAME UP AND THEY DID EARLY VOTING. THEY SAID IT, PENNSYLVANIA IS MAKING A SPEECH. HE SAID, SIR, I DON'T KNOW I CANNOT SPEAK FOR ANYBODY BUT I AM FROM TENNESSEE AND I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. PEOPLE COME FROM THE VALLEYS AND THE HILLTOPS. THEY'RE COMING FROM ALL OVER, THEY ARE COMING OUT OF THE RIVERS, THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL FIELDS THAT WE HAVE, THEY ARE COMING FROM EVERYWHERE. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. IF OTHER STATES ARE LIKE TENNESSEE, YOU WILL WIN THIS ELECTION. SHE IS THE FIRST ONE. THEY CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS, THEY CAME FROM EVERYWHERE. HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. PEOPLE THAT HAD THE TRUMP HATS, THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE NEVER POLITICAL PEOPLE. THEY NEVER WERE A PIN IN THEIR LIFE. IT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE FOR ME. INCREDIBLE. I TELL YOU WHAT, NEXT YEAR IT WILL BE INCREDIBLE. IT WILL BE A GREAT YEAR. IT WILL BE A YEAR OF TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. WE ARE FIGHTING OFF FAVORABLE THING THAT WAS DELIVERED TO US BY CHINA. IT WAS BY CHINA AND WE WILL NEVER FORGET IT. I LET THEM NOW, WE WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY DID. WE WILL DO GREAT THINGS ECONOMICALLY.  WE WILL DO BETTER ECONOMICALLY THAN WE DID LAST YEAR, WE CAN NEVER FORGET THE 175,000 PEOPLE, REMEMBER THIS. WE SAVED MILLIONS. IF WE DID NOT MOVE, IF I DID NOT PUT THE BAN ON HIGHLY INFECTED PEOPLE COMING TO OUR NATION, FROM CHINA, THAT EVERYONE TOLD ME NOT TO DO -- MONTHS LATER, THEY ALL EITHER APOLOGIZED OR HAD ADMITTED THAT IT WAS RIGHT. EUROPE, I SAID IF WE DID NOT DO THAT THAT OUR NUMBERS WOULD BE AT A LEVEL THAT IS LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BELIEVE. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THIS INCREDIBLE SUPPORT. BE VERY CAREFUL. BE VERY CAREFUL. THIS IS GOING TO BE -- THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. DO NOT LET THEM TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME. DON'T LET THEM TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME. NORTH CAROLINA, WE LOVE YOU. THAT IS WHY I'M HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. I HAVE ARTICLES THAT I CAN SHOW YOU, THAT I'VE ASKED TO HAVE VOTING MACHINES WERE CONNECTED AND BROUGHT BACK ONLINE. THEY HAVE BEEN TOO SCARED TO COME FORWARD TO SAY SO. YOU INDICATED THAT IT IS LOCAL LEADERSHIP. I URGE YOU SAY THAT IT IS NOT YOUR JOB TO DECIDE WHETHER THE SORTING MACHINES ARE BROUGHT ONLINE OR NOT. SOMEONE NEEDS TO MUTE MADAM CHAIR. PLEASE MUTE YOURSELF. PLEASE MUTE. DEBBIE I NEED AN ADDITIONAL 30 SECONDS ADDED BACK ONTO MY TIME PLEASE. YOU HAVE SUDDENLY HEARING IT IS NOT YOUR JOB TO A DECISION ABOUT SORTING MACHINES, AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE ALSO SAID THAT HE WILL NOT BRING THEM BACK ONLINE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT NEEDED. YOU CANNOT BE BOTH. MY LOCAL HANDLERS WHO WORK WITH SORTING MACHINES EARLY -- THIS SPECIFIC BARCODE SORTING MACHINE SHOWED ME THAT IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO PLUG IT BACK IN. HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO RECONNECT TO THE MACHINES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DESTROYED? FOR EXAMPLE, ON DISPLAY, IF WE CAN BRING THAT UP ON THE SCREEN, I WAS SENT A PHOTO FROM A PROCESSING DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN FLORIDA WITH A POWER CORD IS HANGING FROM THE CEILING, AND NOT PLUGGED IN. MY LOCAL HANDLER IS TELLING ME THAT THE SORTING MACHINE REGULARLY ON THIS IS THAT SPECIFIC MACHINE SPECIFICALLY WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO PLUG BACK IN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE LOCAL HANDLERS JOB, TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED A SEWING MACHINE, WILL YOU LET THEM PLUG THE MACHINE BACK IN AND BRING THEM BACK ONLINE, AND ORDER THAT WE CAN GET THE MAIL OUT ON TIME, WHICH HAS GOTTEN WORSE SINCE YOUR ARRIVAL? THE CHAIRWOMAN'S TIME IS EXPIRED, THE ANSWER IS REQUESTED. THAT WAS A LONG LIST OF ACCUSATIONS. I WANT A SIMPLE ANSWER, AS TO WHETHER OR NOT -- TO BE IS IT MY TIME? IT IS ALWAYS MY TIME. I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION. WE HAVE MANAGEMENT TEAMS -- THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING DECISIONS. THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT MACHINES THEY USE AND WHAT THEY DON'T USE. IT IS DECIDED LOCALLY? HE HAS NOT TOLD US THE TRUTH IN THIS HEARING. HER TIME HAS EXPIRED. HER TIME HAS EXPIRED. CONGRESSMAN HIGGINS, YOU ARE NOW RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. THAT WAS QUITE A DEBACLE. THIS IS -- THIS IS EXACTLY WHY AMERICA DOES NOT TRUST CONGRESS. OUR CITIES ARE ON FIRE. THE CHINESE HAVE CROSSED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WITH A VIRUS. THE DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT A MAILBOX CONSPIRACY THEORY. POSTMASTER GENERAL, ARE YOU AWARE OF EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT IS SUPPORTING A MAIL DELIVERY CONSPIRACY? NO, SIR. THE QUESTION IS, AMERICA NEEDS TO HEAR THIS, ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF A MAILBOX, OR MAIL DELIVERY CONSPIRACIES? I AM NOT, SIR.  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY, LET ME ASK YOU, ARE YOU HERE ON SUBPOENA WERE VOLUNTARILY? VOLUNTARILY. YOU'RE A BETTER MAN THAN ME. ATTEMPT AFTER ATTEMPT BY MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE OFFICE, THEY TRIED TO ASSASSINATE HER CHARACTER. MIGHT I SUGGEST, AS AN AMERICAN PATRIOT, AND A CONSTITUTIONALIST, IF I WAS NOT YOU, I WOULD NOT HAVE FARED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE, FOR THE FUTURE. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CHARACTER, FOR BEING HERE VOLUNTARILY. SUBMIT YOURSELF FOR THIS HARASSMENT. I WILL BE 59 YEARS OF AGE TODAY. I CANNOT REMEMBER A TIME, WHEN THE POSTAL SERVICE WAS NOT IN SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL TROUBLE, TO REMEMBER SOME SORT OF ERROR THAT I AM NOT RECALLING, THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE WAS SQUARED AWAY, AND OPERATING WITHIN BUDGET, AND WAS NEVER IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE? IN THE LATE 90s AND EARLY 2000, WITHIN TWO YEARS, IT WAS COVERING ITS COSTS. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SIR. THANK YOU SIR, THAT IS KIND OF YOU. I RECALLED A SAYING, OUT OF THE LAST 40 OR 50 YEARS, THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE THERE WAS DESCRIBED AS FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND THE POSTAL OFFICE, DEDICATED MEN AND WOMEN, BUT THE FACT IS THAT THESE ARE LEGENDARY WITHIN THE POSTAL SERVICE. LET ME ASK YOU FOLKS, WHY DID YOU ACCEPT THIS JOB? CAN YOU TELL AMERICA WHY YOU TOOK THIS JOB? SIR, I HAVE CERTAIN EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE, BUSINESSWISE, WITH LARGE PROJECTS AND, LARGE BUSINESS PROJECTS. WE GET YOU QUALIFY. WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOUR HEART, WHY DID YOU ACCEPT THIS JOB? THIS INCREDIBLE BURDEN TO SERVE YOUR GOVERNMENT, YOUR NATION IN THIS WAY. I HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN MY COMMUNITY, AND IN THE COUNTRY. MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS ASKED OF ME, TO PARTICIPATE IN, THAT I COULD THINK I COULD HELP FIX, AND THAT IS WHY I TOOK IT. FROM THIS AMERICAN, AND FROM MY CONSTITUENTS, THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR, FOR TAKING ON THIS BURDEN, AND THIS TASK. NEXT WEEK, THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WILL HAVE A HEARING, AND SUGGEST THAT SMOKING CIGARETTES WILL CAUSE CANCER. SUING AMERICA DID NOT KNOW THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE IS GOING THROUGH MODERNIZATION EFFORTS, ATTEMPTS TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT, AND STRUGGLES TO BECOME SOLVENT INTO THE FUTURE. YOU HANDLE A LOT OF MAIL. DO YOU NOT? I HAVE ONE QUESTION. YOU HAVE 471 -- CANNOT HANDLE THE MAIL OF THE ELECTION CYCLE, GIVEN THAT 150 MILLION AMERICANS ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. YOUR AVERAGE MAIL DELIVERY IS 471 MILLION A DAY. CAN YOU HANDLE THE MAIL DELIVERY FOR THE ELECTION CYCLE? THE ORGANIZATION IS COMMITTED TO DELIVERING THE ELECTION NOW COME BY AND WE WILL DO IT. I LOVE TO HEAR THAT. THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF AMERICA, FOR THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED BY MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE. MADAM CHAIR, I YELLED BACK. CONGRESSMAN, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, POSTMASTER FOR BEING WITH US. I WILL BE CANDID, I DO NOT TRUST YOU RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS THAT I DON'T TRUST HER JUDGMENT OR DON'T TRUST YOUR MOTIVES. IF YOU THINK YOU COULD IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES THAT YOU DID, WITHOUT HAVING NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE SEEN, THEN I WORRY ABOUT YOUR JUDGMENT. IF YOU DO UNDERSTAND, THEN I AM CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR MOTIVE. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TODAY THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE TO US THAT YOUR JUDGMENT IS SOUND AND YOUR MOTIVES ARE PURE. YOU ARE A BUSINESSMAN. HERE AN EXPERT IN SUPPLY-CHAIN MANAGEMENT. THIS DETAILS ALL KINDS OF MINIATURE, CORRECT? ON FRIDAY, YOU SAID AS WE HEAD INTO THE ELECTION SEASON, I WANT TO ENSURE THE COMMITTEE AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND THIS POSTAL SERVICE THAT WE ARE FULLY CAPABLE AND COMMITTED TO DELIVERING ELECTION MAIL SECURELY AND ON TIME. THIS SACRED DUTY AS A NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY. HE SAID IT AGAIN TODAY, THE IDEA OF GETTING THE MAIL TO PEOPLE SECURELY AND ON TIME, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE MAIL IN BALLOTS. WE HAVE HEARD THAT FROM OTHERS TODAY. WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT FREELY ADMITTING THAT HE IS OPPOSED TO USPS FUNDING. HE IS HOPING THAT A HOBBLED POSTAL SERVICE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE MAIL- IN OUTLETS, WITH THE GENERAL COUNSEL, WANTING 46 STATES THAT MAIL BALLOTS WILL NOT BE DELIVERED ON TIME. HAS YOU KNOW, THE SERVICE PRIORITIZES ELECTION MAIL, PUSHING IT OUT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE INCLUDING DAILY SWEEPS OF MAIL FACILITIES, FOR ANY ELECTION MAIL MIST AND PROCESSING. THE STAGING LOCALITIES HAVE BEEN LEFT WONDERING IF THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE AND WENT TO THE PRESIDENTS BROADSIDE AGAINST MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL MEET IN PRACTICE FOR THOSE EFFORTS. ON FRIDAY, AGAIN FOR THE SENATE COLLEAGUES, FIRST CLASS OR BETTER TREATMENT OF ELECTION MAIL WOULD NOT CHANGE, QUOTING YOU IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR PETERS, HE SAID YES SIR, WE ALL HAVE PROCEDURES THAT THAT ADVANCE ANY ELECTION MAIL, AND IN SOME CASES AHEAD OF FIRST-CLASS MAIL. I WILL NOTE THAT ON THE WEBSITE, THERE IS AN FAQ FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS THAT SAY THAT THEY SHOULD USE FIRST- CLASS MAIL OR A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE ELECTION MAIL, USING THE USPS MARKETING MAIL SERVICE RATE WILL SLOW DELIVERY TIMES AND MAY INCREASE THE RISK THAT VOTERS WILL NOT RECEIVE BALLOTS AND TIMED TO RETURN THEM BY MAIL. YOU ARE SAYING THAT THE POST OFFICE IS GOING TO HANDLE THIS ON A FIRST-CLASS BASIS. AT THE SAME TIME THE FAQ IS TELLING ELECTION OFFICIALS THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS, OR OTHERWISE, THE MARKETING MAIL SERVICE WILL COME IN SLOWLY. WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR COLLEAGUES, YOU SAID IT AGAIN TODAY. WE NEED SOMETHING IN WRITING, THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. A DETAILED ACCOUNTING OF HOW EXACTLY YOU ARE GOING TO EXECUTE ON YOUR PROMISES. THE LOGISTICS. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE WILLING FOR USPS TO MAKE A GOOD ON THESE WORDS. HOW IS USPS DESIGNING THE INTERFACE WITH ELECTION MAIL VENDORS, AND OTHERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET PRIORITY TREATMENT. WE NEED WRITTEN POLICIES AND DIRECTIVES, NOT JUST WORDS. I ASSUME YOU KNOW THAT USPS HAS OFFERED MEMORANDUMS OF POLICY, FOR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. I WAS LOOKING AT A BUNCH OF THESE, LAST NIGHT. I AM ASKING, CAN YOU COMMIT TODAY TO THE IMMEDIATE ISSUE FOR A FORMAL USPS POLICY THAT IS IN WRITING, GIVEN TEEING OFF DELIVERY OF ELECTION MAIL, TREATED AS FIRST- CLASS OR BETTER FOR THE 2020 GENERAL ELECTION? CAN YOU DO THAT FOR US? OUR PROCESS IS TO DO THAT PHYSICALLY. I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU FOR WHAT I CAN GET YOU IN WRITING. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT IN A MEMORANDUM SO WE CAN VERIFY THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU ARE MAKING. THESE ARE WHERE YOUR MOTIVES CAN BE SHOWN TO BE PURE. IF YOU CAN DO THAT, WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A PHYSICAL PROCESS THAT, WE COULD ADVANCE MAIL IN FRONT OF FIRST- CLASS, IT IS STILL NOT CALLED FIRST-CLASS MAIL.  I UNDERSTAND. I WANT TO SEE A MEMORANDUM THAT THE POST OFFICE AND THE PUBLIC, JUST SO WE CAN GET SOME CONFIDENCE. I AM RUNNING OUT OF TIME. WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO ISSUE THESE REPORTS. CAN YOU COMMIT TODAY THAT HE WILL GET DATA SPECIFIC EVIDENCE ON HOW THE EFFORTS REGARDING THE MAIL-IN BALLOTS ARE DOING AND DO THAT ON A PERIODIC BASIS, OR WEEKLY? COULD YOU DO THAT? WHAT I WILL DO, IS COMMIT TO GIVING THE COMMITTEE AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE SERVICE, AND, THERE WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. A THAT WOULD HELP DEMONSTRATE THE SACRED DUTIES. IF I CAN JUST ADD, THE LETTER THAT WENT OUT WAS NOT A WARNING, NOT AN INDICATION -- IT WAS US TRYING TO EDUCATE THE ELECTION OFFICIALS ON WHAT THE PROCESS WAS. THIS IS WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST WITH THE PANDEMIC. WE INCREASED THE CONTENT, BECAUSE VOTE BY MAIL WOULD BE HIGHER. REALLY, WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO 50,000 CONTACTS WITH STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS, AND THE REGIONAL AREAS AND THROUGH HEADQUARTERS, AND INTEGRATE THEIR PROCESS WITH OUR PROCESS.  THANK YOU, THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIRED. CONGRESSMAN GIBBS, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE -- CAN YOU HEAR ME? WE CAN HEAR YOU, AND WE CAN SEE YOU. OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THIS JOB. I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO TAKE THIS JOB. I KNOW YOU LOVE THE COUNTRY. YOU WANT THIS COUNTRY TO BE BETTER UNTIL PEOPLE. YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO DO YOUR JOB. YOU WERE HIRED FOR GOVERNORS, DID YOU HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT, ON WHAT TO DO? WHAT YOU SHOULD DO? I NEVER SPOKE ABOUT GETTING THE POSITION. I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO HIM REGARDING THE POSTAL SERVICE. TO DO THIS JOB, BEING MORE COST-EFFICIENT, AND MAKE CHANGES, OBVIOUSLY, GETTING OUT OF THE RED IS IMPORTANT. THE CATEGORY HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE MAKING CHANGES, FOR CROSS EFFICIENCY, WE HAVE A LOT OF DISCUSS ABOUT THESE MACHINES. IS IT TRUE TO SAY THAT THE MAIL VOLUME, WITH THE ADDITIONAL CENSUS, IT IS HIGHER AND MAIL TIME THAN ANYTHING ELSE. BUT THERE BE ENOUGH VOTING MACHINES TO DO THIS? JUST BY THE CHANGES THAT YOU ARE MAKING? YES, WE WILL HAVE SORTING CAPACITY. OKAY. SOME OF THE OTHER DELAYS -- COVID-19. THE RATE AND THE POSTAL SERVICE. I SAW AN ARTICLE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, THE POSTAL SERVICE TOOK A POLICY, TALKING ABOUT TEMPERATURE TAKING. THAT MAKES SENSE. ARE WE HAVING TROUBLE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS, WITH DRIVERS AND MAILMEN -- ARE THERE SHORTAGES OF PERSONNEL? ACROSS THE COUNTRY, OUR EMPLOYEE AVAILABILITY IS DOWN. IT IS DOWN BY THREE OR FOUR PERCENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE ISSUE IS THAT SOME OF THE HOTSPOTS -- THE HOTSPOTS AND THE COUNTRY, LIKE PHILADELPHIA, DETROIT, THE AVERAGES COME DOWN, THEY COULD BE DOWN 20 PERCENT. THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE ADDING. YOU HAVE CHALLENGES, I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR WORKERS ARE HONEST PUBLIC SERVANTS. AND THE 2016 CAMPAIGN, WITH HILLARY CLINTON, CONSIDERING THE MAIL-IN BALLOTS WHAT STEPS CAN THE POST OFFICE TAKE TO ENSURE THAT POLITICAL BIAS IS NOT FACTORED IN?  I HAVE NOT REVIEWED THE REPORT, BUT I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE IN THE 650,000 MEN AND WOMEN AND THE POSTAL SERVICE AND, THEY WILL HANDLE THE ELECTION MAIL, SAFELY AND SECURELY. LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO THINGS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T. WE HAVE THE INSPECTION SERVICE AND THE MANAGEMENT TEAM THAT IS LOOKING FOR THAT SORT OF THING. I HAVE FAITH THAT WE WILL DELIVER. I APPRECIATE THAT. FOR THE TUESDAY ELECTION, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD DO THAT. WITH REGARD, IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS ABOUT THE STATE OFFICIALS, TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC, WE SENT A LETTER OUT TO EVERY AMERICAN AGAIN. WE WILL DESCRIBE THE PARTICIPATION IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. REQUEST THE BALLOT EARLY. WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO THOSE LAST DAYS, THOSE LAST DAYS, WE WILL HAVE VARIOUS PROCEDURES. I HAVE HEARD STORIES OF THE POSTAL MANAGERS RUNNING BALLOTS OVER TO THE ELECTION BOARD. WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY BALLOT GETS THREATENING . CONGRESSMAN MOUSE, YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WANT TO THINK POSTMASTER GENERAL TO JOY. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, MR. DUNCAN FOR PATIENTS. HAS BOTH OF YOU NOW, IT WAS PRESIDENT NIXON, TO GUARANTEE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE POST OFFICE. THE POSTAL SERVICE WEBSITE IS HISTORY. SPEAK TO THAT, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A MOVE -- MOVING THE POSTAL SERVICE FROM POLITICS. I ASSUME THAT BOTH OF YOU AGREE THAT THAT IS ESSENTIAL FROM THE POST OFFICE. ,, ,,,, I WOULD NEED TO CHECK THAT. THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT MAY -- HAD 29 PAIN, YOU WERE ANNOUNCED AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. IS THAT CORRECT? THAT IS A NOT- FOR-PROFIT FOUNDATION, BY THE SOLIDUS COMMITTEE, BIPARTISAN. JUNE 12, 2020, SHORTLY BEFORE HE TOOK OVER AS THE POSTMASTER GENERAL, CORRECT? I DID. FROM JANUARY TO APRIL OF THIS YEAR, BEFORE YOU ARE SELECTED AS THE POSTMASTER GENERAL, HE PROVIDED 18 CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE AMOUNT OF $650,000 FOR REPUBLICAN COMMITTEES. CORRECT? YOU SEEM TO HAVE SOMETHING IN FRONT OF YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. I GIVE A LOT OF MONEY TO REPUBLICANS. RIGHT. LET ME ASK AN OBVIOUS QUESTION. YOU ARE A BIG SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. HOW DO YOU SQUARE BEING A MAJOR SUPPORTER OF THE PRESIDENT, AND GETTING THE INDEPENDENCE THAT IS REQUIRED OF THE POSTMASTER GENERAL -- COULD YOU DO BOTH? ABSOLUTELY. YOU ARE AWARE OF THE FACT, THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE VERY HOSTILE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE POSTAL SERVICE. HE CALLED THE POSTAL SERVICE A JOKE. I ASSUME THAT YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT? I DO. HE IS ALSO VEHEMENTLY AND REPEATEDLY ATTACKED NOW IN VOTING, SAYING -- MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL LEAD TO MASSIVE ELECTORAL FRAUD IN THE 2020 ELECTION. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? I AM IN CHARGE OF DELIVERING BALLOTS, I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT ON -- THAT IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY. IS IT YOUR VIEW, THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE? THE FRAUD -- IT IS OUR INTENT TO NOT HAVE ANY FRAUD WITHIN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE. YES. IF THE MAIL IS NOT DELIVERED ON TIME, AND REPUBLICANS AND TO DEMOCRATS WHO DO VOTE BY MAIL DO NOT HAVE A TIMELY DELIVERY OF THE PALLET TO THEIR CLERK, THE RESULTS WOULD BE THAT THEY ARE DISENFRANCHISED, IS THAT CORRECT? THE MAIL WILL BE DELIVERED ON TIME. WE EFFORT THAT YOU HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT REFORMS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE POSTAL SERVICE. IT HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT DELAYS. THOSE DELAYS COINCIDE WITH THE ELECTION. YOU HAVE APOLOGIZED FOR THAT. IT IS NOT JUST THE POSTAL BOXES. THE MAIL SORTING MACHINES THAT YOU HEARD FROM CONGRESSMAN COOPER, AND THE REQUIREMENTS -- THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIRED, THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIRED BUT HE MAY ANSWER THE QUESTION. THANK YOU CONGRESSMAN. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COLLECTION BOXES, OR THE SORTING MACHINES OR THE POSTAL HOURS, OR THE MEETING OVER TIME. THE CHANGE THAT I HAD MADE WAS ASKING THE TEAM TO RUN THE TRUCKS, THE TRANSPORTATION ON TIME, AND MITIGATE EXTRA TRIPS. IT IS BASED ON AN OIG AUDIT, THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE WERE SPENDING. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE WERE SPENDING AND THE AMOUNT OF PLAY TRIPS AND EXTRA TRIPS THAT WE WERE RUNNING. IT WAS A PLAN TO DO ALL OF THAT WITH OPERATIONS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ADD THAT NETWORK. A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKED, WHY DO TRUCKS MATTER? WHY DO I TIME TRUCKS MATTER? IT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF HOW THE ENTIRE MALE NETWORK IS PUT TOGETHER. IF THE TRUCKS DO NOT RUN ON TIME, THEN THE MAIL CARRIERS CANNOT LEAVE ON TIME. THEY ARE OUT THERE AT NIGHT. THEY HAVE TO COME BACK AND GET MY MAIL. THE COLLECTION PROCESS IS DELAYED. THE PLANT PROCESS IS DISTORTED. I CAN SEE SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS IN POTENTIAL SAVINGS, IN GETTING THE SYSTEM TO SIMPLY CONNECT PROPERLY. THAT IS WHY WE WENT OUT AND PUT A PLAN TOGETHER, TO GET THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIC PRINCIPLE, RUN YOUR TRUCKS ON TIME. I FIND IT REALLY -- I WOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO REVERSE THAT. IF I SAY, DO NOT RUN THE TRUCKS ON TIME, IS NOT THE ANSWER THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO GET TO SAY HERE TONIGHT? GENTLEMEN, THE TIME HAS EXPIRED. WE RECOGNIZE OUR CONGRESSMAN, YOU ARE NOW RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU, MADAM CHAIR. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE POSTMASTER GENERAL, LOUIS DEJOY FOR BEING HERE TODAY. TRAN25 [ NO AUDIO ] OF PRESIDE. NOW THEIR TEENAGE DAUGHTER WANTS HER FREEDOM AFTER THE POSTS HAVE GONE VIRAL. ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S MOST FIERCE DEFENDERS ANNOUNCING SHE'S STEPPING DOWN JUST HOURS BEFORE THE CONVENTION IS SET TO KICK OFF. KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING SHE'S LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE AT THE END OF THE MONTH AFTER HIGH-PROFILE FAMILY DRAMA.  HOW MUCH DID YOUR FAMILY AFFECT YOUR POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS VIEWS CHECK?  Reporter: HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER CLAUDIA WHO MADE HEADLINES FOR SHARING HER LIBERAL VIEWS ON TIKTOK NOW TWEETING OVER THE WEEKEND, I'M OFFICIALLY PUSHING FOR EMANCIPATION. BUCKLE UP BECAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE PUBLIC ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, UNFORTUNATELY. LAST MONTH GOING AS FAR AS ASKING ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ TO ADOPT HER. CONWAY ANNOUNCING HER PLANS TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE IN A STATEMENT LATE SUNDAY CALLING HER TIME IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HEADY AND HUMBLING. EXPLAINING THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND GEORGE ARE MAKING THE DECISION BASED ON WHAT THEY THINK IS BEST FOR THEIR FOUR CHILDREN. GEORGE CONWAY A CONSERVATIVE LAWYER HAS REPEATEDLY GONE AFTER THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE'S MENTALLY UNFIT TO SERVE OFFICE WITH THE PRESIDENT IN TURN CALLING HIM A HUSBAND FROM HELL. GEORGE CONWAY IS ALSO STEPPING BACK FROM HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE LINCOLN PROJECT. A GROUP OF REPUBLICANS LOOKING TO DEFEAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IN NOVEMBER.  HE'S NEVER BEEN ON OUR SIDE. NEVER WILL BE.  Reporter: AS FOR KELLY AN CONWAY WHO MADE A NAME FOR HERSELF DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT.  HE MEANT TO SAY IT WAS EMBARRASSING, IT WAS WRONG. SEAN SPICER OUR PRESS SECRETARY GAVE ALTERNATIVE FACTS TO THAT. WAIT A MINUTE. ALTERNATIVE FACTS?  Reporter: THE MOTHER OF FOUR SAYING SHE WILL ANNOUNCE HER FUTURE PLANS IN TIME, BUT FOR NOW HER FOCUS IS TURNING TO HER FAMILY SAYING IT'LL BE LESS DRAMA, MORE MAMA.  BUT HALLIE, SHE WAS EXPECTED TO SPEAK AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION THIS WEEK. IS THAT STILL ON?  Reporter: YEAH, IT IS. SHE IS STILL SET TO DELIVER THAT ADDRESS WEDNESDAY EVENING AT THE RNC. SHE'LL TRANSITION OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT A WEEK LATER. WITH HER KIDS ALL SCHOOL AGE, ALL OF THEM STARTING A NEW SCHOOL YEAR VIRTUALLY, THAT WHOLE SCHOOL FROM HOME THING IS SOMETHINGANY COMPANIES ARE SAYI WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT LIKE THIS UNTIL IT'S SAFE TO RETURN. IT MAY BE THE BIGGEST, FASTEST TRANSFORMATION TO HIT THE AMERICAN OFFICE SINCE -- HERE ARE THE NEW RULES. EARTH TONES ONLY. ALSO, WOMEN ARE FORBIDDEN TO WEAR PANTS.  Reporter: SINCE DWIGHT CHANGED THE CASUAL FRIDAYS RULES. EVERY DAY IS CASUAL AS TENS OF MILLIONS OF US WORK FROM HOME WHILE OFFICES SIT LARGELY EMPTY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT AMAZON WHOSE BUSINESS HAS EXPLODED WITH ALL OF US SHOPPING ONLINE ACTUALLY WANTS TO GET BACK TO THE OFFICE. SO THIS WORKS -- ZOOM WORKS, SKYPE WORKS, BUT YOU LOSE SOMETHING IN THE PROCESS. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU REALLY LOSE THAT -- WHAT WE LOSE ARE THE SPONTANEOUS CONNECTIONS. YOU KNOW, THREE PEOPLE WALK BY THAT MAY NOT WORK ON MY FLOOR, FOR EXAMPLE, BUT I CAN GET QUICK ANSWERS OR SOLVE PROBLEMS OR DELIVER INFORMATION TO THEM WITHOUT SCHEDULING A ZOOM MEETING.  Reporter: SO AMAZON IS EXPANDING HUBS IN SIX CITIES. NEW YORK, PHOENIX, SAN DIEGO, DENVER, DETROIT, AND DALLAS. AND HIRING THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL WORKERS. EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF COMPANIES SAY WORKING FROM HOME IS WORKING SO WELL,TURNED TO SOME OF THE O ABANDONED IN MARCH. YELLOWED NEWSPAPERS, DEAD PLANTS, AND CANS OF DISINFECTANT. A THOUSAND SURVEYED BY "THE TIMES," 86% SAID THEY'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING FROM HOME. EVEN WHEN THAT MEANS JUGGLING FAMILY DISTRACTIONS.  IN FACT, THEY WERE FEELING AS PRODUCTIVE. THEY WERE IN SOME CASES, YOU KNOW, STRUGGLING TO BALANCE PARTICULARLY IF THEY HAD KIDS WORK AND HOME LIFE. BUT OVERALL REALLY FELT MORE SATISFIED.  Reporter: OF COURSE MANY PEOPLE CAN'T WORK FROM HOME. FROM HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO RETAIL AND WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES, TRUCK DRIVERS, AIRLINE WORKERS, POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS, MILLIONS MUST GO TO WORK RISKING COVID EXPOSURE. BUT FEWER OFFICE WORKERS HAS MEANT FEWER CARS ON THE ROADS, LESS POLLUTION, AND MORE FAMILY TIME. THOUGH EXPERTS CAUTION, IT'S IMPORTANT TO SET BOUNDARIES.  JUST BECAUSE YOUR OFFICE IS TEN FEET AWAY RATHER THAN TEN MILES AWAY DOESN'T MEAN YOU GO TO YOUR OFFICE ALL THE TIME, RIGHT? AND MAKING SURE YOU'RE SETTING UP BARRIERS.  Reporter: SET FAMILY RULES FOR WHEN MOM OR DAD CAN'T BE INTERRUPTED. AND INVEST IN HOME OFFICE UPGRADES IF IT'S LIKELY TO BE PERMANENT LIKE HIGH-SPEED INTERNET AND ERGONOMICALLY CORRECT CHAIR, PERHAPS NOISE ELIMINATING HEADPHONES. BACK TO "THE NEW YORK TIMES" SURVEY, ONE IN FIVE SAID THEY'RE REALLY NOT EAGER -- OR ONE IN FIVE SAID THEY ARE EAGER TO GET BACK TO WORK. BUT THAT'S IT. JUST ONE IN FIVE. A THIRD SAID IF I CAN WORK FROM ANYWHERE, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I'M GOING TO MOVE TO COLORADO, HAWAII, PARIS, AND WORK FROM HOME THERE.  CHARLOTTE HAD A NICE MOVE THERE.  SHE'S GOT A REAL FUTURE IN THIS THING. TOM, WITH MORE FOLKS WORKING FROM HOME AND WANTING MORE SPACE, I UNDERSTAND THAT SUBURBAN REAL ESTATE PRICES HAVE BEEN SOARING. HOW MUCH?  Reporter: YEAH. HOME SALES UP 25% JUST IN JULY. I'M LOOKING AT MY NOTES. 34% WERE FIRST-TIME BUYERS. A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVING OUT OF THE CITIES INTO SUBURBIA OR INTO SMALL TOWN AMERICA. HOME PRICES UP 8.5% IN JULY. AND GUESS WHAT, GUYS. THE HOTTEST REAL ESTATE CITY IN THE COUNTRY. CAN YOU GUESS IT?  NO.  CONNECTICUT?  Reporter: MY HOME STATE. COLORADO. COLORADO SPRINGS, THE HOTTEST REAL ESTATE MARKET IN THE COUNTRY.  I GET IT. BY THE WAY, TOM, NOW YOU'RE ON A WIDER SHOT, WE SEE YOU HAVE A GUITAR THERE. HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING UP FOLK MUSIC DURING YOUR WORK FROM HOME?  Reporter: BACK IN MY YOUTH, I PLAYED RELIGIOUSLY. NOW IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, JUST AN ORNAMENT.  I LOVE THAT.  WE' MICROWEDDINGS. WHAT IS THAT? THIS MORNING A PANDEMIC WEDDING 101. FROM PLANNING TO POSTPONING. SAYING I DO DURING A PANDEMIC HAS SPARKED SOME NEW TRENDS. COUPLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY SACRIFICING GRAND WEDDINGS FORGING AHEAD WITH MICROWEDDINGS, MINI MONIESS. AND STANDING CEREMONIES FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. WHILE MY NEEN MONIES HOLD JUST A FEW LOVED ONES. GUESTS COME AT DIFFERENT TIMES. ONE GROUP FOR THE CEREMONY, ANOTHER GROUP FOR THE COME TAIL HOUR, AND A FINAL FOR THE RECEPTION. THE KNOT.COM RECOMMENDS GREETING GUESTS WITH A WELCOME SPRITZ THAT CAPTURES THE CURRENT MOMENT. SO HAND SANITIZER MAY BE THE NEW WEDDING FAVOR?  I THINK WE COULD SAFELY SAY THAT HAND SANITIZER COULD BE THE NEW WEDDING FAVOR.  Reporter: FOR MANY COUPLES PLANNING THE SPECIAL CELEBRATION HAS TURNED INTO A SUDDEN SCRAMBLE.  WE HAVE TO DECIDE ARE WE STILL GOING TO GET MARRIED? ARE WE GOING TO POSTPONE IN. Reporter: BRIDES AND GROOMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TELL NBC NEWS GETTING HITCHED HAS HIT A COSTLY SNAG.  WE'RE AROUND $6500, ENTIRE DEPOSIT AT THE MOMENT. HAD TO GET AHOLD OF ALL VENDORS AND CANCEL OR RESCHEDULE.  CANCELLATION FEES WERE AROUND $22,000.  Reporter: THIS COUPLE FORCED TO CANCEL THREE TIMES.  EVERYTHING ON HOLD RIGHT NOW.  Reporter: EVEN STARS LIKE JENNIFER LOPEZ POSTPONED HER WEDDING.  I'M A LITTLE HEARTBROKEN BECAUSE WE DID HAVE SOME GREAT PLANS.  Reporter: 1 MILLION WEDDINGS NATIONWIDE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. IN A SURVEY, 59% OF COUPLES SAID THEY'RE POSTPONING OR CANCELING. BUT COUPLES SHOULDN'T LOSE HOPE.  OUR WORLD IS GOING TO RETURN TO NORMAL. AND SO WHETHER THAT'S SIX MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD OR A YEAR DOWN THE ROAD, WE DON'T KNOW. BUT WE ENCOURAGE ALL COUPLES TO POSTPONE. THIS IS A MOMENT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CELEBRATE.  Reporter: BUT POSTPONING A WEDDING CAN BE EXPENSIVE. TALK TO YOUR WEDDING PLANNER FIRST. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, CONTACT THE VENUE. THAT'S LIKELY YOU'RE BIGGEST EXPENSE. THEN CALL THE VENDORS IN ORDER OF WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU. MOST DEPOSITS ARE NONREFUNDABLE BUT TRY TO NEGOTIATE AND BE FLEXIBLE. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE WITH WORKING WITH VENDORS AND NEGOTIATING NEW RATES? BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE PRICES CHANGE.  THE PRICES DO CHANGE. REALLY SIT DOWN WITH YOUR VENDOR AND HAVE A CONVERSATION. THEY ARE IN THIS TOO. THEY'RE IN THIS WITH YOU. THEY ARE IMPACTED BY THIS AS WELL.  Reporter: SHE SAYS MANY COUPLES DELAYING TO NEXT YEAR WILL HAVE TO RESERVE THURSDAY, FRIDAY, OR EVEN MONDAY WEDDINGS.  WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF COUPLES PLAN MONDAY WEDDINGS BECAUSE IT BUMPS UP AGAINST A WEEKEND.  Reporter: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT, POST A VIRTUAL CEREMONY. HODA OFFICIATED THIS WEDDING BY THE POWER OF ZOOM.  I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU HUSBAND AND WIFE.  NOW, IF YOU ARE INVITED TO A WEDDING AND FEEL IT'S UNSAFE, DON'T GO. CORONAVIRUS IS PROBABLY THE BEST EXCUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FOR A LONG TIME. MANY COUPLES ARE ALSO OFFERING A VIRTUAL COMPONENT SO YOU CAN STILL CELEBRATE WITH THEM FROM THE SAFETY OF YOUR HOME.  I LOVE THIS STORY. YOU DID TALK TO A LOT OF COUPLES. THEY SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF GOOD ADVICE. ANYTHING ELSE?  IT'S PERSISTENCE AND FLEXIBILITY PAYS OFF. THEY HAD TO SPEND MONTHS NEGOTIATING OVER THE SUMMER BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET MANY VENDORS TO CHANGE THE DATE AND DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY A PENNY. THEY DID HAVE TO SWITCH FROM A SATURDAY TO A SUNDAY.  WE SAW MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING THESE ZOOM WEDDINGS. BUT THERE ARE THERE WAYS YOU CAN MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A WEDDING SO YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE JUST ON ANOTHER ZOOM CALL.  YES. JUST INSIST ON A DRESS CODE. ACT LIKE IT'S AN ACTUAL WEDDING. EVERYONE HAS A SPECIAL COCKTAIL FOR THEIR WEDDING. COAST. OUR SAM BROCK IS IN NEW ORLEANS TONIGHT.

SAM FOR RESIDENT'S SHELTER-IN-PLACE, WHAT ARE THEY SAYING FOR SHELTERING FOR SAYING FOR SHELTERING FOR STORMS? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. RESIDENTS WITHIN THE LEVEE SYSTEM ARE ENCOURAGED TO SHELTER-IN-PLACE, KEEP FIVE DAYS OF NONPERISHABLE FOOD ON HAND AND FIVE GALLONS OF WATER PER PERSON. GOOD NEWS, THE 99 DRAINAGE PUMPS THAT HISTORICALLY CAUSED PROBLEMS UP AND CARRYING WATER TO DOWNTOWN LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN WHERE I AM NOW. THANK YOU.

NEXT TWO DAYS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE THREAT TOMORROW, THAT IS MARCO IN SOUTHERN LOUISIANA. WE EXPECT CONDITIONS TO ARRIVE, DURING THE DAY. NEW ORLEANS WILL SEE THE WORST OF IT THROUGHOUT THE EARLY EVENING. NOW LET'S TURN OUR ATTENTION TO LAURA. THIS STORM AMAZINGLY SURVIVED HIGH MOUNTAINS OF HAITI AND DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. IT HAS TO DO WITH CUBA FOR THE NEXT DAY AND THEN OVER THE WARM WATERS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RAPIDLY INTENSIFY. BY THE TIME WE GET TO WEDNESDAY EVENING, WE COULD BE DEALING WITH A MAJOR HURRICANE ANYW THE MILITARY IS BEING CALLED UP TO HELP. STEVE PATTERSON ON THE FRONT LINES IN VACAVILLE, CALIFORNIA.  TONIGHT THE DESPERATE BATTLE OF FIRES WORKING AGAINST TIME. CREWS WITH THE LARGEST FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY, LOOMING FORECAST TODAY. FRESH RED FLAG WARNINGS AND ANOTHER PREDICTED BOUT OF DRY LIGHTNING STORMS. THE SAME CONDITIONS WERE IN PLACE EXACTLY ONE WEEK AGO. THOUSANDS OF LIGHTNING STRIKES AND HEAVY WINDS SPREAD FLAMES ACROSS THE STATE. THEY CAN CAUSE HAVOC ON THIS FIRE AND FIRES THROUGHOUT THE REGION 50 MILES AWAY. ANOTHER GRIM MILESTONE. FIRES TOTALLING 1.1 MILLION ACRES IN SIZE. A FIRE FOOTPRINT VISIBLE FROM SPACE. THE PRESIDENT SIGNING A DISASTER DECLARATION RELEASING FED AID TO HELP EXHAUSTED CREWS ON THE GROUND. NATIONAL GUARD AND MILITARY ARRIVING IN CALIFORNIA TO RELIEVE THE STRAIN ON FIREFIGHTERS. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE MONSTER PLANES DEVOURED HOMES, FORCED EVACUATION OF THOUSANDS.

IT A MAJOR ADVANCE AGAINST THE VIRUS. HERE IS KELLY O'DONNELL WITH LATE DETAILS. Reporter: ON THE EVE OF HIS CONVENTION.  I'M PLEASED TO MAKE A TRULY HISTORIC ANNOUNCEMENT.  Reporter: THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED A NEW STEP FOR A CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT. A TEMPORARY EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION FOR CONVALESCENT PLASMA TAKEN FROM RECOVERED PATIENT'S BLOOD FOR OTHERS HOSPITALIZED WITH COVID. THIS IS A POWERFUL THERAPY THAT TRANSFUSES VERY, VERY STRONG ANTIBODIES.  JOINED BY THE HEAD OF THE FDA, THIS DECISION COMES AFTER INTERNAL SCIENTIFIC DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE FDA HAD ENOUGH DATA AND AFTER THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED FDA STAFF ON TWITTER OF DELAYING ACTION UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HOLDUP BUT WE BROKE THE LOGJAM OVER THE LAST WEEK, IT'S MY OPINION, VERY STRONG OPINION, AND THAT'S FOR POLITICAL REASONS. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS. THIS HAS TO DO WITH LIFE AND DEATH. BY ADDING A RARE SUNDAY NIGHT NEWS CONFERENCE, THE PRESIDENT CAN TRY TO DISTRACT FROM THE NEGATIVE PORTRAIT REVEALED BY SECRET AUDIO RECORDINGS OF HIS OLDER SISTER RETIRED FEDERAL JUDGE MARYANNE TRUMP BARRY. DONALD IS FOR DONALD. REPORTED BY "WASHINGTON POST," NBC HAS ALSO OBTAINED SOME OF THE 15 HOURS OF RECORDINGS MADE IN 2018 AND 2019 BY TRUMP NIECE AND TELL-ALL AUTHOR MARY TRUMP. HE HAS NO PRINCIPLES. NONE. NONE. AND MY GOD, IF YOU'RE A RELIGIOUS PERSON, YOU WANT TO HELP PEOPLE, NOT DO THIS. WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MARK MEADOWS REACTED TO THE TRUMP FAMILY DRAMA. THIS IS POLITICS AS USUAL BY A NIECE THAT WAS WRITTEN OUT OF A WILL THAT WOULD APPARENTLY JUST HAS AN AXE TO GRIND BECAUSE SHE WANTS JOE BIDEN TO BE PRESIDENT. THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION BEGINS TOMORROW WITH THE PRESIDENT EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE ACROSS ALL FOUR NIGHTS. KATE.  KELLY O'DONNELL, THANK YOU. LET'S GET SOME MORE CONTEXT NOW ON THAT EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION FOR CONVALESCENT PLASMA TREATMENT. WE TURN TO OUR SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. JOHN TORRES. DR. JOHN, EARLIER THIS MONTH, DR. ANTHONY FAUCI ARGUED AGAINST RUSHING THIS TO PATIENTS. WHAT WERE HIS CONCERNS?  KATE, DR. FAUCI'S BIG CONCERN IS WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO KNOW IF CONVALESCENT PLASMA, RICH IN CORONAVIRUS ANTIBODIES ACTUALLY WORKS. ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION CITES EXAMPLES OF HOW IT SEEMS TO HELP SOME PATIENTS, WE'RE STILL WAITING ON CLINICAL TRIALS WHICH WE THEY'D TO PROVE ITS OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS.  IS THERE ANY DOWNSIDE TO GIVING PATIENTS THE PLASMA THIS WAY. RESEARCHERS DON'T BELIEVE PLASMA USE IS HARMFUL FOR MOST PATIENTS AND LIKELY HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS. BUT IT WILL BE HARDERSPORTS SOCCER ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SPREADING THE DISEASE. HERE'S BLAYNE ALEXANDER.  Reporter: TONIGHT A NEW WARNING FROM THE MAYOR OF DANBURY, CONNECTICUT. KIDS' COVID CASES ARE RISING A MAJOR CAUSE? YOUTH SOCCER AND SOFTBALL GAMES  SOCCER YOU'RE RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE FIELD. IF YOU'RE IN BASEBALL YOU'RE IN THE LEFT FIELD OR RIGHT FIELD OR WHATEVER. BUT WE THINK WE'VE TRACE TD DOWN TO WHEN THERE'S A CHANGEOVER AND TEAMS IN SOCCER YOU'RE ROTATING PLAYERS IN AND OUT, THERE IS A BENCH OR KIDS IN CLOSE CONTACT, YOU'RE NOT WEARING MASKS.  Reporter: THE MAYOR CANCELING SPORTS FOR THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN AS CASES THERE CONTINUE TO RISE FROM LITTLE LEAGUE TO THE PROS, WHERE THE NFL IS INVESTIGATING A SERIES OF POSITIVE TESTS STEMMING FROM A SINGLE NEW JERSEY LAB. THE CHICAGO BEARS HAD NINE PLAYERS AND STAFF TEST POSITIVE, ONLY TO LEARN LATER THEY WERE FALSE. CONFUSION OVER TESTS AS MORE SCHOOLS ARE RELYING ON THEM TO GET BACK TO CLASS. JUST TWO WEEKS AGO STUDENTS WERE MOVING IN AT GEORGIA TECH NOW AN OUTBREAK WITH CLASSES SET TO BEGIN TOMORROW 251 CASES INCLUDING MORE THAN A DOZEN AT A SINGLE FRATERNITY HOUSE NOW BEING USED AS AN ISOLATION AREA  HAVING IN-PERSON CLASSES THIS SEMESTER IS INHERENTLY RISKY.  Reporter: ALL OF IT LEAVING? ON CAMPUS SHAKEN  IT'S UNSAFE RIGHT NOW.  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE OPENED IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.  Reporter: GEORGIA TECH JOINS A GROWING LIST OF SCHOOLS? WITH IMAGES LIKE THESE, AS CAMPUSES SCRAMBLE TO CRACK DOWN AT BOSTON'S NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY A THREAT TO RESCIND ADMISSION FOR ANY STUDENT FOUND IN VIOLATION. TULANE ALSO ENFORCING STIFF PENALTIES FOR PARTIES WHILE REMAINING REALISTIC ABOUT CASES.  WE'RE A CITY, AND EVERY CITY HAS CASES WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIAGNOSE IT VERY QUICKLY AND CARE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS.  Reporter: AND IN NEW YORK A COURT ORDER STOPPED ONE COUPLE'S WEDDING. THE EXPECTED GUEST LIST, 175. THE STATE BANNED GATHERINGS LARGER THAN 50  WHY SHOULD THEY BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THIS WEDDING?  10,000 RESTAURANTS AND BARS ACROSS NEW YORK STATE AND LAWFULLY HAVE GATHERINGS IN EXCESS OF 50 PEOPLE  BLAYNE JOINS US LIVE FROM GEORGIA TECH BLAYNE, WHAT IS THE COLLEGE DOING THERE ABOUT THE OUTBREAK  Reporter: WELL, KATE, THEY ARE ISOLATING STUDENTS THEY'RE ALSO NOTIFYING ANY OF THE STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND GETTING THEM TESTED AT ONE OF THE FREE SITES HEER ON CAMPUS IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH NOTING FOR CONTEXT THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA SHUT DOWN IN-PERSON ONCE AGAIN WE TURN TO OUR SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. JOHN TORRES ON WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. IN TAMPA, FLORIDA, THIS K THROUGH 8 SCHOOL IS ADDING AN EXTRA LAYER OF PROTECTION FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF, INSTALLING BETTER AIR FILTERS IN THE VENTILATION SYSTEM. PARTICLES GO IN AND THEY GET TRAPPED. JULIANNA IS AN ENGLISH TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL. I THINK THE FILTERS WILL MAKE US FEEL A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE WALKING INTO THE CLASSROOM KNOWING IT'S THERE TO KEEP US SAFE. THE UPGRADED FILTERS ARE PUT IN INCREASING EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST COVID-19 SPREAD SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGH THE AIR FURTHER THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED IN WHAT'S CALLED AEROSOL SPREAD. CHILDREN ARE STARTING TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL. WHAT FACTOR IS AEROSOL SPREAD GOING TO PLAY IN THIS. IT'S ALREADY PLAYING A MAJOR ROLE. WHEN YOU TALK, COUGH, BREATHE OR SNEEZE, THE STREAM OF TWO TYPES OF DROPLETS ARE SENT TO THE AIR. RESPIRATORY FALL QUICKLY TO THE GROUND WITHIN 6 FEET. AEROSOL PARTICLES ARE SMALLER AND LIGHTER. THEY CAN LINGER IN THE AIR FOR HOURS AND TRAVEL EVEN LONGER DISTANCES. THAT'S AEROSOL SPREAD.  VIRAL PARTICLE CONCENTRATIONS CAN BUILD UP AND INFECT SOMEBODY BEYOND THAT MAGICAL 6 FOOT RING WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. IT'S ONE REASON WHY YOU'RE MORE SUSS EPT I WILL INDOORS AND AIR VENTILATION ON PLANES, OFFICES AND NOW SCHOOLS IS BEING LOOKED AT IN A NEW LIGHT. A WATCHDOG FOUND ONE-THIRD OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE U.S. NEED IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR AIR SYSTEMS FOR PROPER VENTILATION. WE HAVE UNDERINVESTED IN OUR SCHOOL BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DECADES AND WE'RE PAYING THE PRICE FOR THAT RIGHT NOW. JULIANNA'S CLASSROOM IS ONE OF 12,000 IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT WILL GET NEW FILTERS. A HIGH-QUALITY FILTER THAT CAN CATCH SMALLER CONTAMINANTS. STILL, IT'S NOT A CATCHALL. A PRELIMINARY STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA FOUND WHEN AN ASYMPTOMATIC TEACHER WAS TALKING IN A ROOM WITH STRONG VENTILATION ONLY 10% OF VIRUS PARTICLES WERE FILTERED OUT. IS IT A SOFTBALL WITH COVID-19, NO, BUT IT'S A NECESSARY STEP WE HAVE TO TAKE. IT'S AN EXTRA HEALTH MEASURE THE CDC HAS NOW ADDED TO THEIR SCHOOL GUIDELINES. SO HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR CHILD'S SCHOOL HAS PROPER VENTILATION. SHOULD THEY BE ASKING ABOUT THE VENTILATION SYSTEM?  ABSOLUTELY. ARE THEY USING BETTER FILTERS. YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR  MILLIONS OF AMERICA FROM FLOOR TO ACCESS OUR IN THE PATH OF THESE TWO STORMS. BILL KARINS IS JOINING ME NOW. WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THESE TWO STORM TRACKS? OF THE FIRST TIME MONTH, I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS. MENTIONED THAT IN 2020, SOME GOOD NEWS. MARCO AS WELL AS A HURRICANE. NOW, RIGHT? SO THIS STORM, YOU KNOW, GOT SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER OVERNIGHT. IT IS BARELY EVEN A STORM. WE ARE HAPPY ABOUT THAT. I GOT A BED FEELING ABOUT WHAT LAURA COULD DO. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT MARKET LOOKS LIKE. WE HAVE SEEN SOME PRETTY SPORTY WINDS. WE HAVE NOT SEEN REALLY THAT WINDS YET. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOSE POWERED BY THIS. MARCO GOT 20 APART. IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM. IT HAS 40 MILE- PER-HOUR WINDS. IT IS GOING TO RECONNECT AND DISSIPATE. THAT BRINGS US TO LAURA. THE STORM HAS BEEN VERY INCIDENT. IT WENT OVER THE TOP OF SIX TO -- 6000 FOOT MOUNTAINS IN WESTERN CUBA. AND IT STILL HELPED. NOW WE ARE AFRAID, WHAT IS THIS GOING TO DO IT HAS CLEARED CUBA INTO THE GULF BUT LANES AT 60 MILES PER HOUR IT SHOULD START INTENSIFYING OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND THEN ALL DAY TOMORROW, ALL DAY WEDNESDAY, AND AND THAT LANDFALL. THE HURRICANE CENTER HAS IT KIND OF GRADUALLY UP, MAKING LANDFALL MAYBE 105 TO 110 MILE- PER-HOUR WINDS. THAT IS A SERIES STORM. THAT IS A MAJOR HURRICANE. SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED OF WHERE IT IS GOING TO GO. IT RAINS ITSELF OUT WITH POSSIBLE LETTING PROBLEMS IN ARKANSAS, MISSISSIPPI, INTO TENNESSEE, INTO KENTUCKY, TOO. OF IS THAT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED IS WHERE THE LANDFALL IS GOING TO BE. OUR COMPUTERS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE STILL BETWEEN NEW ORLEANS AND HOUSTON. THEY ARE PINPOINTING THE TEXAS LOUISIANA BORDER. THAT IS WHERE THE HURRICANE CENTER IS, TOO. GET THE GUEST MAY SHIFT A LITTLE CLOSER TO HOUSTON AND GALVESTON AND RODENTS. THE NEXT 24 HOURS. WE WILL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. THIS IS OUR AMERICAN COMPUTER MODEL. THIS IS GOING BACK TO ALL THE -- ALL OF THE SPINES FOR TWO POTENTIAL. AND SO, HERE YOU CAN SEE KIND OF THE DIFFERENCE. IT IS ALL IN THE GENERAL VICINITY. THAT'S WHY PORT ARTHUR, STARTING TOMORROW STARTING TO GET EVACUATIONS. AREAS LIKE BEAUMONT, TWITTER. I THINK GALVESTON AREA, THEY MAY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE EVACUATIONS, JUST IN CASE THIS STORM HEADS YOUR WAY. WE DON'T KNOW DEFINITELY UNTIL THIS TIME TOMORROW. SO JUST BECAUSE MARCO WENT DOWN ON US, NO ONE COMPLAINED THAT IT DOES NOT MEAN LAURA IS GOING TO DO THE SAME THING. WE COULD BE DEALING WITH MAJOR HURRICANES MAKING LANDFALL IN THE U.S. BILL, WE'RE HOPING THAT WILL NOT BE THE CASE. EVEN IF IT IS, YOU ARE PROBABLY THE FIRST PERSON IN THE ENTIRE YEAR OF 2020 TO COME AND BRING US GOODNESS. SO WE ARE AT LEAST APPRECIATIVE OF THE GOODNESS. AND MAYBE WE'LL HAVE SOME MORE GOOD NEWS TOMORROW. GOOD SEEING YOU. GOOD SEEING YOU TOO. BE NOMINATED FOR A SECOND TERM THIS AFTERNOON. FACEBOOK THIS MORNING IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA AFTER IN-PERSON ROLL CALL VOTE. MAKING THEIR CASE TO KEEP THE OVER OFFERS COME NOVEMBER. THE JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THE RADICAL LEFT. AND IS GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST FOUR MORE YEARS TO DRAIN THE SWAMP. BAD THINGS HAPPENED LAST TIME WITH THE SPYING OF OUR CAMPING AND BIDEN AND THAT GOES TO OBAMA. WE HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL. WE HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL. THIS TIME, THEY ARE TRY TO DO IT WITH A WHOLE POST OFFICE SCAM. THIS IS OUR COUNTRY CAN GO IN A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE DRUGS OR EVEN GREATER DIRECTION. NBC NEWS PLACK REPORT IT MONICA ALBA IS TRENDING ON FROM CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA. MONICA, WHAT ELSE HAS THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY TODAY? Reporter: HI THERE, ALISON. APOLOGIES FOR THE NORTH. THEY ARE ALREADY DISMANTLING WHAT THEY HAD SET UP FOR THE CHARLOTTE CONVENTION BECAUSE THE REALITY IS IT IS OVER. IT WAS ABOUT FIVE HOURS OF OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONVENTION BUSINESS HERE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT MAKING THOSE SURPRISE APPEARANCES AND REMARKS TO DELEGATES. THE, THE METAPHOR IS QUITE STRONG. CHARLOTTE IS OVER. NOW ALL THE ACTION MOVES OVER TO WASHINGTON FOR REALLY THE REMAINDER OF THIS BLACK BUSTER OF SPEECHES AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION BUT HERE IN CHARLOTTE, SO NOTABLE THE PRESIDENT TOOK THE STAGE AND DELIVERED ESSENTIALLY A CAMPAIGN RALLY LIKE SPEECH. HE SPOKE FOR NEARLY 50 MINUTES , TOUCHING ON A TON OF IMPORTANT ANY 20 TOPICS BUT I WANTED TO TAKE A LISTEN SPECIFICALLY TO WHAT HE SAID IN TERMS OF NORTH CAROLINA AND THE CORONAVIRUS OUTLINES HERE IN THE STATE. JOE BIDEN WAS GOING TO HAVE HIS CONVENTION IN MILWAUKEE. AND THEY DID NOT GO THERE AT ALL. DID NOT DO THIS. WE DID THIS OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOUR STINK IF YOU HAD A GOVERNOR THAT WOULD HAVE LET US HAVE SOME PEOPLE, HE SAID, ACCORDING TO THE RULES AND REGULATION, THE MOST PEOPLE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE IN THAT ROOM, MEANING -- I VIEWED IT AS A -- THIS 10 PEOPLE. I SAID, SOCHOVKA, I AM AT 19,000. YOU'RE AT 10. AND WE SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE? IT DID NOT SOUND 2G GOOD. ALISON, YOU AND I HAVE TALKED REPEATEDLY ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES HIS CONVENTION WAS UNCEREMONIOUSLY UPROOTED, MOVED TO FLORIDA, BACK TO CHARLOTTE THERE WAS A QUESTION MARK OF WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND OF COURSE, THAT IS BECAUSE THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IS REALLY HUNG OVER THE ENTIRETY OF THIS EVENING. THE PRESIDENT DID WANT TO COME TO CHARLOTTE ULTIMATELY TO THINK THAT SMALLER FOOTPRINT OF DELEGATES WHO OFFICIALLY NOMINATED HIM TODAY. BUT HE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO SLAM THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF THE STATE, WHO IS THE WHAT ONE THAT SAID INITIALLY, I DON'T YOU CAN HAVE AN EVENT WITH 19,000 PEOPLE. BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE SOCIAL DISTANCE AND WE NEED TO BE WEARING MASKS. THAT IS WHEN THE PERSON SAID, I LIKE THAT. SO I'M GOING TO YANK THE CONVENTION AND MOVED TO FLORIDA. HE HAS TO CANCEL IT BECAUSE OF HOW BAD THE PANDEMIC WAS JACKSONVILLE AND NOW HERE WE ARE. TODAY, HERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR FROM INSIDE THE ROOM. THE DELEGATES FOR THE MOST PART WEARING MASKS. EARLIER IN THE DAY, BEFORE THE OFFICIAL PROGRAM STARTED. WITHOUT THE USE WAS INCONSISTENT AT THEIR RETURN TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE. BUT THIS IS A HUGE INDOOR GATHERING. GET IS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING CHARLOTTE HAD SEEN ALL SUMMER. SO IT IS NOTABLE FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. THAT THE RNC DID TAKE A LOT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS. THEY SAID THEY TESTED EVERYBODY. TWICE. THEY HAD TO BE TESTED BEFORE ARRIVING AND THEN UPON ARRIVAL, THEY WERE TESTED. IT JUST UNDERSCORES HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO CONTINUE TO DO THESE POLITICAL CONVENTIONS DURING A PANDEMIC. WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, THOUGH, FROM WHAT WE SAW WITH THEM, LAST WEEK, WHO HELD ALMOST ALL OF IT, AS YOU KNOW, VIRTUALLY, ALISON.  YEAH, MONICA BASED ON WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD SO FAR, WHAT ARE THE MAIN THEMES? WHAT ARE THE MESSAGES WE SHOULD EXPECT TO HEAR THROUGHOUT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION THIS WEEK? WHAT IS STRIKING BECAUSE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAD TRIED TO THE TELEGRAPH THE VERY OPTIMISTIC MESSAGE OF POSITIVE FORWARD- LOOKING TONE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THIS WEEK. AND THAT THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT AND OFFERED SOME RHETORIC THAT WITH THE AT BEST CAN BE DESCRIBED AS QUITE DARK AND DIVISIVE. ONE OF THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION, THINK THE ONLY WAY HE LOSES IS IF IT IS AND RULING AGAINST UNIVERSAL MAIL- IN VOTING PROVIDING ANY EVIDENCE OR SUPPORT FOR THESE WIDESPREAD LANES HE MAKES ABOUT VOTER FRAUD. SO REALLY, IT IS HARD TO SQUARE WHAT THEY SAID WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH WHAT WE ALREADY SAW IN THE FIRST FEW HOURS. NOW, PRIME-TIME COULD BE A DIFFERENT STORY TONIGHT, THE THEME IS LAND OF THOMAS. SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT SPEAKERS IN THE CLOSING PRIME- TIME CONFIDENCE SLOT. IT IS GOING TO BE SENATOR TIM SCOTT THAT THE ONLY REPUBLICAN LACK SENATOR, OF COURSE, WHO IS A TRUMP ALLY, SOMEBODY WHO HAS WORKED WITH HIM ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REPORT. WE WILL BE HEARING ABOUT THAT. WE WILL HEAR IN THE PRESIDENT'S OF THIS SUNDAY DOKO DONALD TRUMP JUNOR. IT IS NOTABLE THIS ALL TAKES PLACE IN WASHINGTON FROM THE MELLON AUDITORIUM. IT IS CLOSE TO THE THE WHITE HOUSE. WE WANT TO ACTUALLY SEE THE WHITE HOUSE USED AS THE TO POLITICAL DROP UNTIL TOMORROW. WE'RE TOLD THERE. HE SOME SURPRISES AND WE DO EXPECT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT OF PROGRAMMING TONIGHT. WE'RE TOLD HE WILL APPEAR WITH FRONTLINE WORKERS AND HE IS GOING TO TRY TO MAKE A POINT ALSO ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. SO THAT IS ONE THING TO LOOK FORWARD. BUT THERE COULD BE OTHER SURPRISES. THE OTHER THINGS FOR THE WEEK OUR OPPORTUNITY AND GREATNESS, WE ARE GOING TO SEE A DIFFERENT MESSAGE. THEY ARE GOING TO ATTEMPT TO TRY TO GO IN EACH DAY. AGAIN, WE CAN'T UNDERSCORE THIS ENOUGH. IF TODAY IS ANY PREVIEW, IT MAY NOT BE EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE SCRIPTING BECAUSE THIS IS THE PRESIDENT WHO MUST GO OFF SCRIPT. SURE DOES. MONICA, LET'S GO TO THE THIS MORNING, HOURS BEFORE THE RNC STARTED. ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S LONGEST OF INCA WAS TRUSTED ADVISERS, KELLYANNE CONWAY, NOTHING THAT SHE IS LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? Reporter: YEAH, THAT WAS PRETTY SHOCKING TO ALLOW PEOPLE. IN TERMS OF SOMEBODY WHO IS SO CLOSE TO HIM, ADVISES HIM, IN SUCH AN INTENSE CAPACITY ON 70 DIFFERENT. SHE IS THE FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER WHO IN THE FINAL MONTHS OF 2016, LEAD THEM TO VICTORY AND ULTIMATELY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. SO SHE IS SOMEBODY THAT HAS BEEN PLAYING A IMPORTANT ROLE BUT SHE IS TAKING A STEP BACK, SHE SAYS, TO FOCUS ON FAMILY. THAT IS OUR PRIORITY AND WE ACTUALLY ARE JUST LEARNING THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WANTED TO HAVE HER BACK. THEY WANTED TO SEE IF SHE COULD COME HELP AND BE A MEANS THERE GET. AND SHE DEBATED THAT. BUT ULTIMATELY DECIDED AGAINST BECAUSE SHE DOES WANT TO BE SPENDING MORE TIME WITH HER FOUR TEENAGE CHILDREN. SO THIS IS GOING TO BE HER LAST WEEK AT THE WHITE HOUSE SHE WILL BE DEPARTING AT THE END OF THE MONTH. BUT SHE IS STILL EXPECTED TO ADDRESS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION IN REMARKS ON WEDNESDAY. SHE IS ACTUALLY IN THE WEST WING TODAY. WORKING ON THOSE REMARKS. AND SHE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVISE THE PRESIDENT, WE UNDERSTAND, IN AN INFORMAL CAPACITY, ALISON.  ALL RIGHT, MONICA ALBA WITH A VERY BRIEF TRIP TO CHARLOTTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. Reporter: YOU GOT IT.  OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION STARTS TONIGHT AT 8 PM EASTERN WITH CHUCK TODD FOLLOWED BY A NETWORK ON THEM SPECIAL ED 10:00 PM EASTERN. YOU CAN CATCH IT ALL RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW. ! THE RNC WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO BE IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA THAT IS DUVAL COUNTY, WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW NEARLY WON BACK IN 2016. NBC NEWS NOW CORRESPONDED DASHA BURNS ASKED SUPPORTERS INJECTABLE HOW THEY ARE FEELING HEADING INTO THIS ELECTION? I THINK THE -- REPUBLICAN PARTY. THERE'S SOMETHING TO RALLY AROUND BUT IF YOU GET TRUMP FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS I THINK IT COULD BE THE DOWNFALL. IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHETHER IT WAS TRUMP OR PENCE OR ANY REPUBLICAN THAT COULD FILL THAT SEAT. WE ARE VOTING ON SUCH DIFFERENT MENTALITIES IN AMERICA THESE DAYS. ANYBODY COULD BE IN THAT SEAT. I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR SMALLER GOVERNMENT, SEAVER STREET, BACKING THE POLICE, KEEPING OUR BORDERS SECURE, LESS GOVERNMENT, AND MORE AND VIGIL FREEDOM, MORE INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. IT DOES NOT RESEMBLE THE PARTY I JOINED. AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS IS A RESET KIND OF ELECTION. WILL, I'M GOING TO SUPPORT BIDEN. PROBABLY SAW WHEN YOU CAME IN, REPUBLICAN FOR BIDEN THEM. I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN 2020 THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE AS OPEN ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR. THEY ARE GOING TO BE CASTING THEIR BALLOTS FOR JOE BIDEN BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF WHAT THEY HAVE SPENT WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO GET FROM THE TO DEMONSTRATION HAS NOT BEEN WITH THE ONE. AND THAT JOE BIDEN IS OFFERING THEM AN ALTERNATIVE TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK. -- JOINS US LIVE. --, WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOME VOTERS THERE. HOW DO FOLKS FEEL THERE ABOUT LOSING THE RNC? Reporter: HEY, ALISON. WELL, THIS AREA HAS BEEN HIT HARD BY THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT FROM THE FARMERS AND BY THE VIRUS ITSELF. AND THE BUSINESS OWNERS THAT I TALKED TO SAID IT HAS BEEN A BIG LOSS. ONE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THAT YOU HEARD FROM THERE ACTUALLY 1 MILLION. HE SAID THAT THE RNC WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE THE SUPER BOWL IN TERMS OF THE BOOST THAT IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS ECONOMY. BUT INTERESTINGLY, HE ALSO SAID THAT IN A WAY, HE WAS A LITTLE BIT RELIEVED AND IT WASN'T COMING HERE BECAUSE OF THE LOCAL DIVISIONS AND DISCOUNTED THAT HE FELT LIKE THAT MIGHT EXACERBATE. AT LOOK AT, ALISON, THERE IS A REASON THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON DUVAL COUNTY. HE WANTED BY SUCH A NARROW MARGIN. LOCALS IN FLORIDA IS A THE FARTHER NORTH YOU GO, THE MORE SELF YOU GET THE CLINIC THAT THIS AREA HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY CONSERVATIVE, NORTH FLORIDA IS HOW REPUBLICANS WIN ELECTIONS. SO THAT NEVER VICTORY IN 2016 WAS A BIT OF A IT'S LIKE. EVEN FIGURE LIKE, THOUGH, WAS IN 2018, WHEN DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE ANDREW GUILLEN TOOK THIS COUNTRY WHICH SAID SHOCK WAS TO THE GOP. IT WAS A SINCE THE 1980. SO THIS AREA HAS SEEN SOME SHIFTS. FOR DONALD TRUMP THE SUBURBS HERE. THEY ARE GREAT BUT THEY ARE BECOMING MORE DIVERSE. MORE COLLEGE EDUCATED. AND THAT COULD SPELL SOME PROBLEMS BECAUSE THESE -- THIS IS THE SORT OF DEMOGRAPHIC THAT HE HAS BEEN HAVING TROUBLE WITH. I HEARD A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT THEY WERE HAVING THESE ROOMS. PRETTY FAR AWAY FROM HERE. IT MICHIGAN. YOU ARE SEEING THESE IN THE SUBURBS. IN BOTH AREAS, IT HAS BEEN THIS -- THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE. THAT THEY DON'T REALLY RECOGNIZE IT. AS THE PARTY THAT THEY JOINED AND IT WAS STRIKING, ALISON TO HEAR ALSO THE SAME WORDS COME OUT OF PEOPLE'S MELTS AS THE WORK IN MICHIGAN. THERE IS STILL A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR DELTA PURE, ASKED ABOUT THE GOP COUNTY FAIR WHO SAYS THAT HE WAS RNC DID NOT ACTUALLY HAPPEN HERE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE REBUILDING GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL. THE REALLY OF THE CROWD GAME. THE ADDED THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS FOR THAT PREPARATION. THE RNC AND YOU THINK THAT COULD BE A PRETTY INFUENTIAL -- GETTING MORE VOTERS AND THE GROUND GAME AHEAD OF NOVEMBER. ALISON? DASHA, THIS TIME, IN DUVAL AND JACKSONVILLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR POINT OF VIEW. GOT MORE COMING FOR YOU, DON'T WORRY. ,, THE WIFE AND MOTHER OF A HUSBAND AND KIDS WHO ARE MORE FOLDABLE TO POLICE VIOLENCE. A PROUD NERD AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MAJOR AMERICA. TO CABLE-TV NEWS. HOPE THE GREAT -- AND MIGHT MOM WILL LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND BE PROUD.! A PRETTY SPICY HEARING. POSTMASTER GENERAL DeJOY TESTIFYING. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT LEIGH ANN CALDWELL JOINS ME NOW. A BIT MORE FIREWORKS TODAY. HOW DID HE SEND HIS MANAGEMENT TO THE POSTAL SERVICE? THE JOINT WAS VERY DEFENSIVE TODAY. A LOT MORE THAN HE WAS ON FRIDAY, WHEN HE APPEARED BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE. BUT TODAY, HE WENT TO THAT FOR HIMSELF, FOR HIS HANDLING OF THE POST OFFICE. AND DISMISSED HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE. HERE IS HOW HE DESCRIBED IT TO LAWMAKERS. I DID NOT DIRECT THE REMOVAL OF BLUE COLLECTION BOXES OR THE REMOVAL OF MAIL PROCESSING EQUIPMENT. SECOND, I DO NOT ERECT THE CUTBACK ON HOURS AT ANY OF OUR POST OFFICE IS. AND FINALLY, I DO NOT DIRECT THE ELIMINATION OR ANY CUT BACK IN OVERTIME. I DID, HOWEVER, SUSPEND THESE PRACTICES AND WORKING TO REMOVE ANY MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT OUR COMMITMENT TO DELIVERING THE NATION'S ELECTION MAIL. ANY FURTHER ASSERTIONS BY THE MEDIA OR ELECTED OFFICIALS IS FURTHERING A FALSE NARRATIVE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. POSTAL WORKERS AND THE POSTAL UNION CONTRADICT WHAT POSTMASTER DeJOY IS THINKING ABOUT THE ACTIONS HE TOOK. THEY SAY, IN FACT, HE DID MAKE THESE CHANGES THAT AFFECTED THE DELIVERY OF MAIL HE ALSO SAID THAT HE HAD NO ROLE IN ATTEMPTING TO STOP SABOTAGE THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS. IN A, ALISON, WANT TO TALK TO YOU. TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES HERE THAT HAVE BEEN COMBINED. ONE IS THE FISCAL SOLVENCY OF THE POSTAL SERVICE BUT IT IS LONG BEEN AN ISSUE. BUT THE JOY CAME TO THE HELM AND SINCE THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ATTACKING THE POSTAL SERVICE AND MAIL- IN BALLOTS, THAT HAS BECOME A MAJOR FOCUS, ESPECIALLY SO CLOSE TO THE ELECTION AND THE UPPER PRESIDENT TREATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCENE, THEY CAN, BUT MAIL-IN BALLOT IN, SAYING THAT IT IS A FRAUD AND THAT IT WILL BE A MESS. AND SO WHEN DEMOCRAT TOLD ME RECENTLY THAT DeJOY PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN BEEN IN THE HOT SEAT IF THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ELEVATE THIS ISSUE AND CAUSE DEMOCRATS ESPECIALLY TO QUESTION THE INCENTIVE AND THE MOTIVATION BEHIND SOME OF THESE CHANGES, ALISON. YEAH LEIGH ANN, WHICH IS KEEP HEARING THAT MUCH ABOUT MAIL- IN VOTING FOR THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN IS NOT GOING TO STOP AS WE GET CLOSER TO NOVEMBER. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT A HEATED EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE JOY AND CONGRESSMAN STEPHEN LYNCH OF MASSACHUSETTS OVER THE MAIL SORTING MACHINE. THIS IS PRETTY GOOD. MORE THAN 600 MAIL SORTING MACHINES HAVE EVEN BEEN TAKER OFFLINE FOR THIS IS. TO BE SURE THAT WAS PART OF THE PLAN THAT HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW. SINCE BEFORE THE JOY STARTED. PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING, IS THE TIMING OF IT. AND HERE IS WHAT CONGRESSMAN LYNCH , LET'S JUST PLAY THEIR EXCHANGE. NO, I WILL NOT. YOU WILL NOT? WILL NOT WELL, THERE YOU GO. YEAR AGO WHAT? ORDER, ORDER, ORDER. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE JOINT WAS EXTREMELY DEFINED THAT HE WOULD NOT EVEN -- ALLOW HIS PEOPLE TO PUT THOSE MACHINES BACK IN. ON, THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE WITH ANOTHER THIS MAN OF CALIFORNIA. WHO SAID EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY, JUST FOR THE OPTICS, TO CONVINCE PEOPLE AND TO ASSURE PEOPLE THAT EVERYTHING IS BEING DONE TO ENSURE A SAFE AND FAIR AND EFFICIENT ELECTION. WHY WON'T YOU DO IT? DeJOY SAID BECAUSE CONGRESS CAN'T GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND GIVE US THE MONEY WE NEED. THE END OF THAT EXTENSION IT FINALLY ENDED WITH, FIND, IF YOU -- IF YOU GIVE ME $1 BILLION, WE WILL PUT IT BACK IN. FOR THAT THAT WAS MORE AN ADVANCEMENT OF WHAT DeJOY IS SAYING. OKAY, FINE, WE WILL WORK ON GIVING YOU THAT DOES IN THE NEXT -- TWO WEEKS, ALISON.  SO LEIGH ANN, DEFINITELY ENTERTAINING. NOW, PRETTY HEATED CITY. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED OF THE WEEKEND. THE HOUSE PASSED THE 25 PENDING BUILT. DOES THIS HAVE ANY HOPE IN THE SENATE? Reporter: IT DOES NOT SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL HAS ALREADY SAID THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO BRING IT UP BECAUSE HIS EXCUSE WAS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ISSUED A THREAT AND WILL NOT SIGN IT INTO LAW. McCONNELL'S MEMO HAS ALWAYS BEEN NOT TO BRING UP LEGISLATION THAT WON'T GET SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT. MAYBE THAT IS IS AMMO OR THAT IS THE EXCUSE THAT HE IS HIDING IN. IT IS LIKE THE WORKS THAT THE HOUSE DID WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE AND THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A BATTLE IN WASHINGTON AS, YOU KNOW, AS THE GET CLOSER AND AS THIS PROGRESSES, ALISON.  ALL RIGHT, LEIGH ANN CALDWELL WITH THE LATEST ON THE POSTMASTER GENERAL'S TESTAMENT TO DATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GETTING US UP TO SPEED YEAH THANK YOU.  THE VICE PRESIDENT OF PENNSYLVANIA'S POSTAL WORKERS UNION SLIMMING PLUS MASSIVE GENERAL DeJOY THING THE AGENCY HAS BECOME POLITICIZED NBC NEWS REPORTER JOINING ME NOW FROM CURRENT SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. WHAT IS THE POSTAL UNION THERE THINKING ABOUT DeJOY'S TESTIMONY TODAY? Reporter: SO, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE POSTAL WORKERS UNION HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA WAS REALLY ADAMANT THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR AN EXPLANATION FROM DeJOY TODAY ABOUT WHY HE SHOULD ACQUITS THAT HE DID WITHOUT GOING THROUGH CONGRESS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS WRITTEN INTO THE CONSTITUTION AND OBVIOUSLY, DeJOY DID NOT DO THAT. AND WHAT IS MARKET GALLAGHER POINTED OUT, AND SEVEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN. IN GALLAGHER'S EYE,, HE SAID, WHY IS HE NOT LOOKING TO INCREASE REVENUE? WHY EASY ONLY FOCUSED ON CUTTING THE BUDGET? AND SO HE SAID THAT THERE MUST BE, IF DeJOY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE POSTAL SERVICE LEGITIMATE LOOKS GOOD HE IS WORRIED THAT THERE'S POLITICAL INTENT BEHIND WHAT HE IS DOING, SAYING THAT THE USPS SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME LESS EYES. HE SAYS HE IS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE TOLD ME YESTERDAY. THIS POSTMASTER GENERAL CAN IN. EVERY PIECE, EVERY DAY. FIVE YEARS I WORKED IN THE POST OFFICE, EVERY PIECE, EVERY DAY. THERE WERE CHANGES. AND JUST WANT TO DEAL WITH LOGISTICS IS RIDICULOUS. AND IF THERE'S AN INTENT THERE, IT IS HORRIBLE. POSTAL WORKERS TAKE PRIDE IN WHAT THEY DO, WHETHER YOU ARE A CARRIER, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, DRIVER, IF ONE TAKES PRIDE AND EVERYONE HAS BEEN BY THAT MODEL EVERY PIECE EVERY DAY AND SUDDENLY THAT IS GONE. YOU ARE DEPRIVING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OF THE SERVICE THEY DESERVE. Reporter: WHAT YOU HEARD THERE, A LOT OF FRUSTRATION FROM ONE OF THE KEY LEADERS HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. HE SAID THAT A GOOD START WOULD BE TO ISSUE THAT $25 BILLION IN GET THAT TO THE SENATE. OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM LEIGH ANN'S REPORTING, THAT DOES NOT SEEM TOO LIKELY . WE KNOW PENNSYLVANIA IS A KEY ELEMENT STATE. WHAT ARE SOME THE ISSUES THE POSTAL UNION IS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IN THIS ELECTION? Reporter: YEAH, SO THE USPS HAS ISSUED LETTERS TO SEVERAL STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, PENNSYLVANIA INCLUDED, THAT BASICALLY SAID THAT THEY CAN'T ADHERE TO THE ELECTION OFFICIALS GUIDELINES AND DEADLINES TO MAKE SURE THAT BALLOTS ARRIVE ON TIME AND SO THAT IS A TOP CONCERN AMONG ELECTION OFFICIALS AND POSTAL WORKERS ELECT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GET BLAMED FOR SOMEONE'S BALLOTS NOT GETTING THERE IN TIME. THEY ARE TELLING ME THAT PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO WORK TO SENDING THEIR BALLOTS EARLY. BALLOT DROP BOXES ARE ALSO SOMETHING THAT PENNSYLVANIA HAS TRIED TO IMPLEMENT DURING THE PRIMARY. IT WAS RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL BUT NOW THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS SUING PENNSYLVANIA OVER IT. AND WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PUSHBACK FROM TRUMP HIMSELF AND THE CAMPAIGN FOR IT COMES TO MAIL-IN VOTING, THE BALLOT DROP ACCESS AND REALLY FOCUSING IN ON THIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN, LOOKING TO EVEN DURING THE HEARING TODAY, HE TWEETED, I WANT TO READ IT TO YOU, HE SAID THAT ALL OF THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DO WITH THE POST OFFICE HEARINGS IS BLAME THE REPUBLICANS FOR THE FRAUD. THEY ARE SETTING THE TABLE FOR WHAT HE CALLS A BIG MESS. OPTIMISM. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE 51 MILLION BALCE IS TALKING ABOUT, SEVERAL STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE SENDING OUT APPLICATIONS TO ALL REGISTERED VOTERS. IT IS NOT THE BALLOTS THEMSELVES. BUT THEY ARE HOPING TO AT LEAST ELIMINATE ONE OF THOSE STEPS THAT IS REQUIRED TO GET YOUR MAIL-IN BALLOT SO MANY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS MILLION BALLOTS, WITH THE FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO GET THEM IN ON TIME, BUT THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO PROCESS THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANKS, ALISON. ! ARE YOU HEADING TO THE POLLS OR THE POST OFFICE? HOW DO YOU VOTE IN THE 2020 PRESENT ELECTION? IT MIGHT BE CONFUSING THIS YEAR. DON'T WORRY.

NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT SHAQUILLE BREWSTER IS JOINING ME FROM KENOSHA. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? WHAT DO YOU KNOW SO FAR ABOUT WHAT LED UP TO THAT SHOOTING? IT IS STILL NOT EXACTLY CLEAR WHAT LED UP TO THAT SHOOTING. WHAT POLICE ARE SAYING IS THAT AT ABOUT 530 PM YESTERDAY, THEY WERE RESPONDING TO A CALL ABOUT A DOMESTIC INCIDENT. THEY HAVE NOT DESCRIBED IF THIS -- BUT WE KNOW THAT WITNESSES AND HIS PARTNERS SAY THAT HE WAS TRYING TO DE-IS GREAT SOME SITUATION THAT WAS GOING ON. THERE WAS A WITNESS ON THE SCENE THAT TOLD NBC NEWS THAT THERE WERE TWO WOMEN ARGUING FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. THAT IS WHEN BLAKE SHOWED UP TO THE IS GREAT AND CALM EVERYTHING DOWN AT SOME POINT, AND WHEN YOU LISTEN TO WHAT HIS PARTNER SAYS, THEY SEE THAT HE -- THE OFFICERS ARRIVED, THERE WAS SOME EXTENT. IT GOT TENTS AND A TASER WAS DEPLOYED AFTER SOME STRUGGLE. AND THEN THAT IS WHEN THAT VIDEO WAKES UP WHERE AFTER THE TASER DEPLOYED, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, MR. BLAKE GOES AROUND THE CAR AND TRIED TO GO INTO THAT PARK AS MUCH IN WITH HIS THREE KIDS INSIDE. AND THAT IS WHEN THE SHOOTING OCCURRED. WE KNOW THAT THERE WERE NO BODY CAMERA VIDEOS. THAT IS ACCORDING LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO SAY THAT DESPITE PRICE AND ATTEMPTS FROM THE CITY COUNCIL, THERE IS NO BODY CAMERA VIDEOS BUT WE DON'T EXACTLY WHAT VIDEO IS. AND JUST HAVE THAT STATEMENT THAT WAS RELEASED LAST NIGHT THINK THAT THERE WAS A POLICE INVOLVED SHOOTING AS THEY SAY AT THAT TIME IN RESPONSE TO A DOMESTIC INCIDENT.

THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT TESTING LOCATIONS AROUND CAMPUS ON GEORGIA TECH. STILL SOME PEOPLE THAT WE SPOKE TO SAY IT IS NOT SO COMFORTABLE ON CAMPUS. THE FACULTY ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE SAFETY OF STUDENTS AND STAFF WHO ARE BEING BROUGHT BACK TO CAMPUS. PARTICULARLY OUR FACILITIES AND JANITORIAL STAFF.

THE FDA ISSUED A NEW EMERGENCY ORDER THAT EXPANDS THE USE OF CONVALESCENT PLASMA AS A TRUMAN FOR THE CORONAVIRUS. BUT HOW EFFECTIVE IS IT? HERE IS WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE ADVISER PETER NAVARRO SAID EARLIER TODAY. ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROVERSY ABOUT CONVALESCENT PLASMA. THIS IS A THERAPY THAT HAS BEEN USED ACROSS MANY DISEASES FOR MANY DECADES. THE ODDS OF IT HURTING YOU ARE CLOSE TO ZERO. THE ODDS OF IT HELPING YOU ARE CLOSE TO 100%. THE ONLY ISSUE IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HELP. AND ACCORDING TO THE FDA, 35% REDUCTION IN MORTALITY. NBC NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. JOHN TORRES JOINING ME NOW. DR. JOHN, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE TO GIVE US A MEDICAL OPINION. THAT WAS A TREAT ADVISER COMMENTING THERE. THAT HEAR FROM A QUALIFIED HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. HOW DOES THIS TREATMENT WORK? HOW EFFECTIVE IS IT? WHAT ARE SOME OF THE POTENTIAL CONCERNS. . GOOD AFTERNOON, ALISON. FIRST OFF, START WITH CONVALESCENT PLASMA. THAT IS A BLOOD WE DONATE BLOOD, THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS. THERE'S RED BLOOD CELLS. , CORONAVIRUS AND WANT TO DONATE PLASMA% COULD YOU TELL ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS? THEN ARE THERE RESTRICTIONS ON GAY MEN?  FIRST QUESTION GO TO A BLOOD DONATION CENTER. ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE HAD COVID-19. THEY ARE REALLYHA PUSHING PEOPLE THAT HAD COVID-19 TO DONATE BLOOD. SO GO THERE. THEY WILL RUN YOU THROUGH THEIR CHECKLIST. YOU WILL DONATE THE PLASMA. THEY GIVE YOU REDISN CELLS BACK AND TAKE THE PLASMA AND TREAT OTHER PEOPLE. AS FAR AS O THE GAY MEN ISSUE, WE TALKED WITH THE AMERICAN RED CROSS TODAY. THEY SAID THEY ARE ACCEPTING BLOOD DONATIONS FROM GAY MEN AND BISEXUAL MENHO HAVE NOT HAD SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH OTHER MEN IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS. IT IS A THREE MONTH TIME PERIOD. THERE IS A BIG PUSH FOR PEOPLE F WHO HAVE HAD COVID-19 TO DONATEHA BLOOD TO TRY TO GET THOSE ANTIBODIES.  TTH ALL RIGHT. ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  YOU BET. HEY, YOU ARE WATCHING NBC NEWS. LET'S GO TO NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT. SHES FRESH OFF THE WEEKEND AND HAS THE LATEST HEADLINES FROM US FROM NBCNEWS.COM. HOW ARE YOU DOING?  ALLISON, I AM GOOD. I HOPE YOU HAD A GREAT WEEKEND. LET'S KICK THIS OFF WITH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. THEY JUST KICKED THAT OFF TODAY IN CHARLOTTE OFFICIALLY RENOMINATING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE FOR THE TICKET.  OUR COUNTRY IS COUNTING ON US. THIS IS THE BIGGEST. THIS IS IT. OUR COUNTRY CAN GO IN A HORRIBLE DIRECTION OR IN AN EVEN GREATER DIRECTION AND BEFORE THE PLAGUE CAME IN FROM CHINA, THAT IS WHERE WE WERE GOING. WE WERE GOING IN A DIRECTION LIKE WE HAD NEVER SEEN.  LATER TODAY THE RNC WILL FEATURE KEY SPEAKERS LIKE SENATOR TIM SCOTT, FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY AND DONALD TRUMP JR. THE AG'S OFFICE SAID THEY ARE LOOKING INTO WHETHER THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION IMPROPERLY INFLATED THE VALUE OF TRUMP'S AS ASSETS ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HE SAID HE INFLATED THE VALUE TO SECURE BETTER LOANS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE. AND SOME STARTLING NEWS ACROSS THE GLOBE. RESEARCHERS FROM HONG KONG SAY A MAN HAS COME DOWN WITH COVID-19 FOR THE SECOND TIME MAKING HIM THE FIRST CONFIRMED PATIENT TO BECOME REINFECTED BY THE VIRUS. THE MAN FIRST TESTED POSITIVE BACK IN MARCH AND THEN WAS DIAGNOSED AGAIN IN AUGUST. HEALTH EXPERTS HOPE THIS CASE WILL HELP SCIENTISTS BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW LONG CORONAVIRUS IMMUNITY LASTS. VIDEO SHOWS POLICE SHOOTING A BLACK MAN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE BACK. FAMILY IDENTIFIED THE MAN AS 29-YEAR-OLD JACOB BLAKE WHO IS IN SERIOUS BUT STABLE CONDITION. IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT TOOK PLACE BEFORE THE VIDEO STARTED. POLICE ALSO SAY THEY WERE RESPONDING TO A DOMESTIC INCIDENT BUT HAVE YET TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILS. WISCONSIN'S DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS INVESTIGATING THE CASE AND THEY SAY THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING WERE PLACED ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. IN THE MEANTIME WISCONSIN'S GOVERNOR SAID HE IS SIGNING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER CALLING STATE LAWMAKERS INTO A SESSION ON POLICE -- [ INDISCERNIBLE ]  AND AS JACOB BLAKE FIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE, WE ARE ALL REMINDED THAT RACISM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THERE IS NO -- FINALLY TO GERMANY WHERE DOCTORS SAY RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER WAS INDEED POISONED LAST WEEK. HIS ASSOCIATES BELIEVE THE TEA HE DRANK AT AN AIRPORT WAS POISONED. HE WAS SOON TRANSFERRED TO GERMANY. HE IS NOW IN STABLE CONDITION BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT HIS RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT NOW. ALLISON, LOTS OF NEWS ON A MONDAY.  OH, YEAH, THAT IS SOME HEAVY STUFF FOR A MONDAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WILL SEE YOU IN ABOUT AN HOUR.  SEE YOU IN A LITTLE BIT. TWO TROPICAL STORMS BRINGING A HISTORIC THREAT TO THE GULF COAST. MARCO AND LAURA ARE ONLY MOVE. THEY ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE LANDFALL BACK TO BACK. NBC NEWS CORE SPOB -- CORRESPONDENT JOINING ME NOW. WHAT ARE THINGS LIKE?  INCREDIBLY CALM AT THE HOME. THERE WAS CONCERN FOR DAYS, ALLISON. THESE TWO STORMS, HURRICANES AT ONE POINT CRISSCROSSING OVER POTENTIALLY NEW ORLEANS. NOT ONLY HAS LAURA MOVED A LITTLE BIT WESTERLY, CERTAINLY AN AREA OF CONCERN HERE. MARCO, WE HAVEN'T FELT ANY EFFECTS OF THAT. GRAY CLOUDS OVER HIGH HEAD RIGHT NOW BUT NOT EVEN A DROP OF RAIN. THE STORM SURGES MAY BE A COUPLE OF FEET BUT NOTHING EXTREME THUS FAR. I'M IN THE FRENCH QUARTER RIGHT NOW ON BOURBON STREET. LOOK AT THIS. THIS COMPLETELY EMPTY. PART OF THIS IS RELATED TO COVID-19 AND JUST A TOURIST TOWN HERE IN NEW ORLEANS. A PARTY TOWN THAT WAS HIT REALLY HARD BY THE PANDEMIC. PART OF IT IS BUSINESSES DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE SHUTTING THEIR DOORS OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE PUTTING DOWN SANDBAGS OR WHERE THEY SHOULD BE GOING. BOARDED WINDOWS AS WELL. THAT IS NOT COVID RELATED. THAT IS BECAUSE THESE RESTAURANTS WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE PROTECTED IN THE EVENT WE DO END UP SEEING A MAJOR HURRICANE COME THROUGH. RIGHT NOW, ALLISON, FOLK -- FOLKS ARE HOPING THEY DODGED A BULLET.  THAT IS QUIET. YOU NEVER SEE IT THAT QUIET. THE BIG QUESTION WITH THIS STORM, POTENTIAL STORM SURGE THAT HAS BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM FOR NEW ORLEANS IN THE PAST. HOW IS THE CITY PREPARING AND ARE THOSE LEVIES READY TO HANDLE IT? WE KNOW THE LEVIES THAT FAILED 15 YEARS AGO WHEN KATRINA HIT. CAN THEY HANDLE SOME SERIOUS STORM SURGE?  THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION. IT IS OBVIOUSLY PERTINENT. IT IS THE 15 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF KATRINA. IT IS PERTINENT BECAUSE NEW ORLEANS HAS SPENT ALMOST $15 BILLION NOT JUST IMPROVING THE LEVIES BUT THE FLOOD WALLS AND THE PUMPS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE CITY. THEY HAVE PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO THIS TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T SEE A REPEAT SURGE BARRIER. THEY TOLD ME IT IS CALLED THE GREAT WALL OF NEW ORLEANS. THEY PUT A LOT OF STUFF TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED. WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY REPEATS SO FAR. THE STRENGTH OF STORMS WOULD HELP WITH SOME OF THAT AS WELL. THE CITY SO FAR HAS LASTED PRETTY WELL WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH STORMS. THERE ARE SOME SHELTERS THAT ARE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW BUT THEY ARE OUTSIDE OF THE LEVY PROTECTION SYSTEM. THEY ARE IN PLACES LIKE JEFFERSON PARISH.  SAM, YOU MENTIONED IT WHEN YOU WERE SHOWING US HOW QUIET THE STREETS ARE IN NEW ORLEANS, THIS IS HAPPENING WHILE WE ARE DEALING WITH THE PANDEMIC AS WELL. HOW IS THAT COMPLICATING THINGS?  IT IS COMPLICATING IT A LOT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME STORES. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANY THIS BLOCK. I'VE SEEN THEM TODAY OUR DOORS WILL BE CLOSED MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY BECAUSE OF THE STORM. THEN THEY SAY NEW COVID-19 HOURS. IT IS AFFECTING THIS COMMUNITY FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT. A LOT OF THE STORES IN THE FRENCH QUARTER HAVE HURLD HAD TO ALREADY HAD TO CLOSE BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. NOW YOU THROW IN MORE HURRICANES AND ONE BUSINESS OWNER TOLD ME WHAT ELSE ARE THEY GOING TO THROW AT US FOR 2020? WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO A LOT OF OBSTACLES BUT EVEN BY THOSE STANDARDS, IT HAS STILL BEEN A LOT FOR THEM.  HOPING THAT THINGS STAY CALM THERE. OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TO EVERYONE. HOPING EVERYBODY STAYS SAFE. YOU INCLUDED, SAM. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  MUCH APPRECIATED, ALLISON. THANKS SO MUCH. HOPE TO BE TALKING TO YOU SOON. MILLIONS OVER AMERICANS FROM FLORIDA TO TEXAS ARE IN THE PATH OF THESE TWO STORMS. NBC NEWS METROLOGIST BILL JOINING ME NOW. WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THESE TWO STORM TRACKS?  HEY, ALLISON. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN LIKE MONTHS I GAVE SOME GOOD NEWS. IMAGINE THAT 2020, SOME GOOD NEWS. WE WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND MARCO WHICH WAS ONE OF THE HURRICANES -- GOT SHEERED APART. THIS STORM GOT SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER OVERNIGHT. IT IS BARELY EVEN A STORM ALONG THE GULF COAST. WE ARE HAPPY ABOUT THAT. IT DOESN'T MEAN LAURA ISOO GOING TO DO THE SAME THING. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT MARCO LOOKS LIKE. IT LOOKS LIKE A BLOB OF RAIN OUTN OVER THE GULF. WE HAVE SEEN SOME SPORTY RAINS. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THINK OF THOSE WINDS YET IN NEW ORLEANS. WE WILL GET SOME RAINFALL IN NEW ORLEANS TONIGHT AND SOME GUSTYTY WINDS. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WILL LOSE POWER FROM THIS. MARCO --ST JUST GOT TORN APART. WEGN WILL END IT WITH THAT. IT WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM. IT WILL WEAKEN AND DISSIPATE. THAT BRINGS US TO LAURA. THIS STORM HAS BEEN VERY RESILIENT. IT WENT OVER THE TOP OF 6 TO 10,000 FOOT MOUNTAINS OVER DOMINICAN REPUBLIC IN HAITI. IT STILL HELDENRE TOGETHER. SO NOW WE ARE AFRAID WHAT IS THIS GOING DO WHEN IT FINALLY CLEARS CUBA INTO THE WARM WATERS OF THE GULF? RIGHT NOW WINDSK RE ARE AT 60 MILES PER HOUR. IT SHOULD START INTENSIFYING OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND THEN ALL DAY TOMORROW, ALL DAY WEDNESDAY AND THEN THE LANDFALL. NOTICE HURRICANE CENTER HAS IT GRADUALLY RAMPING UP MAKING LANDFALL AT MAYBE 105 TO 110 MILE PER HOUR WINDS. THAT IS A SERIOUS STORM. THAT IS BORDERING ON A MAJOR HURRICANE. SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE VERYAN CONCERNED ON WHERE IT IS GOING TO GO. THEN IT RAINS ITSELF OUT. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH THAT STORM SURGE AND WHERE THES  LANDFALL WILL BE. HERE IS SOME OF OUR SPAGHETTI MODELS. THEY ARE STILL INDA BETWEEN NEW ORLEANS AND HOUSTON. THEY ARE REALLY PINPOINTING THE TEXAS-LOUISIANA BORDER. IF ANYTHING I THINK THIS MAY SHIFT A LITTLE CLOSER TO HOUSTON AND GALVESTON THAN NEW% ORLEANS IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. WE WILL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. HERE IS A BUNCH MORE. THIS IS OUR AMERICAN COMPUTER MODEL. THIS IS LIKE PULLING BACK THE CUR SDPAN SHOWING YOU STUFF THAT ALL THE WEATHER GEEKS LOOK AT. YOU CAN SEE KIND OF THE DIFFERENCE. IT IS ALL IN THE GENERAL VICINITY. THAT IS WHILE PORT ARTHUR, THST STARTING TOMORROW MORNING THEY ARE STARTING EVACUATIONS. I THINK THEY ARE POSSIBLY EVEN THE GALVESTON AREA -- THEYEY WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SOME EVACUATIONS JUST THIS CASE THIS STORM HEADS YOUR WAY. WE WON'T KNOW TILL PROBABLY ABOUT THIS TIME TOMORROW. JUST CAUSE MARCO WIMPED OUT ON US, NO ONE COMPLAINED. DOESN'T MEAN LAURA WILL DO THE SAME THING. WE COULD BE DEALING WITH A MAJOR HURRICANE LANDFALL IN THE U.S.R EROD IN A LITTLE MORE THAN 48 HOURS.  BILL, WE ARE HOPING THAT WILL NOT BE THE CASE. I DO HAVE TO SAY THOUGH EVEN IF IT IS, YOU WILL PROBABLY BE THE FIRST PERSON IN THE ENTIRE YEAR -- 2020, TO COME AND BRING US GOOD NEWS. WE ARE APPRECIATIVE FOR THE GOOD NEWS ON MARCO THERE. THAT WAS A GREAT ONE TODAY. MAYBE YOU WILL HAVE SOME MORE GOOD NEWS TOMORROW.  MAYBE. GOOD SEEING YOU. BU THE RNC WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO BE IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA. THAT IS DUVAL COUNTY WHICHCH PRESIDENT TRUMP WON BACK INDE 2016. AS PART% OF OUR COUNTY TO COUNTY SERIES NBC NEWS NOW ASKED VOTERS HOW THEY ARE FEELING HEADING INTO THIS ELECTION.  I THINK THE -- THE STATE SIN VESTING FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THE BIDEN WIN. THEN THERE IS SOMETHING FOR IT TO RALLY AROUND. IF YOU GET TRUMP FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS IT COULD BE THE DOWNFALL.  IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHETHER IT WAS TRUMP OR PENCE OR -- OR ANY REPUBLICAN. WE ARE VOTING ONW SUCH DIFFERENT MENTALITIES IN AMERICA THESE DAYS. ANYBODY COULD BEBE THIS THAT SEAT. I'M JUST GOING TO VOTE FOR A SMALLER GOVERNMENT, SAFER STREET, BACKING THE POLICE, KEEPING OUR BORDERS SECURE, LESS GOVERNMENT ANDTH MORE INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND MORE INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY.  THIS DOESN'T RESEMBLE THE PARTY I JOINED. I AM HOPING THAT THIS IS A RESET KIND OF ELECTION. IE AM GOING TO SUPPORT BIDEN.  I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN 2020 THATAM THERE ARE A LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE AS OPEN ABOUT WHAT THEY WILL VOTE FOR BUT WILL BEBE CASTING THEIR BALLOTS FOR JOE BIDEN. I THINK THATBA -- THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF WHAT THEY EXPECTED THEY WERE GOING TO GET FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT BEEN WHAT THEY WANT AND THAT JOE BIDEN IS OFFERING THEM AN ALTERNATIVE TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK.  WE HEARD FROM SOME VOTERS THERE, HOW DO FOLKS FEEL THERE ABOUT LOSING THE RNC?  HEY, ALLISON. WELL THIS AREA HAS BEEN HIT PRETTY HARD BY THE ECONOMIC FALL OUT FROM THE VIRUS AND BY THE VIRUS ITSELF AND THE BUSINESS OWNERS I TALKED TO SAID ITS BEEN A BIG LOSS. ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU HEARD FROM THERE -- HE SAID THAT THE RNC WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE THE SUPER BOWL IN TERMS OF THE BOOST IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS ECONOMY. HE SAID T HE WAS ALSO RELIEVED IT WOULDN'T COME HERE BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL DIVISIONS IN THIS COUNTY THAT HE FELT IT MIGHT EXACERBATE. THERE IS A REASON THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON DUVAL COUNTY. LOCALS SAY THE FARTHER NORTH YOU GO, THE MORE SOUTH YOUONON GET MEANING THIS AREA HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLYLI CONSERVATIVE. NORTH FLORIDA% IS HOW REPUBLICANS WIN ELECTIONS. THAT NARROW VICTORY WAS A BITTE OF A RED FLAG AND EVEN BIGGER RED FLAG THOUGH WAS IN 2018 WHEN T DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE ANDREW TOOK THIS COUNTY WHICH SENT SHOCK WAVES THROUGH THE GOP. IT WAS A FIRST SINCE 1980. SO TH THIS AREA HAS SEEN SOME SHIFTS THATT COULD PULL SOME HEAD WIND FOR DONALD TRUMP. THAT COULD SPELL SOME PROBLEMS. THIS IS THE SORT OF DEMOGRAPHIC HE HAS BEEN HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH. OF COURSE HE STILL HAS A STRONG BASE OF SUPPORT HERE AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF REPUBLICANS I TALKED TO HERE AS WELL THAT SAID I MAY NOT LIKE WHAT HE SAYS OR WHAT HE TWEETS BUT ITS BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE. ALLISON.  YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING THE COUNTRY AHEAD OF THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. HOW DOES WHAT YOU ARE HEARING THERE IN JACKSONVILLE STACK UP AGAINST SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTIES YOU HAVE BEEN VISITING?  I HEARD A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT MADE ME THINK I WAS HAVING DEJA VU WITH WHAT I'VE BEEN HERING IN A COUNTY PRETTY FAR AWAY FROM HERE, KENT COUNTY, MICHIGAN. YOU ARE SEEING SIMILAR TRENDS IN BOTH ENDS OF THESE PLACES PARTICULARLY IN THE SUBURBS AND BOTH AREAS HAVE THIS -- THIS -- THIS SLICE OF THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE. THESE MORE MODERATE REPUBLICANS WHO SAY THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS IT IS TODAY AS THE PARTY THEY JOINED AND THAT THEY GREW UP WITH. IT WAS STRIKING, ALLISON, TO HEAR ALMOST THE TH SAME WORDS COME OUT OF PEOPLE'S MOUTHS HERE AS I HEARD IN MICHIGAN. BUT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, THERE IS STILL A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP HERE. I SPOKE WITH THE GOP COUNTY CHAIR WHO SAID THAT -- EVEN THOUGH THE RNC DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE, THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE WERE BUILDING OUT IN PREPARATION FOR IT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO THEM G BECAUSE THEY HAVE REALLY BUILT UP THEIR GROUND GAME. THEY HAVE ADDED THOUSANDS MORETH VOLUNTEERS AS A RESULT OF THAT PREPARATION FOR THE RNC. HE THINKS THAT COULDD BE PRETTYCO INFLUENTIAL IN GETTING MORE VOTERS AND REALLY BEEFEN UPP THE GROUND GAME AHEAD OF NOVEMBER. ALLISON.  IT HAS BEEN FASCINATING HEARING FROM VOTERS IN EVERY COUNTY YOU HAVE VISITED SO FAR. THIS TIME IN DUVAL AND JACKSONVILLE, THANK YOU SO MUCH SHARING YOUR POINT OF VIEW.  WE HAVE MORE COMING FOR YOU, DON'T WORRY. NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL MAKING A SERIES OF COURT FILINGS INVESTIGATING PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT FOR INVESTIGATIONS JOINING ME NOW. WHAT IS THE NEW YORK AG INVESTIGATING?  THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST KEPT SECRETS IN NEW YORK INVESTIGATIVE AND POLITICAL CIRCLES. WE ARE TAKING A LOOK AT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. THIS KIND OF STEMS IN A LARGE PART FROM MICHAEL COHEN'S TESTIMONY. IT IS THIS IDEA THAT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION HAS AT DIFFERENT TIMES ACCORDING TO WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SAYING HAS AT DIFFERENT TIMES EITHER INFLATED THEIR ASSETS OR FINANCIALS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO OBTAIN A LOAN OR THEY HAVE DEFLATED THOSE ASSETS AND THOSE FINANCIAL RECORDS IN ORDER TO GET A TAX BREAK. IT HAS BEEN AN OOETSER OR, WAY IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE FOR THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT IS A GROUP OF TRUMP PROPERTIES BOTH IN NEW YORK. WALL STREET IS ONE OF THE ONES FOLKS WILL KNOW THAT IS ANOTHER PROPERTY IN WEST CHESTER COUNTRY AND ON TOP OF THAT A PROPERTY IN LOS ANGELES. SOME OTHER FINANCIAL DEALINGS AS WELL. KIND OF THE HEART OF THIS HERE, ALLISON, IF WE CAN STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT, IS A FIGHT OVER ERIC TRUMP'S TESTIMONY. ERIC TRUMP HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED THIS THIS CASE. THEY HAVE CALLED FOR HIS TESTIMONY AND THAT IS ONE OF THE KIND OF THE KEY REASONS WHY WE ARE AT WHERE WE ARE AT TODAY WITH RESPECT TO -- THIS PARTICULAR FILING AND WHILE THIS IS COMING INTO THE PUBLIC VIEW.  TOM, ANY RESPONSE FROM THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION? ANYTHING FROM ERIC TRUMP YET?  WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO THEM BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THIS FILING ERIC TRUMP WAS SCHEDULED IN LATE JULY TO SPEAK TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AS PART OF THE SUBPOENA. HE SAID HE WOULD AND THEN RETRACTED THAT. HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOME ASSURANCES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CRIMINAL CHARGES. AT THAT POINT ERIC TRUMP SAID THROUGH HIS ATTORNEYS THAT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION -- NO, I'M NOT GOING TO COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY. WE REACHED OUT TO HIS SIDE. WE REACHED OUT TO HIS ATTORNEYS AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND HAVE YET TO HEAR BACK. WE WILL UPDATE EVERYBODY OF COURSE IF WE HEAR FROM THEM AND HEAR THEIR RESPONSE TO THESE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.  ALL RIGHT, TOM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE UPDATE TODAY.  OF COURSE. YOU GOT IT. THEY ARE REPUBLICAN AND THEY ARE BACKING BIDEN AND HARRIS. MORE THAN TWO DOZEN FORMER REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ENDORSING JOE BIDEN TODAY. MIKE, WHO WERE SOME OF THE BIG NAMES REPUBLICANS THROWING THEIR SUPPORT BEHIND BIDEN?  YEAH, PRETTY LONG LIST IN FACT. SOME OF THEM ARE NOT NECESSARILY SURPRISES. FORMER ILLINOIS CONGRESSMAN HOOD. HE ACTUALLY WAS INVITED AND JOINED OBAMA'S CABINET AS THE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY FOR HIS FIRST TERM. HE WAS ALSO ON THAT LIST. THE BIGGEST NAME I THINK AND MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY SURPRISING BUT -- [ INDISCERNIBLE ] HE ENDORSED JOE BIDEN TODAY. THAT IS JEFF FLAKE. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO IS -- PRETTY BY ALL ACCOUNTS, ALL HIS VOTING RECORDS BOTH IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE CONSIDERED A VERY CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKER. HE REALLY HIT ON A NUMBER OF POINTS AS HE TOOK PART IN A VIRTUAL SPEECH TODAY ENDORSING JOE BIDEN. HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP'S GOVERNING STYLE IS NOT CONSERVATIVE AT ALL. HE TALKED ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN HEALTHYING WHEN HE TOOK PUTIN'S WORD FOR IT AND THAT -- THE U.S. -- HE DID NOT MEDDLE IN THE U.S. ELECTIONS. I THINK ONE OF THE STRIKING THINGS WAS WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS WARNINGS ABOUT A RIGGED ELECTION. LETS TAKE A LISTEN.  IT WAS BAD ENOUGH WHEN FOR MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE ELECTION THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT CLAIMED FALSELY THAT THE COMING ELECTION WOULD BE RIGGED. NOW AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HE HAS SAID AND I QUOTE, THE ONLY WAY WE WILL LOSE THIS ELECTION IS IF THE ELECTION IS RIGGED. WHAT KIND OF PERSON TALKS LIKE THAT? WHAT KIND OF AMERICAN LEADER UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN THE ELECTIONS IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AS PART OF HIS STRATEGY TO HOLD POWER? THIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS TO A FREE SOCIETY AND IT STANDS TO INFLICT LASTING DAMAGE TO OUR DEMOCRACY.  HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT HE HAD BEEN ASKED IN THE PAST WHETHER HE SEE HIMSELF VOTING FOR A DEMOCRAT. HE SAID HE REMINDED US YEARS AGO HE SAID IF DEMOCRAT NOMINATED SOMEBODY LIKE JOE BIDEN I WOULD CONSIDER VOTING FOR A DEMOCRAT. AS HE PUT IT, WELL THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS NOMINATED JOE BIDEN. HE CALLED HIM A MAN OF DECENCY. IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR -- ONE OF JEFF FLAKE'S CLOSEST FRIENDS IN THE HOUSE, WHEN THEY SERVED TOGETHER THERE, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. THIS IS A REAL SERIOUS FIND AND OF COURSE IT IS VERY MUCH TIMED ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.  YEAH, THAT IS A PRETTY BIG STATEMENT THERE. THEY DID THEIR FIRST JOINT INTERVIEW OVER THE WEEKEND. WOULD YOU SHARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS.  THIS IS THE FIRST CHANCE WE HAVE HAD TO SEE THEM SIT DOWN NEXT TO EACH OTHER SINCE THE END OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION LAST WEEK. THEY HIT ON A NUMBER OF POINTS. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT DEBATE MOMENT THEY HAD IN MIAMI, WHY DID FORMER VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN CHOOSE KAMALA HARRIS GIVEN SOME OF THE HARD FEELINGS ABOUT THAT? THEY BOTH MADE IT CLEAR THAT THAT WAS A MOMENT IN THE DEBATE THAT THEY -- ACTUALLY BIDEN SAYING HE RESPECTS THE FACT SHE HAS DIFFERENT VIEWS. PERHAPS SHE UNDERSTANDS MORE KNEW ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND WHY THAT MAYBE WAS AN UNFAIR ATTACK. HE TALKED ABOUT HIS TAX POLICY. HE MADE IT CLEAR HE WOULD NOT RAISE TAXES FOR ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. HIS FOCUS WOULD BE ON HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES. OF COURSE THE MASK MANDATE. HE DID SAY IF HE WAS PRESIDENT AND THE MEDICAL ADVISORS HE HAD TOLD HIM HE HAD TO SHUT THE COUNTRY DOWN IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE VIRUS, HE WOULDN'T HESITATE TO DO THAT. LETS TAKE A LISTEN TO ANOTHER PART OF THE INTERVIEW.  WATCH ME. MR. PRESIDENT, WATCH ME. LOOK AT US BOTH WHAT WE SAY, WHAT WE DO, WHAT WE CONTROL, WHAT WE KNOW, WHAT KIND OF SHAPE WE ARE IN. COME ON. LOOK, I THINK IT IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION TO ASK ANYBODY OVER 70 YEARS OLD WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE FIT AND WHETHER THEY ARE READY. I JUST -- ONLY I CAN SAY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IT IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION TO ASK ANYBODY. WATCH ME.  YOU HAVE TO LOVE THE HAND MOVEMENT THERE. WATCH ME, THE IMITATION THERE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.  THAT AND CAMILA LAUGHING. I LOVE IT.  WE ALSO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS LAST WEEK. I WANTED TO MENTION IT. HE WOULDN'T SAY WHO WAS PLAYING DONALD TRUMP IN THOSE DEBATES. WOULDN'T GIVE THAT ANSWER YET.  ALL RIGHT. THIS WILL DRAG ON. I CAN TELL. WE WILL KEEP CHECKING IN WITH YOU ABOUT IT. MIKE WITH THE LATEST ON THE BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN. THANKS SO MUCH.

TONIGHT THE U.S. SHATTERING THE RECORD FOR MOST COVID CASES IN A SINGLE DAY.  FROM EVERY ANGLE.  WHAT IS YOUR LEVEL OF CONCERN?  ON THE GROUND.  DO YOU HAVE FAITH THAT THIS IS GOING TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE SOON?  HERE IN PORTLAND MORE PROTESTS EXPECTED TO NIGHT.  DO YOU THINK POLICE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE UNDER ATTACK?  NBC NIGHTLY NEWS WITH LESTER HOLT. THE NEWS BUSINESS IS DYNAMIC AND PROBABLY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. WITH ALL WE ARE FACING I AM SO PROUD TO BRING THE PERSPECTIVE OF A BLACK WOMAN, A DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS -- A PROUD NERD AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EMERGING AMERICA TO CABLE TV NEWS. I HOPE THE GREAT AND MAY MOM WILL LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND BE PROUD. A PRETTY SPICY % HEARING. POST MASTER GENERAL LEWIS TESTIFYING AGAIN THIS TIME BEFORE THE DEMOCRATIC LED HOUSE OVER SIGHT COMMITTEE. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT JOINS ME NOW. A BIT MORE FIRE WORKS TODAY. HOW DID HE DEFEND HIS MANAGEMENT?  HE WAS VERY DEFENSIVE TODAY. A LOT MORE DEFENSIVE THAN HE WAS ON FRIDAY. TODAY HE -- HE WENT AFTER HIMSELF FOR HIS HANDLING OF THE POST OFFICE AND DISMISSED HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOME OF THE CHANGES MADE.  I DID NOT DIRECT THE REMOVAL OF BLUE COLLECTION BOXESER TO REMOVAL OF MAIL PROCESSING EQUIPMENT. SECOND, I DID NOT DIRECT A CUT BACK ON HOURS AT THINK OF OUR POSTAL OFFICES. AND FINALLY, I DID NOT DIRECT THE ELIMINATION OR ANY CUT BACK IN OVERTIME. I DID HOWEVER SUSPEND THESE PRACTICES TO REMOVE ANY MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT OUR COMMITMENT TO DELIVERING THE NATION'S ELECTION MAIL. ANY FURTHER ASSERTIONS BY THE MEDIA OR ELECTED OFFICIALS IS FURTHERING A FALSE NARRATIVE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  WELL POSTAL WORKERS AND -- THE POSTAL UNION CONTRADICT WHAT -- POST MASTER IS SAYING ABOUT THE ACTIONS HE TOOK. THEY DO SAY IN FACT HE DID MAKE THESE CHANGES THAT AFFECTED THE DELIVERY OF MAIL. HE ALSO SAID HE HAD NO ROLE IN ATTEMPTING TO SABOTAGE THE UPCOMING ELECTION. NOW I WANT TO TALK TO YOU -- THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES HERE THAT HAVE BEEN COMBINED. ONE IS THE -- [ INDISCERNIBLE ] WHICH HAS LONG BEEN AN ISSUE. BUT, HE CAME TO THE HELM. SINCE THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ATTACKING THE POSTAL SERVICE AND MAIL IN BALLOTING, THAT HAS BECOME A MAJOR FOCUS. THE PRESIDENT TWEETED IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS HEARING AGAIN ABOUT MAIL IN BALLOTING SAYING IT IS A FRAUD AND IT WILL BE A BIG MESS. AND SO ONE DEMOCRAT TOLD ME RECENTLY THAT HE PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN BEEN IN THE HOT SEAT IF THE PRESIDENT DID NOT ELEVATE THIS ISSUE AND CAUSE DEMOCRATS I SPECIALLY TO QUESTION THE INCENTIVE AND THE MOTIVATION BEHIND SOME OF THESE CHANGES, ALLISON.  YEAH, WE JUST KEEP HEARING THAT ARGUMENT ABOUT MAIL IN VOTING FRAUD FROM THE PRESIDENT. IT SOME LIKE THAT ONE IS NOT GOING TO STOP AS WE GET CLOSER TO NOVEMBER. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT A HEATED EXCHANGE BETWEEN THEM OVER THE MAIL SORTING MACHINE. THIS IS PRETTY GOOD. TELL US ABOUT IT.  WELL MAIL SORTING MORE THAN 600 MAIL SORTING MACHINES HAVE EITHER BEEN TAKEN OFFLINE OR DISASSEMBLED. THAT WAS PART OF THE PLAN THAT HAD BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW SINCE BEFORE HE STARTED. SO WHAT PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING IS THE TIMING OF IT. AND HERE IS WHAT CONGRESSMAN LYNCH -- LETS PLAY THEIR EXCHANGE. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]  NO, I WILL. NO YOU WILL NOT. YOU WILL NOT.  WELL, THERE YOU GO.  THERE I GO WHAT? [ INDISCERNIBLE ]  ORDER. ORDER. ORDER.  WELL, AS YOU COULD SEE HE WAS EXTREMELY DEFIANT THAT HE WILL NOT EVEN PICK UP THE PLUG AND ALLOW HIS PEOPLE TO PLUG THOSE MACHINES BACK IN. LATER ON IN THE HEARING THERE IS AN EXCHANGE WITH ANOTHER CONGRESSMAN OF CALIFORNIA WHO SAID -- EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY, JUST FOR THE OPTICS TO CONVINCE PEOPLE AND TO ASSURE PEOPLE THAT EVERYTHING IS BEING DONE TO ENSURE A SAFE AND FAIR AND EFFICIENT ELECTION, WHY WON'T YOU DO IT? HE SAID BECAUSE CONGRESS CAN'T GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND GIVE US THE MONEY WE NEED. THE END OF THAT EXCHANGE FINALLY ENDED WITH FINE, IF YOU GIVE -- HIM SAYING FINE IF YOU GIVE ME $1 BILLION WE WILL PLUG IT BACK IN. HE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS -- UH ----MORE AN ADVANCEMENT OF WHAT HE IS SAYING AND SAID OKAY, FINE, WE WILL WORK ON GIVE YOU THAT $1 BILLION IN THE NEXT -- FEW WEEKS. ALLISON.  OH DEFINITELY ENTERTAINING. LET ME YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? DOES THIS HAVE ANY HOPE IN THE SENATE?  IT DOESN'T. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL HAS ALREADY SAID HE IS NOT GOING TO BRING IT UP BECAUSE HIS EXCUSE WAS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ISSUED A VETO THREAT AND WILL NOT SIGN IT INTO LAW. MCCONNELL'S M.O. HAS ALWAYS BEEN NOT TO -- BRING UP LEGISLATION THAT WON'T GET INSIDE BY THE PRESIDENT. MAYBE THAT IS HIS M.O. OR THAT IS THE EXCUSE HE IS HIDING BEHIND. IT LOOKS LIKE THE WORK THAT THE HOUSE DID -- WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE AND THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BATTLE IN WASHINGTON AS -- AS THE ELECTION GETS CLOSER AND AS THIS PROGRESSES. ALLISON.  ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FORGETTING US UP TO SPEED.  THANK YOU. THE VICE PRESIDENT OF PENNSYLVANIA'S POSTAL WORKER'S UNION SLAMMING THE POST MASTER GENERAL. NBC NEWS REPORTER JOINING ME FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA.  SO KEVIN GALLAGHER, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE POSTAL WORKER'S UNION HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, WAS REALLY ADAMANT HE WAS LOOKING FOR AN EXPLANATION FROM HIM TODAY ABOUT WHY HE ISSUED THE CUTS HE DID WITHOUT GOING THROUGH CONGRESS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS WRITTEN INTO THE CONSTITUTION. HE DID NOT DO THAT. IN HIS EYES HE SAID WHY ISN'T HE LOOKING TO INCREASE REVENUE? WHY IS ONLY FOCUSED ON CUTTING THE BUDGET VERSUS TRYING TO MAKE THE REVENUE MORE PROFITABLE AND MAKE THE USD S A BETTER BUSINESS? HE SAID IF HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE POSTAL SERVICE WORKS, HE IS WORRIED THERE IS POLITICAL INTENT BEHIND WHAT HE IS DOING SAYING THE USDS SEEMS TO BE POLITICALIZED. TAKE LISTEN TO WHAT HE TOLD ME YESTERDAY.  I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS POST MASTER GENERAL CAME IN -- EVERY PIECE, EVERYDAY, 35 YEARS I'VE WORKED IN THE POST OFFICE, EVERY PIECE EVERYDAY. NOW EVERYONE IS BEING TOLD THAT DOESN'T COUNT, THAT WE ARE CHANGING. JUST TRYING TO DEAL WITH LOGISTICS IS RIDICULOUS. YOU DEPRIVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. POSTAL WORKERS TAKE PRIDE IN WHAT THEY DO. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, EVERYONE TAKES PRIDE AND EVERYBODY IS -- CAN LIVE BY THAT MOTTO. SUDDENLY THAT IS GONE. YOU ARE DEPRIVING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OF THE SERVICE THEY DESERVE.  SO WHAT YOU HEARD THERE A LOT OF FRUSTRATION FROM ONE OF THE KEY LEADERS HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. HE SAID THAT A GOOD START WOULD BE TO ISSUE THAT $25 BILLION AND GET TO TO THE SENATE BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT DOESN'T SEEM TOO LIKELY.  WE KNOW PENNSYLVANIA IS A KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THE POSTAL UNION IS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IN THIS ELECTION?  YEAH, SO THE U.S.DS ISSUED LETTERS TO SEVERAL STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT BASICALLY SAID THAT THEY CAN'T ADD HERE TO THE ELECTION OFFICIAL'S GUIDELINES AND DEADLINES TO MAKE SURE THAT BALLOTS ARRIVE ON TIME. SO THAT IS A TOP CONCERN AMONG ELECTION OFFICIALS AND POSTAL WORKERS. THEY DON'T WANT TO GET BLAMED FOR SOMEONE'S BALLOT NOT GETTING THERE IN TIME. BALLOT DROP OFF BOXES ARE SOMETHING THAT PENNSYLVANIA HAS TRIED TO IMPLEMENT BACK BACK DURING THE PRIMARY. IT WAS RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL. NOW THE CAMPAIGN IS SUING PENNSYLVANIA OVER IT. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PUSH BACK FROM TRUMP HIMSELF AND THE CAMPAIGN WHETHER IT COMES TO MAIL IN VOTING, THE BALLOT DROP BOXES AND HE IS REALLY FOCUSSING IN ON THIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN. HE TWEETED -- HE SAID -- THAT ALL THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DO WHAT THE POST OFFICE HEARINGS IS BLAME THE REPUBLICANS FRAUD THAT WILL OCCUR BECAUSE 51 MILLION BALLOTS THAT ARE BEING SENT TO PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T EVEN REQUESTED THEM. THEY ARE SETTING THE TABLE FOR WHAT HE CALLS A BIG MESS. THOSE 51 MILLION BALLOTS HE IS TALKING ABOUT -- SEVERAL STATES ARE SENDING OUT APPLICATIONS. IT IS NOT THE BALLOTS THEMSELVES. THEY ARE HOPING TO ELIMINATE ONE OF THOSE STEPS IN THE BACK AND FORTH THAT IS REQUIRED TO GET YOUR MAIL IN BALLOT.  OH, SO MANY CONCERNS ABOUT THOSE MAIL IN BALLOTS WHETHER FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO GET THEM IN ON TIME, WHETHER THE POSTAL SERVICE WHETHER BE ABLE TO PROCESS THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANKS, ALLISON.  [MUSIC PLAYING] ARE YOU HEADING TO THE POLL OR THE POST OFFICE? HOW YOU VOTE IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION MIGHT BE CONFUSING THIS YEAR. WE HAVE YOUR BACK. JUST GO TO NBCNEWS.COM/PLANYOU. WE HAVE INFORMATION FROM EVERY THINGS ON VOTING RULES AND DEADLINES AND RESTRICTIONS. CHECK IT OUT PRESIDENT TRUMP, VICE PRESIDENT PENCE NOMINATED FOR A SECOND TERM THIS AFTERNOON KICKING OFF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. THEY SPOKE THIS MORNING IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA AFTER AN IN PERSON ROLE CALL VOTE MAKING THEIR CASE TO KEEP THE OVAL OFFICE COME NOVEMBER.  THE JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE BEEN OVER TAKEN BY THE RADICAL LEFT. IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST FOUR MORE YEARS TO DRAIN THAT SWAMP.  EVERYONE WE HAVE TO WATCH BECAUSE BAD THINGS HAPPENED LAST TIME WITH THIS SPYING ON OUR CAMPAIGN. THAT GOES TO BIDEN AND THAT GOES TO OBAMA. WE HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL, WE HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL. THIS TIME THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IT WITH A WHOLE POST OFFICE SCAM. THIS IS IT. OUR COUNTRY CAN GO IN A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE DIRECTION OR ON AN EVEN GREATER DIRECTION.  NBC NEWS POLITICAL REPORTER MONICA JOINING ME NOW FROM CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA. MONICA, WHAT ELSE HAS PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY TODAY?  HI THERE, ALLISON. APOLOGIES FOR THE NOISE. THEY ARE LITERALLY ALREADY DISMANTLING WHAT THEY HAD SET UP FOR THE CHARLOTTE CONVENTION BECAUSE THE REALITY IS, ITS OVER. IT WAS ABOUT FIVE HOURS OF OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONVENTION BUSINESS HERE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT MAKING THOSE SURPRISE APPEARANCES AND REMARKS TO DELEGATES. REALLY THE METAPHOR IS QUITE STRONG. CHARLOTTE IS OVER. NOW ALL THE ACTION MOVES OVER TO WASHINGTON FOR REALLY THEIR REMAINDER OF THIS BLOCKBUSTER WEEK OF SPEECHES AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. HERE IN CHARLOTTE IT WAS SO NOTABLE THE PRESIDENT TOOK THE STAGE AND DELIVERED ESSENTIALLY A CAMPAIGN RALLY LIKE SPEECH. HE SPOKE FOR NEARLY 50 MINUTES TOUCHING ON A KIND OF IMPORTANT 2020 TOPIC. I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LISTEN SPECIFIC LIKE TO WHAT HE SAID IN TERMS OF NORTH CAROLINA AND THE CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES HERE IN THE STATE CURRENTLY.  JOE BIDEN WHO IS GOING TO HAVE THE NEXT CONVENTION IN MILWAUKEE AND THEY DIDN'T GO THERE AT ALL. THEY DIDN'T DO THIS. WE DID OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOUR STATE. IF YOU HAD A GOVERNOR THAT WOULD HAVE LET US HAVE SOME PEOPLE, HE SAID ACCORDING TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THE MOST PEOPLE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE IN THAT ROOM, MEANING THAT ARENA, HE VIEWED IT AS A ROOM IS TEN PEOPLE. I SAID SO GOVERNOR, SO I'M AT 19,000, YOU ARE AT 10. CAN WE WORK SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE? IT DIDN'T SOUND TOO GOOD.  ALLISON, YOU AND I HAVE TALKED REPEATEDLY ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES THIS CONVENTION WAS UPROOTED, MOVED TO FLORIDA, BACK TO CHARLOTTE. THERE WAS A QUESTION MARK OF WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND OF COURSE THAT IS BECAUSE THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC HAS REALLY HUNG OVER THE ENTIRETY OF THIS EVENT. THE PRESIDENT DID WANT TO COME TO CHARLOTTE ULTIMATELY TO THANK THAT SMALLER FOOTPRINT OF DELEGATES. HE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO SLAM THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHO WAS THE ONE WHO OF COURSE SAID INITIALLY I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE AN EVENT WITH 19,000 PEOPLE BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE SOCIAL DISTANCE AND NEED PEOPLE BE WEARING MASKS. THAT IS WHEN THE PRESIDENT I DON'T LIKE THAT SO I WILL YANK THE CONVENTION AND MOVE IT TO FLORIDA. WE KNOW HE TO CANCEL THE FLORIDA EVENT BECAUSE OVER HOW BAD THE PANDEMIC WAS IN JACKSONVILLE AND HERE WE ARE. WE SAW THE USE WAS INCONSISTENT WITH MASKS. THEY WERE TRYING TO SOCIALLY DISTANT. THIS IS A HUGE INDOOR GATHERING. IT IS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING CHARLOTTE HAS SEEN ALL SUMMER. THE RNC DID TAKE A LOT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS. THEY SAID THEY TESTED EVERYBODY TWICE. THEY HAD TO BE TESTED NEGATIVE BEFORE ARRIVING AND THEN UPON ARRIVAL THEY WERE TESTED. REALLY JUST UNDER SCORED HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DO THESE POLITICAL CONVENTIONS DURING A PANDEMIC. IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE SAW WITH DEMOCRATS LAST WEEK WHO HELD ALMOST ALL OF IT AS YOU KNOW VIRTUALLY.  YEAH, BASED ON WHAT YOU HEARD SO FAR, BASED ON THIS AFTERNOON'S EVENTS, WHAT ARE THE MAIN THEMES? WHAT ARE THE MESSAGES WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE THROUGHOUT THE CONVENTION THIS WEEK?  THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRIED TO TELEGRAPH A VERY OPTIMISTIC MESSAGE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THIS WEEK. THEN PRESIDENT CAME OUT AND OFFERED SOME RHETORIC THAT REALLY AT BEST CAN BE DESCRIBED AS QUITE DARK AND DIVISIVE WARNING OF THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION SAYING THE ONLY WAY HE LOSES IS IF ITS RIGGED ASK RAILING AGAINST UNIVERSAL MAIL IN VOTING WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY EVIDENCE ABOUT CLAIMS HE MAKES ABOUT VOTER FRAUD. IT IS HARD TO SQUARE WHAT THEY SAID WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH WHAT WE ALREADY SAW IN THESE FIRST FEW HOURS. PRIME TIME COULD BE A DIFFERENT STORY. TONIGHT THE THEME IS LAND OF PROMISE. YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT SPEAKERS IN THE CLOSING PRIME TIME COVETED SLOT. IT WILL BE SENATOR TIM SCOTT. THE ONLY REPUBLICAN BLACK SENATOR OF COURSE WHO IS A TRUMP ALLY. SOMEBODY WHO HAS WORKED WITH HIM ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM FOR EXAMPLE. WE WILL BE HEARING ABOUT THAT TONIGHT. WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT'S ELDEST SON DONALD TRUMP JR. WHO ARE BE APPEARING. AGAIN ITS NOTABLE THIS ALL TAKES PLACE IN WASHINGTON FROM THE MAIL IN AUDITORIUM WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE. WE WON'T ACTUALLY SEE THE WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS USED AS THAT POLITICAL BACKDROP TILL TOMORROW THAT WE ARE TOLD THERE COULD BE SOME SURPRISES. WE DO EXPECT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT OF PROGRAMMING. TONIGHT WE ARE TOLD HE WILL APPEAR WITH FRONT LINE WORKERS AND HE WILL TRY TO MAKE A POINT ALSO ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THAT IS ONE THING TO LOOK FOR BUT THERE COULD BE OTHERS SURPRISES. THE OTHER THEMES FOR THE WEEK ARE OPPORTUNITY AND GREATNESS. YOU WILL SEE A DIFFERENT MESSAGE EACH DAY. WE CAN'T UNDER SCORE THIS ENOUGH, ALLISON. IF TODAY IS ANY PREVIEW, IT MAY NOT BE EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE SCRIPTING CAUSE THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO LOVES TO GO OFF SCRIPT.  SURE DOES. LETS UNWIND TO THIS MORNING JUST HOURS BEFORE THE RNC STARTED. ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S LONGEST SERVING MOST TRUSTED ADVISORS ANNOUNCING SHE IS LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?  YEAH, THIS WAS PRETTY SHOCKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE ORBIT OF THE PRESIDENT IN TERMS OF SOMEBODY WHO IS SO CLOSE TO HIM, ADVISING HIM IN SUCH AN INTENSE CAPACITY ON MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES. SHE'S THE FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER WHO IN THE FINAL MONTHS OF 2016 LED THEM TO VICTORY AND ULTIMATELY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. SHE IS SOMEBODY THAT HAS BEEN PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE. SHE'S TAKING A STEP BACK SHE SAYS TO FOCUS ON FAMILY. THAT IS HER PRIORITY AND WE ACTUALLY ARE JUST LEARNING THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WANTED TO HAVE HER BACK. THEY WANTED TO SEE IF SHE COULD COME HELP AND BE A MAIN SURROGATE. SHE DEBATED THAT. SHE DECIDED AGAINST IT BECAUSE SHE DOES WANT TO BE SPENDING MORE TIME WITH HER FOUR TEENAGE CHILDREN. THIS WILL BE HER LAST WEEK AT THE WHITE HOUSE. SHE WILL BE DEPARTING AT THE END OF THE MONTH. SHE IS STILL EXPECTED TO ADDRESS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION IN REMARKS ON WEDNESDAY. SHE'S ACTUALLY IN THE WEST WING TODAY WORKING ON THOSE REMARKS AND SHE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVISE THE PRESIDENT WE UNDERSTAND IN AN INFORMAL CAPACITY. ALLISON.  ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  YOU GOT IT. OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION STARTS TONIGHT AT 8:00 P.M. EASTERN WITH CHUCK TODD FOLLOWED BY NETWORK PRIME TIME SPECIAL AT 10:00 P.M. EASTERN. YOU CATCH IT ALL RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW. BUSINESS WINDOWS, BROKEN, CITY TRUCKS BURNED OUT TO THE DAY AFTER A NIGHT OF PROTEST IN WISCONSIN. THOSE PROTESTS AFTER POLICE SHOT A BLACK MAN YESTERDAY. A MAN WATCHING THAT SHOOTING FROM HIS WINDOW TOOK THIS VIDEO. IT APPEARS TO SHOW THE MOMENTS JUST BEFORE THE SHOOTING. A WARNING FOR YOU, THE VIDEO COMING UP IS GRAPHIC. IT MAY BE HARD TO WATCH. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]  29-YEAR-OLD JACOB BLAKE WAS SHOT IN THE BACK SEVERAL TIMES AS HE TRIED TO GET INTO THAT PARKED SUV. HIS THREE CHILDREN WERE WATCHING FROM INSIDE THE CAR. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT JOINING ME NOW FROM THERE. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? WHAT DO YOU KNOW SO FAR ABOUT WHAT LED UP TO THAT SHOOTING?  IT SNOT -- IS NOT CLEAR WHAT LED DOWN THAT SHOOTING. AT ABOUT 5:30 P.M. YESTERDAY THEY WERE RESPONDING TO A CALL ABOUT A DOMESTIC INCIDENT. NOW THEY HAVEN'T DESCRIBED IF HE WAS INVOLVED IN THAT INCIDENT. WE KNOW THAT WITNESSES AND HIS PARTNER SAY THAT HE WAS TRYING TO DEESCALATE SOME SITUATION THAT WAS GOING ON. THERE WAS A WITNESS ON THE SCENE THAT TOLD NBC NEWS THERE WERE TWO WOMEN ARGUING FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES AND THAT IS WHEN HE SHOWED UP TO TRY TO DE-ESCALATE AND CALM EVERYTHING DOWN. AT SOME POINT AND WHEN YOU LISTEN TO WHAT HIS PARTNER SAYS, THEY SAY HE -- THE OFFICERS ARRIVE. THERE WAS SOME EXCHANGE. IT WAS INSTANTLY TENSE AND THAT THE TASER WAS DEPLOYED AFTER SOME STRUGGLE. THEN THAT IS WHEN THAT VIDEO PICKS UP WHERE AFTER THE TASER IS DEPLOYED ACCORDING TO WITNESSES MR. BLAKE GOES AROUND THE CAR AND STARTS TO GO INTO THAT CAR WITH HIS THREE KIDS INSIDE. THAT IS WHEN THE SHOOTING OCCURS. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS NO BODY CAMERA VIDEO. THAT IS ACCORDING TO LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO SAY THAT DESPITE PLEAS AND TRIES AND ATTEMPTS FROM THE CITY COUNCIL THERE IS THOUGH BODY CAMERA VIDEO. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT VIDEO IS -- THERE IS. WE JUST HAVE THAT STATEMENT THAT WAS RELEASED LAST NIGHT SAYING THAT THERE WAS A POLICE INVOLVED SHOOTING AS THEY SAY AT THAT TIME IN RESPONSE TO THAT DOMESTIC INCIDENT THAT THEY SAY THEY WERE RESPONDING TO. THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW STILL WAITING FOR A LOT OF ANSWERS TO THOSE BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.  I KNOW WE HAVE TO LET YOU GO. TWO QUICK FOLLOW UPS. FIRST OF ALL, HOW IS BLAKE DOING TODAY? HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE CITY ABOUT THE SHOOTING?  HE IS IN STABLE CONDITION RIGHT NOW. HE DID UNDERGO SURGERY LAST NIGHT. HIS FATHER SAID HE WENT THROUGH THAT SURGERY SUCCESSFULLY AND IS NOW IN THAT STABLE CONDITION. WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY UPDATE FROM THAT SINCE YESTERDAY. I WANT TO PLAY A SOUND FROM HIS PARTNER WHO WAS THERE WHO SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON. LISTEN TO HOW SHE DESCRIBES THAT MOMENT.  THE TWO MALE OFFICERS INSTANTLY LIKE -- DETAINED HIM. LIKE, PUT YOUR HANDS UP -- LIKE NO QUESTIONS OR NONE OF THAT. I'M JUST TRYING TO SIMPLY GET THE KIDS OUT OF THE CAR. I'M LIKE WAIT A MINUTE, LIKE -- HE DIDN'T DO NOTHING WRONG. LIKE -- YOU KNOW, JUST -- ASK HIM QUESTIONS FIRST BEFORE THEN MAN UP AGAINST THE CAR.  IN THE GOVERNOR'S STATEMENT PART OF IT SAID HE WAS PRAYING FOR HIM AND HOPING FOR A FULL RECOVERY. WE STILL ARE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT HIS LATEST CONDITION IS AT THIS POINT. ALLISON.  ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. AMONG THE CHAOS I FOUND A FATHER TRYING TO TEACH HIS SON ABOUT PEACE.  WE DON'T HAVE TO RETALIATE WITH ANGER. WE RETALIATE WITH LOVER. THAT IS WHY WE ARE DOWN HERE. THERE IS ALWAYS ANOTHER WAY. THAT IS ALL I WANT THEM TO SEE. -- ALWAYS ANOTHER WAY. PROTESTERS FEEL THAT THEY NEED TO COME OUT IN FULL FORCE AND SUPPORT THEIR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE NOT GETTING THAT SUPPORT FROM THE POLICE.  ANOTHER ELECTION DAY COMING UP AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF HOW TO KEEP VOTERS SAFE AMID A PANDEMIC.  THE MOMENT THAT TO THE TRULY UNDERSTAND WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE SAY WE ARE IS RIGHT HERE AT OUR FEET. [MUSIC PLAYING] YOU HAVE TO GET A FOUR YEAR DEGREE BUT A FOUR YEAR DEGREE IS SUPER EXPENSIVE.

CLASS ONLY STARTED LAST WEEK AND THE SCHOOL IS ALREADY REPORTING MORE THAN 50 NEW CASES OF COVID-19. A FRATERNITY THERE NOW UNDER QUARANTINE. BLANE ALEXANDER JOINING ME NOW FROM ATLANTA. WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THAT OUTBREAK AT GEORGIA TECH?  LET ME BREAK DOWN THE NUMBERS FOR YOU THERE. THESE NUMBERS -- [ INDISCERNIBLE ] THE LATEST NUMBERS ARE ABOUT 300 CASES, JUST OVER 300. [ INDISCERNIBLE ] [ INDISCERNIBLE ] STILL SOME PEOPLE WE SPOKE TO SAY THEY DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING BACK ON CAMPUS.  WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF STUDENTS AND STAFF WHO ARE BEING BROUGHT BACK TO CAMPUS. I THINK IN GENERAL FACULTY WHO HAS BEEN WARNING ABOUT THIS SINCE JUNE, HOW DANGEROUS IT IS TO REOPEN. I THINK YOU FEEL PRETTY POWERLESS TO PROTECT THEM. IT IS NOT A GOOD FEELING.  NOW I WILL SAY I SPENT TIME ON CAMPUS WHEN THEY WERE MOVING IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. I SPOKE WITH SOME STUDENTS. [ INDISCERNIBLE ] A COUPLE OF THE STUDENTS TOLD ME THEY WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING SO MUCH OF. THEY WERE CONCERNED WHETHER OR NOT THEIR FELLOW STUDENTS WOULD ACTUALLY ABIDE BY THOSE GUIDELINES. ALLISON.  WE KNOW GEORGIA TECH IS NOT ALONE. WE HAVE SEEN VIDEOS OF CROWDED COLLEGE TOWNS LIKE THIS ONE HERE FROM A BAR NEAR AUBURN UNIVERSITY. YOU DON'T SEE ANY MASKS. YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF SOCIAL DISTANCING. WHAT ARE SCHOOLS DOING -- WHAT CAN SCHOOLS DO TO GET THE OFF CAMPUS PARTYING, THE SOCIALIZING UNDER CONTROL?  YEAH. THE MAYOR ANNOUNCED THEY ARE ACTUALLY CLOSING ALL BARS AS OF 5:00 TODAY FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. SO TILL LABOR DAY. THEY EXPECT TO REOPEN IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS. THEY KIND OF WARN UNLESS THEY GET IT UNDER CONTROL, IT COULD JEOPARDIZE -- [ INDISCERNIBLE ] IT IS WARNING THAT STUDENTS COULD HAVE THE -- [ INDISCERNIBLE ]  THEY SAY THEY DON'T WANT ALL OF THOSE CROWDS. THEY ARE BEING REALISTIC WHEN IT COMES TO -- [ INDISCERNIBLE ] THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING INTO THIS SAYING THERE WON'T BE ANY COVID CASES. WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS CONTINUE AS BEST THEY CAN. HERE IS WHAT I HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT OF TULANE. TAKE A LISTEN.  WE UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS THE CITY OF 15,000 TO 20,000 PEOPLE THERE, WILL BE POSITIVE TESTS. AND OUR GOAL REALLY IS TO IDENTIFY THOSE AND -- ISOLATE THOSE INDIVIDUALS VERY QUICKLY. [ INDISCERNIBLE ] ALLISON.  ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  YOU GOT IT. THE FDA ISSUING A NEW EMERGENCY ORDER THAT EXPANDS THE USE OF PLASMA AS A TREATMENT FOR THE CORONAVIRUS BUT HOW EFFECTIVE IS IT SM HERE -- IT?  THERE SHOULD BE NO CONTROVERSY ABOUT PLASMA. THIS IS A THERAPY THAT HAS BEEN USED ACROSS MANY DISEASES FOR MANY DECADES. THE ODDS OF IT -- HURTING YOU ARE CLOSE TO 0. THE ODDS OF HIT HELPING YOU ARE CLOSE TO 100%. THE ONLY ISSUE IS HOW MUCH IT CAN HELP. A 35% REDUCTION IN MORTALITY.  NBC NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT DR. JOHN TORRES JOINING ME NOW. I'M GLAD YOU ARE HERE TO GIVE US A MEDICAL OPINION. THAT WAS A TRADE ADVISOR COMMENTING THERE. LETS HEAR IT FROM A QUALIFIED HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. HOW DOES THIS TREATMENT WORK? HOW RESPECTIVE IS IT? WHAT ARE SOME OF THE POTENTIAL CONCERNS?  GOOD AFTERNOON, ALLISON. FIRST OFF I WILL START WITH THE PLASMA. WHAT THAT IS IS THAT IS A BLOOD PRODUCT. WHEN YOU DONATE BLOOD THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS. THERE IS RED BLOOD CELLS, THERE IS THE PLASMA. WHAT THEY DO IS TAKE THAT LIQUID PART OUT FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD COVID-19. THEY ARE HAVE COVERED AND ARE NOW DONATING BLOOD WHICH IS RICH IN THE ANTIBODIES. THEN THEY USE THAT TO TREAT OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE COVID-19 NOW AND ARE HAVING A HARD TIME RECOVERING. IT GIVES THEM A BOOST OF THOSE ANTIBODIES AND BRIDGES THE GAP TILL THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN TAKE OVER AND THEY CAN RECOVER FROM IT. PART OF THE ISSUE IS THE EFFECTIVENESS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE BEFORE AN -- ANTIBIOTICS CAME ABOUT. HE MENTIONED THE FACT THAT THE ODDS OF IT HELPING ARE CLOSE TO 100%. THAT IS NOT A FACT. THAT IS NOT AT ALL FACTUAL. WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT IS BEING TO HEM -- HELL -- HELP PEOPLE.  DR. JOHN, TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU HERE. IF YOU HAVE HAD THE CORONAVIRUS AND YOU WANT TO DONATE PLASMA CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS? % TELL ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS?% THEN ARE THERE% RESTRICTIONS ON% GAY MEN?%  FIRST QUESTION GO TO A BLOOD DONATION CENTER.% ESPECIALLY IF YOU% HAVE HAD% CENTER, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE HAD COVID-19. THERE PUSHING PEOPLE TO GO AHEAD AND DONATE SO THAT ATTHEY CAN GET THOSE ANTIBODIES. THEY ARE RUNNING THROUGH YOUR CHECKLIST. IT TAKES A UG LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO GET THE PLASMA. THEY TAKE THE PLASMA AND TREAT OTHER PEOPLE. AS FAR AS THE GAME ISSUE, WE TALKED WITH THE AMERICAN RED CROSS TODAY AND THEY SAID THEY ARE ACCEPTING DONATIONS AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT HAD SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH OTHER MEN. THEY ARE ACCEPTING THOSE DONATIONS AT THIS POINT. BUT AGAIN, THERE'S A BIG PUSH TO GET PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD COVID-19 TO DONATE BLOOD TO TRY TO GET THAT CONVALESCENT PLASMA. T  DR. JOHN, ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU BET.  HEY, EVERYONE. I'M ALISON MORRIS. YOU'RE WATCHING NBC NEWS YONOW. LET'S GO TO NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT SAVANNAH SELLERS.

HE WANTED TO COME TO THE NORTH CAROLINA DURING THIS IMPORTANT CONVENTION WEEK AND OF COURSE, THIS IS A BATTLEGROUND STATE. HE WON IT LELAST TIME, IT WOULD BE VERY REPORTED TO HIS PAST TO A POTENTIAL SECOND TERM, ALISON. IT IS. MEANWHILE, A COLLISION OF LEFT-LEANING GROUP IS ASKING TOBIN SIX FOR A ONE MINUTE DELAY IN THE RNC, SO THAT THEY CAN FACT-CHECKED THIS BEACHES IN REALTIME. THE PRESIDENT ALREADY BEING CHECKED CITY. WHAT ARE SOME THE CLAIMS HE HAS MADE SO FAR? YEAR EARLIER, WE HEARD HIM IN A 50 MINUTE SPEECH REALLY WILL AGAINST UNIVERSAL MAIL- IN VOTING. THIS IS SOMETHING HE CONTINUES NSMA%TO CLAIM WITHOUT EVIDENCE, WHICH IS THAT IF PEOPLE VOTE BY MAIL, IT COULD LEAD TO WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD. THAT IS VSIMPLY NOT BACKED UP BY ANY DATA. CK THAT IS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT HAS REPEATED MANY TEMPS. WE SHOULD ANPUT OUT THAT HE HIMSELF VOTES BY MAIL THAT IS HOW REQUESTED HIS BALLOT IN THE FIRST LADY IS WILL THIS YEAR IN FLORIDA AND THAT IS WHERE HE ALREADY, WE UNDERSTAND FROM PALM BEACH COUNTY, THAT BALLOT HAS BEEN RECEIVED AND PROCESSED. SO THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO SAY, ABSENTEE VOTING IS SAFE AND SECURE. BUT NOT MAIL-IN VOTING. THERE REALLY IS NOT A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO. SO THAT WAS ONE AREA. THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAYS THE ONLY WAY HE COULD LOSE THIS ELECTION IS IF IT WAS RIGGED. THAT IS ANOTHER CLAIM HAVE NOW HEARD FOR WEEKS, WHICH REALLY HE DOES NOT HAVE MUCH EVIDENCE FOR. SO THIS WAS A SORT OF OPENING ACT TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION AS THE DELEGATES GATHERED HERE TODAY. BUT THE BL H PRESIDENT WAS REALLY DELIVERING A FAR MORE POLITICAL WA SPEECH THAN %WE MIGHT SEE LATER IN THE WEEK. OF COURSE, E HE IS EXPECTED TO BE A PART OF THE PROGRAMMING EVERY SINGLE NIGHT AND IF THESE COMMENTS WERE A PREVIEW, WE CAN EXPECT A LOT MORE INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC ON THE OTHER NIGHT AS WELL, ALISON. MONICA, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF RENOVATIONS THERE AHEAD OF MB THE RNC. COULD YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT AND ALSO, THE ETHICAL CONCERNS ABOUT  HAVING CONVENTION EVENTS AT THE BOVI WHITE HOUSE? FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WANTED TO DO A RENOVATION OF THE ROSE GARDEN EARLIER IN THE SUMMER. IT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WILL HAPPEN IN ABOUT 60 YEARS. THAT IS AN OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE PROJECT. BUT WE HAVE LEARNED THAT IT WAS DIVIDED BY PRIVATE DONATIONS. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOT IVGIVEN A LIST OF WHO THOSE SUPPORTERS ARE TO HELP THOSE FUNDS WERE SOLICITED, AND ULTIMATELY, HOW MUCH OF IT WAS USED AND HOW. SO THERE ARE SOME QUESTION THERE ABOUT THIS PROJECT BECAUSE WITH FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO SEE IT, IT IS GOING TO BE DURING INTHE FIRST LADY'S BEACH TOMORROW NIGHT IN PRIME- TIME AS SHE CLOSES OUT TUESDAY EVENING'S PROGRAMMING FOR THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. IT IS ALREADY UNUSUAL THAT THE %AN PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE SPEAKING THURSDAY FROM THE SOUTH LAWN. FOR HER UTTO SPEAK FROM THE ROSE GARDEN IS ALSO UNPRECEDENTED. BUT IT COMES BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. WE WANTED TO MAKE A LOT OF ADJUSTMENTS BUT THEY ARGUE THAT ANYONE WHO IS INVOLVED IN THIS POLITICAL STUFF IS BEING VERY CAREFUL. ETHICAL EXPERTS HAVE REACHED THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES. IT WOULD APPLY TO THE STAFF. WHERE WORKING ON THESE VARIOUS SPEECHES, WO ALISON. MONICA, ANOTHER LEGAL HEADACHE FOR THE PRESIDENT. THIS IS A BIG SURPRISE. NOW IT IS PUBLIC. NEW YORK'S W ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICIALLY INVESTIGATING THE RESIGNATION OVER SOME OF ITS ER FINANCIAL FILINGS. WHAT HAVE WE NA LEARNED HERE? Reporter: YES, AND THIS IS ALSO A CIVIL INQUIRY, WE SHOULD PUT EPIC RELATED TO SOME REAL ESTATE PARTIES AND THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION HAS RESPONDED IN A STATEMENT SAYING, THERE IS NO CRIMINAL %CASE HERE. THEY WANT STATEMENT THAT VERY %CLEAR. BUT THERE TRUMP, ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S SONS, WAS VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE VO20 DECISION. AT NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SAID IT K %WOULD BE HELPFUL IF HE CAME IN AND TALKED TO THEM BECAUSE HE MIGHT POSSESS SOME INFORMATION FOR THIS CASE. ERIC TRUMP HAS NOT SAT DOWN WITH THEM YET BUT IF HE IS NOW WANTING TO THE TIMING OF ALL OF THIS AS L A LITTLE BIT SUSPECT, SEEING WHY THIS COMING OUT ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. SO IT IS ICUNCLEAR WHETHER HE WILL BUT WILL HAPPEN, WHAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY SOME WAY THEY COULD COMPEL HIM TO DO SO. BUT AS OF OUR UNDERSTANDING. GET HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE YET AS WE LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL IS LOOKING INTO, ALISON. ALL RIGHT, MONICA ALBA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. Reporter: THANK YOU.  MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTESTS IN CHARLOTTE AND HAVE TODAY'S  REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. RACKING UP A CROWD LAST BLNIGHT BUT ARRESTED FIVE PEOPLE. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT MORGAN RADFORD IS JOINING US. J TELL US ABOUT THE PROTESTS THERE TODAY. YEAH ALISON, THIS IS A TENSE THING. WE ARE IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE THE RNC CONVENTION IS. YOU CAN HEAR A LOT OF. PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF YOU HEAR ANY PROFANITY. THEY ARE PART OF THE ORGANIZED RESIST RNC PROTEST. ABOUT 4:30. YOU CAN ALSO SEEK COUNTERPROTESTERS AND THE COUNTERPROTESTERS HAVE SIDES. THE HEAD SIDES HERE THAT ARE SAYING THINGS LIKE AMERICA, YOU NEED TO LAST GOT. AND SO THEY ARE ARGUING. WE SAW THEM BREAK OUT INTO A CROWD. YOU CAN SEE THIS INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING ELSE YEAR. IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE, THIS IS HOW THE PROTESTS WOULD INTENDED TO INITIALLY LOOK, ALISON. YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE RESIST RNC PROTEST. THERE OUR SPEAKERS AT THE PODIUM. AND THEY HAD A PERMIT TO BE HERE . THIS IS THE ENERGY. THIS IS THE TENSION THAT WE ARE SEEING NOW ON THE FOURTH NIGHT OF CONVENTION PROTEST. I WANT TO ENSHOW YOU SOMETHING FROM ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS. MOMENTS AGO, WE ASKED BUT THEY BELIEVE THE PERCEPTION OF THESE PROTESTS WERE. . NOT ONLY HERE INTRALIPID AROUND THE COUNTRY. TAKE ER TA LISTEN. WHEN I SEE THOSE VIDEOS, I SEE POLICE MEETING THE VIOLENCE. JUST FLAT OUT. THERE HAVE BEEN WELL OVER 1000 INCIDENTS OF POLICE VIOLENCE SINCE GEORGE FORD'S MERGER, INCLUDING THE ONE IN WISCONSIN LAST NIGHT, WHERE THEY SHOT AN UNARMED BLACK MAN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE BACK IN VERY CLOSE RANGE. Reporter: THOUSAND THESE ORGANIZERS SAY THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY CALL THE DIVISIVENESS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FREDERICK. THEY SEE IT HAS P' NO PLACE HERE INTRALIPID DID ABSOLUTELY IT IS THE VISION TO PLAY THE COUNTRY. THEY SEE %THEY ARE HERE TODAY TO MAKE THEIR FEELINGS AND THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN. ALISON?  MORGAN, SPEAKING OF THEIR PRESENCE, WHAT IS POLICE RESINS LIKE DROUGHT CHARLOTTE? ARE YOU EXPECTING MORE DEMONSTRATIONS TONIGHT, TOMORROW, DROUGHT WEEK?DR% I HAVE TO SAY, ALISON, IT IS TRICKY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE POLICE PRESENCE THAT HAS BEEN A.M. TO EVEN WHEN WE WERE HERE ENTERING THE CITY. IF YOU COMPARE IT TO SOMETHING LIKE 2016, IT IS SIMILAR. YOU ARE SEEING THEIR CASE. YOU'RE SEEING THIS INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE IN THIS AREA. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 400 OFFICIALS HERE IN 2020 AND YET, THE SAME D LEVEL THREE POLICE PRESENCE, NEARLY WHAT WE SAW:IN 2016. THAT KIND OF TELLS YOU SOMETHING. THEY ARE REALLY -- WE WILL NOT BE SILENT WE WILL NOT BE -- NEVER! Reporter: CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU DECIDED TO ORGANIZE? BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF THIS. WE WILL ARE GETTING KILDE INDUSTRIES. I'M TIRED OF BEING BRUTALIZED BY THE RIPOLICE. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE. Reporter: YOUR NAME? I'M NOT GIVING MY NAME. THAT IS THE KIND OF ENERGY WE ARE SEEING HERE TODAY. THEY ARE AGAINST PATEL THE. E THEY ARE HERE FORFO SOCIAL JUSTICE. ALISON?  MORGAN COOK PART OF THE PROTEST IN CHARLOTTE. I DON'T THINK YOU SUMMIT FOR BEING WITH US. ABSOLUTELY.  PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKING HIS MESSAGE TO FARMERS IN NORTH CAROLINA TODAY. BACK IN 2016. HOW THEY FEEL AHEAD OF NOVEMBER 2020. RON HILLIARD SPOKE TO FARMERS IN BOTH WISCONSIN AND IOWA. I WOULD SAY HE HAS HAD SOME ACCOMPANIMENTS CO AND TRADE. BUT THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA HAS BEEN DEVASTATING. AGRICULTURE. FROM A RENEWABLE STANDPOINT, IT DP HAS BEEN -- THE SUPPORT HAS NOT BEEN THERE. PEOPLE FAILED. THIS PREDATES TRUMP. AND WHEN TRUMP CAME IN, IT DID NOT NECESSARILY IMPROVE, BUT I THINK HE AT LEAST IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING. THAT IS THE ONE THING THAT I THINK SOME PEOPLE WERE EXCITED ABOUT TRUMP. HE IS ABFINALLY TALKING AGRICULTURE. WE HAVE BEEN SO ELECTED FOR SO MANY YEARS FROM POLITICIANS. THE FLYOVER COUNTRY, THE TERM PEOPLE USE. AND TRUMP IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN OUR LIFETIME TO TALK SPECIFICALLY AGRICULTURE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S GOT TO BE BETTER CHOICES OUT THERE. I WON'T VOTE FOR TRUMP AGAIN. THE POLICIES THAT HE HAS PUT IN PLACE AND THE TRADE WAR THAT HE STARTED HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT HURT RURAL AMERICA. HE CAN %L CLAIM OTHERWISE IN EVERY OPPORTUNITY . THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE ONLY THING HE HAS DONE IS A BUNCH OF SUBSIDIES. SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS, PEOPLE ARE JUST DETACHED FROM WHAT THEY ARE VOTING FOR. I MYSELF DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYBODY IN THE MIDWEST THINGS TRUMP RELATES WITH THEM AND IS FOR THEM. HE WHAT HAVE NEVER SET FOOT IN OUR STAGE IN IOWA OR ILLINOIS IF IT WAS NOT FOR A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO THE FARMERS IN RURAL IMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONE WHERE YOU ARE? Reporter: ALISON, THE PRESIDENT IS NOT NAIVE TO HOW CRUCIAL FORMER SUPPORT IS. 2016, WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA. WE ARE IN SOUTHWESTERN WISCONSIN. IF YOU LOOK TEAT THE 2020. LO DENTAL MAP, MOST OF THESE COUNTY HERE, FOURMAN COUNTRIES, WENT BLUE. TRUMP TURNED THOSE NUMBERS . MEANT IN 2016. AND THAT IS WHY YOU SAW HIM AGAIN TODAY IN NORTH CAROLINA. MAKING A DIRECT APPEAL TO FARMERS, PRETENDING THAT HE IS BENEFITING THE AG ECONOMY. OF COURSE, HIS STATEMENTS WERE LITTERED WITH FALSEHOODS, SUGGESTING THAT CHINA, FOR INSTANCE, COULD PAY $20 BILLION. IN REALITY, THAT WAS PAID BY U.S. -- U.S. COMPANIES, IMPORTING CHINESE GOODS AND HE WAS PAID OUT IN THE FORM OF SUBSIDIES. FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. TO MAKE UP %FOR THE VERY LOSSES THAT THE U.S. AG ECONOMY SAW BECAUSE OF THOSE VERY -- THOSE VERY TARIFFS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IMPOSED AS WELL AS THOSE RETALIATORY TEARS FROM THE LIKES OF CHINA AND EVEN OUR ALLIES, MEXICO AND CANADA. AND THAT IS WHERE THESE FARMERS ARE SO CRUCIAL. YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO MAKE THAT SALES PITCH THAT HE HAS HELPED THE AG S ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME, YOU E KNOW, IN TALKING WITH FARMERS, THAT YOU JUST HEARD SOME OF THEM THERE, THERE WERE SOME SLIGHT CONCESSIONS FOR INSTANCE, FOR THEIR ECONOMY COMING OUT OF CANADA. WHAT THESE FARMERS HAVE LARGELY SAYING THAT THE VERY VOLATILE ECONOMY. THEY HAVE SEEN LA THE PRICES OF YOUR COMMODITIES FLUCTUATE UP AND DOWN AND OVER THE COURSE OF THESE LAST FOUR YEARS. WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY HEARD FARMERS SAY THAT THE BOAT EXPANDED ROCKETS AND THEY WANT THOSE MARKETS TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE AMERICAN AG PRODUCTS CAN BE ACCOUNTED ON. BUT WHAT YOU HAVE ATSEEN NO IS CONCERN AMONG THE GREAT SHARE OF THE FARMERS OF WHETHER THE TRUMP DEMONSTRATION IS ABLE TO OPT FOR THAT. WHAT ARE VOTERS AND FARMERS SAYING THERE ABOUT HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HANDLES THE PANDEMIC? THERE IS A LOT OF ENCOURAGEMENT EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT YOU KNOW, PERHAPS THIS YEAR THIS HARVEST WOULD RESULT IN A BETTER YIELD FOR THE. BUT WHAT YOU SAW WAS THE PANDEMIC THAT HAS, YOU KNOW, LARGELY HAD SIGNIFICANT HURT TO THE EXPERIENCE INDUSTRY. YOU ARE SEEING IT ABOUT $50 FOR A POUND OF MILK YEAR. IN ORDER TO BREAK EVEN, YOU NEED THAT TO BE AT ABOUT 17 TO $18. AND THAT IS WHERE THEY ARE COMPARING WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ROCKETS, NOT JUST DAIRY, BUT CORN, T BEANS, IN THE, LET'S SAY CHINA IS A BUYER. CHINA HAS MORE OPTIONS THAN JUST U.S. COMMODITIES TO BUY FROM. IF THAT %IS WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN THE TRADE WAR BEGIN. LARGELY BACK IN 2010. YOU HAVE SEEN CHINA INCREASED RETURN TO OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL TO BUY THEIR BEANS. AND THAT IS WHERE WE WERE TALKED ABOUT RELIABILITY OF AMERICAN. THERE'S CONCERN AMONG A LOT OF THESE FARMERS PRACTICE BACK IN 2018, WHEN I WAS ON THE FARM WITH BOB HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THE PRESIDENT'S EFFORTS. NO THAT ENTHERE WOULD BE INITIAL HEARD FROM THE TARIFFS. WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE COURSE OF NOW YEAR THREE IS NEGOTIATIONS. IS CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY. CHINA JUST LAST WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP SUGGESTED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE OF THAT TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA WITH LOOKED LIKE. TALKING WITH FARMERS WHO, INCLUDING DAN, IK WHO IS A FIFTH GENERATION DAIRY FARMER HERE IN RURAL WISCONSIN, THAT MEANS A LOT OF QUESTION MARKS. THERE'S A TILOT OF HOPE INVESTED IN YOUR POCKET BUT THESE OPERATIONS YOUR TALK ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN %OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT ME. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE GUARANTEE OF WHAT THEIR MARKETS LOOK LIKE, THAT LEAVES A LOT OF QUESTION MARKS. AND BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN TAKING THIS ON FOR NOW, THREE YEARS, IS, A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT A LOT OF THESE VOTERS THAT WE TALK TO HERE ABOUT OTHER PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD BE THE ONE TO BE TRUSTED TO HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF HANDLING THE AG ECONOMY HERE. . Reporter: % VAUGHN HILLYARD, NOTHING I LOVE MORE THAN WHEN WETH SEND YOU TO A FARM ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST STORIES AND THE BEST SHOT. SO GREAT TO SEE YOU OUT THERE IN WISCONSIN. Reporter: WE HAVE GOT A LOT OF IT, MY FRIEND LOOKING FORWARD. THANKS, VON. SPIN THE CHALLENGE FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THIS WEEK, OVERCOMING THE TRUST YEP. NBCNEWS.COM ANALYST JONATHAN SAYS THAT THE WIN RELIGION, THE PRESIDENT WILL TRY TO SELL THE STORY THAT HE HAS BEEN A SHINING SUCCESS EN AND JOE BIDEN HAS. IF HIS CREDIBILITY PROBLEM DOES NOT GET IN THE WAY. JOHN KINSMAN NOW YOU KNOW. YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO MAKE THE GREATEST SALES PITCH OF HIS LIFE. HOW CAN HE DO THAT THIS WEEK? WE HAVE SENT A LITTLE BIT OF IT TODAY. YOU GOT OUT THERE AND SPOKE IN NORTH CAROLINA FOR QUITE SOME TIME. 102 PRESENT HIS ECONOMY. IT WAS ONE THAT WAS STRONG BEFORE COVID. HE BLAMES COVID ON CHINA. HE BLAMES THEM A CREDIT GOVERNORS RATHER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR INEFFICIENCIES AND FOR FAILURE STICKUP AT HE IS GOING TO SAY THAT THE ECONOMY IS GOING WILL. HE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT HAVING DEFEATED I SUSPECT AND HE IS GOING TO SAY BASICALLY THAT HE NEEDS ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. BUT THE MAJORITY OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR IS ABOUT HOW THE DEMOCRATS HOARE -- JOHN, ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS OF EXECUTIVE POWER. PEOPLE FOR AND AGAINST THEM HAVE TAKEN ISSUE WITH THAT. COULD HIS USE OF -- IT COULD, ALISON. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT IT IS NOT REALLY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ANYMORE. IT IS A TRUMP BODY. MOST OF THE INITIATIVES, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. PEOPLE WHO ARE DRAWN TO THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE HIS POWERS TO GET ABOUT PROGRESS, TO GET AROUND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AND SO, THAT SHOULD ENERGIZE PEOPLE BUT IT SHOULD EXCITE PEOPLE IT DOES LEAVE CONCERN THAT OBVIOUSLY, AMONG THE DEMOCRATS WHO CRITICIZE HIM. ALSO ON SOME OF THOSE SWING VOTERS, SOME OF THOSE MODERATE REPUBLICANS. THEY MAY HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THINGS LIKE REVERTING APPROPRIATIONS FROM CONGRESS TO BUILD A WALL. MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER POWERS HE HEHAS TAKEN UPON HIMSELF. FOR INSTANCE, HOLDING BACK EIGHT TO UKRAINE TO EXTORT AN INVESTIGATION INTO JOE BIDEN. SO WE WILL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. DON'T IS SOMETHING THAT ENERGIZES THE REPUBLICAN BASE. JOHN, LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE NUMBERS IN AN NPR PIECE, POSTED IN THE MIDDLE OF F THIS MONTH, TWO THIRDS OF REGISTERED VOTERS, THAT INCLUDES 71% EDOF INDEPENDENTS, SAY THEY DON'T TRUST WITH THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS AT ALL OR VERY LITTLE. ACCORDING TO % THAT SAME POLL, THAT JOE BIDEN WOULD ENTER HANDLE RACE RELATIONS BUT THEY DO SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE ECONOMY. IS IT ECONOMY IN RECESSION, PRINTED'S TRUST GREATEST STRENGTH, HIS BEST ARGUMENT ONE? IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU AE?SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON? Reporter: FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY. I WOULD. ONE THING THAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THE % DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION WAS THERE WAS MORE OF A NARROW FOCUS ON JOBS AND THE ECONOMY. THAT IS E THE ISSUE VOTERS TEND TO LOOK AT. I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. PEOPLE CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEY ARE FEELING" AND THE POCKETBOOKS AND THE REAL ECONOMY AND WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED -- THAT HAS SEEN MOST. JON, THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR SECOND. REPUBLICANS GET TO LEAVE THE LAST IMPRESSION HERE. HOW MUCH OF AN ADVANTAGE IS THAT? Reporter: ALISON, I'M AMAZED BASEBALL FAN. I HAVE TALKED ABOUT BASEMENT. THE HOME TEAM HAS THE ADVANTAGE. IT IS THE SECOND CONVENTION AND THE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY GET TO E RESPOND TO THE PARTY. IN THIS CASE, YOU WILL SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE SURROGATES TALK WITH THE DEMOCRATS TALKED ABOUT AT THEIR CONVENTION AND WHAT THEY DID NOT TALK ABOUT AND THEIR CONVENTION. IT IS A HUGE PLATFORM FOR RESPONSE. JOHN ALLEN, ALWAYS BRINGING TOGETHER BY TWO FAVORITE THINGS, ALL ADDICTS AND BASEBALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. TAKE CARE, ALISON.  WHAT SPEECHES WILL MAKE HISTORY ATAND WHICH ONES STILL STAND OUT T FROM YEARS AGO? NBC NEWS NATIONAL POLITICAL RESPONDED STEVE TAKES US THROUGH SOME OF THE MOST MEMORABLE ELEMENTS OF RNC PASSED. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOOK TO US TO DIRECT OUR NATION. MY REFELLOW AMERICANS, LONG DARK NIGHT FOR AMERICA IS ABOUT TO IN. BY PROMOTING THE PRETTY ABROAD, WE WILL BUILD A FAVORITE WORLD. I RIAM -- CONVENTION PART TWO. ANY OF THE SPEECH IS GOING OVER THE COURSE OF THIS WEEK STANDARD TEST OF TOWN. THE CONVENTIONS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE THIS, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL SPEECHES THAT HAVE REALLY REVERBERATED THROUGH HISTORY. TAKE A LOOK BACK.  FIRST UP, 1964, THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION. THAT IS WHAT THEY CALLED THE OVEN IN SAN FRANCISCO. BECOMING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. THIS WAS A REVOLUTION. ROCKEFELLER, THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK. ALMOST LIBERAL REPUBLICAN. WE'VE GOT THE NOMINATION BECAUSE HE OUTHUSTLED ROCKEFELLER. THE MOST CONSERVATIVE NOMINEE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AT THAT POINT. AND HE EMBRACED THAT INITIATIVE. SO FOCUSED AND SO DEDICATED, NOT BE MADE FUZZY BY UNTHINKING AND STUPID LABELS. [ APPLAUSE ] I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT EXTREMISM IN THE DEFENSE OF LIBERTY, IT IS -- Reporter: NEXT UP, LET'S GO TO THAT AND 76, INCUMBENT GERALD FORD, BECAME THE PRESIDENT TWO YEARS EARLIER WHEN %RICHARD NIXON RESIGNED. GERALD FORD GOT CHALLENGED BY RONALD REAGAN. IT WAS SORT OF A CONSERVATIVE RICK AND VERSUS MODERATE ESTABLISHMENT PRIMARY. RONALD REAGAN BL GOT HOT TOWARDS THE END. FOUR THE NOMINATION. UNIFYING THE PARTY.TI HE CALLED MEGAN TO THE STAGE AND ASKED HIM TO DELIVER A FEW WORDS AND RONALD REAGAN STOLE THE SHOW. I BELIEVE THAT REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS A FIRM THAT IS A BUMMER OF BOLD, UNMISTAKABLE COLORS. WE HAVE JUST HEARD -- BASED ON THAT PLATFORM. AND A CALL TO US TO REALLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN COMMUNICATING AND REVIEW TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS PLATFORM AND THE EN PLATFORM OF THE OPPOSING PARTY, WHICH IS NOTHING BUT A REVAMPED AND RUNNING OF LATE LATE SHOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Reporter: 1988 , IN NEW ORLEANS. GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH. HE HAD BEEN THE IS PRESENT FOR EIGHT YEARS. BUSH HAD BEEN A MODERATE. NOW HE WAS RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY ON HIS ON. 1988, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS MORE CONSERVATIVE. BUT WANTED TO PROVE TO CONSERVATIVES, I'M NOT THAT MODERATE I'M ONE OF YOU NOW. THE CONGRESS WILL PUSH ME TO RAISE TAXES. AND THEY WILL PUSH AND I WILL SAY NOW. AND THEY WILL PUSH AGAIN I WILL SAY TO THEM, READ MY LIPS, NO NEW TAXES. Reporter: WE KNOW THE HISTORY OF THAT. BUSH WENT BACK ON HIS WORD AND GOT DEFEATED IN ELECTION.  2000, JOHN McCAIN, REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT, WENT AGAINST BARACK OBAMA. THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT, GEORGE W. BUSH. VERY UNPOPULAR. WHAT DID HE DO? HE PICKS THE SECOND YEAR GOVERNOR OF ALASKA, SARAH PALIN. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING MOST OF MY LIFE IN A SMALL TOWN. JUST YOUR AVERAGE HOCKEY MOM SIGN UP FOR THE PTA. I LOVE THOSE HOCKEY MOMS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HOCKEY MOM AND A PIT BULL, LIPSTICK. Reporter: OF COURSE, SARAH PALIN HAD TROUBLE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FROM THERE. BY THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, THERE WAS WORRIED SHE MIGHT BE A LIABILITY FOR BE JOHN McCAIN. AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, SARAH PALIN WAS A STRONG POLITICAL FORCE. SOME VERSION OF THAT IS WEEK. WE WILL SEE HOW THAT GOES. IT WILL BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT. OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION STARTS TONIGHT AT 8:00 PM BL EASTERN WITH AL CHUCK TODD. FOLLOWED BY NETWORK PRIME- TIME SPECIAL AT 10:00 P.M. EASTERN. YOU CAN WATCH IT ALL RIGHT HERE ON NBC NEWS NOW.  AMONG THE CHAOS, I FOUND A FATHER TRYING TO TEACH HIS SON ABOUT PEACE.

WE'VE GOT SOME BREAKING NEWS. WE ACTUALLY SAW A LARGE CONVOY OF THE NATIONAL GUARD COME THROUGH HERE. IT'S NEWS MADE FOR YOUR STREAMING WORLD. LIVE WEEKDAYS STARTING AT 6:00 A.M. EASTERN.  TROPICAL STORM MARCO STARTING TO FALL APART TODAY. BUT LAURA COULD STRENGTHEN TO A HURRICANE. OUR BROKER JOINS ME NOW. WE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS. THE LOOK LIKE MARCO MAY BE FALL APART. JUST GOT AN UPDATE FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE TWO STORMS? ALISON, AS YOU MENTIONED, MARCO HAS 15 MILES. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. THE GOOD NEWS IS TWINS ARE DOWN TO FOUR MILES PER HOUR. IT IS SURPRISING, THE NEXT 12 HOURS. IT IS DOWN TO THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION. YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF RAIN AROUND THE PANHANDLE. THAT IS GOING TO BE THE MOST PROBLEMATIC OF SITUATIONS. MAYBE SOME STRONG WINDS. YOU CAN'T RULE OUT A TORNADO OR TWO AS IT MAKES ITS WAY INLAND AND STARTS TO DISPLAY. WHEN FILAMENTS, AGAIN, VERY LIGHT. WE COULD SEE SOME FRESH BLOOD IN. ISOLATED TORNADO THREAT. WINDS WILL ALSO BE 26 TO 56 MILES PER HOUR. THOSE WILL LESSEN AS IT WAS IN THEM. WHERE WE ARE CONCERNED, RIGHT NOW, 30 MILE-PER- HOUR WINDS IT IS 50 MILES PER HOUR WINDS, I SHOULD SAY. 20 MILES PER HOUR. IT IS OVER TO YOU BALL. WE WON'T SEE MUCH STRENGTHENING OUT OF THE SYSTEM. THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS. BUT THEN IT IS OUT OVER THE GULF. ALL BETS ARE OFF. A LOT OF WATER WATER PARK VERY LITTLE SHEAR TO TEAR IT APART. THERE'S HEIGHT MOISTURE LEFT OVER FROM MARCO. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT INTENSIFIES FROM ONE STATE MONDAY. BY WEDNESDAY AFTER NOON, IT COMES ONSHORE. CATEGORY TO STRUM. COULD EVEN MAKE ITS WAY UP THE 283. WE WILL HAVE TO WE CAN SEE. ARE TAKING THE WHAT THIS WILL BRING IS A LOT OF HEAVY RAIN MAKING ITS WAY UP INTO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. LOCALLY. 15 INCHES OF RAIN OR MORE AND HIGH WINDS. CAN'T RULE OUT A TORNADO OR TWO WITH THIS SYSTEM. AS YOU CAN SEE, HAVE HER GET MUCH IS NOW UP FROM GALVESTON INTO CENTRAL LOUISIANA AND WE GOT TROPICAL STORM WATCHES. THROUGH MUCH OF LOUISIANA AND JUST TO THE WEST OF GALVESTON. NOW,, CHANGEABLE SITUATION. THE GOOD NEWS IS MARCO, WEAKENING. IF IS STRICTLY. WE EXPECT IT TO HAPPEN WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. ALISON?  Reporter: ALWAYS A LETTER TO HEAVY WEATHER THINGS FOR THE UPDATE.  THE GULF COAST PRISON FOR UNPRECEDENTED THREAT. TWO TROPICAL STORMS ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE LANDFALL. IT LOOKS LICK AT LEAST ONE OF THEM IS MOVING. THAT IS GOODNESS. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT MORGAN CHESKY IS JOINING ME NOW. WE HEAR MARCO MAY BE FALL APART. MORE IS STILL A BAY CONCERNED. HOW IS THAT AREA PREPARING? ALISON, THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN NOW BECAUSE THESE FOLKS KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES. THEY HAVE -- THEY HAVE SEEN MARCO STARTED TO DISSIPATE OUTSIDE OF NEW ORLEANS. THE PAST FOR LAURA LOOKS TO BE MORE OR LESS DIRECTLY HEADED TOWARDS LAKE CHARLES. SPOKE TO SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THIS AREA HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE THAT THESE STORMS CAN DO. TODAY IS THE DATE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET OUT AHEAD, SECURE ANYTHING IN THEIR YARD BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES, AS MUCH OF A CLICHE TERM IS THAT IS. THEY ARE PRINTED MADE SURE THEIR HOMES ARE SECURE AT THIS POINT IN TOWN. GOING TO STORES, STOCKING UP ON THIS GOOD THERE'S NO MANDATORY THE COMMISSION TO SIMPLY SPEAK TO STRICTLY VOLUNTARY AT THIS POINT. WE KNOW THAT LAURA IS FORECAST TO BE POTENTIALLY CATEGORY 2 HURRICANE IF AND WHEN IT MAKES LANDFALL NEAR THE AREA. AND WHILE THAT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE A CATEGORY 5 REASON STATE IN THE PAST, PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE SYSTEMS HERE KNOW THAT THAT CAN STILL RICK AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE, NOT NECESSARILY FROM 100 MILES PER HOUR. JUST BUT THE INTENSE AMOUNT OF RAIN THAT THE STORM RING INUNDATING A LOT OF THIS COMMUNITY. IT IS RIGHT NOW, WE ARE HEARING FROM GOVERNOR JOHN EARLIER TODAY. HE SAYS DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES. THEY WITHOUT MARCO STARTED TO DISSIPATE, GO AHEAD AND REPAIR AS IF LAURA IS GOING TO BE ON OUR DOORSTEP TOMORROW. EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT FORECAST TO RISE UNTIL WEDNESDAY. BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS, JUST HOW DANGEROUS THESE STORMS CAN BE. AND MAKING IT EVEN MORE COMPLICATED, OF COURSE, ALISON, IS THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE COVID-19 BEING A VERY REAL PROBLEM HERE IN LOUISIANA. SO THOSE TWO ACTORS COMBINED GOING TO BE TAKING FOR A VERY INTERESTING NEXT FEW DAYS. ALISON?  I KNOW THE GOVERNOR ISSUED A STATE OF EMERGENCY AHEAD OF THE STORM. WHAT ELSE THAT IS A TODAY? I THINK WE HAVE SOME SOUND FROM HIM JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS AHEAD. Reporter: RIGHT. WILL, AT THIS POINT, IT IS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO ALLOCATE THOSE RESOURCES ACROSS THE SWATH OF THE COAST, WHERE THE STORM IS EXPECTED TO HIT. AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH MARCO, THESE STORMS IN PARTICULAR CAN VARY FROM HOUR TO HOUR, STRENGTHENING AND THEN MARCO SHOWING US, DISSIPATING. TO WHERE IT IS NOT SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. BUT LAURA STILL VERY MUCH A CONCERN AT THIS POINT IN TOWN. AND THAT IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS VERY CLEAR WITH, YOU SHARED RESOURCES EARLIER TODAY ON WHAT PEOPLE CAN EXPECT THE NEXT 48 HOURS. TAKE A LISTEN. THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS MORE THAN 2000 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN. READY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. THEY HAVE STAGED 94 HIGH WATER VEHICLES ACROSS SOUTH LOUISIANA. ALSO 55 VOTES, I THINK IT, EVEN THOUGH AIRCRAFT. ALSO POSITION THOUSAND 80 FEET OF SANDBAGS IN GRAND ISLE COMPLETED DELIVERY OF GENERATORS AND PUMPS TO GRAND ISLAND. AS WELL. Reporter: ALISON, ON THE WEIGHT TO THIS VERY LOCATION, RIGHT IN FRONT OF CONTRABAND BY YOU, I PASSED SOME FISHERIES STAFF MEMBERS. THEY HAD ONE OF MANY BOATS OUT FRONT. THEY WERE STARTING TO STOCK IT WITH SUPPLIES JUST IN CASE WATER RESCUES ARE NEEDED. IN THE NEXT COMING DAYS. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PREPARATIONS WE ARE ALREADY SEEING HERE ON A BLUE SKY, SUNSHINE DAY. ALISON?  YEAH MORGAN, HOPING THEY WON'T NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THOSE PREPARATIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING. THANK YOU.  WILDFIRES HAVE SCORCHED OVER 1 MILLION ACRES IN CALIFORNIA. AND NOW A RED FLAG WARNING IS IN EFFECT FROM THE OREGON BORDER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CENTRAL COAST. GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM TALKED ABOUT THE DEVASTATION EARLIER TODAY. LAST YEAR, IN 2019, WE HAD 4292 WILDFIRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. 56,000 ACRES. TO 292 WILDFIRES THIS TIME LAST YEAR. TODAY, OVER 7000 WILDFIRES, 7002 BURNING NOW NORTH OF 1.4 MILLION ACRES. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT STEVE PATTERSON HAS MORE. Reporter: ALISON, IT IS NOW WEEK TWO OF THIS STATEWIDE. IT. MORE THAN 600 FIRES ACROSS THE STATE BURNING IN ALL AREAS HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. TWO OF THE BIGGEST FIRES IN STATE HISTORY ARE RAGING. THE SECOND AND THE THIRD IS IN STATE HISTORY, HE CAN SEE SOME THE ACTIVE DAY BEHIND ME. FIREFIGHTERS HAVE WORKED WITH MORE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS THIS WEEKEND ABLE TO PUSH SOME OF THE FLAMES AWAY FROM HOUSES, BUT THAT COULD CHANGE ON A DIME IF THE WIND PICKS UP. SOME OF THESE REGIONS ARE STILL IN A RED FLAG WARNING. FIREFIGHTERS WRITE ABOUT THAT. NOT ONLY THAT, COMBATING THE EXTENSION. SOME OF THESE GUYS, 48, 72 HOURS THEY NEED A. BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS A DISASTER DECLARATION, BRING IN FEDERAL RESOURCES, OFFERING UP SOME FEDERAL AGE. MILITARY, THE NATIONAL GUARD EXPECTED TO COME IN AND HELP OUT WITH THE FIREFIGHTING OPERATION ON THE GROUND. BUT RED WE GOT FIRES ALL OVER THE STATE. THE SIZE OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT GOES ON FOR WEEKS.  KENOSHA, WAS ON THING, GETTING READY FOR ANOTHER NIGHT OF PROTEST. THIS VIDEO APPEARS TO SHOW THE MOMENTS JUST BEFORE THE SHAMING. A WARNING TO IT IS GRAPHIC AND THIS MAY BE HARD TO WATCH. [ SOUND OF GUNFIRE ] WOW. JACOB BLAKE, THE MAN POLICE SHOT IS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL. THE OFFICER IS ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. SHEK MEKA, HOW IS THE CITY PREPARING FOR ANOTHER NIGHT OF PROTEST. THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW THEY ARE PREPARING. YOU SEE THE BROKEN GLASS. IT HAPPENED. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ARE BUSINESS AFTER BUSINESS, MUCH -- PUTTING UP ON THE GLASS TO PROTECT THE GRASS. WE WILL KEEP GOING AND WALKING DOWN THE STREET YOU WILL SEE THIS AT THE LAST BUSINESSES. YOU CONTINUE, GO DOWN, EACH ONE AFTER THE OTHER IS WHAT IT UP. EVEN THOSE THAT WERE NOT HIT LAST NIGHT AND THE VIOLENCE. SPOKE OF THIS? YOU MENTIONED THE SHOOTING. YOU SHOWED THAT VIDEO THERE. THAT IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN. THERE WAS INSTANT CROWDS AND INSTANT OUTREACH AFTER THAT SHOOTING. AND AFTER THE MAJOR MADE ITS WAY AROUND SOCIAL MEDIA, PEOPLE THAT VIDEO, THEY WERE OUTRAGED. AND THEN THERE WAS A PROTEST AT THE SCENE THAT THEN CAME DOWNTOWN AS PEOPLE MUCH TOWARDS THE POLICE STATIONS. WE ARE CLOSER TO THE POLICE STATION UP AS PEOPLE SCATTERED AWAY FROM THE POLICE STATION, THAT IS WHEN THEY STARTED GOING AND KNOCKING DOWN THE BUSINESSES HERE. YOU SEE BUSINESSES PUTTING UP THEIR PLYWOOD. THE CITY IS PUTTING IN ROADBLOCKS AND VARIOUS TO RESTRICT THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC. AND THEN THAT CURFEW IN PLACE. 8:00 PM. CURFEW THAT STARTS TONIGHT AND WILL SEE IF THAT WORKS. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS THIS TIME AROUND. ALISON?  SHAQ, IT HAS BEEN THREE MONTHS SINCE POLICE KILLED GEORGE FLOYD. BESIDES THE PROTESTS THERE, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM THE COMMITTEE ABOUT ANOTHER POLICE- INVOLVED KILLING OF A BLACK MAN? WHAT HAVE PEOPLE BEEN TELLING YOU?  Reporter: LIMIT MARK IT DOWN BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A SIGN THAT THERE DOUBLE ANSWER THAT QUESTION BETTER THAN I CAN DESCRIBE FOR YOU. OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS AND WHEN FRUSTRATION ABOUT THE SITUATION, BUT THAT VIDEO THAT WENT OUT BUT LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE HERE. BOARDED UP BUSINESS. YOU HAVE THE SIGNED BLACK LIVES MATTER. THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO TELL ME. DESPITE THEIR FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT THE LOOTING AND THE DAMAGE AND THE BED LISTEN, THEY STILL WANT THE MESSAGE TO BE THE CORE WHAT THEY ARE DOING. NOW ARE GATHERING DOWNTOWN. A COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE, COMING DOWNTOWN. THEY ARE FRUSTRATED. IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATEMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR, THE WISCONSIN GOVERNOR, NOT ONLY DID HE MENTION THIS SITUATION BUT HE LIKENED IT TO -- SORRY I SAID YARD. INTO THE OTHER POLICE SHOOTINGS THAT WE HAD RECENTLY. LIKING HIM GEORGE FLOYD. THAT WITH ANOTHER INSTANCE OF WHAT PEOPLE CONSIDER POLICE INVOLVEMENT. HE LIKENED IT TO BREONNA TAYLOR. SO CONNECTING THIS SITUATION IS THE PART OF WHAT THEY SEE OF THE CHANGES THAT THE WANT TO SEE. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. IT IS FRUSTRATION HERE. I SPOKE WITH SOME PEOPLE IN MILWAUKEE A LOT. COVERING THE POLITICAL. THEY ARE HAVING PROTESTS SINCE GEORGE FLOYD WAS KILLED DEVILETTES GO. DAILY PROTESTS. SOMEONE WHO HAS PARTICIPATED IN THAT ACTUALLY IS ON A MUCH RIGHT NOW MILWAUKEE TO DC. THE REASON WHY THEY ARE NOT HERE NOW IS BECAUSE THEY ARE PARTICIPATING IN THAT MARK. DIFFERENT MESSAGE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO HAVE TONIGHT. ALISON?  SAC, I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DATE WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO REPORT ON ANY OF THESE STORIES AND MARQUETTE POLICE INVOLVED SHOOTINGS OF BLACK FOLKS. I HOPE THAT DAY COMES SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. I HOPE THE FOLKS STATE SAFE. THANK YOU.  JOE BIDEN'S REACTION TO THE SHEDDING, SAYING THE POLICE OFFICERS MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. MIKE IS JOINING US NOW. WHAT DID JOE BIDEN SAY TODAY? IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE NOTHING JOE BIDEN CITY. UNLIKE LAST WEEK WHEN DELTA WAS REGULARLY OUT THERE, PUBLIC DURING THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION, JOE BIDEN GETTING AWAY FOR THE WEEK FOR THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. HE DID ISSUE A STATEMENT THIS MORNING THINK THAT THESE SHOTS PIERCE THE SOUL OF THE NATION, CALLING FOR AN IMMEDIATE TRANSPARENT INVESTIGATION AND THE OFFICERS MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. IT IS IMPORTANT, AS WELL,. ABOUT, JOE BIDEN 'S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH AT THE DEMOCRAT NOMINATION. ON THURSDAY NIGHT. HE SAID ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS HE HAS HAD ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THIS YEAR WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF GEORGE FLOYD. THINK ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS IN THE INTERVIEW THAT THEY HAD TOGETHER IN THE FIRST INTERVIEW WITH ABC. I DON'T THINK THAT JOE BIDEN HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY THIS MATTER. IT WAS A VERY CLEAR CONTRAST WITH TRUMP CAMPAIGN ESPECIALLY AS WE EXPECT FROM THE RNC THIS WEEK. ONE OF THE SEEMS THAT REPUBLICANS ARE EXPECTED TO FOCUS ON IS THE VIOLENCE, THE DEMONSTRATION THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD'S KILLING AND EMRE CAN CITIES, WARNING THAT THIS MIGHT BE A PRECURSOR OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN UNDER A PRESIDENT BIDEN. I HAD A CHANCE TO ASK BIDEN ABOUT IT IF YOU REMEMBER, HE SAID ANDY FORMS OF VIOLENCE OF THAT TYPE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, ALL THOSE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. OF COURSE THAT HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WILL HAVE A RIGHT TO PEACEFULLY PROTEST AND HE BLAMES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR EXACERBATING THE SITUATION. CLEARLY A TOUGH SITUATION THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS TRIED TO STAY ON TOP OF AS WELL. ALISON?  MIKE, A NUMBER OF FORMER REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS NOW RALLYING BEHIND BIDEN AND HARRIS. IS MORE. WHO ARE THEY? WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? WHAT SHOULD WE NOTICE? ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION, THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN IS LAUNCHING WHAT THEY CALL REPUBLICANS FOR. ABOUT TWO DOZEN FORMER NUMBERS OF CONGRESS AND SEVERAL SENATORS THE TOP OF THAT LIST ARIZONA SENATOR JEFF FLAKE. NOT JUST LIST OF THIS NEW GROUP OF REPUBLICANS FOR BIDEN. HE GAVE A VIRTUAL ADDRESS THIS AFTERNOON AND ENCOURAGED THE SAME TIME, THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ADDRESSING THE RNC, AND ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING PART THAT ADDRESS WAS AS WE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA OF THE GRID ELECTION, SING THE EFFORTS BY THE, STILL PUSH FOR A VOTE BY MAIL ELECTION WAS EVIDENCE OF THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE A BIG ELECTION. HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT WAS ONE THING IN 2016 WHEN CANDIDATE TRUMP, THE NOMINEE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WAS TALK ABOUT A REGULATION. HE SAID IT IS A WHOLE OTHER THING A PRESIDENT SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE USING THIS KIND OF RHETORIC HE WOULD THAT WAS GOING TO HAVE LEFT DAMAGE INTO OUR DEMOCRACY. HE WAS STRONGLY CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE. IN FACT, THE WAY HE IS GOVERNMENT IS COUNTRY TO CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES. AND FOR REPUBLICANS, AS HE PUT IT, WILL, AT THE VERY LEAST, WE NEED TO ELECT DELTA TO HAVE THE SUPREME COURT. THIS IS TO SHOW THE LACK OF PRINCIPLES AND THE PARTY. HE STILL CONSIDERS HIMSELF A MEMBER. BUT HE SAYS SOME THINGS ARE BIGGER THAN POLITICS AND EVEN THOUGH HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH JOE BIDEN ON ISSUES, HE CALLS HIM A DECENT MAN AND HE SAID HE WILL BE VOTING FOR HIM IN NOVEMBER, FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHEN MOST QUESTION. SOME BIG NEWS ABOUT FUND- RAISING FOR THE BIDEN/HARRIS CAMPAIGN. WHAT IS THE SCOOP THERE? OUR COLLEAGUES AT CNBC REPORTING THAT KAMALA HARRIS HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE TICKET, THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE OTHER NETWORK OF DONORS THAT ARE NOW MAKING PHONE CALLS AND HELPING RAISE MORE MONEY FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. THIS IS, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THIS ALL OVER FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. THERE ADDING SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO GET SOME R&R THIS WEEK. HARRIS WILL BE DOING VIRTUALLY AND POTENTIALLY OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. PERHAPS ESPECIALLY FOR A SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BIGGEST, YOU KNOW, CASH COW FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HOW OFTEN DEMOCRATIC RESIDENCE, ESPECIALLY GOING TO L.A., TO RAISE MONEY. THIS HAS EIGHT REAL BOOST TO THE CAMPAIGN. AND ALISON, THE END OF THE REPUBLICAN -- END OF THE THEM, CONVENTION, I SHOULD SAY, YOUR NUMBER IN THE PRETTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER SENATOR HARRIS WAS CHOSEN, THE CAMPAIGN SAID HE HAD READ $48 MILLION. WILL BE ARE ADDING TO THAT TOTAL, SEEING AT THE END OF THE CONVENTION, THEY HAVE RAISED ANOTHER $70 MILLION FOR THE ENTHUSIASM OF THIS NEW DEMOCRATIC TICKET. SO NOT THAT YOU HAVE A FULL TICKET BROUGHT IT UP TO HELPING TO DIVIDE AND CONQUER ANY. WE OF DOING THAT IS RAISING MONEY AS WELL, ALISON. YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE UPDATE ON THE BIDEN HARRIS TICKET. I APPRECIATE IT. THANKS, ALISON. ! HOW ARE YOU VOTING IN THE 2020 IS THE GELATIN. NBC NEWS IS HERE TO HELP YOU FIGURE IT OUT.
