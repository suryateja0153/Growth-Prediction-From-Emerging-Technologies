 hello everyone welcome back to my channel as I mentioned in my last video I was going to show you what I use the setup that I use when I'm on the go and not staying with family friends are in a campground and there's no facilities sometimes I'll have to park at a Walmart for the night and in the middle of the night I really don't want to get out of my van and to use the toilets there so what I do is I have a five gallon bucket and I'll show you how I do that and I do it in a compost toilet type of way I use a certain type of organic kitty litter that's kind of like a sawdust type thing you can use sawdust that you put in pet bedding for pet bedding or you can use peat moss all these things are biodegradable and eco-friendly that's what I use to put on top of the waste and then everything goes into a dumpster Oringer garbage can just like you would with a baby diaper so let's get outside and let me show you how I do this it's very simple very discreet just got my new package super excited waited almost two weeks for this but this is gonna make my sleeping arrangements much more comfortable you wonder what it is let me show you here's the bedpan that I spoke about that I put up here on the chair I put one of these pads down it could be a doggy pad or people pad and I just tuck it in so it doesn't slip and this is an absorbent pad so it will absorb any liquid and first I would put the bag on top of this this is a special bag for this and it it's both of these are biodegradable I've tried the go-girl and a couple of other ones like that and they really don't work great for me this is this does work it's can be for a man or a woman it's a little urinal there's also a top for a woman's urinal with this one I'll show you what I use this for now and then I got this right here this is amazing this is the one that I really like it's wide there's no mess so this is what I recommend it's used for women who just had babies or people who can't get out of women who can't get out of bed this is really a great product right here's what I use also it's a bucket and I put a biodegradable bag in there a couple of them and what I've done to make it a compost toilet it's the this is will be for solids that's just junk down in there there's some sawdust in there and then I put that urinal piece that I showed you earlier in there along with an oil change funnel and that makes it to where liquids go in here so let's go in here and then I use a cat litter a cat litter that's sawdust cat litter and then I just throw it in there when I'm done I hope you can see that there's other things you can use such as sawdust peat moss there's also this equal fresh stuff you can buy in the store and there's the biodegradable bags that I use so there's lots of things I'll show you what the cat litter bag looks like as well so it's called Tidy Cats and that's what I use for my compost bucket toilet and as you can see it is just like sawdust it's organic it's cedar pine and corn husks so it works great for that it's got outstanding odor control I like it that's what I use I think I got it at Walmart then what I'll do is I put a mat down here that could be washed and then then I will put the portable bucket in here and if I need to use it it's riddled readily available for me or I could put it in the tent that attaches to my car as well and I also have a little bathroom tent that I can put this in when I'm at one particular campground or space or place then I'll just stow it away and pack it in this once it's clean there's plastic to put over this as well and the bags I just dumped them in a dumpster or in a garbage can it's just like I mentioned before you would just do with a baby diaper same thing and it everything's can be composted later on once it's in there now if I am at a place that they have a compost pile I will just put everything in the compost pile to secure my curtains and to be able to put both of them on because I only showed you one in the last van design that I did I get this velcro in a roll from Amazon I'll put the link below and I just cut it about five or six inches and this way I could wrap it around the bar that's so I can secure my curtains so that's how I do that I just want to show you that as well so there's where I put the velcro pieces to secure my curtains and that is a closed bar that you buy for cars because my car didn't have a lot of these little hookups and stuff like that in it so this is what I use it works very well are you ready to see what's in the box it's gonna make my sleeping arrangements so much more comfortable let me show you it's a foam it's a 3-inch foam to go under my four inch mattress this pad is also has no off gases and no bad smells so it's eco-friendly just like the mattress so now I have the mattress in the three inch foam and this color is perfectly over both of them so excited so comfortable I already tried it out if you're interested in any of these
