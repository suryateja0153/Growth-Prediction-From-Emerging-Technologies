 a brain-computer interface BCI sometimes called a neural control interface NCI mind machine interface MMI direct neural interface DNI or brain machine interface BMI is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device BCI differs from neuromodulation in that it allows for bi-directional information flow BCI's are often directed at researching mapping assisting augmenting or repairing human cognitive or sensory motor functions research on BCI's began in the 1970s at the University of California Los Angeles UCLA under a grant from the National Science Foundation followed by a contract from D ARPA the papers published after this research also marked the first appearance of the expression brain computer interface in scientific literature the field of BCI research and development has since focused primarily on neuroprosthetics applications that aim at restoring damaged hearing sight and movement thanks to the remarkable cortical plasticity of the brain signals from implanted prostheses can after adaptation be handled by the brain like natural sensor or effector channels following years of animal experimentation the first neuroprosthetic devices implanted in humans appeared in the mid 1990s topic history the history of brain-computer interfaces BCI's starts with hands burgers discovery of the electrical activity of the human brain and the development of electroencephalography EEG in 1924 burger was the first to record human brain activity by means of EEG Berger was able to identify oscillatory activity such as burgers wave or the alpha wave eight to thirteen Hertz by analyzing EEG traces burgers first recording device was very rudimentary he inserted silver wires under the scalps of his patients these were later replaced by silver foils attached to the patient's head by rubber bandages burger connected these sensors to a lip Minh capillary electronica with disappointing results however more sophisticated measuring devices such as the Siemens double coil recording galvanometer which displayed electric voltages as small as one ten thousandth of a volt led to success Berger analyzed the interrelation of alternations in his EEG wave diagrams with brain diseases EEG s permitted completely new possibilities for the research of human brain activities although the term had not yet been coined one of the earliest examples of a working brain machine interface was the piece music for solo performer 1965 by the american composer Alvin Lucier the piece makes use of EEG and analog signal processing Hardware filters amplifiers and a mixing board to stimulate acoustic percussion instruments to perform the piece one must produce alpha waves and thereby play the various percussion instruments v aloud speakers which are placed near or directly on the instruments themselves UCLA professor Jacques Vidal coined the term BCI and produced the first peer-reviewed publications on this topic Vidal is widely recognized as the inventor of BCI's in the BCI community as reflected in numerous articles reviewing and discussing the field eg his 1973 paper stated the BCI challenge control of objects using EEG signals especially he pointed out to contingent negative variation cnv potential as a challenge for BCI control the 1977 experiment Vidal described was the first application of BCI after his 1973 BCI challenge it was a non-invasive EEG actually visual evoked potentials vep control of a cursor like graphical object on a computer screen the demonstration was movement in a maze after his early contributions Vidal was not active in BCI research nor BCI events such as conferences for many years in 2011 however he gave a lecture in Graz Austria supported by the future be NCI project presenting the first BCI which earned a standing ovation Vidal was joined by his wife laris Vidal who previously worked with him at UCLA on his first BCI project in 1988 report was given on non-invasive EEG control of a physical object a robot the experiment described with EEG control of multiple start/stop restart of the robot movement along an arbitrary trajectory defined by a line drawn on a floor the line following behavior was the default robot behavior utilizing autonomous intelligence and autonomous source of energy in 1990 a report was given on a bi-directional adaptive BCI controlling computer buzzer by an anticipatory brain potential the contingent negative variation cnv potential the experiment described how an expectation state of the brain manifested by cnv controls in a feedback loop the s2 buzzer in the s1 s2 cnv paradigm the obtained cognitive wave representing the expectation learning in the brain is named electro expected gram XG the cnv brain potential was part of the BCI challenge presented by Vidal in his 1973 paper topic versus neuroprosthetics neuroprosthetics is an area of neuroscience concerned with neural prosthesis that is using artificial devices to replace the function of impaired nervous systems and brain related problems or of sensory organs the most widely used neuro prosthetic device is the cochlear implant which as of December 2010 had been implanted in approximately 220,000 people worldwide there are also several neuroprosthetic devices that aim to restore vision including retinal implants the difference between BCI's and neuroprosthetics is mostly in how the terms are used neuroprosthetics typically connect the nervous system to a device whereas BCI's usually connect the brain or nervous system with a computer system practical neuroprosthetics can be linked to any part of the nervous system for example peripheral nerves while the term BCI usually designates a narrower class of systems which interface with the central nervous system the terms are sometimes however used interchangeably neuroprosthetics and BCI's seek to achieve the same aims such as restoring sight hearing movement ability to communicate and even cognitive function both use similar experimental methods and surgical techniques topic animal BCI research several laboratories have managed to record signals from monkey and rat cerebral cortices to operate BCI's to produce movement monkeys have navigated computer cursors on screen and commanded robotic arms to perform simple tasks simply by thinking about the task and seeing the visual feedback but without any motor output in May 2008 photographs that showed a monkey at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center operating a robotic arm by thinking were published in a number of well-known science journals and magazines topic early work in 1969 the operant conditioning studies of FETs and colleagues at the regional Primate Research Center and department of physiology and biophysics University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle showed for the first time that monkeys could learn to control the deflection of a biofeedback meter armed with neural activity similar work in the 1970's established that monkeys could quickly learn to voluntarily control the firing rates of individual and multiple neurons in the primary motor cortex if they were rewarded for generating appropriate patterns of neural activity studies that developed algorithms to reconstruct movements from motor cortex neurons which control movement date back to the 1970s in the 1980's Apostolos georgopoulos at johns hopkins university found a mathematical relationship between the electrical responses of single motor cortex neurons in rhesus macaque monkeys in the direction in which they move their arms based on a cosine function he also found that dispersed groups of neurons in different areas of the monkeys brains collectively controlled motor commands but was able to record the firings of neurons in only one area at a time because of the technical limitations imposed by his equipment there has been rapid development in BCI's since the mid 1990s several groups have been able to capture complex brain motor cortex signals by recording from neural ensembles groups of neurons and using these to control external devices topic prominent research successes you topic Kennedy in yang Dan Philip Kennedy who later founded neural signals in 1987 and colleagues built the first intro cortical brain computer interface by implanting neurotrophic cone electrodes into monkeys in 1999 researchers led by yang Dan at the University of California Berkeley decoded neuronal firings to reproduce images seen by cats the team used an array of electrodes embedded in the thalamus which integrates all of the brains sensory input of sharp-eyed cats researchers targeted 177 brain cells in the thalamus lateral geniculate nucleus area which decodes signals from the retina the cats were shown eight short movies and then neuron firings were recorded using mathematical filters the researchers decoded the signals to generate movies of what the cats saw and were able to reconstruct recognizable scenes and moving objects similar results in humans have since been achieved by researchers in Japan see below topic Nicolelis Miguel Nicolelis a professor at Duke University in Durham North Carolina has been a prominent proponent of using multiple electrodes spread over a greater area of the brain to obtain neuronal signals to driver BCI after conducting initial studies in rats during the 1990s Nicolelis and his colleagues developed BCI is that decoded brain activity in owl monkeys and used the devices to reproduce monkey movements in robotic arms monkeys have advanced reaching and grasping abilities and good hand manipulation skills making them ideal test subjects for this kind of work by 2000 the group succeeded in building a BCI that reproduced owl monkey movements while the monkey operated a joystick or reached for food the BCI operated in real-time and could also control a separate robot remotely over Internet Protocol but the monkeys could not see the arm moving and did not receive any feedback a so-called open-loop BCI later experiments by Nicolelis using rhesus monkeys succeeded in closing the feedback loop and reproduced monkey reaching and grasping movements in a robot arm with their deeply cleft and furrowed brains rhesus monkeys are considered to be better models for human neurophysiology than al monkeys the monkeys were trained to reach and grasp objects on a computer screen by manipulating a joystick while corresponding movements by a robot arm were hidden the monkeys were later shown the robot directly and learned to control it by viewing its movements the BCI used velocity predictions to control reaching movements and simultaneously predicted hand gripping force in 2011 Odadjian colleagues showed a BCI with sensory feedback with rhesus monkeys the monkey was brain controlling the position of an avatar arm while receiving sensory feedback through direct intra cortical stimulation eye CMS in the armed representation area of the sensory cortex topic Donoghue Schwartz in Anderson other laboratories which have developed BCI's and algorithms that decode neuron signals include those run by John Donoghue at Brown University andrey schwartz at the University of Pittsburgh and Richard Anderson at Cal Tech these researchers have been able to produce working BCI's even using recorded signals from far fewer neurons than did Nicholas 15 to 30 neurons versus 50 to 200 neurons Donoghue's group reported training rhesus monkeys to use a BCI to track visual targets on a computer screen closed-loop BCI with or without assistance of a joystick Schwartz's group created a BCI for three-dimensional tracking in virtual reality and also reproduced BCI control in a robotic arm the same group also created headlines when they demonstrated that a monkey could feed itself pieces of fruit and marshmallows using a robotic arm controlled by the animals own brain signals Anderson's group used recordings of pre movement activity from the posterior parietal cortex in the BCI including signals created when experimental animals anticipated receiving a reward topic other research in addition to predicting kinematic and kinetic parameters of limb movements BCI's that predict electromyographic or electrical activity of the muscles of primates are being developed such BCI's could be used to restore mobility in paralyzed limbs by electrically stimulating muscles Miguel Nicolelis and colleagues demonstrated that the activity of large neural ensembles can predict arm position this work made possible creation of BCI's that read our movement intentions and translate them into movements of artificial actuators carmina and colleagues programmed the neural coding in a BCI that allowed a monkey to control reaching and grasping movements by a robotic arm Lebedev and colleagues argued that brain networks reorganized to create a new representation of the robotic appendage in a to the representation of the animals own limbs the biggest impediment to BCI technology at present is the lack of a sensor modality that provides safe accurate and robust access to brain signals it is conceivable or even likely however that such a sensor will be developed within the next 20 years the use of such a sensor should greatly expand the range of communication functions that can be provided using a BCI development and implementation of a BCI system is complex and time-consuming in response to this problem go and Shelke has been developing a general-purpose system for BCI research called BCI mm BCI mm has been in development since 2000 in a project led by the brain computer interface R&D program at the wodsworth center of the New York State Department of Health in Albany New York United States a new wireless approach uses light gated ion channels such as channelrhodopsin to control the activity of genetically defined subsets of neurons in vivo in the context of a simple learning task illumination of transfected cells in the somatosensory cortex influenced the decision-making process of freely moving mice the use of BMIs has also led to a deeper understanding of neural networks in the central nervous system research has shown that despite the inclination of neuro scientists to believe that neurons have the most effect when working together single neurons can be conditioned through the use of BMIs to fire at a pattern that allows primates to control motor outputs the use of BMIs has led to development of the single neuron insufficiency principle which states that even with a well tuned firing rate single neurons can only carry a narrow amount of information and therefore the highest level of accuracy is achieved by recording firings of the collective ensemble other principles discovered with the use of BMI is include the neuronal multi-tasking principle the neuronal mass principle the neural degeneracy principle and the plasticity principle BCI's are also proposed to be applied by users without disabilities a user centered categorization of BCI approaches by Torsten Oh Xander and Christian kurtter introduces the term passive BCI next to active and reactive BCI that are used for directed control passive BCI is allow for assessing and interpreting changes in the user state during human-computer interaction HCI in a secondary implicit control loop the computer system adapts to its user improving its usability in general topic the BCI award the annual BCI research award is awarded in recognition of outstanding and innovative research in the field of brain-computer interfaces each year a renowned research laboratory is asked to judge the submitted projects the jury consists of world leading BCI experts recruited by the awarding laboratory the jury selects 12 nominees then chooses a 1st 2nd and 3rd place winner who receive awards of $3,000 $2,000 and $1,000 respectively the following list presents the

variations topic human BCI research you topic invasive BCI's invasive BCI requires surgery to implant electrodes under scalp for communicating brain signals the main advantage is to provide more accurate reading however its downside includes side effects from the surgery after the surgery scar tissues may form which can make brain signals weaker in addition according to the research of abdul qader at al 2015 once implanted electrodes the body may not accept the electrodes which may cause medical complications topic vision invasive BCI research has targeted repairing damaged site and providing new functionality for people with paralysis invasive BCI's are implanted directly into the gray matter of the brain during neurosurgery because they lie in the gray matter invasive devices produce the highest quality signals of BCI devices but a prone to scar tissue build up causing the signal to become weaker or even non-existent as the body reacts to a foreign object in the brain in vision science direct brain implants have been used to treat non congenital acquired blindness one of the first scientists to produce a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher William Dobell dough balls first prototype was implanted into Jerry a man blinded in adulthood in 1978 a single array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry's visual cortex and succeeded in producing phosphenes the sensation of seeing light the system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant initially the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of gray in a limited field of vision at a low frame rate this also required him to be hooked up to a mainframe computer but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted in 2002 Jenson almond also blinded in adulthood became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive doable second-generation implant marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BC eyes the second-generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry night effect immediately after his implant Jen's was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive an automobile slowly around the parking area of the Research Institute unfortunately Dobel died in 2004 before his processes and developments were documented subsequently when mr. Naumann and the other patients in the program began having problems with their vision there was no relief and they eventually lost their sight again now Minh wrote about his experience with doubles work in search for paradise a patient's account of the artificial vision experiment and has returned to his farm in Southeast Ontario Canada to resume his normal activities topic movement BC is focusing on motor neuroprosthetics aim to either restore movement in individuals with paralysis or provide devices to assist them such as interfaces with computers or robot arms researchers at Emory University in Atlanta led by Philip Kennedy and Roy Bacchae were first to install a brain implant in a human that produced signals of high enough quality to simulate movement their patient Johnny ray 1944 to 2002 suffered from locked-in syndrome after suffering a brainstem stroke in 1997 Ray's implant was installed in 1998 and he lived long enough to start working with the implant eventually learning to control a computer cursor he died in 2002 of a brain aneurysm tetraplegic Matt Nagel became the first person to control an artificial hand using a BCI in 2005 as part of the first nine-month human trial of cyber kinetics brain gate chip implant implanted in Nagle's right precentral gyrus area of the motor cortex for our movement the 96 electrode brain gate implant allowed Nagel to control a robotic arm by thinking about moving his hand as well as a computer cursor lights and TV one year later Professor Jonathan well Paul received the prize of the Ultron foundation for innovation to develop a brain computer interface with electrodes located on the surface of the skull instead of directly in the brain more recently research teams led by the brain gate group at Brown University in a group led by University of Pittsburgh Medical Center both in collaborations with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs have demonstrated further success in direct control of robotic prosthetic limbs with many degrees of freedom using direct connections to arrays of neurons in the motor cortex of patients with tetraplegia topic partially invasive BCI's partially invasive BCI devices are implanted inside the skull but rest outside the brain rather than within the gray matter they produce better resolution signals than non-invasive BCI is where the bone tissue of the cranium deflects and deforms signals and have a lower risk of forming scar tissue in the brain than fully invasive BCI's there has been preclinical demonstration of intra cortical BCI's from the strop pair illusional cortex electro cortical graphi ECoG measures the electrical activity of the brain taken from beneath the skull in a similar way to non-invasive electroencephalography but the electrodes are embedded in a thin plastic pad that is placed above the cortex beneath the dura mater ecog technologies were first trialed in humans in 2004 by Eric Luth art and daniel moran from washington university in st. louis in a later trial the researchers enabled a teenage boy to play space invaders using his ECoG implant this research indicates that control is rapid requires minimal training and may be an ideal trade-off with regards to signal fidelity and level of invasiveness note these electrodes had not been implanted in the patient with the intention of developing a BCI the patient had been suffering from severe epilepsy and the electrodes were temporarily implanted to help his physicians localize seizure foci the BCI researchers simply took advantage of this signals can be either subdural or epidural but are not taken from within the brain parenchyma itself it has not been studied extensively until recently due to the limited access of subjects currently the only manner to acquire the signal for study is through the use of patients requiring invasive monitoring for localization and resection of an epileptic Anik focus ECoG is a very promising intermediate BCI modality because it has higher spatial resolution better signal-to-noise ratio wider frequency range and training requirements than scalp recorded EEG and at the same time has lower technical difficulty lower clinical risk and probably superior long-term stability than intra cortical single neuron recording this feature profile and recent evidence of the high level of control with minimal training requirements shows potential for real world application for people with motor disabilities light reactive imaging BCI devices are still in the realm of theory these would involve implanting a laser inside the skull the laser would be trained on a single neuron and the neurons reflectance measured by a separate sensor when the neuron fires the laser light pattern and wavelengths it reflects would change slightly this would allow researchers to monitor single neurons but require less contact with tissue and reduce the risk of scar tissue build up topic noninvasive BCI's there have also been experiments in humans using non-invasive neuroimaging technologies as interfaces the substantial majority of published BCI work involves non-invasive EEG based BCI's non-invasive EEG based technologies and interfaces have been used for a much broader variety of applications although EEG based interfaces are easy to wear and do not require surgery they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot effectively use higher frequency signals because the skull dampens signals dispersing and blurring the electromagnetic waves created by the neurons EEG based interfaces also requires some time and effort prior to each usage session whereas non EEG based ones as well as invasive ones require no prior usage training overall the best BCI for each user depends on numerous factors topic non EEG based human-computer interface you topic pupil size oscillation in a 2016 article an entirely new communication device and non EEG based human-computer interface was developed requiring no visual fixation or ability to move eyes at all that is based on covet interest in ie without fixing eyes on chosen letter on a virtual keyboard with letters each having its own background circle that is micro oscillating in brightness in different time transitions where the letter selection is based on best fit between on one hand unintentional pupil size oscillation pattern and on the other hand the circle in backgrounds brightness oscillation pattern accuracy is additionally improved by users mental rehearsing the words bright and dark in synchrony with the brightness transitions of the circle letter topic functional near-infrared spectroscopy in 2014 and 2017 a BCI using functional near-infrared spectroscopy for locked-in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis else was able to restore some basic ability of the patients to communicate with other people topic electroencephalography EEG based brain computer interfaces you topic overview electroencephalography EEG is the most studied non-invasive interface mainly due to its fine temporal resolution ease-of-use portability and low set-up cost the technology is somewhat susceptible to noise however in the early days of BCI research another substantial barrier to using EEG is a brain computer interface was the extensive training required before users can work the technology for example in experiments beginning in the mid-1990s Niels BER bomber at the University of Tuebingen in Germany trained severely paralyzed people to self-regulate the slow cortical potentials in their EEG to such an extent that these signals could be used as a binary signal to control a computer cursor BER bomber had earlier trained epileptics to prevent impending fits by controlling this low voltage wave the experiments or 10 patients trained to move a computer cursor by controlling their brainwaves the process was slow requiring more than an hour for patients to write 100 characters with the cursor while training often took many months however the slow cortical potential approach to BCI's has not been used in several years since other approaches require little or no training a faster and more accurate and work for a greater proportion of users another research parameter is the type of oscillatory activity that is measured Birbal ms later research with jonathan Wolper at new york state university has focused on developing technology that would allow users to choose the brain signals they found easiest to operate a BCI including mu and beta rhythms a further parameter is the method of feedback used and this is shown in studies of p300 signals patterns of p300 waves are generated involuntarily stimulus feedback when people see something they recognize and may allow BCI's to decode categories of thoughts without training patients first by contrast the biofeedback methods described above require learning to control brain wave so the resulting brain activity can be detected while in EEG based brain computer interface has been pursued extensively by a number of research labs recent advancements made by been he and his team at the University of Minnesota suggests the potential of an EEG based brain computer interface to accomplish tasks close to invasive brain computer interface using advanced functional neuroimaging including bold functional MRI and EEG source imaging been he and co-workers identified the covariation and Co localization of electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals induced by motor imagination refined by a neuro imaging approach and by a training protocol then he and co-workers demonstrated the ability of a non-invasive EEG based brain computer interface to control the flight of a virtual helicopter in three-dimensional space based upon motor imagination in June 2013 it was announced that Ben he had developed the technique to enable a remote control helicopter to be guided through an obstacle course in addition to a brain computer interface based on brainwaves as recorded from scalp EEG electrodes Ben he and co-workers explored a virtual EEG signal based brain computer interface by first solving the EEG inverse problem and then used the resulting virtual EEG for brain computer interface tasks well-controlled studies suggested the merits of such a source analysis based brain computer interface a 2014 study found that severely motor impaired patients could communicate faster and more reliably with non-invasive EEG BCI than with any muscle based communication channel topic DRI active electrode arrays in the early 1990s Babbitt Taheri at University of california-davis demonstrated the first single and also multi-channel dry active electrode arrays using micro machining the single channel dry EEG electrode construction and results were published in 1994 the arrayed electrode was also demonstrated to perform well compared to silver silver chloride electrodes the device consisted of four sites of sensors with integrated electronics to reduce noise by impedance matching the advantages of such electrodes are one know electrolyte used to know skin preparation three significantly reduced sensor size and for compatibility with EEG monitoring systems the active electrode array is an integrated system made of an array of capacitive sensors with local integrated circuitry housed in a package with batteries to power the circuitry this level of integration was required to achieve the functional performance obtained by the electrode the electrode was tested on an electrical test bench and on human subjects in four modalities of EEG activity namely one spontaneous EEG to sensory event-related potentials 3 brainstem potentials and for cognitive event-related potentials the performance of the dry electrode compared favorably with that of the standard wet electrodes in terms of skin preparation no gel requirements dry and higher signal-to-noise ratio in 1999 researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland Ohio led by Hunter Peckham used 64 electrode EEG skullcap to return limited hand movements to quadriplegic Jim Shattuck as jutted concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like up and down his beta rhythm EEG output was analyzed using software to identify patterns in the noise a basic pattern was identified and used to control a switch above average activity was set to on below frig off as well as enabling Jat itch to control a computer cursor the signals were also used to drive the nerve control is embedded in his hands restoring some movement topic SS VP mobile eg BCI's in 2009 the NCT you brain computer interface headband was reported the researchers who developed this BCI headband also engineered silicon based micro electromechanical system MEMS dry electrodes designed for application in non-hairy sites of the body these electrodes were secured to the da Q board in the headband with snap-on electrode holders the signal processing module measured alpha activity in the Bluetooth enabled phone assess the patient's alertness and capacity for cognitive performance when the subject became drowsy the phone sent arousing feedback to the operator to rouse them this research was supported by the National Science Council taiwan roc NSC National Chiu Tong University Taiwan's Ministry of Education and the US Army Research Laboratory in 2011 researchers reported a cellular based BCI with the capability of taking EEG data and converting it into a command to cause the phone to ring this research was supported in part by Abraxas bioscience LLP the US Army Research Laboratory and the Army Research Office the develop technology was a wearable system composed of a four-channel bio signal acquisition amplification module a wireless transmission module and a Bluetooth enabled cell phone the electrodes were placed so that they pick up steady state visual evoked potentials ssv EPS ssv EPS are electrical responses to flickering visual stimuli with repetition rates over six Hertz that are best found in the parietal and occipital scalp regions of the visual cortex it was reported that with this BCI setup all study participants were able to initiate the phone call with minimal practice in natural environments the scientists claimed that the studies using a single channel fast Fourier transform FFT and multiple channel system canonical correlation analysis CCA algorithm support the capacity of mobile BCI the CCA algorithm has been applied in other experiments investigating BCI's with claimed high performance in accuracy as well as speed while the cellular based BCI technology was developed to initiate a phone call from SS V EPS the researchers said that it can be translated from other applications such as picking up sensorimotor mu beta rhythms to function as a motor imagery based BCI in 2013 comparative tests were performed on android cell phone tablet and computer based BCI's analyzing the power spectrum density of resultant EEG ssv EPS the stated goals of this study which involved scientists supported in part by the US Army Research Laboratory were to increase the practicability Portability and ubiquity of an SS V EP based BCI for daily use citation it was reported that the stimulation frequency on all mediums was accurate although the cell phone signal demonstrated some instability the amplitudes of the SSV EPS for the laptop and tablet were also reported to be larger than those of the cell phone these two qualitative characterizations were suggested as indicators of the feasibility of using a mobile stimulus BCI topic limitations in 2011 researchers stated that continued work should address ease-of-use performance robustness reducing hardware and software costs one of the difficulties with EEG readings is the large susceptibility to motion artifacts in most the previously described research projects the participants were asked to sit still reducing head and eye movements as much as possible and measurements were taken in a laboratory setting however since the emphasized application of these initiatives had been in creating a mobile device for daily use the technology had to be tested in motion in 2013 researchers tested mobile EEG based BCI technology measuring ssv EPS from participants as they walked on a treadmill at varying speeds this research was supported by the Office of Naval Research Army Research Office and the US Army Research Laboratory stated results were that as speed increased the SSV EP detect ability using CC a decreased as independent component analysis eeka had been shown to be efficient in separating EEG signals from noise the scientists applied iike to CCA extracted EEG data they stated that the CCA data with and without iike processing were similar thus they concluded that CCA independently demonstrated a robustness to motion artifacts that indicates it may be a beneficial algorithm to apply to BCI's used in real-world conditions topic prosthesis and environment control non-invasive BCI's have also been applied to enable brain control of prosthetic upper and lower extremity devices in people with paralysis for example Gert virtually of Grass University of Technology and colleagues demonstrated a BCI controlled functional electrical stimulation system to restore upper extremity movements in a person with tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury between 2012 and 2013 researchers at the University of California Irvine demonstrated for the first time that it is possible to use BCI technology to restore brain controlled walking after spinal cord injury in the spinal cord injury research study a person with paraplegia was able to operate a BCI robotic gait orthosis to regain basic brain controlled ambulation in 2009 Alex Blaney an independent researcher based in the UK successfully used the Emotiv EPOC to control a five axis robot arm he then went on to make several demonstration mind controlled wheelchairs and home automation that could be operated by people with limited or no motor controls such as those with paraplegia in cerebral palsy research into military use of BCI is funded by D ARPA has been ongoing since the 1970s the current focus of research is user to user communication through analysis of neural signals topic DIY and open source BCI in 2001 the opening project was initiated by a group of DIY neuro scientists and engineers the modular ich was the primary device created by the open e community it was a six channel signal capture board that cost between $200 and $400 to make at home the open e project marked a significant moment in the emergence of DIY brain computer interfacing in 2010 the frontier nerds of NYU's ITP program published a thorough tutorial titled how to hack toy aegs the tutorial which stirred the minds of many budding DIY BCI enthusiasts demonstrated how to create a single channel at home EEG with an Arduino in a Mattel min flex at a very reasonable price this tutorial amplified the DIY BCI movement in 2013 open BCI emerged from a dar PA solicitation and subsequent Kickstarter campaign they created a high quality open-source 8 channel EEG acquisition board known as the 32-bit board that retailed for under $500 two years later they created the first 3d printed EEG headset known as the ultra cortex as well as a 4 channel EEG acquisition board known as the ganglion board that retailed for under $100 topic mega and MRI magneto encephalography meg and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI have both been used successfully as non-invasive BCI's in a widely reported experiment fMRI allowed two users being scanned to play pong in real time by altering their hemodynamic response or brain blood flow through biofeedback techniques fMRI measurements of hemodynamic responses in real-time have also been used to control robot arms with a seven second delay between thought and movement in 2008 research developed in the advanced telecommunications research ATR computational neuroscience laboratories in Kyoto Japan allowed the scientists to reconstruct images directly from the brain and display them on a computer in black and white at a resolution of 10 by 10 pixels the article announcing these achievements was the cover story of the journal neuron of the 10th of December 2008 in 2011 researchers from UC Berkeley published a study reporting second-by-second reconstruction of videos watched by the studies subjects from fMRI data this was achieved by creating a statistical model relating visual patterns in videos shown to the subjects to the brain activity caused by watching the videos this model was then used to look up the 101 second video segments in a database of 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos whose visual patterns most closely matched the brain activity recorded when subjects watched a new video these 101 second video extracts were then combined into a mashed up image that resembled the video being watched topic BCI control strategies in neuro gaming you topic motor imagery motor imagery involves the imagination of the movement of various body parts resulting in sensory motor cortex activation which modulates sensory motor oscillations in the EEG this can be detected by the BCI to infer a user's intent motor imagery typically requires a number of sessions of training before acceptable control of the BCI is acquired these training sessions may take a number of hours over several days before users can consistently employ the technique with acceptable levels of precision regardless of the duration of the training session users are unable to master the control scheme this results in very slow pace of the gameplay advanced machine learning methods were recently developed to compute a subject specific model for detecting the performance of motor imagery the top-performing algorithm from BCI competition IV data set 2 for motor imagery is the filter Bank common spatial pattern developed by an al from a asterisk star Singapore topic bio neurofeedback for passive BCI designs biofeedback is used to monitor a subjects mental relaxation in some cases biofeedback does not monitor electroencephalography EEG but instead bodily parameters such as electromyography EMG galvanic skin resistance GSR and heart rate variability HRV many biofeedback systems are used to treat certain disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD sleep problems in children teeth grinding and chronic pain EEG biofeedback systems typically monitor four different bands theta four to seven Hertz alpha eight to 12 Hertz SMR 12 to 15 Hertz beta 15 to 18 Hertz and challenge the subject to control them passive BCI involves using BCI to enrich human machine interaction with implicit information on the actual users state for example simulations to detect when users intend to push brakes during an emergency car stopping procedure game developers using passive BCI's need to acknowledge that through repetition of game levels the user's cognitive state will change or adapt within the first play of a level the user will react to things differently from during the second play for example the user will be less surprised at an event in the game if he/she is expecting it topic visual evoked potential vep a vep is an electrical potential recorded after a subject is presented with a type of visual stimuli there are several types of V EPS steady-state visually evoked potentials ssv EPS use potentials generated by exciting the retina using visual stimuli modulated at certain frequencies SS V EP stimuli are often formed from alternating checkerboard patterns and at times simply use flashing images the frequency of the phase reversal of the stimulus used can be clearly distinguished in the spectrum of an EEG this makes detection of SS V EP stimuli relatively easy SS V EP has proved to be successful within many BCI systems this is due to several factors the signal elicited is measurable in as large a population as the transient v EP in blink movement and electrocardiographic artifacts do not affect the frequencies monitored in addition the SS V EP signal is exceptionally robust the topographic organization of the primary visual cortex is such that a broader area obtains afferents from the central or foveal region of the visual field SS V EP does have several problems however as SS V EPS use flashing stimuli to infer reuses intent the user must gaze at one of the flashing or iterating symbols in order to interact with the system it is therefore likely that the symbols could become irritating and uncomfortable to use during longer play sessions which can often lasts more than an hour which may not be an ideal game play another type of v EP used with applications is the p300 potential the p300 event-related potential is a positive peak in the EEG that occurs at roughly 300 milliseconds after the appearance of a target stimulus a stimulus for which the user is waiting or seeking or oddball stimuli the P 300 amplitude decreases as the target stimuli and the ignored stimuli crome similar the p300 is thought to be related to a higher-level attention process or an orienting response using p300 as a control scheme has the advantage of the participant only having to attend limited training sessions the first application to use the p300 model was the p300 matrix within this system a subject would choose a letter from a grid of six by six letters and numbers the rows and columns of the grid flashed sequentially and every time the selected choice letter was illuminated the users p300 was potentially elicited however the communication process at approximately 17 characters per minute was quite slow the p300 is a BCI that offers a discrete selection rather than a continuous control mechanism the advantage of p300 use within games is that the player does not have to teach himself/herself how to use a completely new control system and so only has to undertake short training instances to learn the gameplay mechanics and basic use of the BCI paradigm topic synthetic telepathy silent communication in 2010 the darpa's budget for the fiscal year included four million dollars to start up a program called silent talk the goal was to allow user to use a communication on the battlefield without the use of vocalized speech through analysis of neural signals the program had three major goals one to attempt to identify electroencephalography patterns unique to individual words to ensure that those patterns are generalizable across users in order to prevent extensive device training and three construct a field herbal pre prototype that would decode the signal and transmit over a limited range in a six point three million dollars army initiative to invent devices for telepathic communication go and shout underwritten in a 2.2 million dollars grant found the use of ecog signals can discriminate the vowels and consonants embedded in spoken and imagined words shedding light on the distinct mechanisms associated with production of vowels and consonants and could provide the basis for brain based communication using imagine speech in 2002 Kevin Warwick had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the internet to investigate enhancement possibilities with this in place Warwick successfully carried out a series of experiments with electrodes also implanted into his wife's nervous system they conducted the first direct electronic communication experiment between the nervous systems of two humans research into synthetic telepathy using subvocalization is taking place at the University of California Irvine and elite scientist mike d'zmura the first such communication took place in the 1960s using EEG to create Morse code using brain alpha waves using EEG to communicate imagine speech is less accurate than the invasive method of placing an electrode between the skull in the brain on the 27th of February 2013 the group with Miguel Nicolelis at Duke University ìin NL successfully connected the brains of two rats with electronic interfaces that allowed them to directly share information in the first-ever direct brain-to-brain interface on the 3rd of September 2014 direct communication between human brains became a possibility over extended distances through internet transmission of EEG signals in March in May 2014 a study conducted by departamento dice ecology a general university to diapered over evn lab4 ends liquid web s r l company and departamento died in january re-architecture università died Trieste showed confirmatory results analyzing the EEG activity of two human partners spatially separated approximately 190 kilometers apart when one member of the pair receives the stimulation and the second one is connected only mentally with the first topic cell culture BCI's researchers have built devices to interface with neural cells and entire neural networks in cultures outside animals as well as furthering research on animal implantable devices experiments on cultured neural tissue have focused on building problem-solving networks constructing basic computers and manipulating robotic devices research into techniques for stimulating and recording from individual neurons grown on semiconductor chips is sometimes referred to as neuro electronics or neuro chips development of the first working neuro chip was claimed by a Caltech team led by Jerome pine and Michael Marr in 1997 the Caltech chip had room for 16 neurons in 2003 a team led by Theodore Berger at the University of Southern California started work on a neuro chip designed to function as an artificial or prosthetic hippocampus the neuro chip was designed to function in rat brains and was intended as a prototype for the eventual development of higher brain prosthesis the hippocampus was chosen because it is thought to be the most ordered and structured part of the brain and is the most studied area its function is to encode experiences for storage as long-term memories elsewhere in the brain in 2004 Thomas de Mass at the University of Florida used a culture of 25 thousand neurons taken from a rat's brain to fly our f-22 fighter jet aircraft simulator after collection the cortical neurons were cultured in a petri dish and rapidly began to reconnect themselves to form a living neural network the cells were arranged over a grid of 60 electrodes and used to control the pitch in your functions of the simulator the studies focus was on understanding how the human brain performs and learns computational tasks at a cellular level topic ethical considerations important ethical legal and societal issues related to brain computer interfacing uh conceptual issues researchers disagree over what is and what is not a brain computer interface obtaining informed consent from people who have difficulty communicating risk benefit analysis shared responsibility of BCI teams eg how to ensure that responsible group decisions can be made the consequences of BCI technology for the quality of life of patients and their families side-effects eg neurofeedback of sensory motor rhythm training is reported to affect sleep quality personal responsibility in it's possible constraints eg who is responsible for erroneous actions with a neuroprosthesis issues concerning personality and personhood and it's possible alteration blurring of the division between human and machine therapeutic applications and their possible exceedance questions of research ethics that arise when progressing from animal experimentation to application in human subjects mind reading and privacy mind control use of the technology in advanced interrogation techniques by governmental authorities selective enhancement and social stratification communication to the media in their current form most BC eyes are far removed from the ethical issues considered above they are actually similar to corrective therapies in function Claussen stated in 2009 that bc i spose ethical challenges but these are conceptually similar to those that bioethicists have addressed for other realms of therapy moreover he suggests that bioethics is well prepared to deal with the issues that arise with BCI technologies hazel Ashur and colleagues pointed out that expectations of BCI efficacy and value play a great role in ethical analysis and the way BC ice dentist should approach media furthermore standard protocols can be implemented to ensure ethically sound informed consent procedures with locked-in patients the case of BCI's today has parallels in medicine as will its evolution much as pharmaceutical science began as a balance for impairments and is now used to increase focus and reduce need for sleep BCI's will likely transform gradually from therapies to enhancements researchers are well aware that sound ethical guidelines appropriately moderated enthusiasm in media coverage and education about BCI systems will be of utmost importance for the societal acceptance of this technology thus recently more effort is made inside the BCI community to create consensus on ethical guidelines for BCI research development and dissemination topic low cost BCI based interfaces recently a number of companies have scaled back medical grade EEG technology and in one case NeuroSky rebuilt the technology from the ground up to create inexpensive BCI's this technology has been built into toys and gaming devices some of these toys have been extremely commercially successful like the NeuroSky and Mattel MIM flex in 2006 Sony patented a neural interface system allowing radio waves to affect signals in the neural cortex in 2007 NeuroSky released the first affordable consumer based EEG along with the game neuro boy this was also the first large-scale EEG device to use dry sensor technology in 2008 ocz technology developed a device for use in video games relying primarily on electromyography in 2008 the Final Fantasy developer Square Enix announced that it was partnering with NeuroSky to create a game jeu Decca in 2009 Mattel partnered with NeuroSky to release them in Flex a game that used an EEG to steer a ball through an obstacle course by far the best selling consumer based EEG to date in 2009 Uncle Milton industries partnered with NeuroSky to release the Star Wars Force trainer a game designed to create the illusion of possessing the force in 2009 emotive release the EPOC a 14 channel EEG device that can read for mental states 13 conscious states facial expressions and head movements the EPOC is the first commercial BCI to use dry sensor technology which can be dampened with a saline solution for a better connection in November 2011 Time magazine selected necomimi produced by neuro where as one of the best inventions of the year the company announced that it expected to launch a consumer version of the garment of cat-like is controlled by a brainwave reader produced by NeuroSky in spring 2012 in February 2014 they shall walk a nonprofit organization fixed on constructing exoskeletons dubbed Li Fe Sui T's for paraplegics and quadriplegics began a partnership with James W Shekhar ji on the development of a wireless BCI in 2016 a group of hobbyists developed an open-source BCI board that sends neural signals to the audio jack of a smartphone dropping the cost of entry-level BCI 220 pounds basic diagnostic software is available for Android devices as well as a text entry app for unity topic future directions a consortium consisting of 12 European partners has completed a road map to support the European Commission in their funding decisions for the new framework programme horizon 2020 the project which was funded by the European Commission started in November 2013 and ended in April 2015 the roadmap is now complete and can be downloaded on the project's web page a 2015 publication led by dr. Clemmens Brunner described some of the analyses and achievements of this project as well as the emerging brain computer interface society for example this article reviewed work within this project that further defined BCI's and applications explored recent trends discussed ethical issues and evaluated different directions for new BCI's as the article notes their new roadmap generally extends and supports the recommendations from the future be NCI project managed by dr. Brendan Allison which conveys substantial enthusiasm for emerging BCI directions in addition to other recent publications have explored the most promising future BCI directions for new groups of disabled users eg some prominent examples are summarized below topic disorders of consciousness duck some persons have a disorder of consciousness duck this state is defined to include persons with coma as well as persons in a vegetative state vs or minimally conscious state mcs new BCI research seeks to help persons with doc in different ways a key initial goal is to identify patients who are able to perform basic cognitive tasks which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis that is some persons who are diagnosed with doc may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions such as whether to seek therapy where to live and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them some persons who are diagnosed with doc die as a result of end-of-life decisions which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision there would seem to be a strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that doc patients are given an opportunity to decide whether they want to live these and other articles describe new challenges and solutions to use BCI technology to help persons with doc one major challenge is that these patients cannot use BCI is based on vision hence new tools rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile stimuli patients may wear headphones and/or vibrotactile stimulators placed on the wrists neck leg and/or other locations another challenge is that patients may fade in and out of consciousness and can only communicate at certain times this may indeed be a cause of mistaken diagnosis some patients may only be able to respond to physicians requests during a few hours per day which might not be predictable ahead of time and thus may have been unresponsive during diagnosis therefore new methods rely on tools that are easy to use in field settings even without expert help so family members and other persons without any medical or technical background consider use them this reduces the cost time need for expertise and other burdens with Doc assessment automated tools can ask simple questions that patients can easily answer such as is your father named George or were you born in the USA automated instructions inform patients that they may convey yes or no by for example focusing their attention on stimuli on the right versus left wrist this focused attention produces reliable changes in EEG patterns that can help determine that the patient is able to communicate the results could be presented to physicians and therapists which could lead to a revised diagnosis and therapy in addition these patients could then be provided with BCI based communication tools that could help them convey basic needs adjust bed position an HVAC heating ventilation and air conditioning and otherwise empower them to make major life decisions and communicate this research effort was supported in part by different EU funded projects such as the decoder project led by Professor Andrea Kubler at the University of works Berg this project contributed to the first BCI system developed for doc assessment and communication called mine beagle this system is designed to help non-expert users work with doc patients but is not intended to replace medical staff an EU funded project that began in 2015 called Combe alert conducted further research and development to improve doc prediction assessment rehabilitation and communication called Park in that project another project funded by the National Science Foundation is led by profs dean kruse en Suki and Chang Nam this project provides for improved vibrotactile systems advanced signal analysis and other improvements for doc assessment and communication topic motor recovery people may lose some of their ability to move due to many causes such as stroke or injury several groups have explored systems and methods for motor recovery that include BCI's in this approach a VCI measures motor activity while the patient imagines or attempts movements as directed by a therapist the BCI may provide two benefits one if the BCI indicates that a patient is not imagining a movement correctly non-compliance then the BCI could inform the patient and therapist and to rewarding feedback such as functional stimulation or the movement of a virtual avatar also depends on the patient's correct movement imagery so far BC is for motor recovery have relied on the EEG to measure the patient's motor imagery however studies have also used fMRI to study different changes in the brain as persons undergo BCI based stroke rehab training future systems might include the fMRI and other measures for real-time control such as functional near-infrared probably in tandem with EEG z' non-invasive brain stimulation has also been explored in combination with BCI's for motor recovery like the work with BCI's for doc this research direction was funded by different public funding mechanisms within the EU and elsewhere the vir project included work on a new system for stroke rehabilitation focused on BCI's and advanced virtual environments designed to provide the patient with immersive feedback to foster recovery this project and the recover expect that focused exclusively on a new BCI system for stroke patients contributed to a hardware and software platform called recover --ax this system includes a BCI as well as a functional electrical stimulator and virtual feedback in September 2016 a training facility called a recover Xtreme opened in Austria in which therapists use this system to provide motor rehab therapy to persons with stroke you topic functional brain mapping each year about 400,000 people undergo brain mapping during neurosurgery this procedure is often required for people with tumors or epilepsy that do not respond to medication during this procedure electrodes are placed on the brain to precisely identify the locations of structures and functional areas patients may be awake during neurosurgery and asked to perform certain tasks such as moving fingers or repeating words this is necessary so that surgeons can remove only the desired tissue while sparing other regions such as critical movement or language regions removing too much brain tissue can cause permanent damage while removing too little tissue can leave the underlying condition untreated and require additional neurosurgery thus there is a strong need to improve both methods and systems to map the brain as effectively as possible in several recent publications BCI research experts and medical doctors have collaborated to explore new ways to use BCI technology to improve neurosurgical mapping this work focuses largely on high gamma activity which is difficult to detect with non-invasive means results have led to improved methods for identifying key areas for movement language and other functions a recent article addressed advances in functional brain mapping and summarizes a workshop topic flexible devices flexible electronics are polymers or other flexible materials eg silk pentacene PDMS perylene polyamide that are printed with circuitry the flexible nature of the organic background materials allowing the electronics created to bend and the fabrication techniques utilized to create these devices resembles those used to create integrated circuits and micro electromechanical systems MEMS flexible electronics were first developed in the 1960s and 1970s but research interest increased in the mid 2000s topic neural dust neural dust is a term used to refer to millimeter sized devices operated as wirelessly powered nerve senses that were proposed in a 2011 paper from the University of California Berkeley Wireless Research Center which described both the challenges and outstanding benefits of creating a long-lasting wireless BCI in one proposed model of the neural dust sensor the transistor model allowed for a method of separating between local field potentials and action potential spikes which would allow for a greatly diversified wealth of data
