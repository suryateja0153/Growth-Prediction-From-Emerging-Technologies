 GOOD AFTERNOON. IT'S NOW 1:30 AND I AM PLEASED TO OPEN THE THIRD OF OUR VIRTUAL MEETING SERIES OF THE NATIONAL RESEARCH SUMMIT ON CARE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. NEXT SLIDE. MY NAME IS JENNIFER -- GO BACK. MY NAME IS JENNIFER WOLF, I'M HONORED TO CO-CHAIR THE 2020 SUMMIT WITH DR. REUBEN YOU WILL HEAR FROM SHORTLY. NEXT SLIDE. THIS EVENT HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FOUNDATION FOR THE NIH. THE ORGANIZATIONS LISTED HERE MADE GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS EVENT THROUGH THE NIH INCLUDING THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION, A LEAD SPONSOR. NEXT SLIDE. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF THE 2020 SUMMIT IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH PRIORITIES TO INFORM FEDERAL AGENCIES FOUNDATIONS AND PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS. TO SET THE STAGE FOR THESE GAPS IN OPPORTUNITIES THE SUMMIT WILL SUMMARIZE THE STATE OF THE SCIENCE AND HIGHLIGHT PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE SINCE AND AS A RESULT OF THE 2017 SUMMIT. NEXT SLIDE. THE BULK OF THE THREE VIRTUAL MEETINGS HAVE BEEN STRUCTURED AROUND SIX THEMES ON THE SLIDE. THE FIRST THREE FOCUSES ON PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA AND/OR CAREGIVERS AND UNDERSTANDING IMPACTS OF THE DISEASE AND THEIR EXPERIENCES. THEMES 4 THROUGH 6 ARE DIRECTED HOW WE DO RESEARCH. TODAY WE ARE -- FOCUS ON SESSION 5 INTERVENTION RESEARCH DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION, SESSION 6 RESEARCH RESOURCES METHODS AND DATA INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS PANEL ON EMERGING TOPICS. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE DESCRIPTION OF EACH THEME AND RELATED GAPS IN OPPORTUNITIES ARE PROVIDED IN ONLINE PROGRAM BOOK AND WEBSITE. NEXT SLIDE. A NUMBER OF CROSS CUTTING ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED, THESE CROSS CUTTING THEMES INCLUDE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING AND INCORPORATING THE PERSPECTIVES OF PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR CAREGIVERS DISPARITY,ETHICS, TECHNOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY. PRESENTERS HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO ADDRESS EACH THEME IN THEIR PRESENTATIONS WHICH ARE PROMINENT FEATURE OF TODAY'S EMERGING TOPICS THEME. NEXT SLIDE. A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF SUMMIT PLANNING IS SEN SURING WE ARE LISTENING AND INCORPORATING THE PERSPECTIVES OF EACH STEP IN THE PROCESS INCLUDING ISSUING A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION, MORE THAN A YEAR AGO THE OUTSET OF THE PROCESS, ASSEMBLING A STEERING COMMITTEE WITH DIVERSE EXPERTISE, SOLICITING AND COORDINATING INPUT FROM FIVE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS COORDINATED INTO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF PLANNING AND E SAM WEIGH. LED BY IMPORTANTLY LED BY KATIE, ENGAGING FEDERAL PARTNERS AND NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S ADVISORY COUNCIL AND ENGAGING AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION BEFORE DURING AND AFTER EACH SUMMIT MEETINGS. THE FIRST TWO SUMMIT MEETINGS WE HEARD FROM KATIE BRANCH CYNTHIA AND LORI WHO THANKS FOR THEIR IMPORTANT INCITE AND TODAY WE WILL BE HEARING AS WELL FROM VICTIMS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE CO-CHAIR DR. DAVID REUBEN TO DISCUSS SUMMIT ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS TODAY'S MEET EGG. NEXT SLIDE.  THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO OFFER MY WELCOME TO EVERYONE. I'M GOING TO RECAP THE BIDDING A LITTLE BIT. ON JULY 10TH WE HAD OUR FIRST VIRTUAL MEETING WHICH FOCUSED ON THEME ONE, THE IMPACT AND THEME 4 ARE PARTICIPATION OF PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA AND HAIR CAREGIVERS IN RESEARCH. ON JULY 21ST WE FOCUSED ON LONG TERM CARE SERVICES IN VARIOUS SETTINGS AND MEDICARE -- MEDICAL CARE SETTINGS AS WELL AS INTEGRATION OF THEMES 2 AND 3. RECORDINGS AND SLIDES ARE AVAILABLE AT THE SUMMIT WEBSITE. LAST FRIDAY AUGUST 7 YOU GOT A NOVEL VIRTUAL TWITTER POSTER SESSION THAT WAS GREAT AND AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO VIEW. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THERE WE GO. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THREE OF THESE, THE WAY THIS WORKS IS YOU LOOK AT ONE, EVERY FEW SECONDS IT ADVANCES AND YOU CAN VIEW AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT. THESE ARE QUITE GOOD AND THERE WAS AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE ARE INVITING PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE WITH SUBMITTING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR TODAY'S SESSION. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET TO ALL BUT WILL DO AS MANY AS WE CAN. WE ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO RESPOND TO THE RFI, TO INDICATE SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS OF DRAFT S, OPPORTUNITIES OR SUGGEST NEW ONES AND THEN AFTER SUMMIT GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE COMPLETED AROUND BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO STAY ENGAGE AND WORK TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING THIS RESEARCH. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO TODAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE -- TALK ABOUT EMERGING TOPICS. INTERVENTIONAL RESEARCH, DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION AND RESEARCH RESOURCES, METHODS AND DATA INFRASTRUCTURE. EACH SESSION WILL INCLUDE SHORT RESEARCH PRESENTATIONS, INTRODUCTION OF DRAFT RESEARCH GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES, AND PANELIST PERSPECTIVES AND THEN A MODERATED QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION. HERE WE INVITE PEOPLE TO SUBMIT QUESTIONS SO ONE PRESENT THEM TO THE PANELISTS AND SPEAKERS. WE WILL KEEP THE INTRODUCTIONS VERY BRIEF. I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE AGENDA WHERE PEOPLE'S FULL BIOGRAPHIES ARE LISTED. THESE ARE INTERESTING PEOPLE, READ ABOUT THEM. SO WE ARE GOING TO BE BEGIN WITH THE EMERGING TOPICS SESSION. THREE RESEARCH PRESENTATIONS, THE FIRST WILL BE BY JOAN MONIN, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR YALE SCHOOL OF HEALTH AND DEVOTING HER RESEARCH CAREER TO UNDERSTANDING AND IMPROVING THE EMOTION ALVING LIVESES OF CAREGIVERS. FOLLOWED BY JARRED BENGE, A CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY AT THE BAILOR SCOTT WHITE, INTERESTED IN ASESSIONMENT AND PATIENT CENTERED -- ASSESSMENT AND PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES THEN FINALLY FROM CHRISTINE CASSEL, SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGY AND POLICY AT UCSF AND IS NATIONAL LEADER IN GERIATRIC BIOETHICS AND QUALITY OF CARE. JOAN.  HI. THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING AND PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR CARE PARTNERS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. MY DISCLOSE INSURES ARE THAT I'M PART OF THE E THE SCENE AND STATISTIC S CORPS OF THE IMPACT CO-LABORATORY AND I RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE NIA. NEXT SLIDE. SO I WILL BE TALKING EMOTIONAL PROCESSES THAT AFFECT THE HEALTH OF PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR CARE PARTNERS. I'LL TALK ABOUT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES THAT AFFECT EMOTION AND CARE GIVING. AND WHAT THIS MEANS FOR INTERVENTIONS AND A FEW DIRECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE. NEXT SLIDE. SO TRADITIONALLY, CAREGIVER CARE GIVING STRESS HAS BEEN STUDIED THROUGH A CARE GIVING STRESS HEALTH MODEL WHICH REALLY FOCUSES ON THE DISEASE-RELATED STRESSORS. SO FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR THAT A PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA MAY EXPERIENCE, AND THEN THIS IS THOUGHT TO LEAD TO CARE GIVING STRESSORS SUCH AS TYPE AND QUANTITY OF ASSISTANCE PROVIDED, AND THIS IS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON AS THE ACTUAL PRACTICAL HELPING BEHAVIORS OR ACTUAL TYPES OF ASSISTANCE THAT THEY ARE GIVING. AND THEN ALSO VIGILANCE DEMANDS, SO MAKING SURE THE PERSON IS SAFE, AND THIS IS OFTEN MEASURED AS TIME SPENT CARE GIVING. AND THIS IS THOUGHT TO LEAD TO CAREGIVERS PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. NEXT SLIDE. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL PROCESSES HERE? SO FIRST OF ALL, WHAT ARE EMOTION S? AND ACTUALLY THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS ON THE DEFINITION OF EMOTION. REALLY EMOTION RESEARCHERS HAVEN'T AGREED ON WHAT EMOTIONS ARE. SO THIS MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT TRICKY. BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT EMOTIONS, I THINK ABOUT THOUGHTS, FEELINGS OR BEHAVIOR, PLUS PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL OF SOME TYPE. WE CAN ALSO THINK OF IT AS DEGREES OF PLEASURE VERSUS JUST PLEASURE. IN THE CARE GIVING LITERATURE YOU DON'T REALLY SEE MANY EMOTION MEASURES USED. OFTENTIMES IT'S DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, CAREGIVER BURDEN, MAYBE SOME SELF-REPORTED EMOTION ADJECTIVES, PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICATORS LIKE BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE, BUT YOU DON'T REALLY SEE A LOT OF THE EMOTION MEASURES THAT EMOTION RESEARCHERS WOULD USUALLY USE. I JUST RECOMMEND THAT THERE'S A GREAT YALE COURSE BY GREWER CALLED EXPERTS IN EMOTION SERIES IF YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THE RESEARCH ON EMOTION MORE BROADLY. NEXT SLIDE. SO THE EXPERIENCE EXPRESSION AN PERCEPTIONS OF EMOTIONS IN CARE GIVING ARE IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER. SO YOU CAN MEASURE THE CARE RECIPIENT OR THE PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA, THEIR EXPERIENCE OF EMOTION. YOU CAN ASK THEM HOW THEY ARE FEELING, YOU CAN LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOR S, WHEN THEY EXPRESS THE EMOTION. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE EXPERIENCE IS ALWAYS GETTING TO THE EXPRESSION BECAUSE THERE COULD BE SUFFERING IN SILENCE OR INHIBITION OF EMOTION OR EXAGGERATION. THEN YOU HAVE THE CAREGIVER'S PERCEPTIONS OF EMOTION. AND THOSE COULD BE JUST INFERRING WHAT THE CARE RECIPIENT IS THINKING OR ACTUALLY WITNESSING EXPRESSION OF EMOTION FROM THAT CARE RECIPIENT. CAREGIVER HAVE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES THAT MAKE THEM MORE LIKELY TO SEE THOSE TYPES OF EMOTION EXPRESSIONS OR INFER THOSE FEELINGS ABOUT THE PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA'S EXPERIENCE. SO THINGS LIKE EMPATHY AND RELATIONSHIP CLOSENESS, INTIMACY, INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND HOW SECURE THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS WITH ATTACHMENT. THEN THESE PERCEPTIONS OF EMOTIONS ARE THOUGHT TO LEAD TO THE CAREGIVER'S RESPONSE. NEXT SLIDE. MUCH OF THE RESEARCH ON DEMENTIA CARE GIVING AND EMOTIONS REALLY FOCUSES ON NEGATIVE EMOTION. SO MUCH OF THE WORK RICHARD SCHULTZ AND I HAVE DONE IS ABOUT PERCEIVING THAT A PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA IS SUFFERING AND HOW THAT LEADS TO POOR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. ABOVE AND BEYOND SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE OR THE ACTUAL HELPING THEY ARE GIVING OF THOSE BEHAVIOR. THERE'S ALSO A LARGE LITERATURE ON THE EXPERIENCE OF GUILT IN CAREGIVERS AS A SEPARATE OUTCOME FROM BURDEN AND DEPRESSION. THERE'S A GROWING LITERATURE SHOWING HOW CAREGIVERS ARE DEPRESSED ACTUALLY THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA NOT AS LONG. SO WHEN CAREGIVERS ARE REALLY STRESSED OUT, THAT HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. NEXT SLIDE. THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT RECENTLY TO THINK ABOUT POSITIVE EMOTIONS AND HEALTH AND DEMENTIA CARE GIVING AND THIS IS ALSO A REFLECTION OF PSYCHOLOGY, POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY WHICH TOOK A WHILE TO HAPPEN AS WELL. WE HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS HAVE INDEPENDENT AFFECTS ON CAREGIVER' WELL BEING SO CAREGIVERS ARE ONLY FEELING NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE, THEY ARE FEELING BOTH BUT IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH THEY ARE FEELING EACH ONE FOR HOW IT'S ACTING PEOPLE'S HEALTH. THERE'S ALSO A MOVEMENT TO HAVE MORE POSITIVE MEASURES OF CARE GIVING, SO POSITIVE ASPECTS OF CARE GIVING IS A COMMON MEASURE THAT REALLY GETS MEANING AND PURPOSE OF LIFE IN CARE GIVING AND GRATITUDE AND THINGS THAT COME FROM CARE GIVING BEYOND JUST THE STRESSFUL ASPECTS. THEN POSITIVE EMOTION EXPRESSION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE PROTECTIVE IN BOTH PARTNERS. SO THIS IS TAKING THE VIEW THAT WE REALLY WANT TO BE LOOKING AT MORE THAN THE PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA BUT ALSO THEIR CARE PARTNERS AND POTENTIALLY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. SO SOME OF MY WORK AND OTHERS WORK HAS FOCUSED ON LOVE AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA AND CARE PARTNERS. WE ARE ALSO SEEING SOME GREAT OBSERVATIONAL CODING WORK ON -- ABOUT HOW GENUINE SMILES FROM PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CAREGIVERS THAT ARE MENTAL HEALTH. NEXT SLIDE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES WHEN WE ARE HIKING EMOTIONS AND DEMENTIA CARE GIVING. SO WE ARE FINDING THAT EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES A OF PERSONS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE ARE DIFFERENT FROM FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA. SO PEOPLE WITH FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA TEND TO HAVE DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS THAT MAYBE MORE STRESSFUL FOR CAREGIVERS TO WITNESS. SO WE ARE FINDING THAT'S SPECIALLY FOR SPOUSES OF PEOPLE WITH FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA, IT CAN BE MORE DIFFICULT TO PERCEIVE THOSE EXPRESSIONS. CAN YOU GO BACK ONE. THANKS. WE ALSO SEE WOMEN TEND TO REPORT MORE DISTRESS THAN MEN IN CAREGIVERS ACROSS DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. THEN THERE'S MIXED EVIDENCE ON THE CULTURAL AND ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN HOW CAREGIVERS RESPOND TO THE DEMANDS OF CARE GIVING. SO WE SEE THAT THERE'S GREATER FAMILY IN LATINOS AND GREATER OBLIGATION AMONG ASIANS AND MORE RELIGIOUS COPING AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS BUT UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE ARE PROTECTIVE OR NOT PROTECTIVE. SO FAMILIES AND FAMILIAL OBLIGATION ARE THE SENSE FROM THE CULTURE THAT IT'S A DUTY TO BE A CAREGIVER, REALLY IF THAT'S YOUR PARENT OR YOUR LOVED ONE, THERE'S REALLY NO OPTION BUT TO EXPRESS YOUR LOVE AND YOUR DEVOTION TO THAT PERSON. NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT THIS MEANS FOR INTERVENTIONS. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPRESSION IN CARE GIVING IN ADDITION TO THINKING ABOUT THE PRACTICAL CARE TASKS THAT CAREGIVERS HAVE OR FUNCTIONAL ABILITY OR COGNITIVE DECLINE AND YOU ANY REPRODUCIBILITY NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT IN AN ENTER PERSONAL WAY BECAUSE EMOTIONS DON'T HAPPEN IN A VACUUM. WE NEED TO INCLUDE BOTH PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR PRIMARY CARE PARTNER AND INTERVENTIONS AND POTENTIALLY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE EACH PERSON'S EMOTION IS GOING TO AFFECT THE OTHER. WE NEED TO TARGET AND TAYLOR TO THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS. NEXT SLIDE. SO ADVANCE. THANK YOU. SO THERE'S SOME EXISTING ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE PRETTY GOOD. SO MINDFULNESS BASED APPROACHES, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. NEXT. COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. THERE'S MORE EVIDENCE FOR CAREGIVERS POSITIVE EMOTION AFFECTS THAN FOR CARE RECIPIENTS. NEXT SLIDE. THERE'S ALSO PROMISING INTERVENTIONS LIKE MUSIC AN MEMORY FOR PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND POSITIVE AFFECT TRAINING FOR CARE PARTNERS WHICH POSITIVE AFFECT TRAINING REALLY COMBINES LIKE GRATITUDE, SHARING POSITIVE EMOTIONS KEEPING TRACK OF POSITIVE EVENTS. NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS OBTAIN BETTER EMOTION MEASURES FOR PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. NEED TO ADDRESS EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. WE NEED TO DEVELOP INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP PROCESSES. AND THEN ALSO I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO COLLECT INFORMATION IN A MORE PRAGMATIC WAY FROM THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN WE DO THESE INTERVENTIONS WE HAVE INFORMATION FOR MORE THAN JUST THE PERSON WITH DEMENTIA.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, DR. MONIN. TIME TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. APPRECIATE EVERYTHING. THANK YOU.  MY NAME IS JARRED BENGE, I'M PRESENTING ON TECHNOLOGICAL RESERVE IN PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FEW DISCLOSURES HERE, OUR WORK IS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF AGING, WE RECEIVE SMART PHONES FROM MICROSOFT CORPORATION FOR PREVIOUS ITERATION OF OUR WORK AND THE IDEA IS I'LL TALK TODAY ARE DEVELOPED WITH MY COLLABORATOR AT BAYLOR UNIVERSITY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE IDEA OF TECHNOLOGICAL RESERVE STEMS FROM KIND OF A HOLISTIC VIEW OF LOOKING AT THE PROCESS OF DEMENTIA. SO IN DEMENTIA YOU HAVE THESE MICROSCOPIC CHANGES IN THE BRAIN THAT LEAD TO CHANGES IN THINKING SKILLS AND THOSE CHANGES IN THINKING SKILLS LEAD TO CHANGES IN DAY TO DAY FUNCTIONING. SO WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT INTERVENING IN DEMENTIA OF COURSE YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING INTERVENTIONS TO TARGET THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE BRAIN. YOU ALSO WANT TO TARGET THE ACTUAL CHANGES IN COGNITION. BUT IN THE AREA THAT'S RECEIVED A LOT OF SUPPORT IS THINGS WE CAN DO IN THE ENVIRONMENT TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE DISEASE ON DAY TO DAY PROCESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN SERVE AS THIS VERY IMPORTANT FORM OF RESERVE, WE BUILD AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE TECHNOLOGY BUFFERS THE IMPACT OF COGNITIVE CHANGES ON REAL WORLD FUNCTIONING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT TECHNOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR PERSONS WITH LIVING WITH DEMENTIA, THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES OR GROUPINGS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS THAT MAYBE HELPFUL. THE FIRST, ONE THAT OUR GROUP FOCUSES ON IS THE IDEA THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN SERVE AS A COGNITIVE PROSTHETIC. SO EXAMPLES OF THESE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS ARE THINGS LIKE TEACHING INDIVIDUALS TO USE A REMINDER APP ON A SMART PHONE, TO HELP WITH PROSPECTIVE MEMORY LAPSES. UTILIZE GPS TO GET AROUND NAVIGATIONAL DIFFICULTIES. OR EVEN IN OTHER FORMS OF NEURODEGENERATIVE PROCESSES LIKE PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE A FASCIAS, TECHNOLOGY TO SERVE AS AUGMENTED COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES. THERE'S ALSO GROUPS WORKING TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICALLY INDEPENDENCE IN THE HOME AND COMMUNITY AS WELL AS SAFETY IN THOSE SETTINGS. GREAT EXAMPLES OF THESE ARE SMART HOME SYSTEMS, SMART HOME SYSTEMS ARE AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE AUTOMATED PROCESSES THAT HELP PROMPT TO INITIATE PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR DAY TO DAY, MONITOR FOR ERRORS, PROMPT FOR THE NEXT STEP AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ALONG THE WAY TO HELP SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE FOR ACTIVITIES LIKE IN THE KITCHEN OR MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. AS TECHNOLOGIES ADVANCE YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE SORTS OF APPLICATIONS WILL EXPAND WHERE SELF-DRIVING OR ASSISTED DRIVING CARS OR RIDE SHARING APPS MAY BECOME SOMETHING USEFUL TO GET AROUND MOBILITY LIMITATIONS IN NEURODEGENERATIVE PROCESSES. TRACKING TO HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF WANDERING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. TECHNOLOGY AS DR. MONIN TALKED ABOUT CAN BE SERVED TO HELP PROMOTE WELL BEING, SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS SO FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND CARE PARTNERS , TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AS WE ARE DOING TODAY AND HAVE OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC USING TECHNOLOGY TO BRING GROUPS TOGETHER. TECHNOLOGY CAN ALSO BE USED TO HELP PROVIDE REMINDERS FOR THESE DAILY HABITS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT LIKE EXERCISE AND MINDFULNESS WHICH ARE KNOWN TO HELP MITIGATE IMPACTS OF DEMENTIA ON DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES . SOMETIMES MIGHT NEED PROMPTS FOR THAT. ALSO TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP PROMOTE CONNECTEDNESS WITH TREATMENT TEAMS, PARTICULARLY FOR SPECIALIZED TREATMENT TEAMS THAT MAYBE FAR AWAY FROM WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE LIVING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FINALLY FOR SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITIES, TECHNOLOGY HOLDS MORE POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVING CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. SO THESE MAY BE THINGS LIKE USING SYSTEMS WITH AN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS TO DETECT MEDICATION ERRORS OR NON-COMPLIANCE, NON-REFILLS OF TREATMENTS, HELPING TO FACILITATE TRUE COMMUNICATION ACROSS PROVIDERS AS WELL AS FAMILY OR OTHER CARE PARTNERS AS WELL AS PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. THEN SYSTEMS THAT HELP SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE AND SAFETY IN THE BROADER COMMUNITY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FOR ALL THE ENORMOUS PROMISE OF TECHNOLOGY TO HELP DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DEMENTIA, IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE BASE HERE. AND THERE'S SOME AMAZING LABS, AMAZING PAPERS, EVERY DAY, EVERY MONTH NEW INFORMATION COMES OUT ON THIS DOMAIN. I HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE EXCITING PROJECTS AND EXCITING LABS HERE, THERE'S OTHERS IN THE REFERENCES PORTION OF MY SLIDE. AND EVEN MORE THAN I CAN PUT INTO A TEN MINUTE PRESENTATION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. DESPITE ALL OF THIS WORK THOUGH IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT HIGH QUALITY RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS ARE RELATIVELY LACKING IN THIS WORLD. THIS REALLY IS KIND OF AN EMERGING TOPIC SO YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE COCHRAN REVIEW IN THE AREA I LOOK AT USING ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR MEMORY SUPPORT AND AS RECENTLY AS 2017 WHEN THE COCHRAN REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED THERE WEREN'T STUDIES THAT MET RIGOROUS INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SOME OF THE MOST RIGOROUS TRIALS. TO PROMOTE THIS. SO MORE WORK CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE DONE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AS WE DEVELOP THIS FIELD, AS THIS FIELD EMERGES THOUGH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT POTENTIAL PITFALLS OR AREAS THAT TRIP UP THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS LITERATURE. SO THE FIRST IS JUST OVERALL ACCESS, PARTICULARLY FOR AGING POPULATIONS THAT ARE AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING THESE CONDITIONS. DO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A TECH ENABLED ENVIRONMENT? ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED CELLULAR SERVICE, THE INEVITABLE TECH SUPPORT OR HOW DO WE AVOID MAKING TECHNOLOGY A BURDEN DENSOME IMPACT ON CARE PARTNERS WHO ARE DOING OTHER THINGS TO HELP DAY TO DAY. WHAT IS IMPACT OF RACIAL ETHNIC SOCIO ECONOMIC DISPARITIES ON UTILIZATION OF TECHNOLOGIES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ANOTHER PITFALL HERE IS CAN WE BUILD STABLE AND USABLE PLATFORMS. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE LIFE SPAN OF TECHNOLOGIES, THERE'S AN ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO ADVANCE EVERY YEAR. CONSTANTLY MOVE FORWARD. IF YOU THINK ABOUT INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA, THEY RELY MORE ON PROCEDURAL MEMORY OVERLEARNED MEMORY SYSTEMS, RATHER THAN EPISODIC MEMORY. SO LEARNING NEW TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE WHENEVER SAY ELEMENTS OF THE APPLICATIONS CHANGE OR HOME BUTTONS GO AWAY. FINALLY YOU THINK ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE CLINICAL RESEARCHER, OFTEN TIMES IT CAN TAKE SEVERAL ROUNDS, YEAR OR MORE TO OBTAIN FUNDING. SEVERAL YEARS TO COMPLETE A STUDY AND DISSEMINATE THOSE RESULTS AND OF COURSE THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE ARE STUDYING MAY HAVE CHANGED RAPIDLY OVER THAT TIME PERIOD. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ALSO A WORD ABOUT PRIVACY RISK. TECHNOLOGY PRODUCES BIG DATA AND HAS AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GENERATING REAL TIME IN THE WORLD TYPE DATA BUT HOW DO WE DEIDENTIFY DATA SETS? HOW TO EXPLAIN DATA RISKS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT PARTICIPATE IN OUR STUDIES? HOW DO WE EXPLAIN IT TO OTHER STAKEHOLDERS LIKE IRBs? AND HOW DO WE WEIGH PROS AND CONS OF THINGS LIKE IN HOME VIDEO MONITOR ING AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS THAT HOLD POTENTIAL BUT ALSO A PRIVACY RISK. FIGURING OUT THESE QUESTIONS WILL BE CRITICAL AS THIS FIELD EVOLVES AND GOES FORWARD. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FINALLY WE'LL SAY A WORD ABOUT TECHNOLOGICAL LITERACY. I BELIEVE IN THE FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY WE ARE GOING TO SEE ENORMOUS COHORT EFFECTS AS INDIVIDUALS AGE AND MOVE TOISONS AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING THEIR NEURODEGENERATIVE CHANGES. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WITH TECHNOLOGY MIGHT PROMOTE OR INTERACT WITH NEURODEGENERATIVE STATUS TO MAKE SOME INTERVENTIONS MORE OR LESS USEFUL. ALSO IMMEDIATE TO SEE IF THIS TECHNOLOGICAL LITERACY SOMETHING WE CAN DEVELOP OR PROMOTE, PARTICULARLY AS WE MOVE TOWARD IDENTIFYING THESE CONDITIONS EARLY ON CAN WE USE THAT TIME TO BUILD IN THE HABITS AND THE ENVIRONMENTS THAT CAN HELP MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF TECHNOLOGICAL -- OR MITIGATE IMPACTS OF DEMENTIA. NEXT SLIDEs PLEASE. THE PATH FORWARD FOR THIS FIELD WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND PROMOTE AND IMPROVE THE TECH ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE TO COLLABORATE WITH PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA, CARE PARTNERS AND TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS. WE NEED TO INCLUDE APPROACHES THAT HELP US DEVELOP SECURE AND ETHICAL WAYS OF MANAGING THIS DATA AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE INDIVIDUAL FOR THE FACTORS AT THE LEVEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO HELP PICK THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. MUCH MORE REFERENCES FOR YOUR READING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.  HELLO. MY NAME IS CHRISTINE CASSEL, NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THESE ARE MY DISCLOSURES, I WOULD LIKE TO PARTICULARLY FOCUS ON THE LAST ONE. I'M A PHYSICIAN GERIATRIC, SPENT MY CAREER WORKING IN INTEFAITH TEENAGERIA TRICKS AND BIOETHICS AND NOW ALSO IN TRAN BETWEEN PRE-CAREGIVER AND CAREGIVER. WHEN DAVID REUBEN INVITED ME TO PARTICIPATE, IN THIS SUMMIT , HE DIDN'T KNOW YET THAT MY HUSBAND MIKE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH EARLY ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. THAT HAPPENED THROUGH A STUDY AT UCSF THAT WAS IN THE VERY EARLIEST STAGE OF MILD MEMORY PROBLEMS AND IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THE INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVED IN THAT NOW THREE YEARS AGO AND SINCE THEN ANNUAL REASSESSMENT THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE MORE UNDERSTANDING OF CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING AND ALSO MORE ABILITY TO THINK ABOUT IT AND PLAN FOR OUR FUTURE. SO I COME TO YOU AS BOTH PROFESSIONAL IN THIS FIELD AND ALSO SOMEONE WHO IS A CAREGIVER AND HOPEFULLY THE SUBJECT OF SOME OF THE IMPORTANT RESEARCH THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. NEXT SLIDE. SO WE KNOW NOW THAT EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS POSSIBLE AND EVEN WHAT'S CALLED PRE-CLINICAL, I WOULD CHALLENGE US THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, AS A SPOUSE OF SOMEONE WITH THIS CONDITION, EVEN HOW DEFINING PRE-CLINICAL WE TEND TO THINK OF THAT AS GENETIC DIAGNOSES AND INDEED MORE PEOPLE ARE NOW SEEKING AND GETTING THIS INFORMATION. AND WE NEED HUGE AMOUNT MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE DEAL WITH PROBABILISTIC DATA AND HOW TO UNDERSTAND BOTH COMMUNICATION ABOUT IT AND ALSO HOW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT OR MAY MISUNDERSTAND IT AND ALSO FROM WHOSE PERSPECTIVE IS IT HAVE REALLY VALUABLE. IT ALSO SETS US UP FOR BEING ABLE TO DO EARLY INTERVENTION RESEARCH. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND PARTICIPATION AND RESEARCH. ALSO WHAT COST ARE THESE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES? PARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH STUDY FUNDED BY NIA, IS A GREAT GIFT OR AT LEAST IT WAS TO US. BUT IF PEOPLE START REALLY WANTING THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE IT HELPS IMPROVE THEIR LIVES, THEN ARE WE GOING TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE, WHAT ARE THE THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON OUR LIVES? OF INFORMATION PURE AND SIMPLE INFORMATION, BECAUSE MUCH AS YOU KNOW, MUCH EARLY DIAGNOSIS DOESN'T REALLY OFFER A THERAPEUTIC OPTION. NEXT SLIDE. SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF INFORMATION, A LOT OF THE RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED HERE IS IN THE LITERATURE IS ON PATIENTS AND ON CAREGIVERS. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I WOULD URGE US TO ALSO THINK ABOUT MORE RESEARCH IF NEEDED. ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THIS INFORMATION ON CLINICIANS. CLINICIANS ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM THE ATTITUDES AND BIASES SOMETIMES IMPLICIT THAT HAVE TO DO WITH PEOPLE WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. BUT ALSO THERE'S BEEN MORE ATTENTION TO BURN OUT AND MORAL DISTRESS. AS STRESSORS ON CLINICIANS. AND SOME OF THAT COMES FROM CLINICIANS LIKE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE BEING FACED WITH SITUATIONS WHERE THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE A TOOLBOX. AND THEY REALLY HAVE INADEQUATE SKILLS. TO DEAL WITH AN INFLAMMATION. SO THEY MIGHT NOT SEEK TO EVALUATE COGNITIVE FUNCTION OR BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO IT VERY CAREFULLY. THEN COMMUNITIES. HERE IS WHERE WE REALLY HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE AGING BABY BOOMERS AND STIGMA STILL IS WITH US. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT STIGMA? NOT ENOUGH, I WOULD ARGUE, THIS IS STILL A HUGE BARRIER TO SEEKING DIAGNOSIS AND TO LIVING THE BEST WAY WE CAN, QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE PARTICULARLY EARLY STAGE OR PRE-CLINICAL STAGE. WHAT IS THE ROLE FOR ACTIVISM? WHAT WORKS IN ADDRESSING STIGMA? HOW CAN RESEARCH HELP US? I WOULD REMIND US THAT IT'S BEEN 40 YEARS SINCE BOB BUTLER WROTE WHY SURVIVE THAT LED TO FOUNDING OF NIA. WE TALKED ABOUT STIGMA OF AGEISM AS WELL AS COGNITIVE DECLINE , TO ARTHUR KLINEMAN'S SOUL OF CARE WHERE HE DESCRIBES FACING THE SAME CHALLENGES WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF HIS WIFE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO FOR ALL OF THIS,ETHICS HELPS. I PUT IT IN QUOTE HERE BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS EXTENSIVE POSSIBILITIES FOR RESEARCH IN BIOETHICS AND PARTICULARLY AT THIS CONDITION -- THAT THIS CONDITION PRESENTS US WITH. WE TEND TO THINK OF ETHICS AS PROCEDURES, RULES AND REGULATIONS. WE HAVE RULES FOR ADVANCED CARE PLANNING, LIVING WILLS, WE HAVE WILLS FOR CLINICAL DECISION MAKING INFORMED CONSENT, RULE RULES FOR PARTICIPATION AND RESEARCH. IRBs AND WE HAVE RULES FOR DISCLOSURE. WE TELL ABOUT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AT THE BEGINNING OF A PRESENTATION, WE THEN HAVE SOME BEGINNING EMERGING RESEARCH ABOUT DISCLOSURE OF ERRORS IN MEDICINE AND DIAGNOSIS. OR IN TREATMENT. BUT OF THESE AREAS ACTUALLY HAVE MORE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS THAN THEY HAVE ANSWERED AND SETTLED RULES ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH IT. SO JUST TO TAKE CLINICAL DECISION MAKING FOR EXAMPLE, THE USE OF DIGITAL INFORMATION, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING IS MORE AND MORE WIDESPREAD. AND HOW IS THAT AFFECT SHARED WHAT WE THINK OF AS SHARED DECISION MAKING? PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH, WE WILL HEAR LATER ABOUT EMBEDDED RESEARCH, OTHER KINDS OF BIG DATA AND ANTICIPATORY RESEARCH THAT DOESN'T ALLOW TRADITIONAL WAYS IN WHICH WE THINK ABOUT INDIVIDUAL DECISION MAKING. SO LET ME JUST IN CONCLUSION TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME AREAS SUCH AS JARRED JUST MENTIONED, ALL OF THE INCREDIBLY PROMISING WORK THAT DIGITAL MONITOR ING AND ROBOTS AND OTHER KINDS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES BRING WITH THEM EXTRAORDINARY ETHICAL QUESTIONS THAT LEAD RESEARCH AND LEAD PARTICIPATION. BUT ACCESS TO -- EVEN ACCESS TO THE KINDS OF TESTS MY HUSBAND AND I WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO PARTICIPATE IN, WHO GETS THAT AND HOW DO WE DECIDE WHO GETS THAT? AND WHEN YOU FACE A CRISIS LIKE COVID, WE HAVE RECENTLY FACED ENORMOUS ISSUE S OF HOW TO MANAGE ALLOCATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES. AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF DOG ANITIVE IMPAIRMENT? AND -- COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF CAREGIVER DYADS IN THOSE KINDS OF DECISIONS? P SO WE NEED PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHETHER KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THEM. I WOULD REMIND US THAT NIH CLINICAL CENTER HAS A TERRIFIC ETHICS DEPARTMENT BY CHRISTINE GRADY THAT DOES A LOT AND FUNDS A LOT OF RESEARCH IN THIS AREA I HOPE NEW DIRECTIONS TO EXPLORE WILL INCLUDE EXPERTS FROM MANY DIFFERENT CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS, FROM MANY DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES FROM RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR POINTS OF VIEW AND INTERGENERATION AL POINTS OF VIEW TO SHAPE THE RIGHT WAYS TO ASK THESE ETHICAL QUESTIONS AND TO ANSWER THE ETHICAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU TO EACH OF OUR THREE RESEARCH PRESENTERS. I'M PLEASED NOW TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR TWO PANELISTS FOR THIS SESSION. WE'LL FIRST HEAR FROM MICHAEL BELLEVILLE WHO WILL SHARE HIS PERSPECTIVE AND INSIGHT ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF THOSE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA INCLUDING EFFORTS TO REDUCE STIMULUS ASSOCIATED WITH DEMENTIA. WE'LL THEN HERE FROM VENOREEN BOATSWAIN WHO WILL RAISE AWARENESS OF DEMENTIA IN DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS HEALTH PRACTICERS. EACH PANELIST WILL SPEAK FOR FIVE MINUTES.  MY NAME IS MIKE BELLEVILLE, HONORED TO BE HERE. I GUESS I'M -- I DON'T HAVE A SLIDE SHOW A SO YOU ARE STUCK WITH ME. HERE I AM. THE THINGS I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY WHEN TALKING TECHNOLOGY DEMENTIA, EVERYTHING THAT JARRED TALKED ABOUT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN THE RESEARCH AND THINGS GOING TO GO INTO FINDING DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA LIVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. MICHAEL IN THAT AREA -- MY GOAL IN THAT AREA IS TO TRY TO HELP AND I'M WORKING WITH A COUPLE OF COMPANIES ON DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES IS TO BE USED WITH SMART HOME TECHNOLOGIES, TO KEEP PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOME LONGER. BUT THE THING I WOULD LOVE PEOPLE TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT OR WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD TECHNOLOGY, TECHNOLOGY IS NOT JUST WEARING AN APPLE WATCH WHICH I DO BECAUSE I HAVE BALANCE ISSUES. TECHNOLOGY SHOULD ALSO BE THOUGHT OF IN WAYS OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEMENTIA ESPECIALLY DURING THESE COVID TIMES TO HAVE A BETTER AGAIN QUALITY OF LIFE. THAT'S REACHING OUT TO THEM FOR SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO. SO I WAS ON A GREAT CALL YESTERDAY WITH SOME VERY SMART INDIVIDUALS AND WE WERE TRYING TO COME UP WITH WAYS WHAT CAN WE DO TO ENGAGE PEOPLE WITH LIVING WITH DEMENTIA TO CONTINUE TO STAY ENGAGED THAT'S KEY THING IS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT. I LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE THE NUMBER ONE PRESCRIPTION DOCTOR SHOULD BE GIVING PERSON WITH DEMENTIA IS NOT A PILL, IT'S SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT. I HONESTLY BELIEVE I'M STILL DOING WELL WITH MY DIAGNOSIS THAT JUST BECAME SEVEN YEARS A FEW WEEKS AGO. THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE I'M STAYING SOCIALLY ENGAGED. I VOLUNTEER AT MY LOCAL SENIOR CENTER SENT HELPING SENIOR POPULATION WITH TECHNOLOGY ISSUES. TRY TO BREAK DOWN THE STIGMA WHAT PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT WHEN THEY HEAR ALZHEIMER'S OR RELATED DEMENTIA. ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE STRUGGLING AT TIMES TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW YOU CAN STILL LEARN SOMETHING NEW AFTER A DIAGNOSIS. I LEARNED TO DO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS. IS THAT MIGHT SURPRISE A FEW PEOPLE. IF I DO ANYTHING BUT DRIVE THE POINT HOME, TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE A PARTNER WITH ANY TYPE OF MEDICATION THAT IS GOING TO BE HOPEFULLY FOUND TO HELP AN INDIVIDUAL LIVE A BETTER LIFE. I LOVE THAT ALL THREE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS ALL TOUCHED ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS. ONE OF THEM WAS ABOUT HOW IT'S NOT JUST CAREGIVER AND THE PERSON LIVING WITH THE DISEASE. IT INVOLVES THE WHOLE FAMILY. DEMENTIA INVOLVES THE WHOLE FAMILY. SO INCLUDE THE WHOLE FAMILY. THE OTHER THING I WILL STRESS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EX PERTS WITH -- IN THE DEMENTIA AREA , DON'T TAKE THIS WRONG WAY BUT I HONESTLY BELIEVE THE EXPERTS ARE THE PEOPLE LIVING WITH THE DISEASE. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW REALLY WHAT IT'S LIKE OR HOW IT'S GOING, TALK TO US. WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS. WE WANT A VOICE AT THE TABLE. AND THANK YOU NIA FOR INCLUDING ALL MY PREVIOUS FRIENDS WHO SPOKE EARLIER AND MYSELF BEING INCLUDED IN THIS PROCESS. THIS IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO HELP REDUCE THE STIGMA THAT PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA ARE AUTOMATICALLY THOUGHT OF AS A LOT OF PROGRESSIONS OF THE DISEASE. NOTHING CAN BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. YOU CAN STILL LIVE A MEANINGFUL PURPOSEFUL LIFE, YOU CAN CREDIBILITY TO SOCIETY, BE PART OF SOMETHING. I'M HONORED TO HELP DO THAT IN WHATEVER WAY I CAN IN THE THINGS THAT I LOVE DOING AND ONE IS TECHNOLOGY. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.  HELLO. . MY NAME IS VENOREEN BROWNE-BOATSWAIN. MY JOURNEY WITH DEMENTIA STARTED OVER 12 YEARS AGO WHEN I SERVICE SERVE AS CARETAKER OF MY HUSBAND FOR 37 YEARS, FREDERICK BOATSWAIN WHOSE CHARITY ENDED ON OCTOBER 15, 2018 WHEN HE SUCCUMBED TO THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. THIS EXPERIENCE AS CARETAKING OPENED MY EYES TO THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THIS DISEASE AND ITS IMPACT ON PEOPLE OF COLOR. MANY LIVES OF CARETAKERS OF DEMENTIA PATIENTS ARE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. MY JOURNEY INVOLVE NOT ONLY NAVIGATING RESOURCES BUT ALSO CONSTANTLY EXPERIENCING THAT MANY OF THE RESOURCES WERE NOT DESIGNED FOR MY HUSBAND'S EXPERIENCE AS A BLACK MAN. I MADE A COMMITMENT AFTER MY HUSBAND'S PASSING THAT I WILL FOCUS ON MAKING THE IMPACT OF DEMENTIA KNOWN IN MY COMMUNITY AS WELL AS HOLDING ORGANIZATIONS ACCOUNTABLE IN PROVIDING INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE SERVICES. MANY THINGS THEY ARE DOING SO BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE MOST HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. TWO YEARS AGO I ATTENDED THIS CONFERENCE AND ONE TOPIC RESONATED WITH ALL THE PRESENTERS FOR ME. WE NEED TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR MORE IN OUR RESEARCH TRIALS. WHILE TODAY I HEAR QUESTIONS BEING RAISED IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, I AM WONDERING IF WE CAN GO PAST THE QUESTIONS BY GETTING RESULTS TO THE QUESTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE , IN THE PRESENTATION OF POSITIVE EMOTION, MUSIC HAVE BOTH A POSITIVE IMPACT ON PEOPLE LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND THEIR CARETAKERS. THIS IS A PROVEN PROMISING INTERVENTION. MY QUESTION HOWEVER IS HOW ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR BROUGHT INTO THIS ENGAGEMENT? MY HUSBAND LOVED MUSIC AND ENGAGED IN MUSIC RIGHT UP TO HIS DEATH. HOWEVER, THE TYPE OF MUSIC BEING PLAYED IN MANY OF THE SETTINGS HE WAS IN, WERE NOT GOSPEL , JAZZ OR CALIPSO MORE FAMILIAR TO HIM. MY EXPERIENCE IS MY HUSBAND'S LIVED EXPERIENCE DIDN'T MATTER IN SOME OF THESE FACILITIES AND THE MUSIC WAS NOT COMFORTING TO ME. YES, MUSIC IS GOOD. BUT HOW DOES THIS MUSIC HELP A PERSON BUILD A SENSE OF SOCIAL CAPITAL IF THE MUSIC IS NOT SOMETHING THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH? I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. YOU MAY SAY WELL, MAYBE I CAN DO THE RESEARCH TO FIND THE ANSWER. WELL, MAYBE ONE DAY I WILL. MY POINT IS WHEN INDIVIDUALS OF COLOR ARE NOT ENGAGED WE STATE THE FINDINGS IS GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE TESTED SO IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYONE. WE CAN AGREE STUDIES NEED TO ENGAGE THOSE HARDEST HIT BY DEMENTIA. WE CAN AGREE PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN THESE STUDIES PROVIDING A GAP IN KNOWLEDGE. WE CAN ALSO AGREE A A STRONGER MORE TRUSTING TRANSPARENT RELATIONSHIP NEEDS TO BE BUILT WITH COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS FOR PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH. SO HOW DO WE REACH PEOPLE? WE REACH THEM BY MEETING THEM WHERE THEY ARE. PLEASE DON'T WAIT UNTIL YOU NEED THE RESEARCH DONE TO REACH OUT. THE INNOVATIVE IN YOUR RECRUITMENT AND IT ALWAYS HELP TO CHECK YOUR STAFF BY ASKING THE STAFF REFLECT COMMUNITY YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE IF THEY ARE, DON'T ASSUME THEY ARE CULTURE SENSITIVE. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS SIMPLE AND SOME RESEARCHERS ARE ALREADY DOING THIS. JUST A REMINDER , THAT BUILDING A TRUSTING ENGAGING COMMUNITY IS HARD WORK. IT IS MY HOPE THAT TWO YEARS FROM NOW WHEN THE SUMMIT IS HELD AGAIN, WE WILL FIND WAYS TO CONNECT BUILDING AND TRUSTING AND ENGAGING WITH COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SO THE RESEARCH WILL HOPEFULLY LESSEN THE CURRENT DISPARITIES.  GREAT. THANKS TO EACH OF OUR PANELISTS AND OUR PRESENTERS. WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN POSTED THROUGH THE Q&A FUNCTION. AND SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS TO DR. BENGE, HOW DO WE BALANCE THE PROMISE OF USING TECHNOLOGY TO PROMOTE INDEPENDENCE AND SAFETY WITH PRIVACY CONCERNS?  IT'S A WONDERFUL QUESTION. AND I WILL NOT SIT HERE AND SAY I HAVE THE ANSWER. I DO THINK THOUGH THAT THERE ARE A FEW WAYS TO START ADDRESSING THAT QUESTION. SO FIRST OF ALL IS WORKING -- AS RESEARCHERS WORKING WITH TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS AND PRIVACY EXPERTS TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATION S OURSELVES OF THE DATA WE ARE CHECKING AND THE POTENTIAL FOR BREACHES THERE. I THINK -- SO IN OTHER WORDS CLINICAL RESEARCH ERS WE DON'T -- WE'RE SENSITIVE TO THINGS LIKE PATIENT IDENTIFIER AND THE HIPAA 18 BUT ALL THE ADDITIONAL DATA THAT COMES WITH TECHNOLOGY IS SOMETHING WE ARE NOT AS WELL VERSED. SO WE AS RESEARCHERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM BETTER FIRST. I THINK THE SECOND STEP IS GOING TO BE LEARNING THE BEST WAYS TO CONVEY THAT SORT OF INFORMATION. ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM ITSELF, BEING ABLE TO CONVEY IT TO INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AS WELL AS THEIR CARE PARTNERS TO HELP THEM MAKE AN INFORMED CONSENT ABOUT WHAT SORT OF DATA THEY WANT TO DISCLOSE. MY HOPE IS WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE SYSTEMS WHERE INDIVIDUALS COULD SHARE ASPECTS OF DATA THEY ARE MOST COMFORTABLE WITH BUT BE ABLE TO REMOVE DATA THEY MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH. THIS WAY MAYBE BE ABLE TO MORE PRECISE LY HONE THE INFORMATION GATHERED AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE IT'S USED. IT IS NOT JUST DYNAMIC BETWEEN RESEARCHER AND THE INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANTSES IN THE STUDY, IT'S ALSO BEING ABLE TO CONVEY THAT TO EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT. SO LIKE IRBs AND DATA SAFETY COMMITTEES AS WELL SO THAT WE HAVE EXTERNAL INDIVIDUALS LOOKING AT OUR APPROACHES AND STRATEGIES TO ENSURE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PROTECT AND BE SENSITIVE TO THAT DATA.  I HAVE A QUESTION DIRECTED TO DR. CASSEL. THIS RELATES TO THE IMPLICATION S FOR PERSONS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED OR IDENTIFIED WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO BEFORE THEY HAVE SYMPTOMS, EITHER THROUGH GENETIC TESTING, OR AS WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT, SOON THERE WILL BE BLOOD TESTS. WHAT HAPPEN ARE IMPLICATIONS ON THESE POPULATION S?  I THINK THERE ARE MANY IMPLICATIONS. ONE IS THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL REALLY WANT TO HAVE MORE OF THESE TESTS. AND WE ARE SEEING THAT ALREADY WITH THE COMMERCIAL GENETIC TESTING BUT NOT EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION. AND THEY MAY GO TO THEIR DOCTOR AND SAY, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? IT HAS HUGE IMPLICATIONS HOW WE TRAIN, THAT'S WHY I MENTION THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND GIVING PEOPLE THE TOOLS SO THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. FOR PATIENTS. I THINK THE OTHER THING IS HOW WE DEAL WITH UNCERTAINTY. AS YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE TESTS ARE PROBABILISTIC AND ALSO UNFOLD AS WE HEARD FROM MICHAEL, THEY UNFOLD OVER MANY YEARS AHEAD. SO WANTING TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT MIS INFORMATION OR MISASSUMPTIONS PARTICULARLY IN THE BACKGROUND OF COMMUNITIES OF STIGMA, THAT MAY HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PEOPLE IF THEY GET THE TESTS DONE OR THEN DECIDE NOT TO DISCLOSE IT. REMEMBER, WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF FAKE NEWS NOW AND ALL KINDS OF MISINFORMATION BECOMES VERY WIDESPREAD, VERY EASILY SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE HAVE NEW KINDS OF DIAGNOSTIC MARKERS, THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SHARE THE INFORMATION IN WAYS THAT ARE POSITIVE AND NOTARIES SKI. NOT RISKY,  THE NEXT QUESTION IS FOR DR. MONIN, A QUESTION WHETHER EMOTIONS TEND TO BE GROUPED INTO MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND POSSIBILITIES FOR BETTER DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN TWO.  ACTUALLY EMOTION AS AN OUTCOME IS OFTEN SEPARATED FROM MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. SO USUALLY PEOPLE FOCUS ON CLINICAL MEASURES. SUCH AS DEPRESSION OR CAREGIVER BURDEN OR ANXIETY OR THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT A LOT OF POSITIVE EXPERIENCES FOR INSTANCE ARE MIXED OR COMPLEX EMOTIONS OR CULTURAL TYPES OF EMOTIONS ARE MIXED IN THE A LOT OF THOSE MEASURES. SO IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO SEE HOW THOSE EMOTION MEASURES MAP ON TO THE CLINICAL MEASURES, THAT CLINICS ARE USED TO. TO SEE WHAT THOSE CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE. BUT ALSO TOLL MOVE BEYOND THAT TO MORE A POSITIVE QUALITY OF LIFE WAY OF LOOKING AT MEASURES.  WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION HERE ON STIGMA. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT RESEARCH ON STIGMA? WHAT HAS BEEN FOUND, WHAT AREAS STILL NEED TO BE DISCOVERED?  I CAN BEGIN THAT. I RAISED IN MY COMMENTS THAT EVERYONE ELSE USED THE WORD IN THEIR PRESENTATION, WE ASSUME THAT THESE THINGS GO HAND IN HAND. AND THE REASON I RAISE THE ROBERT BUTLER EXAMPLE IS THAT WHEN BUTLER FOUNDED NIA WE CALLED IT SENILITY AND THERE WAS A THINKING AT THE TIME, THERE WAS GREAT -- PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT -- THEY KEPT PEOPLE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLDS, THEY DIDN'T TELL THEIR EVEN NEIGHBORS WHAT WAS GOING ON. BECAUSE THERE WAS GREAT STIGMA ABOUT SENILITY. BUTLER THOUGHT IF WE GIVE THIS -- IF WE UNDERSTAND WE DO MORE RESEARCH, WE UNDERSTAND THE BRAIN DISEASE OR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF DISEASES AND MAKE IT A MEDICAL CONDITION, THEN IT WON'T HAVE THE STIGMA. I THINK UNFORTUNATELY IT WASN'T THAT SIMPLE. THAT THE -- EVEN THOUGH WE DO UNDERSTAND THIS AS MEDICAL CONDITION NOW, THERE'S STILL ARE SOCIAL INHIBITIONS HOW TO CONTINUE TO INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES. WE JUST HEARD HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO STAY ACTIVE, TO STAY ENGAGED. SOME COMMUNITIES WILL WELCOME THAT BUT LOTS ARE STILL UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT. SO I'M ARGUING THAT THIS SHOULD BE CLOSE TO THE TOP OF OUR LIST. SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AS WELL AS OTHERS, EVEN POLITICAL SCIENCE, TO LOOK AT HOW DO COMMUNITIES CHANGE THEIR POINTS OF VIEW ABOUT CONDITIONS LIKE THIS? AND THEN WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT KINDS OF -- IS IT EDUCATION, ACTIVISM, WHAT IS IT? THAT COULD HELP REDUCE STIGMA.  THE NEXT QUESTION, THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS BUT FOR -- ONE IS MOVING ON THE QUESTION ABOUT CULTURALLY SENSITIVE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS EMOTIONS. AND THERE WAS ALSO A QUESTION FROM -- ASKING ABOUT HOW TO ENCOURAGE AFRICAN AMERICANS IN RESEARCH, THAT THIS PERSON HAS SAID THEY FOUND THIS VERY CHALLENGING IN THEIR WORK.  I THINK OFTEN THAT WHAT MY EXPERIENCE HAVE BEEN, THAT RESEARCH IS INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE INVITED INTO RESEARCH RIGHT WHEN RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE. THERE IS NO TRUST WITHIN THAT AREA BECAUSE YOU ARE BEING INVITED IN WITH A GROUP YOU PROBABLY DO NOT KNOW. WE NEED TO BEGIN TO ENGAGE WITH INDIVIDUALS VERY EARLY, BEING IN IMMUNITIES, LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES MEETING PEOPLE MANY COMMUNITIES, HAVING RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIVIDUALS IN COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE A SUPPORT GROUP AND THE SUPPORT GROUP DOES HAVE SOME DISTRUST ABOUT THE MEDICAL FIELD AND RESEARCH. SO WHAT DID I DO? INVITED SOMEONE TO DO A LOT OF RESEARCH TO COME SPEAK TO THE INDIVIDUALS ABILITY THAT RESEARCH THEY ARE DOING, HOW THEY GO ABOUT INVITING INDIVIDUALS WITH RESEARCH AND BEGINNING THAT TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIVIDUAL, THAT PERSON. SO IF THAT PERSON COMES BACK INDIVIDUALS KNOW THEM. THEY ALREADY ARE TRUSTING THEM, THEY HAVE ALREADY BUILT A RELATIONSHIP SO WHEN THE PERSON REACH YOU WANT AND SAY I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE IN MY RESEARCH THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT RESEARCH IS ABOUT. THEY ALREADY HAVE A TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AND HIS GROUP SO THEY KNOW AND THEY WILL BEGIN TO BE MORE ENGAGED WITH IT. BUT I THINK OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE, WE MAY HAVE ONE PERSON WE KNOW AND THEN WE WANT TO JUST ENGAGE INDIVIDUALS.  I'LL BRING UP A FINAL QUESTION RAISED FROM THE AUDIENCE. THIS HAS TO DO WITH IN THE SETTING OF COVID-19 . BUT IT'S APPLICABLE BEYOND COVID-19. WE ARE IN A SITUATION NOW WHERE MANY OF THE PLACES WHERE PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA SOCIALLY CONNECT SENIOR CENTERS, ADULT DAY HEALTH PROGRAMS, THESE ARE NOT AVAILABLE. SO WHAT IS THE BACKUP? WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE IN A SITUATION WHERE THESE IN PERSON EVENTS AND CONVENINGS NOT POSSIBLE?  -- HAS THE ANSWER. GO AHEAD JARRED.  I'D LOVE TO HEAR MIKE'S THOUGHTS ON THIS AS WELL SINCE HE'S LIVING WITH THIS. I WILL SAY I HAVE BEEN SO PROUD OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES HERE. FOR EXAMPLE, I GO AND SPEAK AT OUR LOCAL PARKINSON SUPPORT GROUPS. THEY HAVE GONE ALL VIRTUAL. AND IT IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR -- TO DO SEMINARS LIKE THIS WITH OUR LOCAL SUPPORT GROUPS, SEE THE LOCAL INDIVIDUALS, BECAUSE OF THE GIFT OF VIDEO CONFERENCING AND PEOPLE GOING AND DROPPING OFF STAIR DEVICES TO PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE THEM, THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS. IT IS NOT PERFECT. BUT THERE'S POTENTIAL HERE BUT WITH ALL THE SAME PROBLEMS OF ANY OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL INTERVENTION. SO TECHNOLOGY, I THINK THAT'S MY JOB, BUT MIKE I WAS CURIOUS WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN.  WHEN THIS FIRST STARTED PEOPLE ASKED HOW ARE YOU DOING? AND I WAS LIKE IN THE BEGINNING, NO OFFENSE BUT I WAS LIKE WELCOME TO MY WORLD. THE WAY PEOPLE ARE LIVING NOW IS THE WAY MOST PEOPLE SADLY ARE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. SOME OF THEM SECLUDED. DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A LOT OF THINGS. STUCK INDOORS, CAN'T GET OUT. AND I LIKE TO JOKE AND TELL PEOPLE WE WERE ZOOMING WHEN ZOOMING WASN'T COOL. DOING THIS FOR YEARS. WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SUPPORT GROUPS. BUT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, I'LL PUT A LITTLE PLUG FOR AN ORGANIZATION I'M ABOUT. THE INTERACTION ALLIANCE, WE WERE ON A CALL YET, WAS TO TACKLE THIS EXACT PROBLEM. THIS EXACT ISSUE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH HOPEFULLY SENIOR CENTERS WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. WITH PEOPLE WHO ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY DONE IT LOCALLY AND WE CAN TRY TO EXPAND IT OUT MORE REGIONALLY AND HOPEFULLY NATIONALLY TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE. BUT I MEAN, YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD, JARRED, WHEN YOU SAY IF YOU CAN GET TECHNOLOGY IN IF FRONT OF PEOPLE, AND THERE'S PROGRAMS OUT THERE WHERE PEOPLE CAN DONATE THEIR OLD CELL PHONES OR THEIR OLE iPADS BECAUSE ITs A CELL PHONE DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ITS AS A CELL PHONE, IT CAN CONNECT TO WIFI AND USE IT IN THAT WAY. THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS OUT THERE WHERE YOU CAN GO ABOUT TO DO THAT. SO THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT IS THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR THE LAST SINCE I HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH THESE FOLKS FOR THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS. THAT'S USUALLY TECHNOLOGY, JUST LIKE THIS. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THAT QUESTION.  THANKS. THANK YOU TO THE PRESENTERS AND OUR PANEL iS FOR GETTING US OFF TO A GREAT START FOR THE FIRST PANEL OF OUR THIRD MEETING. IT'S NOW TIME FOR A TEN MINUTE BREAK. AND I BELIEVE WE WILL BE ASKED TO BE BACK AT IS IT 2:40. ONCE WE TRANSITION TO THE BREAK, THE TIME BACK WILL BE POSTED ON THE SLIDE AND WILL BE COMING BACK TO HEAR FROM CO- CHAIRS.  IT'S NOW 2:40. I'M PLEASED TO WELCOME THE AUDIENCE BACK TO OUR SECOND PANEL OF THE NATIONAL RESEARCH SUMMIT ON DEMENTIA CARE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. I'M PLEASED TO TURN OVER THE MIC TO THE THEME CO-CHAIRS MICHAEL MONSON AND MALAZ BOUSTANI.  THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO ORGANIZE THE NEXT HOUR. I WANT TO INTRODUCE THE THEME AND ALSO INTRODUCE OUR PART -- MY PARTNER IN CRIME, MR. MICHAEL MONSON AND WHO IS THE SENIOR VP OF -- IN ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS AND HAVE AMAZING EXPERIENCE IN IMPLEMENTING A MODEL OF CARE IN THE REAL WORLD. WHAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM US IN THE PANEL RESPECTIVE ON THE SCIENCE -- PERSPECTIVE ON THE SCIENCE OF DEVELOPING AT THIS DISCOVERING SCALABLE SOLUTION, THE SCIENCE OF IMPLEMENTING SUCH SOLUTION AND THE SCIENCE OF YOUR -- DIFFUSING SUCH SOLUTION. LET ME INTRODUCE THE THREE AMAZING PANEL ISTS FOR YOU. I'LL START WITH DR. UNUTZER, WHO IS CHAIR OF THE PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AND DIRECTOR OF INSTITUTE FOR BRAIN HEALTH SOLUTION AT UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON. HE WILL BE FOLLOWED BY DR. LUCY LEYKUM FROM SOUTH TEXAS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND DALE MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AUSTIN, THEY WILL END WITH DR. ELIZABETH MCGLYNN WHO IS VICE PRESIDENT AND KEISER PERMANENTE RESEARCH AND INTERIM SENIOR ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR RESEARCH AT KEISER PERMANENTE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. SO PLEASE WELCOME, I'LL HAND IT OVER TO DR. UNUTZER.  GOOD AFTERNOON, THANK YOU FOR THE NICE INTRODUCTION. I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T SAID TOO MUCH ABOUT, THAT IS NOT DEMENTIA BUT DEPRESSION. AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE DEVELOP AND THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT AN EVIDENCE BASED MODEL OF CARE IN PRACTICE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. LITTLE D DISCLOSURE. DAY JOB I CHAIR THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, I DO WANT GRANT AND CONTRACT WORK INTEGRATING PRIMARY CARE AND MENTAL CARE SERVICES, I DON'T DO PAID WORK FOR PHARMACEUTICAL OR DEVICE MANUFACTURERS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO DEPRESSION IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM IN OLDER ADULTS. ABOUT FIVE TO TEN% OF PEOPLE SITTING IN A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WAITING ROOM ANY GIVEN DAY HAVE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSEABLE SIGNIFICANT DEPRESSION. THIS TURNS NOW OUT TO BE THE SINGLE LARGEST DRIVER OF HEALTH RELATED DISABILITY IN THE WORLD. AND IT'S NOT JUST FEELING DOWN, HAVING A BAD DAY, THIS IS A TRULY MISERABLE STATE THAT CAN LAST FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS, IT'S PARTICULARLY CHRONIC IN OLDER ADULT ADULTS, NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. HOW GOOD IS CURRENT DEPRESSION CARE? I'M A GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRIST AND I WOULD SAY THAT FEWER THAN TWO OUT OF TEN OLDER ADULTS WHO LIVE WITH A SERIOUS CLINICAL DEPRESSION WILL EVER SEE A PSYCHIATRIST PSYCHOLOGIST OR ANY OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDER WHO HAS SPECIFIC TRAINING TO TREAT SOMETHING LIKE DEPRESSION IN AN OLDER PERSON. WELL OVER HALF, AT LEAST HALF OF ALL OLDER ADULTS WHO HAVE DEPRESSION DO RECEIVE SOME TREATMENT FOR THEIR CONDITION IN PRIMARY CARE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS IN PRIMARY CARE FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH DEPRESSION, I'M A GLASS IS HALF FULL PERSON, THAT'S A LOT OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ARE SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE OLDER PATIENTS COULD HAVE DEPRESSION BUT THEY HAVE LIMITED TIME AND MEANS TO DEAL WITH THAT. THERE WAS A WONDERFUL STUDY NOW A LITTLE OVER A DECADE AGO IN JAGS THAT SAID THE AVERAGE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER TRIES TO HELP AN OLDER PERSON WITH DEPRESSION, THEY HAVE ABOUT TWO MINUTES TO DEVOTE TO THAT. I'M A VERY GOOD CLINICIAN. BUT I COULDN'T FIX -- DIAGNOSE OR FIX DEPRESSION IN A TWO MINUTE MENTAL HEALTH VISIT. ONE THING WE DO IN THIS COUNTRY IS LIKE TO GIVE PEOPLE PILLS SO THERE'S ABOUT FOR OUR FIVE MILLION OLDER ADULTS WHO WALK OUT OF DOCTOR'S OFFICE WITH A PRESCRIPTION FOR ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION EVERY YEAR. BUT IF YOU FOLLOW THAT -- THOSE FOUR OR FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ONLY ONE IN FIVE WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, VERY FEW WILL GET OTHER KINDS OF AFFECTIVE TREATMENTS SUCH AS COUNSELING OR PSYCHOTHERAPY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OUR PRIMARY CARE COLLEAGUES KNOW THIS, THIS IS FROM A SURVEY, TWO-THIRDS OF ALL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AROUND THE COUNTRY, 60 U.S. COMMUNITIES ASKED ABOUT ACCESS TO CONSULTATION FOR THEIR PATIENTS SAID OUR ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OUR PATIENTS IS TERRIBLE . NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS? HOW DO WE GET MORE OLDER ADULTS WITH DEPRESSION EFFECTIVE TREATMENT? NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO TWO DECADES AGO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUE AND I SET OUT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AND WE DEVELOPED A PRIMARY CARE BASED APPROACH TO TREATING DEPRESSION, CAREGIVER CALLED A COLLABORATIVE CARE OR IMPACT MODEL THAT IS NOW STRONGLY EVIDENCE BASED AND THE CONTENT IS SIMPLE. WE SAY WE START WITH A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AND A PATIENT. AND WE SUPPLEMENT, WE AUGMENT THAT TEAM IN PRIMARY CARE WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CARE MANAGER AND A PSYCHIATRIST WHO CAN CONSULT TO THAT TEAM IF HAVING A PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING PROBLEM. SO WE ALSO PUT IN SOME SPECIFIC PROCESSES OF CARE SO EVERY TIME A PATIENT COMES IN THEY GET THEIR DEPRESSION MEASURE WITH TOOL CALLED Ph.D. 9 LIKE YOU MEASURE SOMEONE'S BLOOD PRESSURE IF TREATING HYPERTENSION. WE TEACH THE STAFF IN THE CLINIC SOME VERY BRIEF EFFECTIVE BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES FOR TREATING A PERSON WITH DEPRESSION. WE TRACK ALL PATIENTS IN A REGISTRY SO PEOPLE DON'T FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND WE HAVE ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIST WHO CAN SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW AND MAKE SUGGESTIONS ON EVERY PATIENT SEEN IN PRIMARY CARE WHO IS NOT IMPROVING. THAT'S THE MODEL. MENTION SLIDE. HOW WELL DOES THIS WORK? THIS IS OUR MAIN STUDY FINDINGS SO WE TESTED THIS, WITH 2000 PATIENTS IN EIGHT HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS IN FIVE STATES IN A LARGE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS KIND OF ORGANIZED COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTION MORE THAN DOUBLES LIKELIHOOD THAT PEOPLE DEPRESSION WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED 12 MONTHS LATER. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. CHRIS CALLAHAN COLLEAGUE WHO WAS ON THE TEAM ALSO PUBLISHED THAT NOT ONLY DID PEOPLE'S DEPRESSION GET BETTER WE SAW IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING. SO DOING RIGHT BY DEPRESSION ISN'T JUST GOOD FOR YOUR EMOTIONS AND YOUR MOOD, IT ALSO HELPS YOUR PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING. NEXT SLIDE. SO THAT'S ALL GREAT, THE FINAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT WE PRODUCED AS PART OF THE RESEARCH WAS THE FACT THAT WHEN WE LOOK SEVERAL YEARS OUT AT TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING, FOR THIS GROUP OF 2000 OLDER ADULTS, ALSO SOME WERE ON MEDICARE, WE FOUND PEOPLE WHO HAD GOTTEN THIS COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTION FOR DEPRESSION NOT ONLY HAD BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES, WE SAW SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TOTAL HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPENT ON THIS INTERVENTION WE SAW ABOUT SIX AND A HALF DOLLARS IN HEALTHCARE COST SAVINGS. SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THIS WAS KIND OF LIKE A HOME RUN FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF A RESEARCHER, SO WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW WE CAME UP WITH A BETTER WAY OF TREATING DEPRESSION IN OLDER ADULTS THAT FIT INTO TYPICAL PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS AND DID NOT ONLY INCLUDE HEALTH TO REDUCES HEALTHCARE COSTS, THIS WAS QUADRUPLE AIM OF HEALTHCARE REFORM THOUGH I DON'T THINK DONALD HAS SPOKEN THAT FERVENT WHEN DOING THIS RESEARCH. NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS GREAT. WE HAVE A STRONGLY EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION, IT WORKS, IT WORKED IN A LOT OF SETTINGS. I WORKED FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS HE WOULDERS, IT WORKED FOR LATINOS, WHITES, WE WERE QUITE PLEASED WITH THIS AND THEN WE EMBARKED ON A 15 YEAR JOURNEY TO TRY TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS IMPLEMENT THIS. SO I'LL CONCLUDE WITH A FEW COMMENTS ON THAT EXPERIENCE. WE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM CALLED THE AIM CENTER THAT IS NOT DOING MORE RESEARCH BUT ITS PRIMARY MISSION IS TO HELP DISSEMINATE THIS EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION AND WE HAVE TO DAY TRAINED A LITTLE OVER 5,000 CLINICIANS AND NOW WELL OVER A THOUSAND PRIMARY CARE CLINIC AROUND THE COUNTRY IN IMPLEMENTING THIS INTERVENTION. WE HAVE WRITTEN SOME MANUALS, WE HAVE PRODUCED A LOT OF VIDEO, A WHOLE BUNCH OF MATERIALS THAT HELP ORGANIZATIONS WHO REALLY ARE MOTIVATED BY THE EVIDENCE TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT THIS. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS HAS BEEN WHAT'S ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE. YOU HAD TO FIND A WAY FOR MEDICARE AND OTHER PAYERS TO PAY FOR THIS BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T GET PAY FOR IT NOBODY IS GOING TO DO IT. SO WE SPENT A LOT OF EFFORT AND TIME WORKING WITH AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION AND CMS AND DEVELOPED A BUNCH OF CPT BILLING CODES PRIMARY PRACTICES CAN USE TO CHARGE FOR DELIVERING AN EVIDENCE BASED COURSE OF CARE CALLED COLLABORATIVE CARE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE ALSO REALIZED THIS IS NEW TYPE OF WORK. THIS IS A TEAM WORK, A TEAM APPROACH THAT MOST PSYCHIATRISTS ARE NOT TRAINED TO DO SO. WE HAD A FOUR YEAR PROJECT WITH FUNDED BY CMS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION WHERE WE TRAINED OVER 3,000 PSYCHIATRISTS IN EVERY STATE OF THE COUNTRY. IN PROVIDING THE KIND OF PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION THAT IS REALLY EFFECTIVE IN PROJECT LIKE THIS. IN AN EFFORT LIKE THIS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE SET UP IN OUR STATE IN WASHINGTON A SYSTEM WHERE WE IMPLEMENTED THIS KIND OF PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A MANAGED MEDICAID PLAN WHERE WE WENT INTO OVER A HUNDRED PRIMARY CARE CLINICS AND SAID LET US HELP YOU TRACK USING THIS EVIDENCE BASED MODEL WHAT IS NOW A LITTLE OVER 50,000 PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION AND WE HAVE PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION PROVIDED INTO ALL THESE CLINIC, TRACKING ALL THESE PATIENTS ON A PIECE OF REGISTRY SOFTWARE AND SHOWING THAT WE CAN REALLY IMPROVE OUTCOMES NOT JUST IN RESEARCH. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN TEN YEARS WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A LOT OF CLINIC. THIS IS A SLIDE ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED, THE AVERAGE RESPONSE RATES IN ABOUT 130 CLINIC THAT IMPLEMENTED THIS MODEL OF CARE, AND WHAT WE SEE IS ON AVERAGE WE GET OUTCOMES THAT ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL RESEARCH, NOT QUITE AS GOOD BUT NOT TOO BAD. BUT THERE IS A HUGE DISTRIBUTION ACROSS THESE 130 CLINICS WE WORK WITHIN HOW WELL THIS IS WORKING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHAT WE FIND IS THAT CLINIC FOR OUR TEAM HAS GIVEN A SUBSTANTIAL IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT ACTUALLY DO MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE WHO JUST TOOK THE EVIDENCE AND SAID WE'LL DO THIS ON OUR OWN. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT WHEN YOU PAY FOR PERFORMANCE THIS IS A SLIDE BASED ON STUDY WITH OVER 6,000 PATIENTS YOU CAN DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROGRAM LIKE THIS AND THE ULTIMATE OUTCOMES. SO THIS IS PUBLISHED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. NOW I THINK MY LAST SLIDE. SO SOME OF THE LESSONS, RESEARCH EVIDENCE WAS INCREDIBLY HELPFUL BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. MONEY MATTERS. IF WE COULDN'T FIND WAY FOR PEOPLE TO GET THIS PAY, THEY WON'T DO IT. DEMAND IS IMPORTANT. WHEN WE STARTED THIS WORK NOBODY WAS ASKING US FOR THIS. AND WE HAVE SPENT SINCE A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO CREATE A DEMAND FOR THIS KIND OF INTERVENTION. AND FINALLY, IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IF YOU PROVIDE GOOD IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT. LET'S FINISH UP ON THIS. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YURGEN, WE'LL HAND IT TO LUCY OR DR. LEYKUM.  THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE AS THEY RELATE TO CARE OF PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. NEXT SLIDE. I HAVE NO DISCLOSURES. NEXT SLIDE. I WILL B TALKING IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE. WHICH IS THE STUDY OF METHODS AND STRATEGIES TO TAKE THINGS THAT WORK IN RESEARCH TRIALS AND PUT THEM INTO ROUTINE CARE. JUST LIKE WHAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT.  FOR EXAMPLE, A NEW TREATMENT, HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WHO SHOULD GET IT ACTUALLY GETS IT? IF THERE'S A NEW SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR CAREGIVERS, HOW DO WE MAKE IT WIDELY AVAILABLE ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF SETTINGS? IMPLEMENTATION IS A PROCESS OF PUTTING EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS INTO REGULAR USE SO THAT WE CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW WE SHOULD DO BASED ON EVIDENCE. AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO IN ROUTINE PRACTICE. JUST SOME QUICK DEFINITIONS. WHEN I IMPLEMENT AN INTERVENTION THAT CUB A NUMBER OF COULD BE A NUMBER OF THINGS. BEST PRACTICE TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND PARTICIPANTS CAN BE INDIVIDUAL PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA OR CAREGIVERS OR THEY COULD BE CLINICIANS OR EVEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. NEXT SLIDE. UNFORTUNATELY OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THINGS THAT WORK HAS BEEN LIMITED WHEN IT COMES TO DEMENTIA CARE. AND THERE ARE THREE KEY REASONS I WILL TALK ABOUT TODAY. FIRST OUR EVIDENCE BASED FOR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IS LIMITED. WE NEED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT TREATMENTS AND INTERVENTIONS THAT, WHO. SECOND OFTEN TYPE L DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT SERVICES THAT MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL WHICH LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO PUT THOSE SERVICES INTO CARE. FINALLY, WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE THINGS THAT WORK IN ONE TYPE OF PLACE AND PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE IN OTHER TYPES OF PLACES, WHICH OFTEN MAKES THINGS WORK LESS WELL. NEXT SLIDE. SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT EACH OF THESE CHALLENGES AND HOW THE FIELD OF IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE IS TRYING TO OVERCOME THEM SO MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND PROGRAMS. NEXT SLIDE. LET'S START WITH ISSUE OF NEEDING MORE EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. IF WE WAIT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF EFFECTIVE TREATMENT TO EXPAND BEFORE WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO PUT THOSE INTERVENTIONS INTO PRACTICE, WE'LL WAIT TOO LONG. THIS IS WHERE HYBRID STUDIES COME INTO PLAY. IN HYBRID STUDIES WE ARE DOING TWO THINGS AT THE SAME TIME, FISHES SEEING IF THE INTERVENTION WORKS, CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND SECOND SEEING HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT IT. THERE'S THREE TYPES OF HYBRID STUDIES WHICH DIFFER IN HOW MANY EMPHASIS THEY PUT ON ASSESSING INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS VERSUS STUDYING IMPLEMENTATION. BUT BY STUDYING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAME TIME, ALL HYBRID STUDY DESIGNS HELP US PUT EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION INTO ROUTINE PRACTICE MORE QUICKLY. NEXT SLIDE. THERE'S SOME OTHER TYPES OF STUDY DESIGNS MORE USED MORE FREQUENTLY TO HELP US TEST INTERVENTIONS AND HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT THEM. ONE IS STEPPED WEDGE DESIGN. RATHER THAN TRADITIONAL RANDOMIZE CONTROL TRIAL APPROACH OF SEEING IF SOMETHING WORKS, IN WHICH HALF PARTICIPANTS GET AN INTERVENTION AND HALF DON'T, IN THE STEPPED WEB STUDY ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE GIVEN INTERVENTION AND IN A STAGGERED FASHION YOU CAN SEE HERE. THIS HAS BENEFITS. FIRST ATTILAS US TO IT ALLOWS US TO SEE THE EFFECT WHEN IMPLEMENTED AND ALLOWS US TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO PARTICIPANTS AFTER THAT IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. THAT WAY WE CAN SEE IF PARTICIPANTS STOP USING THE INTERVENTION OR IF THEY START USING IT DIFFERENTLY WHICH IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION. SECOND, ALL PARTICIPANTS HAVE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF GETTING THE INTERVENTION RATHER THAN GETTING NO INTERVENTION AT ALL. CLICK. THEN TYPE OF USEFUL IMPLEMENTATION STUDY DESIGN IS SOMETHING CALLED A SMART DESIGN. SO RATHER THAN IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING FOR AN ENTIRE STUDY PERIOD, SEEING HOW IT WORKED AND THEN SEEING HOW TO IMPROVE IT, IN A SMART DESIGN STUDY PARTICIPANTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAILOR THE INTERVENTION ALONG THE WAY THROUGH ASSESSING INTERIM OUTCOMES AND ADJUSTING THE INTERVENTION TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER IF NEEDED. BY CONTINUING TO DEVELOP NEW STUDY DESIGNS WE CAN MORE RAPIDLY EXPAND OUR KNOWLEDGE BASE REGARDING EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS AND HOW TO PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. NEXT SLIDE. NEXT MOVE TO ISSUE OF PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA OR CAREGIVERS NOT ACCEPTING INTERVENTIONS OR SERVICES. SO WHY MIGHT PEOPLE NOT ACCEPT THAT SHOULD HELP THEM? SOME LEVEL THOSE SERVICES MUST NOT MEET PEOPLE'S NEEDS. IF WE WANT TO INCREASE INTERVENTION UPTAKE ONE VITAL WAY OF O DOING THIS IS PARTNER WITH PATIENTS CAREGIVERS AND CLINICIANS FROM THE BEGINNING TO DESIGN TREATMENT SERVICES AND INTERVENTIONS THEY WOULD FIND MOST USEFUL. A KEY STRATEGY FOR ACCOMPLISHING THIS PARTNERSHIP IS USING PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES. RESEARCHERS COLLABORATE AS EQUALS WITH PATIENT CAREGIVERS AND OTHERS TO CO-CREATE INTERVENTIONS THAT BEST MEET PARTICIPANTS NEEDS. THIS ALLOWS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF INTERVENTIONS MATCHED WITH RECIPIENTS REAL LIFE CHALLENGES ARROGANCE AND EXPERIENCES. NEXT SLIDE. CHALLENGES, CARE GAPS AN CHALLENGES. AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AS WE WORK WITH CAREGIVERS IS BEING CLEAR ON THEIR ROLE IN THIS WORK. WE ASK THEM TO PARTICIPATE WITH US IN RESEARCH STUDIES. WE ASK THEM TO BE INFORMANTS, REPORT ON THEMSELVES HOW THEY ARE DOING. ASK THEM TO BE PROXIES FOR THE PEOPLE WHOM THEY ARE CARING. AND WE ASK THEM TO PARTNER WITH US AND DELIVERING THE CARE. IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR CAREGIVERS TO BALANCE THESE MULTIPLE IDENTITIES. WAS DEVELOP MORE PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES WE HAVE TO DO SO IN A WAY MORE MINDFUL. AN EXAMPLE OF PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH GETTING ATTENTION IS DESIGN THINKING. DESIGN THINKING IS DIFFERENT AND IT STARTS WITH PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN SET OF OUTCOMES DEFINED BY RESEARCHERS. THROUGH EMPATHIZING RESEARCHERS WORK WITH PARTICIPANTS TO UNDERSTAND THE UNMET NEEDS OF PARTICIPANTS LIVED EXPERIENCES. THEY THEN TRY TO DEFINE GAPS AND PROBLEMS BASED ON THOSE UNMET NEEDS. AND IDEA TO CREATE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONINGS. THESE SOLUTIONS ARE DEVELOPED INTO PROPERTY TYPES THAT CAN BE TESTED TO SEE HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE, IN MEETING NEEDS AND CLOSING GAPS. SO DESIGN THINKING ONLY ASK PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING A SOLUTION BUT ALSO IN DEFINING THE PROP ON THEIR OWN TERMS. NEXT SLIDE. NOW FOR OUR THIRD CHALLENGE. TAKING THINGS AT IN ONE PLACE AND PUTTING THEM SUCCESSFULLY INTO PRACTICE OTHER PLACES THAT ARE OFTEN DIFFERENT. NEXT SLIDE. AS WE THINK ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE THESE ARE THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT WE ARE ASKING IN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE. WHAT IS THE ESSENCE OF INTERVENTION THAT MATTERS? FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE ARE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE CAREGIVER TRAINING PROGRAM ACROSS SITES WE MIGHT ASK HOW MUCH WE NEED TO ADOPT THAT TRAINING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CAREGIVERS? REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE INTERVENTION THAT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IS VITAL. CLICK. SIMILARLY WHAT ARE IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THIS CONTEXT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT? FOR EXAMPLE, HOW DOES THE CARE PATHWAY GET IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY IN RURAL VERSUS SUBURBAN SETTING OR GROUP PRACTICE. FINALLY HOW DO THE INTERVENTION AN CONTEXT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER? CAN WE ALIGN THESE MORE LIKELY TO BE REINFORCING? NEXT SLIDE. I PUT THE SLIDES WITH THE O -- BECAUSE ILLUSTRATES THE CHALLENGE. HOW THEY INTERACT SO IMPLICIT TO THEM THEY DO IT NATURALLY. AND FOR US WATCHING FROM THE OUTSIDE, IF WE WANTED TO GET THEM FLYING ANOTHER DIRECTION WE WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO DO IT IN A CONTROLLED WAY. SAME WITH TRYING TO CHANGE CARE DELIVERY. CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE ORGANIZE THEMSELVES TO DO THE WORK IS A HARD TASK EVEN IF THEY KNOW THEY CAN DO BETTER AND WANT TO CHANGE. NEXT SLIDE. SO HOW MANY TAKE LOCAL WAYS OF ORGANIZING WORK INTO ACCOUNT SO WE IMPLEMENT NEW INTERVENTIONS IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY? HERE IS ONE EXAMPLE USED IN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE CALLED REPLICATING EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. WE START BY UNDERSTANDING THE PRECONDITIONS. WHAT DO PEOPLE IN THE A SPECIFIC SETTING THINK OF THE PROBLEM IN THE INTERVENTION? CLICK. WE THEN ENGAGE PEOPLE IN PLANNING FOR SUCCESS. HOW EXACTLY ARE THEY GOING TO PUT THE INTERVENTION INTO PLACE IN A WAY THAT WILL WORK IN THEIR CONTEXT. DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD ONGOING FEEDBACK IS PROVIDED SO PEOPLE CAN SEE HOW THEY ARE DOING, ADOPT WITH THEIR ARE DOING AND CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. FINALLY IN THE MAINTENANCE PHASE THOSE REFINEMENTS AND ADAPTATION CONTINUE OVER TIME AND ACTIVE DYNAMIC AND ITERATIVE PROCESS. NEXT SLIDE. SO TO SUMMARIZE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN IMPLEMENTING INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE THE CARE OF PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA. AS ALWAYS OUR CHALLENGES REPRESENT OPPORTUNITIES AND NEW APPROACHES AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO PUT EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS TO ROUTINE CARE WITH GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE SHORTEST AMOUNT OF TIME. CLICK TWICE. WE ARE USING ADOPTIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT ALLOW US TO BEST MEET NEEDS OF PATIENTS CAREGIVERS AND CLINICS IN EACH CONTEXT WHERE CARE IS DELIVERED. WE ARE USING PARTICIPATORY HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN THINKING APPROACHES TO PARTNER WITH PATIENTS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR CAREGIVERS TO CO-CREATE INTERVENTIONS MOST RELEVANT TO THEM. CLICK TWICE. AND FINALLY, WE ARE DEVELOPING APPROACHES TO STUDY THINGS OVER TIME SUCH AS SMART ADOPTIVE STEP WEDGE DESIGNS SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF INTERVENTIONS AND HOW TO MAINTAIN THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, LUCY. NOW LET ME MOVE ON TO DR. MCGLYNN. SHE WILL SHARE HER EXPERIENCE ABOUT LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS.  THANKS SO MUCH, MALAZ. I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE TODAY THE TALK ABOUT LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS AT THIS CONFERENCE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NOTICE MY DISCLOSURE SLIDE WENT MISSING BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY DISCLOSURES. SO CLICK. THIS DEFINITION OF LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS COME FROM THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE AND ESSENTIALLY IT IS A LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEM IS A SYSTEM IN WHICH THE SCIENCE INFO FOR MAIEUTICS INCENTIVES AND CULTURE ARE ALIGNED FOR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND INNOVATION. AND WHAT THAT ALLOWS IS FOR BEST PRACTICES TO BE EMBEDDED AND SECURED DELIVERY PROCESSES. THIS SEAMLESSLY THAT'S OBVIOUSLY AN IDEAL BUT THAT'S WHAT THESE SYSTEMS GOING FOR AND KNOWLEDGE IS CAPTURED AS A BY-PRODUCT OF THE DELIVERY EXPERIENCE ITSELF. THE SIMPLEST WAY TO THINK IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE ILLUSTRATIONS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE OF GIVING YOU, ITS SYSTEMS THAT ARE ABLE TO DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. ON A ROUTINE BASIS. NEXT SLIDE. I USE THIS MODEL TO LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEM JUST THE PICTURE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S HELPFUL. IF YOU CLICK IT STARTS WITH THE DATA. AND DATA BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT AS THE COUNSEL OF REALM, IT'S WHAT THE SYSTEM IN JUST TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. THE DATA ALLOW OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH TO BE DONE TO GENERATE EVIDENCE AND TO TRY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO AN ONGOING SET OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMING UP. WHEN WE LEARN BEST PRACTICES FROM THESE MECHANISM , THESE CAN BE FED INTO POINT OF INTERACTION TOOLS THAT ALLOW THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO BE DISPLAYED AT POINT OF CARE ENABLING MORE ROUTINE AND LIVE DELIVERY OF BEST PRACTICE S. THE FINAL STEP IS ONGOING MONITORING AN ANALYTICS. SOME OF WHAT LUCY IS TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU MOVE INTO NEW LOCATIONS OR YOU ADD ELEMENTS, YOU REALLY NEED TO KEEP LOOKING AND LEARNING SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. I WILL TALK ABOUT EACH OF THESE FOUR ELEMENTS IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL. NEXT SLIDE. SO LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS HAVE DATA THAT THEY ARE INGESTING FROM LOTS OF SOURCES AND THE DATA THEMSELVES ARE QUITE VARIABLE. AND COME FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SOURCES. AND INCREASINGLY INCLUDES MEMBERS OF PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. THERE'S A NEED TO USUALLY TREAT THOSE DATA SO THEY CAN BE USED EFFECTIVELY IN OUTPUTS SUCH AS REGISTRIES, WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE. NEXT SLIDE. SO THE DATA THAT ARE AVAILABLE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE HELPFUL FOR THINGS LIKE ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR LOWER THE RISK OF THE ONSET OF DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S. THIS IS A LIST FROM THE LANSETT COMMISSION REVIEW IN 2017. OF SOME OF THE EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR REDUCING RISK AND THESE ARE ALL TYPICALLY READILY AVAILABLE IN THESE KINDS OF HEALTH SYSTEMS. NEXT SLIDE. SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DATA, ARE CREATION OF REGISTRIES. AND YURGEN TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH A NICE ELEVATION BUT THE PROGRESS WE HAVE SEEN IN CHRONIC DISEASE HAS COME FROM CREATING THESE REGISTRIES. THAN BEEN USED BOTH FACILITATE RESEARCH AND TO MORE RAPIDLY BE ABLE TOP REACH OUT TO THE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM INSIGHTS SO CAN BE TERRIBLY IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLECTING NEW DATA. THIS THIS IS COME UP IN PRIOR SESSION IN OUR SESSION AND IN PARTICULAR THINKING ABOUT COLLECTING DATA FROM PATIENT EXPERIENCE AND FROM CAREGIVER. THEN I THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GROWING INTEREST IN SOCIAL NEEDS, THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN TRADITIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND THE MUCH BROADER COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL SERVICES AREAS ARE IMPORTANT. I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE IN A MINUTE. IN MENTION SLIDE. THAT WAS ALL ABOUT DATA. LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS CAN GENERATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EVIDENCE, IF YOU CLICK THERE'S THE RCTs THAT WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH AND WE SAW AN EXAMPLE PRIOR SESSION HAVING NOT ENOUGH RCTs IN IN SOME OF THE SPACES WE ARE INTERESTED IN. THEY ARE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL FOR CLICK, UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD SO WE HAVE TALKED IN SESSIONS ABOUT PRAGMATIC TRIALS AND OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES AND DR. MONIN GAVE EXAMPLES OF THOSE AND THEN THE LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS ALSO ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE THINGS LUCY WAS TALKING ABOUT, IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF RESEARCH METHODS THAT CAN BE USED IN LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS. NEXT SLIDE. I ALSO LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT RESEARCH QUALITY EVIDENCE IS OFTEN NEEDED ACROSS THE BOARD AND IT STARTS WITH EVEN AREAS WE THINK WE KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THE EVIDENCE IS NOT CHANGING MUCH. THERE'S QUITE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MONITORING FOR RELIABLE EXECUTION AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCY WHICH THINGS ARE DONE. THAT GOES ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STATE OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, HONESTLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT TO DO IN THE WORLD OF EXPLORATORY RESEARCH AND INTEREST IN THINGS LIKE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING. AREAS AND THEN EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY WHICH TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE RENEWED FOCUS ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OR SOCIAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT DOMAINS. IS TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE FROM OUR OWN SYSTEM CALLED THRIVE LOCAL. WHERE WE HAVE PARTNERED IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO CREATE RESOURCE DIRECTORIES IN THE COMMUNITY, A NETWORK OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ABLE TO DO BIDIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION, WE CAN PROVIDE REFERRALS TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND WE CAN LEARN WHETHER THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE WORKING. ALL WITHIN A SECURE IT SYSTEM. THESE NEW WAYS TO BRING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS ACTIVELY IN TO CARE DELIVERY NEED TO BE EVALUATED, SEE IF THEY'RE GOING TO WORK BUT I THINK THEY ARE PROMISING. NEXT SLIDE. SO THAT'S LITTLE BIT ABOUT DATA RESEARCH NOW. I'LL SAY QUICKLY POINT OF CARE TOOLS WHICH ARE REALLY INTEGRATED INTO WORK TOOLS, THAT EN ABLE MORE ACCURATE DIAGNOSES TO BE MADE P TESTS TO BE DONE, REFERRALS TO BE MADE, BUT ARE DONE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF REGULAR CARE DELIVERY, IS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING BEST PRACTICES. IT PUTS THE RIGHT INFORMATION IN FRONT OF REALLY A VARIETY OF PEOPLE ON A TEAM AND MAKE DOING THE RIGHT THING MUCH EASIER. IT CAN FACILITATE ACTION TO PROMPTS AND REMINDERS, BUT NEEDS TO BE PRESENTED IN A WAY THAT'S EASY TO USE. IT MAY BE A WAY TO DRIVE SCALABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY. NEXT SLIDE. SO THEN THE FOURTH ELEMENT IN THAT WHEEL IS ONGOING MONITORING AND ANALYTICS. IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT LOOK PROMISING IN THE AREA OF TREATMENT FOR PERSONS WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA, A LOT OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS ARE MULTI-COMPONENT AND VERY COMPLEX. THEY GET EVEN MORE COMPLEX IF THEY TAKE SERIOUSLY TAILORING TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THAT IN PRIOR SESSIONS. AND SO ONGOING MONITORING OF HOW THESE MODELS ARE IMPLEMENTED IN DIFFERENT PLACES WITH DIFFERENT CONTEXT WHAT ADJUSTS ARE BEING MADE OVER TILE AND BARRIERS ENCOUNTERED IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE OUTCOMES YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO GET FROM THOSE MODELS. I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND I THINK LUCY TALKED ABOUT THIS QUITE HELPFULLY, IS TO DO THIS IN A WAY YOU MAKE CHANGES SYSTEMATICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY SO YOU CAN LEARN FROM THEM. IF THE CHANGES ARE GOING ON AND YOU CAN'T REALLY CAPTURE THEM, YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU BEGIN SEEING MORE OR LESS EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION, EXAMPLE FROM YURGEN ON DEPRESSION CARE, WHAT CAUSED THAT EXACTLY? YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU ARE OBSERVING. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF TOOLS THAT USES SYSTEMS DASH BOARDS CARRYING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, TRACKING LONG TERM OUTCOMES, ALL CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING AND ONGOING ASSESSMENT. SO NEXT SLIDE. JUST LITTLE BIT OF CONCLUDING THOUGHTS. LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE A VALUABLE ENTERPRISE FOR ADVANCING REAL WORLD SYSTEMS, DELIVERING BEST IN CLASS CARE FOR PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S. I THINK TOO, AND I WROTE CHALLENGES HERE BUT YOU CAN THINK OF THEM AS OPPORTUNITIES, ARE DEVELOPING SYSTEMATIC APPROACHES FOR ENGAGING THE -- CREATING ENGAGEMENTS BETWEEN MEDICAL AND NON-MEDICAL SYSTEMS AND REALLY I THINK WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IN THIS I THINK THIS WHOLE SUMMIT HAS BEEN ENGAGING FAMILY AND CAREGIVER PERSPECTIVES IN WAYS WE HAVE NOT DONE AS SCALE AS EFFECTIVELY AS WE SHOULD. IT'S TEMPTING TO THINK ABOUT PUTTING SYSTEMS OR SYSTEMS TOGETHER I WILL SAY THOSE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING TO DO EFFECTIVELY BUT IT MAYBE WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT THAT. WE NEED TO REFER OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE WITH RELATED EFFORTS, THAT IS NOT TO HAVE TO GO ALL ALONE BUT TO LOOK FOR CHANCES TO PAIR UP WITH OTHER AREAS THAT ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SOME OF THESE END GOALS. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO NEXT. WHAT MICHAEL AND I WILL DO IS SHARE TEN RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES THAT OUR PANEL HAVE IDENTIFIED. I WILL READ THE FIRST FIVE AND THEN MICHAEL WILL READ THE NEXT FIVE. FIRST ONE IS IDENTIFY CONTEXTUAL AND STRUCTURAL FEATURES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO CREATE LEARNING LABORATORIES TO CATALYZE INTERACTION, COLLABORATION, COORDINATION OF INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO SHORTEN THE TRANSLATION OF INNOVATIVE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE DEMENTIA CARE SERVICES INTO WIDESPREAD USE. NEXT, IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT CREATE MARKET DEMAND AND PROMOTE AVAILABILITY OF EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS FOR THE RAPID IMPLEMENTATION AND DIFFUSION OF THE COLLABORATIVE CARE MODELS WITHIN VARIOUS PAYMENTS MODELS. NEXT. DEVELOP AND EVALUATE TOOLS, PROCESSES, AND STRATEGIES TO INCORPORATE AD FOCUS INTERVENTION STRATEGY INTO THE CURRENT AND FUTURE WORK FLOW OF THE BUSY PRIMARY CARE SYSTEMS. NEXT. DEVELOP AND EVALUATE EVERYDAY BASED TOOLS, PROCESSES AND STRATEGY FOR THE MOST OPTIMAL INTEGRATION OF AD CARE SERVICES ACROSS HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION IN RURAL AND URBAN SETTINGS. LEVERAGE ADVANCES IN HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY, NETWORK SCIENCE TO DEVELOP TOOLS, PROCESSES AND STRATEGIES TO TRAIN, SUPPORT AND INVOLVED FAMILY AND OTHER CAREGIVERS IN THE CARE OF PERSON LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND OTHER RELATED DEMENTIA. MICHAEL. NEXT. THANK YOU. THERE ARE SIX OPPORTUNITIES TO CONDUCT RESEARCH TO DEVELOP AND STUDY MECHANISMS TO COMPENSATE FAMILY AND OTHER UNPAID CAREGIVERS PERSONS LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND DEMENTIA, THEY PLAY ESSENTIAL ROLES IN CARE PLAN OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. 7TH IS AROUND CONDUCTING RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS AND STRATEGIES TO FINANCIALLY COMPENSATE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS, YOU HEARD FROM THE LAST SPEAKER ESSENTIAL ROLES IN THE CARE OF PERSONS LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND RELATED DEMENTIA. THE STUDY HOW PRINCIPLES OF AGILE DESIGN WE HEARD DURING THE THIS PRESENTATION, THE LAST PRIOR PRESENTATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND DIFFUSION THAT INTEGRATE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND CAN PROMOTE DISSEMINATION OF CARE INNOVATIONS FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RELATED DEMENTIA. NEXT. DEVELOP AND EVALUATE NETWORK SCIENCE TOOLS, PROCESSES, AND STRATEGIES FOR DISSEMINATING EVIDENCE-BASED MODELS OF CARE IN RURAL AREAS AND WITHIN AND BETWEEN DEMOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE POPULATIONS. FINALLY, DEVELOP SCALABLE SUSTAINABLE AND ACTIONABLE CARE INTERVENTIONS THAT PAYERS AND PROVIDERS CAN USE OFF THE SHELF IN PRACTICE TO IMPROVE QUALITY SAFETY AND FINANCIAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND GUIDELINES HOW TO INFLUENCE INTERVENTION INCLUDING KEY CONTEXTUAL FACTORS.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, MICHAEL. NOW WE'LL MOVE TO DISCUSS ANT. DR. LINDA ONKEN, WHO WILL REFLECT ON WHAT WE HEARD SO FAR. LISA, ALL YOURS.  THANK YOU. I'M HONORED TO BE INCLUDED AMONG THE DISTINGUISHED SPEAKERS OF THIS SUMMIT. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TRY TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE EXCELLENT POINTS MADE BY THE SPEAKERS AND MAYBE INTEGRATE A FEW OF THESE POINTS. SO DR. BOATSWAIN EMPHASIZED SUSTAINABLE AND ACTIONABLE INTERVENTION USED OFF THE SHELF WITH GUIDELINES HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERVENTION AND KEY CONTEXTUAL FACTORS. SO IF WE CAN'T SUSTAIN AN INTERVENTION, WE CAN'T SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT AN INTERVENTION. DR. LEYKUM DISCUSSED THE IMPORTANCE OF REPLICATING EFFICACIOUS INTERVENTIONS. SHE ASKED WHAT'S THE MINIMUM REQUIRED INTERVENTION? SHE ALSO STRESSED THE CRITICAL CONTEXTUAL FACTORS, THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THEM. SO IF WE CAN'T REPLICATE, WE CAN'T IMPLEMENT SUCCESSFULLY. DR. MCGLYNN ASKED WHAT WORKS IN CONTROLLED STUDIES? IF WE CAN'T RELIABLY DO WHAT WORKS, YOU CAN'T IMPLEMENT. AND DR. UNUTZER COULDN'T HAVE SAID MORE CLEARLY IMPLEMENTATION IS ONE OF THE VALLEYS OF DEATH, AS I RECALL FROM HIS LAST SLIDE. SO NEXT SLIDE. WE ALL KNOW INTERVENTIONS CAN BE COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO LEARN. THAT IS A LOT OF WHAT MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO DELIVER WITH REPLICABILITY AND RELIABILITY. NEXT SLIDE. SO IF WE ARE TRYING TO COOK A MEAL, TRYING TO FOLLOW A RECIPE, IT HELPS TO KNOW THE MAIN INGREDIENTS, THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS, FOR LEMON CAKE WE KNOW WE NEED LEMONS, IF WE MAKE A LEMON CAKE WITH LEMONS AND FLOUR AND BAKING SODA BUT WE DON'T INCLUDE ANY SUGAR WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE A GOOD LEMON CAKE. I DON'T THINK YOU MAKE A CAKE AT ALL AND PEOPLE WOULDN'T WANT TO EAT IT. IF WE PUT CHOCOLATE IN THE LEMON CAKE IT WON'T TASTE VERY GOOD LEMON AND CHOCOLATE. E WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CAKE REQUIRES BAKE BEING SODA. FOR COMPLEXION BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT ALSO NEED WHAT NOT TO DO AND WHY NOT. YOU NEED TO KNOW ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS. IF WE DON'T KNOW THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS AND WHY THEY ARE IMPORTANT, JUST LIKE IT WOULD BE HARD TO RECREATE A RECIPE , WITH BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS, IT WOULD BE HARD TO REPLICATE THE INTERVENTION AND DELIVER IT CORRECTLY WITHOUT KNOWING THE MAIN INGREDIENTS. NEXT SLIDE SO WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT DELIVERING INTERVENTIONS WITH FIDELITY? EVEN IF WE HAD A THREE STAR MITCH LYNN CHEF TEACH US HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING, NOT EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE THE DISH THE SAME WAY IT TASTES IN THE RESTAURANT. NOT EVERYONE HAS THE SAME BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE AND EVEN WHEN PEOPLE DO LEARN, NOT EVERYONE WILL REMEMBER HOW TO RECREATE THE RECIPE NEXT WEEK. OR TWO WEEKS, TWO MONTHS LATER. SAME IS TRUE WHEN WE TEACH PEOPLE TO ADMINISTER CHECKS BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS THAT NEED THE GO INTO COMPLEX SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS PERHAPS. SO WHAT CAN WE DO FOR THIS FOR ONE, AS MANY SPEAKERS POINT OUT RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE TO IMPLEMENTATION OF KNOWING ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS AND HOW AND WHY AN INTERVENTION WORKS. WE CAN ALSO CONSIDER THE EASE OF IMPLEMENTIBILITY OF THE INTERVENTION EARLY AND OFTEN AS POSSIBLE IN THE INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND THIS INCLUDES INVOLVING STAKE HOLERS AS NECESSARY, EARLY IN THE PROCESS AND OFTEN AS NEED IN THE PROCESS AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT IMPLEMENTIBILITY. FINALLY, FINALLY RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING AND MODIFYING EXPLICIT TRAINING PROCEDURES FOR COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF RENDER ING THESE TRAINING PROCEDURES AS SCALABLE AS THE INTERVENTIONS THEMSELVES AND TESTING THE PROCEDURES WITH THE SAME DEGREE OF RIGOR WE TEST THE INTERVENTIONS THEMSELVES. TO EN SURE THAT WHEN INTERVENTIONS ARE DELIVERED IN COMMUNITY THEY CAN BE DELIVER WITH SUSTAINED FIDELITY. JUST A FEW THOUGHTS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR ATTENTION.  THANK YOU LISA S. HAND IT BACK TO DAVID ANDIER FER FOR THE Q&A AND TRY TO DIRECT THE QUESTIONS TO THE RIGHT PANEL IS.  GREAT. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. TO ALL THE PANELISTS. THE FIRST QUESTION GOES -- YOU CAN DIRECT IT BUT PROBABLY TO DR. UNUTZER ABOUT OLDER PARTICIPANTS WHO HAVE DEMENTIA, CREATIVE ANTIDEPRESSANT THOUGH NOT DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION. THAT MAYBE COME O HOW THAT INTERFERES WITH STUDIES OF ALZHEIMER'S AND OTHER DEMENTIA.  LET ME TRY TO TAKE THAT. UNFORTUNATELY THE REAL WORLD IS COMPLEX. PEOPLE DON'T JUST HAVE THE THING WE WANT TO STUDY. DEPRESSION AND DEMENTIA OFTEN OCCUR TOGETHER. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEMENTIA WHO WILL DEVELOP DEPRESSION, MAYBE IN PART BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY EARLY STAGE TO LIVE WITH THE DEMEANTING ILLNESS. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LATE LIFE DEPRESSION THAT MAY REALLY BE AN EARLY PRESENTATION OF DEVELOPING DEMENTIA. AND IT'S NOT EASY TO SORT IT OUT. THERE ARE GOOD TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE IN RESEARCH AND IN CLINICAL TO TRY TO DIFFERENTIATE DEPRESSION AND DEMENTIA OR TO DIAGNOSE BOTH CONCURRENTLY. AND IN TERMS OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS USED IN THIS POPULATION I WILL SAY LIKE IN ANY POPULATION, THE MOST CHALLENGING THING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THEY ARE NOT WORKING WE STOP THEM. BECAUSE I SEE A LOT OF PATIENTS WHO GET STARTED ON AN ANTIDEPRESSANT AND THEY CAN IT FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO AND IT NEVER WORKED IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO I THINK THAT LIKE WITH ANY OTHER INTERVENTION, IT COULD BE HELPFUL BUT IF IT'S NOT HELLFUL, STOP HELPFUL, BUT IF NOT, STOP IT AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE.  THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, THE FIRST HAD TO DO WITH IMPROVING REPLICABILITY ACROSS DEMENTIA CARE STUDIES AND JUST TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THAT. AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, HOW DO YOU BALANCE PRAGMATISM VERSUS FIDELITY? TERMS OF MAKING SURE IN THE REPLY CASE STUDIES AND DISSEMINATION STUDIES PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING THE INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED EFFECTIVE.  LUCY CAN YOU TAKE THIS AND I CAN ADD INPUT ON THAT.  SURE. SO I PERSONALLY EXAMINE DOWN ON SIDE OF PRAGMATISM AND I WONDER IS OUR GOAL REPLICATE OR IMPROVE. IF OUR GOAL IS IMPROVE, WE CAN BE ADAPTIVE HOW TO GET THERE. BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS WE CAN DO. FIRST UNDERSTANDING CONTEXT, IF WE RYE TO UNDERSTAND KEY CONTEXTUAL FACTS TO WHEN WE START THAT HELPS THINK HOW CONTEXTUAL FACTORS ARE SIMILAR OR DIFFERENT TO THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONINGS WE'LL TRY TO WORK. AND GIVE YOUS HOW TO PROCEED. THE OTHER THING THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS CONTINUOUS ONGOING ASSESSMENT AS WE IMPLEMENT. THAT'S PART OF WHAT TELLS US WHAT ARE THE KEY FACTORS OF THIS INTERVENTION THAT'S WORKING? WHAT IS RESONATING WITH PEOPLE, WHAT IS PRACTICES THAT ARE CHANGING AND HOW DO WE ASSESS THOSE OUTCOMES TO KNOW WHAT IS CHANGING OVER TIME. THOSE GIVE PIECES OF INFORMATION WE NEED TO THEN CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT IN OTHER PLACES. CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK.  SPEAKER5: THINK. I THINK THE QUESTION MIGHT BE NOT RELEVANT. I HATE TO SAY THAT WORD BECAUSE IN THE REAL WORLD THE PROBLEM IS NOT AM I IMPLEMENTING SOLUTION? THE PROBLEM IS MY PROBLEM GOING AWAY, IS MY PHQ 9 GO BEGIN AWAY. WHEN YOU FOCUS ON PROBLEM SOLVING , SOLVING THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM THAT GIVE YOU A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CONTEXTUAL PIECE S AND FLEXIBILITY TO UPDATE EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTION. SO J URGEN MADE SURE IN IMPLEMENTATION SOMETHING CALLED PHQ 9 MAKING SURE THE END OF THE DAY THESE PATIENTS WHO HAVE DEPRESSION , IT WENT DOWN, AND HE HAD FLEX TO BELIEVE CHANGE THE PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGY, THE ANTIDEPRESSANT AND NEW ONE OR NOT. SO FOCUS ON THE OUTCOME MEASURE FOR THE PROBLEM AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE PROCESS MIGHT HELP IN THAT TRANSITION AND REPLICABILITY.  ANOTHER COUPLE OF QUESTIONS CAME IN. ABOUT LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS. ONE QUESTION CAME IN ABOUT HOW DO HEALTH SYSTEMS DEAL WITH DATA THAT ARE EASILY COLLECTED IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD? SUCH AS PATIENT IDENTIFIED PRIORITIZED GOALS IN DEMENTIA CARE AND HOW DO THEY USE STORIES, EVERYBODY WHO HAS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA HAS THEIR OWN STORY. SO JUST GET A COMMENT ON THAT. ELIZABETH.  SURE I'LL START. I'LL START WITH THE FIRST QUESTION OR THE LAST QUESTION FOR A SECOND. GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT, INCREASED USE OF DESIGN THINKING. TO DEVELOP INTERVENTIONS. THAT'S A PLACE WHERE STORIES AND PRIORITIES CAN BECOME REALLY IMPORTANT AND EVEN THINKING WHAT INTERVENTION S OR SYSTEMS YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO PUT IN PLACE TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS OF CARE. SO THAT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THING, THERE'S MORE OF THAT GOING. SECOND IN TERMS OF TAKING IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF DATA THAN HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN USED IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH, WE TALK ABOUT THE DATA ECOSYSTEM WE USE. AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING TOGETHER REALLY VERY DIFFERENT KINDS OF INFORMATION. WE HAVE DONE THIS WITH PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES. AND TO CREATE VIEWS THAT GET INTEGRATED INTO MORE TRADITIONAL PROVIDER FACING TOOLS CLINICIAN FACING TOOLS. SO THAT THAT INFORMATION INCLUDES THINGS LIKE PRIORITIES OR INCLUDES THINGS ABOUT PREFERENCES, INCLUDES THINGS ABOUT INDIVIDUALS CAN COME UP AT THE POINT OF CARE, AND INTEGRATE INFORMATION. SO I THINK WE SEE AREAS THIS HAD BEEN DONE AND IT DOES REQUIRE INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY, LEARNS WHAT'S GOING TO WORK THE BEST SO THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR USING THOSE SYSTEMS TO INDIVIDUALIZE CARE DELIVERY IN WAYS THAT QUESTION SUGGESTS ARE IMPORTANT.  ANOTHER QUESTION I GUESS TO THAT, IT IS NOTABLE FOCUSED ON INTEGRATING SOCIAL FACTORS AS POINT OF CARE AND HOW THIS RELATES TO DEMENTIA CARE.  PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE VERSED SAYING WHAT'S MOTIVATING INTEREST. INTEREST IS MOTIVATED BY WHAT MY SIMPLE RESPONSE TO THAT IS USUALLY IS RIGHT. IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THEIR BASIC NEEDS MET HOUSING, FOOD, SAFE ENVIRONMENT, OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH MEETING PEOPLE'S BASIC NEEDS, IT 'S HARD FOR ANY HEALTH SYSTEM TO MAKE ADVANCE IN PEOPLE'S HEALTH SO TO THE EXTENT SYSTEMS ARE FOCUSED AND INTERESTED IN OPTIMIZING HEALTH FOR PEOPLE THEY SERVE, YOU CAN NO LONGER IGNORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE OTHER FACTORS. THAT'S WHERE THE MOTIVATION COMES FROM. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, THIS IS IN SOME WAYS AS IMPORTANT AS WE KNOW IT IS FOR PEOPLE CAN ANY KIND OF CHRONIC LONG STANDING DISEASE. SO IT'S JUST IF YOU WANT THE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HEALTH AND I WORK IN A SYSTEM THAT WANTS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HEALTH, YOU CAN'T IGNORE THESE FACTORS ANY MORE. AND I THINK YOU HAVE EVIDENCE ABOUT THAT FOR A LONG TIME, BUT IT'S GETTING HARDER TO WALK AWAY FROM THE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE FACTORS.  SO THIS QUESTION CAME IN ON THE NEED FOR INVESTMENT IN IN DATA AND TECHNOLOGY. OBVIOUSLY LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS CAN DO THIS. SMALLER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS PRIVATE PRACTICES, COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS, THIS WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. SO WHAT DOES IT TAKE AND HOW CAN THIS BE ACCOMPLISHED? LET ME TAKE THIS ONE AND THEN I'LL ASK YURGEN HASSER BECAUSE HE HAD TO WORK WITH MUCH MORE DIVERSE PIECE. I THINK THE QUESTION HAS REALLY AMAZING IMPETUS. THAT SMALL PRACTICES MIGHT NOT HAVE CAPABILITY SO ONE OPTION WE HAVE BEEN DOING WITH SUPPORT WITH CMS IS CREATING THIS CONCEPT OF COLLABORATIVE OR NETWORK WHERE YOU ACTUALLY HEDGE THE COST ACROSS ALL MEMBERSHIPS OF A NETWORK AND MANAGE THAT NEED INSTEAD OF NOT HAVING THESE RESOURCES. BUT I WONDER YURGEN IF YOU CAN SAY HOW DOES SIMPLE DATA REQUIREMENT THAT HAD TO DO BY ALL THESE NUMBERS OF SITES, ALMOST 100 PLUS, THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED IMPACT MODELS SO FAR?  I THINK IT'S -- FOR US PROBABLY THE KEY TOOLS WE HAVE TO HAVE IS A GOOD REGISTRY TOOL. SOMEBODY HAS TO KNOW IS THERE A PERSON WHO IS DEPRESSED, IF SO, ARE THEY GETTING BETTER? IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT YOU ARE LOST. SO IN LARGE PRACTICE S, SOME OF THE BETTER EHR TOOLS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CREATE THAT REGISTRY. BUT IF IT'S REMARKABLE, HOW 15 YEARS AFTER WE BUILT THE TOOL WE USED IN THE STUDY, EVEN SOME OF THE LARGER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS STILL COULDN'T PRODUCE A FUNCTIONAL REGISTRY. THAT IS NOW CHANGING. SMALLER PRACTICE IS STILL A CHALLENGE SO YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM A TOOL THAT EASY TO USE. WHY THEY USE IT? TWO REASONS. ONE IS, THE KIND OF MODEL I TALKED ABOUT REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE PERSON TO BE ABLE TO LOOK UP VERY EASILY AND QUICKLY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. SO A WEB-BASED TOOL WHERE DATA SYSTEM IN THE CLOUD MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE PATIENT TO SUBMIT THEIR OWN PHQ 9, OR FAMILY MEMBER IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE PSYCHIATRIC COMPONENT WHO MIGHT BE A STATE AWAY TO LOOK AT IT AND THE ACCOUNT MANAGER WHO HAS INTERACTION WITH THE PATIENTS CAN LOOK. SO THAT'S THE KIND OF TOOLS, IF IT FACILITATES GOOD CARE, PRACTICE MIGHT BE MOTIVATED TO INVEST IN IT. I THINK THE LONG TERM WHAT WE NEED TO GO WITH THIS, THIS IS DATA THAT IS THE PATIENT AND THE FAMILY DATA. WE NEED TO MAKE TOOLS THAT ARE SO EASY TO USE FOR THE PATIENT AND FAMILY USE IT TO COMMUNIQUE WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE HEALTHCARE TEAM. AND THEN I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING REALLY POWERFUL. NEXT QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE ARE ANY GOOD EXAMPLES OF DESIGN THINKING DERIVED INTERVENTIONS IN THE DEMENTIA SPACE. LUCY.  I CAN THINK OF SOME THAT REALLY RELATE SPECIFICALLY TO INPATIENT CARE. SO THESE ARE INTERVENTIONS IN WHICH PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS GAVE INPUT AROUND CHALLENGES THEY WERE EXPERIENCING DURING HOSPITALIZATION. IN TERMS OF PUTTING TOGETHER INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN TERMS OF KNOWING WHAT THEY WERE INTERACTING WITH. AND THEN IN COLLABORATION WITH CLINICIAN S, DEVELOPING TOOLS TO HELP KEEP ALL THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER. AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND SO MUCH IS WE THINK WE GIVE PEOPLE INFORMATION AND THEN THEY HAVE ALL THEY NEED. BUT IT'S REALLY WHAT THE DESIGN THINKING I THINK HELPS US WITH IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE USE THAT INFORMATION. HOW THEY USE THE INFORMATION TO CREATE MEANING AND TO MAKE SENSE. THAT IS WHAT THEY'LL ACT ON LATER.  THANK YOU, LUCY.  SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS HERE . ABOUT TAILORING INTERVENTION SO TO BE DEVELOPED AND TESTED IN ONE SETTING BUT DISSEMINATING THEM AND MAKING WORK IN SETTINGS THAT ARE CULTURALLY DIFFERENT FOR UNDERRE SOURCED RURAL, CERTAIN ORIGANS OF COMMUNITY BASED RESOURCES MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE. WHAT -- WHERE DO WE STAND WITH THAT? I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN IN LIMITED RE SOURCES ENVIRONMENTS SO CAN YOU GIVE INSIGHT?  HOW SMALL RURAL PRACTICE COULD DO THIS YES.  YOU HAVE TO GIVE A REASON TO DO IT. YOU HAVE TO GIVE INCENTIVE. AND IF YOU SAY IF YOU HAVE THIS DATA AND IT'S ACCESSIBLE WE CAN PROVIDE YOU SOMETHING MEANINGFUL TANGIBLE, IN OUR CASE WE HAVE RURAL PRACTICES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. WE HAVE 39 COUNTIES. ONLY 17 HAVE ONE PSYCHIATRIST. THE REST WILL NEVER SEE ONE SO IF YOU CAN SAY IF YOU SHARE DATA WITH US ON A WEB BASE TOOL LIKE THIS WE WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU CONSULTATION STRAIGHT INTO YOUR PRACTICE. THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL MOTIVATOR. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REASON FOR PEOPLE TO WANT TO PUT TO WANT TO DO THAT H. IT IS EXTRA WORK BUT AS LONG AS SOMETHING MEANINGFUL COMES BACK PEOPLE CAN CERTAINLY DO IT.  THANKS.  KIND OF A RELATED QUESTION, TO FOLLOW-UP ON THAT, YOU TALK ABOUT INCENTIVES PARTICULARLY FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. ASIDE FROM FINANCIAL INCENTIVES WHAT KIND OF THINGS MIGHT WORK IN TERMS OF DISSEMINATING?  SEE BETH DO YOU HAVE ANY INPUT WHERE YOU SIT ON KEISER PERMANENTE THIS $5 SIGN IS THERE ANY OTHER INCENTIVE THAT FACILITATE DIFFUSION?  I ALWAYS START WITH PROFESSIONAL SATISFACTION. SO I THINK WE START WITH PHYSICIAN AND OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND MEMBERS OF THE CARE TEAM, WANT BEST BY PATIENT SO THE BIG ATTRACTION IN WHAT WE SEE WORKS IS WHEN PEOPLE FEEL THAT IT IS A TOOL THAT IS EFFECTIVE IN HELPING THEIR PATIENTS. THAT'S ONE. I DON'T I AGREE FINANCIAL PIECE IS HELPFUL BUT STARTS DEMONSTRATING IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN PATIENT LIVES, THAT IS WHY MOST HEALTH PROFESSIONALS GET OUT OF BED AND GO INTO DO A REALLY TOUGH JOB.  WE ARE OUT OF TIME, 3:40. HAND IT BACK TO YOU DAVID.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO THESE WERE GREAT QUESTIONS. WE DIDN'T GET TO QUITE ALL OF THEM BUT THANKS AND YOU CAN CONTINUE TO SUBMIT THEM. WE ARE GOING TO BREAK NOW FOR TEN MINUTES. SO WE WILL COME BACK AT 3: 50 AND FOR THE LAST THEME. THANKS, EVERYBODY.  IT IS 3:50, TIME TO COME BACK MY JOB IS TO VERY BRIEFLY WELCOME EVERYBODY BACK. AND PASS THE BATON TO VINCE MOORE AND JOANNE PIKE WHO WILL LEAD THE FINAL THEME DISCUSSION ON RESEARCH RESOURCES, METHODS AND DATA INFRASTRUCTURE. VINCE AND JOANNE.  THANK YOU, DAVID. I'M JOANNE PIKE AND TOGETHER WITH VINCE MOR WE ARE CO-CHAIRING THEME 6 ON RESEARCH RESOURCE, METHODS AN DATA INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS INCLUDES A FOCUS ON METHOD DATA AND PROCESS TO FACILITATE CROSS CUTTING HIGH IMPACT RESEARCH INCLUDING APPROACHES TO INTERVENTION RESEARCH INCLUDING PRAGMATIC TRIALS, AND OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES TO ENABLE MONITORING OF PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING RESEARCH IMPLEMENTATION MILESTONES. ISSUES THAT WILL BE COVERED TODAY INCLUDE SURVEY INFRASTRUCTURE, ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS, COSTS AND ACCESS TO DATA FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. VINCE WILL BE INTRODUCE YOU CAN SPEAKERS.  THANK YOU, JOANNE. GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE OUR SPEAKERS ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC REGARDING RESEARCH RESOURCES ADVANCES AND DATA INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO ADVANCE CARE OF PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS JULIE BYNUM, GERIATRIC AND HEALTH RESEARCHER AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, WHERE SHE SPECIALIZES IN USING MEDICARE AND OTHER INSURANCE CLAIMS DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS OF CARE OLDER PERSONS RECEIVE. SHE IS FOLLOWED BY TOM TRAVISON, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR BIOSTATISTICS AT HARVARD AND DIRECTOR OF BIOSTATISTICS AND DATA SCIENCE LONG TERM CARE HOSPITAL AFFILIATE WITH HARVARD. FOLLOWED BY DAVID WENDLER, SENIOR INVESTIGATOR AT THE NIH CLINICAL CENTER AND DEPARTMENT OF BIOETHICS WHERE HE FOCUSES ONETHICS OF RESEARCH ON PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT. EACH SPEAKER WILL HAVE TEN MINUTES THEN MOVE TO THE GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES. JULIE, YOU ARE UP FIRST.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE I'M JULIE BYNUM, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HERE TO TALK TODAY HOW WE IDENTIFY PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA WHEN WE ARE CONDUCTING POPULATION AND HEALTHCARE RESEARCH. NEXT. SO FROM MY EXPERIENCE DOING POPULATION RESEARCH AN HEALTHCARE RESEARCH SOMETIMES JUNIOR FACULTY AND OTHER INVESTIGATORS WILL ASK ME HOW SHOULD WE OR ASK HER ADVICE HOW SHOULD WE BEST IDENTIFY PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA FOR OUR STUDIES. AND WE'RE GOING TO HELP ANSWER THAT QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK THREE MORE QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS ARE, WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF YOUR STUDY? WHAT ARE THE KEY PARTICIPANT FEATURES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO MAKE VALID CONCLUSION? WHAT ARE THE TRADE OFFS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE IN ORDER FOR YOU TO MEET THE GOALS OF YOUR STUDY? THE INFORMATICS WORLD HAS A TERM FOR THINKING THIS WAY. THEY CALL IT FITNESS FOR USE. WHICH I REALLY LIKE. WHERE WE ARE THINKING ABOUT OUR OPTIONS AND DATA OPTIONS THAT APPROACH OPTIONS AND TAILORING OUR DECISIONS WHAT TO DO BASED ON WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. NEXT. THE IDEA OF FITNESS OF USE IS SO USEFUL BECAUSE IT HAMMERS HOME THE PUNCH LINE THERE'S GOING TO BE NO SINGLE BEST APPROACH. IF YOU THINK ABOUT OUR FOCUS TODAY, WHICH IS POPULATION -- MY FOCUS POPULATION EPIDEMIOLOGY RESEARCH AND HEALTHCARE SETTING RESEARCH, EVEN WITHIN THAT SMALLER DOMAIN OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE STUDIES HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF POTENTIAL GOALS OF THEIR STUDIES. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, IF FOR EXAMPLE I WAS INTERESTED IN DOING A STUDY OF CAREGIVERS, AND TO INFORM POLICIES THAT MIGHT COME OUT, I MAY BE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF DEMENTIA A PERSON HAS, WHAT THE ETIOLOGY WAS. BUT IF I WAS DOING A EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND RISK FACTORS PER SE BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS THEN THE TYPE, THE ETIOLOGY OF DEMENTIA COULD REALLY BE VERY IMPORTANT. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THAT BRINGS US TO THE NEXT QUESTION. WHAT IT THE FEATURES OF PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA THAT ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO CAPTURE IN YOUR STUDY? DR. PERSPECTIVE SORESON WAY DR. PETERSON TALKED ABOUT CATEGORIES OF DISEASE WE NOW USE IN OUR LEXICON WHEN WE DO DEMENTIA STUDIES. MAY GO FROM STUDYING DEMENTIA SYNDROME WHICH IS DEFINED BY COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL LOSS , TO DEFINING PEOPLE BY THEIR SPECIFIC CAUSE OF THEIR DEMENTIA ALZHEIMER'S OR OTHER CAUSE, OR IDENTIFYING CONDITIONS THAT PULL PEOPLE AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING DEMENTIA WHICH ARE PEOPLE WITH NCI FOR EXAMPLE, OR HAVE A BIOLOGIC PHENOTYPE THAT'S IDENTIFIED THROUGH BLOOD TESTS OR CEREBROSPINAL FLUID TO SAY THAT THEY MIGHT DEVELOP THE DEMENTIA SYNDROME IN THE FUTURE. THESE ARE REALLY DISEASE CONSTRUCTS. THINKING ABOUT WHICH OF THESE DISEASE CONSTRUCTS IS EVER MORE IMPORTANT IN OUR FIELD TODAY, ONE BECAUSE IT MEANS A LOT FOR INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS BUT TWO, OUR FIELD HAS BECOME MORE COMPLEX AND MORE NUANCED AND ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE THAT WE USE THE NOMENCLATURE THAT COMMUNE CASE WELL WITH OUR -- COMMUNICATES WELL WITH STAKEHOLDERS SO WHEN KNOW WHEN STUDIES A APPLYING TO WHICH SPECIAL POPULATION. IN ADDITION IT HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR DATA COLLECTION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IF WE ARE STUDYING DEMENTIA SYNDROME WE CAN IDENTIFY COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE AND ROLE FUNCTION THROUGH SURVEYS AND POSSIBLY PROCEDURESISES IN SYSTEM SCENARIOS BUT IF WE NEED THE TYPE OF SEVERITY WE HAVE TO DO A CLINICAL EVALUATION AND COLLECT BIOLOGICAL MARKERS. WITH THOSE DECISIONS THOSE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DATA THERE ARE TRADE OFFS. CLEARLY THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A DIAGNOSTIC PRECISION TRADE OFF ACROSS THESE CATEGORIES . DEPENDING HOW MUCH MORE DETAILED DATA YOU COLLECT, AND WHEN YOU GET MORE PROVISION YOU OFTEN GET MORE COST. IT'S MUCH MORE COSTLY TO COLLECT OBVIOUSLY BRAIN IMAGING THAN IT IS TO DO A SURVEY. WITH THOSE MORE INTENSIVE METHODS WE ALSO HAVE INCREASED RISK ALBEIT RELATIVELY LOW RISK COMPARED TO WHAT SOME PHARMACEUTICAL STUDIES DO AND ALSO VERY IMPORTANTLY THE BARRIERS TO RECRUITMENT. SOME OF THE THINGS WE REQUIRE OF PEOPLE TO RECRUIT INTO A STUDY SUCH AS BIOLOGIC MARKERS ARE MAYBE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT IN SOME ETHNIC GROUPS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WE LOOK AT THE CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR STRATEGIES FOR IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WITH LIVING WITH DEMENTIA FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC AND POPULATION STUDIES, ONE OF THE FIRST ONES IS THIS ISSUE OF SAMPLING AND RECRUITING REPRESENTATIVE POPULATIONS. AND IT'S REALLY TIED UP IN THE COST, OF HOW WE IDENTIFY OUR POPULATION. TO GET TRULY REPRESENTATIVE STUDY WE NEED A LARGE ONE. BUT TO DO THAT WITH A CLINICAL EXAM OR BIOLOGIC MARKERS COULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. ANOTHER MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR US IS THAT WITH EVERY STUDY YOU CAN USE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT METHODS AND AS A RESULT GET SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT RESULTS THAT MAY CONFUSE STAKEHOLDERS. SO HARMONIZATION OF HOW WE ARE DOING MEASUREMENT AND HOW STUDIES RELATE TO EACH OTHER ARE VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY THINKING CONSISTENCY OVER TIME AS OUR DIAGNOSIS DEFINITIONS CHANGE OVER TIME. WHEN WE WANT THE STUDY TRENDS AND HAVE LONG TERM LEGACY DATABASEED DATABASEED FROM DEMENTIA SYNDROMES HOW WE USE THAT MOVING FORWARD AS WITH E COLLECT OTHER MORE SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS FOR WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A PERSON LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. FINALLY AS I HAVE MENTIONED WE HAVE VERY LIMITED DATA FOR THE BIOLOGIC MEASURES AMONG CERTAIN ETHNIC RACIALLY UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS. SO OUR NEW DEFINITIONS WILL PRESENT CHALLENGING TO GET BASIC EPIDEMIOLOGY DOWN. I THINK THE MAIN POINT I WANT YOU THE TAKE AWAY THOUGH IS THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH NUANCE IN OUR FIELD THINKING DISEASE CONSTRUCT AND HOW IT FITS WITH PRECISELY WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO STUDY IS A CRITICAL STEP AND THEN THE SECOND CRITICAL STEP IS BEING ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IN OUR NOMENCLATURE AND OUR DISCUSSION WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT CONSTRUCT WE ARE USING AND HOW ARE DATA PROCESSES ALONE ASIDE FROM OUR THEORIES OF DISEASE AND OTHERWISE, EVEN OUR DATA PROCESSES CAN IMPACT OUR INTERPRETATION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. LOT OF PEOPLE TURN TO HEALTHCARE SETTING DATA TO TRY TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF COST AND GETTING A TRULY REPRESENTATIVE REAL WORLD SELECTION OF PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA. WE HEARD REFERENCE TO THAT MANY THE LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS SECTION AS WELL. I MEAN DATA GENERATED IN COURSE OF DELIVERING CARE. AN EXAMPLE OF THAT ARE THINGS LIKE BILLING DATA, ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD DATA WHETHER THAT'S MEDICARE CLAIMS, ASSESSMENT FILES OR THE STRUCTURE OR THE UNSTRUCTURED ELEMENTS IN A RECORD. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE MAJOR CHALLENGES, THIS KIND OF DATA THOUGH IS THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE SHOW UP IN THAT CLAIM YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BILL, YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE VISIT. YOU HAVE TO PRESENT FOR CARE. WHILE THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL DISEASES, THERE'S REALLY SPECIAL ISSUE MS. S IN THE FIELD OF DEMENTIA. THIS MODEL HOW SOMEBODY COMES TO DIAGNOSIS OF ANY KIND OF DIAGNOSIS FOR THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE HELPS WITH THAT BECAUSE WHICH KNOW IN THE SETTING OF DEMENTIA WE HAVE ISSUES OF STIGMA THAT MIGHT KEEP PEOPLE FROM COMING IN, WE ALSO HAVE UNDERDIAGNOSIS EVEN WHEN PEOPLE DO COME IN BECAUSE OF CLINICIAN SKILL AND OTHERWISE AND MIGHT HAVE PEOPLE IN WHOM DIAGNOSIS OR CONCERNS HAVEN'T BEEN DISCLOSED. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. MANY PEOPLE ARE REACHING THE ELECTRON ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD TO OFFER OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS BECAUSE IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD YOU CAN USE UNSTRUCTURED FIELDS, CLINICAL NOTES TO EXTRACT SYMPTOMS OR YOU CAN USE SCREENING TOOLS THAT ARE USED FOR THE ANNUAL WELLNESS EXAM FOR EXAMPLE. SO THAT OFFERS SOME REAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE GROWING. BUT THERE'S STILL CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN. THEY STILL HAVE TO COME INTO THE CLINICAL SETTING. AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO COME INTO THE PLACE THAT HAS ONE OF THESE ELECTRONIC HELD RECORDS FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA INTERESTED IN HOME CARE DAY CARE ORIZATIONED LIVING AND MAJOR CHALLENGES OF IMPLEMENTING THE ALGORITHMS ACROSS THESE SYSTEMS. BEYOND IDENTIFYING THE YES OR NO WHETHER SOMEBODY IS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA, THERE'S ALSO SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISEASE ITSELF. THAT ARE HARD FOR US TO IDENTIFY CURRENTLY. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN STAIN OR SEVERITY, FIRST THERE'S MANY WAYS TO DEFINE THAT BY COGNITIVE LEVEL FUNCTION BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS AND THOSE PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS ARE DIFFICULT TO PULL OUT OF EXISTING CLAIMS DATA. SIMILARLY, TYPE OF DEMENTIA IS HARD CLINICALLY SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DATA REPRESENTEDDED IN THE CLINICAL RECORD IS NOT ACCURATE AS WE WOULD LIKE BUT FOR CARE INTERVENTIONS WE SHOULD BE THINKING CAREFULLY ABOUT WHICH CAREGIVER INTERVENTION WORKS AT WHICH STAGE OF DISEASE. AND DO WE HAVE MEASUREMENT APPROACHES TO CAPTURE THAT FULLY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN SUMMARY THERE'S NEW EXCITING THINGS GOING ON IN OUR FIELD AND LOTS OF ATTENTION, PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO US AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA, WE HAVE A REAL IMPERATIVE TO BE CLEAR AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY. BECAUSE OF THE NUANCE WE HAVE TO BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL ABOUT ADDRESSING THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR DATA AND THE LIMITATIONS OF HOW WE CAN INTERPRET FINDINGS ESPECIALLY AS THAT EFFECTS REPRESENTATION OF THE GENERAL POPULATION AND HOW OUR STAKEHOLDERS LIKE POLICY MAKERS AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS MIGHT USE THIS INFORMATION. THANK YOU.  MY NAME IS TOM TRAVISON, BY WAY OF DISCLOSURE ON THE NEXT SLIDE ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BIOSTATISTICS GROUP AT THE NIA FUNDED BOSTON OLDER AMERICANS INDIANA PEN DENSE CENTER AND LIKE DR. MONIN, DIRECTOR OF IMPACT LABORATORY DESIGN STATISTICS CORPS DIRECTED BY MY COLLEAGUE PROFESSOR HEATHER ALLURE. NEXT SLIDE, FIRST I WOULD SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE CREATURE WE KNOW AS EMBEDDED PRAGMATIC TRIAL. THERE'S EXPERTS MANY THE AUDIENCE SO I'LL ASK INDULGENCE WHERE TERMINOLOGY IS STREAMLINED FORD CLARITY. WHAT I THINK OF SO CALLED PRAGMATIC CLINICAL TRIAL IS ROUGHLY AN INTERVENTION TRIAL THAT SEEK TO PRESERVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF REAL WORLD CARE AND DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF INFORMATION. EMBEDDED TRIAL IS ONE IN WHICH STRUCTURE OF TRIAL ITSELF IS CONTAINED WITHIN RATHER THAN APART FROM A HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM OR SYSTEMS. I FIND IT CONVENIENT TO THINK OF THIS Z AS HIGHER LEVEL FUTURE OF PRAGMATISM WHERE NOT ONLY DESIGN IS REAL EXCHANGES OF CARE AN INFORMATION BUT ALSO CIRCUMSTANCES IN SETTINGS IN WHICH EVENTS OCCUR ARE AS THEY ARE IN REAL WORLD CARE. BECAUSE OF THESE FEATURES, THIS ATRIALES LACK INTENTIONAL LABORATORY ARTIFICIALITY OF WHAT WE MIGHT CALL CONVENTIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS DESIGN WHAT WE THINK OF IN CLASSICAL DRUG DEVELOPMENT OR BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION, AND THEREFORE THESE NEW DESIGNS ARE IDEAL FOR HELPING US QUANTIFY THE PRACTICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF AN INTERVENTION. HOW IT IS LIKELY TO PERFORM IN THE WILD SO TO SPEAK AS OPPOSED TO CLASSICAL EFFICACY OF INTERVENTIONS WHICH MEASURE EFFECTS UNDER MORE STRINGENT LABORATORY LIKE CONTROL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THESE DESIGNS HAVE PARTICULAR RELEVANCE FOR ASSESSMENT OF NON-PHARMACOLOGIC OR SYSTEMS LEVEL INTERVENTION BECAUSE OF THE CHOICE TO MAINTAIN PRAGMATISM IN OVERLAPPING AND MUTUALLY REINFORCING DOMAIN ILLUSTRATED HERE. THIS FEATURE ENSURE THE PHILOSOPHY OF DESIGN IS HARMONY WITH PRINCIPLES OF INCLUSIVETY AND POPULATIONS WITH DIVERSE HEALTH PROFILES EXCLUDING FEW INDIVIDUALS LOOKING FOR DIVERSITY OF SETTINGS IN WHICH THE INTERVENTION CAN BE DEPLOYED AND SO ON. IT ALSO FOCUSES ON CLINICAL END POINTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WHICH IS DR. LEYKUM AND OTHERS POINTED OUT ARE INFORMED BY INTERACTIONS WITH PATIENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS THEMSELVES AND OF COURSE IN CHOOSING FROM AMONG SUCH END POINTS THOSE THAT ARE TRACTABLE AND WIDELY AVAILABLE WHICH IN TURN DEPENDS ON DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF RESOURCES AND STRUCTURAL PRACTICALITIES THAT WERE DISCUSSED BY DR. BYNUM. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO IF IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL; THERE ARE CHALLENGES CREATING AN EXECUTING EMBEDDED PCP AND AS WE HAVE SEEN THESE COMPLEXITIES ARE INTERWOVEN AND INHABIT ALL FEATURE OF CLASSICAL TRIAL DESIGN I TRIED TO HIGHLIGHT HERE. DR. UNUTZER SAID EARLIER UNFORTUNATE WILL THE REAL WORLD IS COMPLEX AND THAT STRIKE ME AS A REASONABLE DISSTALLAGES OF SOME OF THE ISSUE S -- DISTILLATION OF WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE AND TO REVISIT A COMMENT, IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY BETTER TO CONSIDER ASPECTS WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE RIGOR RATHER THE THAN TREAT THEM AS NUISANCES TO BE AVOIDED OR IGNORED SO THAT CONTEMPORARY SOLUTIONS WHETHER TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHERWISE CAN BE BROUGHT TO BEAR AND SERVE AS VALID RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS. NEXT SLIDE. SO SOME OF THESE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES ARE IN THE AREA OF DESIGN. OFTEN BECAUSE THESE TRIALS OR INTERVENTIONS ARE APPLIED TO GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS AT LEVEL OF PRACTICE OR SYSTEM RATHER THAN INDIVIDUALS WITH INDIVIDUAL RANDOMIZATION SO CALLED CLUSTER RANDOMIZATION OR GROUP RANDOMIZATION IS NECESSARY. AND ALSO THE INTENTIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF INTERVENTIONS IN A VARIETY OF SYSTEMS OR SETTINGS MAY GIVE RISE TO HETEROGENEITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS AND INTERVENTION MAYBE MORE EFFECTIVE ONE PLACE OR AMONG ONE POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS AT ANOTHER. UNDERSTANDING HETEROGENEITY IS AN EXCELLENT GOOD THING STUDYING IT CLOSELY IS A KEY MISSION OF RESEARCH IN THIS AREA. BUT TO DO SO RIGOROUSLY REQUIRES MORE POTENTIALLY MANY MORE PARTICIPANTS AND CAREGIVERS THAT MIGHT BE SUGGESTED IN A CONVENTIONAL DESIGN SO THEREFORE THESE TRIALS SUFFER DRAMATICALLY IF DESIGN IS RESOURCE POOR. NEXT SLIDE. THESE DESIGNS MAY ALSO LEVY SPECIFIC CHALLENGES AND MEASUREMENT IMPOSED BY DESIRE TO MEASURE ACCESSIBLE PARTICIPANT IMPORTANT OUTCOMES. SO WE MAYBE RELYING ROUTINELY COLLECTED DATA, WHICH HAS A KNEETURE OF MIMICKING REAL WORLD INFORMATION GATHER MANAGE AND BEING PRACTICAL -- TRACTABLE IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS. BUT MAY HAVE HAMSTRUNG BY INABILITY TO ATTACK CERTAIN PATIENT IMPORTANT REGIMENS. NEXT SLIDE. THEY ALSO DESIGNS ALSO HAVE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF INTERPRETATION AND ANALYSIS. JUST TO SPEAK QUICKLY ABOUT SOME OF THESE, IDENTIFYING MECHANISM OF ACTION IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH EFFECTIVENESS DESIGN AND REQUIRES CLOSER STUDY. AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY CONSISTENCY ACROSS SUB POPULATIONS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE STUDIED ITSELF AND REQUIRES MUCH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES OR MORE CLOSE IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC ISSUES SPECIFIC TO CERTAIN POPULATIONS AND SETTINGS. THESE CHALLENGES PRESENT CORRESPONDING OPPORTUNITIES SO I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND A COUPLE OF MOMENTS TALKING ABOUT THOSE. IN AREA OF DESIGN, CONTEMPORARY DESIGN INNOVATION SUCH AS STEP WEDGE AND A SMART DESIGN MENTIONED EARLIER BY DR. LEYKUM ARE CONTEMPORARY INNOVATIONS THAT MAKE FOR SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON HELPING BETTER ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS WHILE PROVIDING GREATER ACCESS TO POTENTIALLY HELPFUL INNOVATION AND HELPING US GENERATE MEANINGFUL WITHIN GROUP COMPARISONS BECAUSE EACH GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL EVENTUALLY RECEIVES EITHER CONTROLLER TEAM OR INTERVENTION REGIME THAT HELPS ADDRESS POTENTIAL CLINICALS SUCH AS CONFOUNDING BY SETTING AS WELL AS OTHERS. NEXT SLIDE. SIMILARLY IF WE MAKE GOOD INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND FLEXIBLE IN DESIGN WE CAN EBB HANS QUALITY OF MEASUREMENT UNDER THE BROADER UMBRELLA OF PRAGMATISM. ESTABLISHING VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF MEASURES OBTAINED BY AD MINUTE INVESTIGATIVE DATA AND EHR AND OTHER SOURCES AS MENTIONED BY DR. BYNUM, INCLUDING CONTEMPORARY QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGIES TO MAKE SURE OUR MEASUREMENTS ARE VALID AND EXPLICIT LY APPLICABLE TO PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA AND CAREGIVERS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FINALLY I THINK A FOCUS ON INTERDISCIPLINARY ENGAGEMENT IN BRINGING ALL PARTIES TO THE TABLE AND MOST SPECIFICALLY IT'S REASSURING TO SEE FOCUS IN THIS SESSION AN OTHERS ON IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE ON PROMOTING SUCCESS INTERPRETATION AND MEASUREMENT. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FINALLY CONTEMPORARY INTERVENTIONS IN ANALYSIS AND ALSO INTERPRETATION AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF RESULTS. IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER, ANALYSES THAT EXPLICITLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BOTH PARTICIPANT AND ALSO CAREGIVER AS DYAD OR UNIT THINKING THROUGH EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS ON BOTH MEMBERS OF THE PARTNERSHIP BOTH IN THE CURRENT SITUATION AND DOWNSTREAM AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THOSE EFFECTS IS NOW A GREAT FOCUS OF WORK BY COLLEAGUE OF MINE AND OTHERS WHICH I THINK WILL DO -- WILL IMPROVE OUR PERSPECTIVE GREATLY GOING FORWARD. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO IN SUMMARY, EMBEDDED PCTs HAVE PROMISE AND TESTING NOVEL INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. BUT CERTAIN DESIGN FEATURES WHILE REQUIRING FLEXIBILITY ENROLLMENT SENDING IN ADHERENTS ARE HELPFUL IN SETTING ALSO OFFER UNIQUE METHOD LOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES. LUCKILY CON TEMPORARY DESIGN ANALYSIS IS WORKING ON SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS AND WILL BE HELP US TO BOTH (INAUDIBLE). THANK YOU. CAN ANYONE SEE ME? WE CAN SEE YOU, DAVID.  I'M DAVE WENDLER FROM DEPARTMENT OF BIOETHICS AT THE NIH CLINICAL CENTER WHO WILL DISCUSS A FEW OF THE IMPORTANT ETHICAL ISSUES THAT ARISE IN DOING RESEARCH I WORK FOR U.S. GOVERNMENT BUT HAVE REPRESENTERS SPEAK WITH UT iUS GOVERNMENT. NEXT SLIDE. OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT IS CRITICAL TO RESEARCH I'M GOING FOCUS ON TWO PRIMARY CHALLENGES. THE FIRST ONE, NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHETHER OR NOT TO PARTICIPANTS DECISIONAL CAPACITY SHOULD BE ASSESSED PRIOR TO ENROLLING IN THE STUDY AND THEN WHILE ENROLLED IN THAT STUDY. NEXT SLIDE. SO EXISTING GUIDANCE TENDS TO FOCUS IN THIS REGARD ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR LACKING DECISIONAL CAPACITY SO A REPORT FROM THE U.S. NATIONAL BIOADVISORY COMMISSION RECOMMENDED ASSESSING PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM MENTAL DISORDERS FOR INSTANCE THAT MAY AFFECT DECISION MAKING CAPACITY, INDIVIDUALS REGARDED AS SUFFICIENTLY AT RISK RECEIVE FORMAL ASSESSMENT AND OTHERS RECEIVE LITTLE IF ANY ASSESS P AT ALL. NEXT SLIDE. WHILE THIS MAKES SENSE IT RAISES A NUMBER OF CONCERNS. THE FIRST ONE IS THAT EVIDENCECAL RESEARCH DOESN'T DEPEND SIMPLY ON HAVING PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF GIVING INFORMED CONSENT, IT DEPENDS ON PEOPLE GIVING INFORMED CONSENT. SECOND IS TARGETING AT RISK GROUPS RAISES A NUMBER OF PRACTICAL CHALLENGES, HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHICH PEOPLE ARE SUFFICIENTLY AT RISK, WHAT DO YOU DO FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T SUFFICIENTLY AT RISK AND THERE'S ALSO WORRIES ABOUT STIGMATIZING THE TARGETED GROUPS. SO I'VE ADVOCATED A DIFFERENT APPROACH. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ASSESS EVERYBODY'S CONSENT TO MAKE SURE THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND THEIR GIVING VALID CONSENT TO ENROLL IN RESEARCH. DON'T DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT INDIVIDUALS GIVE INFORMED CONSENT FOR A PARTICULAR STUDY. ICE IMPORTANT TO DO WHAT'S TASK SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT, ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN GIVE INFORMED CONSENT, FOR THE SPECIFIC STUDY IN QUESTION. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. TYPICALLY THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT'S REQUIRED TO ASSESS INDIVIDUALINGS CAPACITY SHOULD BE BASED ON RISK BENEFIT PROFILE OF STUDY. GENERAL IDEA IS RELATIVELY LOW RISK AND LOW WORRY STUDIES, FAIRLY MINIMAL INFORMAL ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT, EXPLAINING THE STUDY TO AN INDIVIDUAL AND ASKING THEM WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AND WHY THEY WANT TO ENROLL IN THE STUDY. THE RISK BENEFIT PROFILE BECOMES LESS FAVORABLE TO INDIVIDUALS THERE SHOULD BE MORE FORMAL ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED TO BE SURE THEY HAVE CAPACITY IN OUR UNDERSTANDING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTANDING THEIR CONSENT CAN BE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THE TIME OF DAY, WHETHER THEY ARE COMFORTABLE IN SETTING, WHETHER THEY ARE PAYING ATTENTION, HOW WELL THE INFORMATION WAS EXPLAINED TO THEM. THAT REMINDS US THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY IS HAVING TROUBLE DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO GIVE INFORMED CONSENT. INSTEAD WE SHOULD DO TWO THINGS. PERSPECTIVELY TRY TO MAXIMIZE CHANCES OF SUCCESS, MAKE SURE WE ARE EXPLAINING IN A CLEAR WAY. MAKE SURE WE HAVE A COMFORTABLE SETTING, THAT'S NOT INTIMIDATING FOR INDIVIDUALS. SECOND IS A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT SHOWS INDIVIDUALS WHO FAIL THE FIRST TIME WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND CERTAIN CRITICAL ASPECTS CAN OFTEN ASK THAT AND UNDERSTAND IF GIVEN TARGETED REINFORCEMENT AND EDUCATION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO NOW WE HAVE DONE ASSESSMENT WE DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY CONSENT, NEXT QUESTION IS WHO SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS FOR WHO CAN'T GIVE INFORMED CONSENT. NEXT SLIDE. SO FIRST THING TO THINK ABOUT IS WHAT'S THE ETHICAL CONCERN WITH ENROLLING INDIVIDUALS INFORMED CONSENT. THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS I THINK OF POSSIBILITY OF UNWANTED RESEARCH ENROLLMENT SO THE WORRY IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO ENROLL PEOPLE WHO CAN'T CONSENT IN RESEARCH THEY THEMSELVES WOULD HAVE DECLINED TO ENROLL IN, IF THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO GIVE INFORMED CONSENT THEMSELVES. SO WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW IS WE NEED TO KNOW WHETHER INDIVIDUALS ARE WILLING TO ENROLL IN RESEARCH, IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO GIVE INFORMED CONSENT. SO RELEVANCE. WHAT IS EMERGING EMPIRICAL DATA TELL US ABOUT PEOPLE WILLSNESS IN THIS REGARD. NEXT SLIDE. THE PRIMARY LESSON IS THAT FOR THE MOST PART MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH THEY LOSE ABILITY GIVE CONSENT THEMSELVES. AND THEY ARE ALSO WILLING TO RELY ON SURROGATE TO MAKE RESEARCH ENROLLMENT AND PARTICIPATION DECISIONS FOR THEM. NOT SURPRISINGLY INDIVIDUALS WILLINGNESS TO BE IN RESEARCH SHOULD THEY LOSE THE ABILITY TO CONSENT DECREASES AS THE RISK BENEFIT PROFILE BECOMES LESS FAVORABLE. SO FOR INSTANCE, AS CHANCES FOR BENEFIT GO DOWN, AND AS RISKS GO UP, IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE MINORITY BUT THERE IS A MINORITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO PREFERS NOT TO BE ENROLLED, IN RESEARCH IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO GIVE INFORMED CONSENT. NEXT SLIDE. SO THAT'S SUGGESTION TURNS TO QUESTION OF WHO SHOULD GIVE INFORMED CONSENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN'T MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. WE NEED AN APPROPRIATE SURROGATE. AND THE SURROGATE SHOULD BE MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON THE PREFERENCES AND VERSUS OF THE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION. SO WE SHOULD ASK SURROGATE SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES DO WE HAVE SUFFICIENT REASON TO BELIEVE GIVEN PERSON CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THEM, AND THE NATURE OF THE TRIAL, WHETHER OR NOT THEY THEMSELVES WOULD ENROLL THEM IN THE TRIAL IF THEY WERE CAPABLE OF MAKING THIS DECISION. SO IF THEY IN THIS TRIAL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TYPE OF PERSON THEY ARE, THE KIND OF DECISIONS THEY MAKE FOR THEMSELVES, IT CAN BE APPROPRIATE TO ENROLL THEM. NEXT SLIDE. SO THOSE ARE THE TWO PRIMARY QUESTIONS WITH FOCUS ON, I WANT TO VERY BRIEFLY MENTION ANOTHER FEW IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT I THINK DESERVE FURTHER DISCUSSION AND ATTENTION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE FIRST ONE IS A MOVEMENT THAT HAS STARTED IN IN EUROPE IS GAINING TRACTION, IT'S SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS SUPPORTED DECISION MAKING. SO BASICALLY THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE TYPICALLY OR AT LEAST STANDARD LY DICHOTOMIES PEOPLE TO CHOSE WHO CAN GIVE INFORMED CONSENT AND THOSE WHO CAN'T GIVE INFORMED CONSENT AND NEED A SURROGATE AS I HAVE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY. THE SUPPORTED DECISION MAKING LITERATURE TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF TRYING TO PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE THAT'S NECESSARY TO ALLOW ALL INDIVIDUALS, INDEPENDENT OF THEIR LEVEL OF COGNITIVE CAPACITY, TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS, IN THIS CASE THEIR OWN RESEARCH ENROLLMENT PARTICIPATION DECISION. SO THIS RAISES THE QUESTION TO WHAT EXTENT AND WHAT WAYS CAN WE ASSIST PATIENTS WHO HAVE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT TO REMAIN DECISION MAKERS FOR THE RESEARCH. NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS A APPROACH THAT COLLEAGUE OF MINE RECOMMENDED 15 YEARS AGO, THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE DISCUSSION OF THIS THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY IN THE LITERATURE BUT IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION WHICH IS TO WHAT EXTENT IF WE IDENTIFY SOMEONE WE DO ASSESSMENT AND IDENTIFY SOMEBODY UNABLE TO GIVE INFORMED CONSENT, TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD THAT BE NOTED? WHAT EXTENT SHOULD WE EXPLAIN TO THE PERSON THAT ARE NOW REGARDED AS NOT ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISION, WHAT EXTENT SHOULD WE THEN POINT OUT THAT A SURROGATE WILL MAKE DECISIONS. THAT'S REGARDED AS PROTECTION BUT ALSO RAISES WORRIES ABOUT THE TRAUMA TO THE INDIVIDUAL. AND THE QUESTIONS CAN WE INSTEAD ENGAGE SURROGATE EARLY ON AND CONTINUOUSLY AND SEAMLESSLY INVOLVE BOTH DECISION MAKING PROCESS. MENTION SLIDE. -- NEXT SLIDE. FINALLY I FOCUSED ON AS MOST PEOPLE DO, ASSESSMENT OF THE DECISIONAL CAPACITY OF THE PATIENT. THAT RAISES THE IMPORTANT QUESTION ABOUT WHAT ABOUT ASSESSING THE SURROGATE, IF THEY ARE MAKING THE DECISION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. IT'S ALSO CRITICAL WE HAVE A PROTOCOL HERE AT THE NIH CLINICAL CENTER WHERE WE DO ASSESSMENTS OF THE SURROGATES TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND AND ARE MAKING DECISIONS APPROPRIATELY FOR DECISIONALLY INCAPACITATED PATIENTS. SO IN SUMMARY ANSWER TO OUR QUESTIONS, WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH ASSESSMENT OF DECISIONAL CAPACITY? MY VIEW IS THAT ALL RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS DECISIONAL CAPACITY SHOULD BE ASSESSED. WHETHER FORMAL OR INFORMAL AND MORE FORMAL DEPEND ON NATURE OF THE STUDY. WHO CAN MAKE DECISIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS DETERMINED TO BE UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT? AN APPROPRIATE SURROGATE USING SUBSTITUTE JUDGMENT STANDARD AS I TRIEDED TO SUGGEST NUMBER OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN IN THIS REGARD. THANK YOU.  THANKS SO MUCH TO DR. BYNUM TRAVISON AND WENDLER. FOR OTHER SESSIONS THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR AUDIENCE QUESTIONS AFTER WE PRESENT DRAFTS THE GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES. PANELISTS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. I'LL TAKE THE FIRST FIVE AND VINCE WILL TAKE THE SECOND HALF. OPPORTUNITY NUMBER ONE.

LAST ONE. NUMBER 10, TO CONDUCT RESEARCH TO GUIDE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS AND ETHICS COMMITTEES ON HOW TO FACILITATE APPROPRIATE COLLECTION OF SELF-SUPPORT DATA FROM PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND FROM THEIR CAREGIVERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE ARE READY TO GO TO PANEL IS. JOANNE DID YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE THEM?  OUR PANELS REPRESENT A BROAD PERSPECTIVE IN APPLICATION ANDIUS OF RESEARCH AND DATA. JOE CHUNG JOINS US CEREAL ENTREPRENEUR AND SBICI FUNDED ORGANIZATION TO BUILD A CAREGIVER TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. HE WILL BE FOLLOWED BY DR. CRAIG TO MASS WHO IS THE DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL DIVISION OF POPULATION HEALTH, A POSITION HE ASSUMED IN JUNE 2018 PRIOR TO THIS ROLE DR. TO MASS SERVE AS RECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF PUBLIC HEALTH PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT CDC OFFICE FOR STATE TRIBAL LOCAL AND TERRITORIAL SUPPORT. DR. MAGGI MILLER RESEARCH ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BIOSTATISTICS AND MANAGES THE SOUTH CAROLINA ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE REGISTRY WE'LL CLOSE OUT FOR PANELISTS. JOE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, I'M JOE CHUNG, I SHOULD SAY I COME FROM PRETTY DIFFERENT WORLD, I THINK THAN THE REST OF YOU. I GUESS I'M A TECH ENTREPRENEUR AT HEART, CAME STRAIGHT OUT OF MY UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE WORK AT MIT AND OFTEN STARTED LAUNCHING START UPS SO THE STORY BEHIND HOW I GOT TO BE CEO OF KENTO IS REALLY A PERSONAL ONE WHERE AFTER A COUPLE OF SUCCESSFUL ONES WE MANAGED TO TAKE COMPANY PUBLIC B, WE DID A BUNCH OF THAT, THAT WHOLE SILICON VALLEY STUFF, MANY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PSP DEMENTIA AND OVERNIGHT BECAME A CAREGIVER. AND I THINK THE QUICK STORY BEHIND THAT WAS AS FAMILY THAT HAD REALLY TREMENDOUS RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US, MY FATHER WAS A NEUROSURGEON, MY BROTHER WHO IS REALLY PRIMARY CAREGIVER WAS ALSO NEUROSURGEON, MY FATHER'S PARTNER AND MY FATHER WAS ALSO FIRST ANNUAL INVESTOR MY FIRST COMPANY SO HAD KIND OF A BIG WIND FALL OF WEALTH LATER IN HIS LIFE SO WE HAD PLENTY OF RESOURCES BEHIND TAKING CARE OF MY DAD THROUGH DEMENTIA CARE GIVING PROCESS. AND FRANKLY WE DID A TERRIBLE JOB. WE MADE EVERY MISTAKE, NOW THAT I HAVE STUDIED THIS IN MORE DEPTH I REALIZE HOW BADLY WE DID IT. AND WE STARTED IT AROUND THE IDEA THAT THERE'S SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE, SO MUCH EXPERIENCE THAT'S HAPPENING MOST CAREGIVERS AND NOBODY -- EVERYONE WHO ENDS UP MANY THIS POSITION SEEMINGLY GOES THROUGH IT ON THEIR OWN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE THOUGHT THAT WE COULD REALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT DRIVING SUPPORT AND COACHING TO THAT. SO KINTO IS CARE COACHING SERVICE FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS WITH DEMENTIA, THAT'S ITS MISSION. BUT AS ENTREPRENEUR AND BUSINESS MAN, MY MISSION IS TO FIGURE HOW TO TURN THAT INTO A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE AND HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL COMPANY THAT REACHES COMMERCIAL SCALE SO I'M A HUGE BELIEVER IN THE POWER OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE POWER OF SCALABILITY OF THESE STARTUPS TO BE ABLE TO RAPID LY REACH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND SOLVE REAL PROBLEMS THERE. SO THAT IS THE BACKGROUND BEHIND IT. DISEASE OBSERVATION FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF HOW WE MAKE THIS INTO A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE VENTURE IS AROUND UTILIZING AND MAXIMIZING THE ALIGNMENT INTEREST S BEHIND WHAT FAMILY CAREGIVERS ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THE PERSON WITH DEMENTIA AND THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND CARE SYSTEM THAT LOOKS AFTER RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR CARE AN ULTIMATELY THE COST OF THOSE C CARES. THOUGH ARE HIGHLY ALIGNED AND HASN'T BEEN EXPLOITED ENOUGH. SO THAT'S MY BACKGROUND. CRAIG.  CRAIG ARE YOU MUTED?  I AM HERE. I'M DEFINITELY HERE. THERE WE GO. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN IN WITH OUR DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES HERE. THANK YOU, JOANNE AND VINCENT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ON BEHALF OF THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. I WILL BECAUSE I'M A PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONAL I'LL TAKE THAT POPULATION BASED RESEARCH APPROACH SO THANK YOU DR. BYNUM FOR THE LOVELY SETUP, IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT WE FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING THE BURDEN OF DISEASE FOR ALZHEIMER'S AND RELATED DEMENTIA ROOKING AT THE RISK FACTORS, UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE DISPARITIES ARE AND HOW WE TRANSLATE WHAT WE KNOW WORKS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES THROUGH POLICY AND/OR PRACTICE. WE KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE ALZHEIMER'S HAS QUICKLY BECOME A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AND DISABILITY IN THE UNITED STATES. AND LIKELY IN THE WORLD. APPROXIMATELY 6 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING CURRENTLY IN THE UNITED STATES LIVING WITH DEMENTIA. AND IT COSTS US ABOUT $270 BILLION ANNUALLY TO CARE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR CAREGIVER S. MAKING THIS LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED, TYPICALLY 95% OF THE PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA OFTEN HAVE MORE THAN ONE CHRONIC CONDITION. SO THIS ADDS COMPLEXITY TO HOW WE MANAGE AND TREAT THE DISEASE. AND THAT WE RECOGNIZE AND KNOW AFRICAN AMERICANS, HISPANICS, MAYTIVE AMERICAN AND ALASKA NATIVES AND WOMEN ARE GREATER RISK FOR DEVELOPING DEMENTIA INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S. LAST POINT I WANT TO SHARE IS ONE IN THREE ALZHEIMER'S CAREGIVERS REPORT THEIR HEALTH HAS BECOME WORSE DUE TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CARE GIVING. SO AGAIN, MAKING THE IMPORTANT CASE FOR WHY THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OF SORTS AND WE ARE CERTAINLY UP AGAINST OUR ISSUES AROUND THE PANDEMIC BUT SO MUCH OF WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN COVID-19 AND THE MITIGATION STRATEGIES THAT WE ARE EMPLOYING ESPECIALLY AROUND SOCIAL ISOLATION NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THIS POPULATION AND WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO HELP TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AS WELL. I WOULD LIKE TO QUICKLY SHIFT TO MY THOUGHTS ON DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS OBVIOUS WILL I SOMETHING THAT CDC IS KNOWN FOR. WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT DATA SOURCES THAT WANT TO BROUGHT TO YOUR ATTENTION AS YOU THINK ABOUT DESIGNING YOUR POPULATION BASED OR EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES. THE BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM MEASURES TWO REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS FOR DEMENTIA, ONE IS SUBJECTIVE COGNITIVE DECLINE. AS WELL AS WE HAVE A CARE GIVING MODULE, OUR 2019 DATA WILL BE RELEASED IN SEPTEMBER SO PLEASE CHECK OUT THAT WEBSITE. WHERE YOU CAN GET DATA ON ALL 50 STATES FOR SUBJECTIVE COGNITIVE DECLINE, I BELIEVE IT'S 44 STATES THAT REPORTED DATA ON CARE GIVING. THESE DATA ARE ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING WHERE WE SHOULD BE INVESTING OUR RESOURCES AN TIME AND OBVIOUSLY N HAYNES IS ANOTHER ONE, NATIONAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION SURVEY AND IT'S ONE THAT I THINK YOU ALL ARE FAMILIAR WITH, EXAMINATION SURVEY. AND THAT'S YET ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT DATA SOURCE AND THEN YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 AND 2030 HAVE VERY CONCRETE OBJECTIVES FOCUSING ON DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S. THAT REALLY REINFORCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE PROBLEM. REGARDING BEYOND THE DATA I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT YOU CAN LOOK AT OUR WEBSITE AND FIND SOME DATA BRIEFS A Z WELL AS DATA FOR ACTION WHICH HIGHLIGHT STATISTICS I SHARED WITH YOU BRIEFLY . I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE NOW TO POLL SANE PRACTICE WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE ABOUT IN PUBLIC HEALTH, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TRANSLATE FINDINGS INTO ACTION. AND --  THANK YOU SHOULD HAVE FOR YOUR THOUGHTS. WE NEED TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PRESENTER BUT LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR Q&A RESPONSES.  OKAY.  MAGGI.  GO AHEAD. YOU ARE ON.  OKAY. HI, EVERYBODY. MY NAME IS MAGGI MILLER . AS MENTIONED I'M THE SOUTH CAROLINA ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE REGISTRY MANAGER. THAT IS WITHIN THE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA. AND I WANTED TO GIVE A LITTLE OF MY PERSPECTIVE WORKING WITH THE REGISTRY AND ALSO DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT OF GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE RELATED TO MY WORK WITH THE REGISTRY. OUR REGISTRY CAPTURES NEW DIAGNOSES OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND RELATED DEMENTIA ON A YEARRY BASIS AND WE USE 11 SOURCES OF STATEWIDE HEALTH AD MINUTE INVESTIGATIVE DATA. SO BASICALLY ANYONE WHO SEEK PROVIDESSER SERVICES WITHIN THESE SOURCES, AND IS DIAGNOSED WITH DEMENTIA THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE REGISTRY. WE OBTAIN OUR DATA FROM OUR PARTNERS AT THE SOUTH CAROLINA AFFAIRS OFFICE AND HERE STATISTICIANS CREATE UNIQUE IDENTIFIER FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL AND THAT ENABLES RESEARCHERS TO LINK ACROSS MULTIPLE PROVIDERS AND SERVICE AGENCIES. AND THESE INCLUDE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH, LAW ENFORCEMENT DATA AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AMONG MANY OTHERS. SO THIS UNIQUE IDENTIFIER ALLOWS DATA LINKAGES WHILE ALSO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AND IN ADDITION, ALL OF THE REQUESTS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE DATA OVERSIGHT COUNCIL FOR THE PARTICIPATING AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS. I JUST WANTED TO USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE, BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A VERY EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR THE STATE LEVEL AND IF WE CAN FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO LINK TO ADDITIONAL DATA FROM OTHER STATES, OR SERVE AS EXAMPLE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SIMILAR DATA WAREHOUSES IN OTHER STATES, THIS WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS THE FIRST GAP IN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS THEME THAT WAS LISTED EARLIER. THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO DEVELOP A NATIONAL REPOSITORY WITH THOSE RICH SECURE DATA TO HELP PROMOTE POPULATION LEVEL RESEARCH INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN IMPROVE THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUAL WITH DEMENTIA AND CAREGIVERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  THANKS VERY MUCH JOE, MAGGI AND GREG. WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE WHICH DAVID AND JEER FER HAVE BEEN REVIEW. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A QUESTION, ACTUALLY I HAVE ALREADY CLOSEN FOR DR. BYNUM, AND JULIE FOR YOU, HOW DO WE ESTABLISH VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF MEASURES OBTAINEDED FROM ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AND ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS? A LOT OF WORK. VERY CHALLENGING. SO HISTORICALLY WHEN WE USE AD MINUTE INVESTIGATIVE CLAIMS IT REQUIRES SOMEONE TAKING IT UPON THEMSELVES TO DO RESEARCH STUDY WHICH IS QUITE TEDIOUS, LINKING SOME SORT OF DATA SET THAT HAS OBSERVED AND MEASURED COGNITIVE STATUS. MANY THE CASE OF WHAT'S COMMONLY USED IN AT CCW WHICH IS THE CMS RESOURCE FOR THIS THIS, BASE ON HEALTH AND RETIREMENT SURVEY. ON THE ATOM STUDY BACK AROUND 2000. WE ARE ACTUALLY REPEATING THAT STUDY FOR MORE RECENT HRS DATA, TWO REASONS, WE THINK THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE LABELED WITH DEMENTIA IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND MAYBE EXPERIENCING THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN THE CLINICAL SETTING. SO THE PERFORMANCE OF CLAIMS MAY ACTUALLY HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME BECAUSE CLINICAL PRACTICE CHANGED TO MAKE THE POINT THAT I MADE BEFORE. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS ARE TRICKIER. NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO -- WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT VALIDATION OF ELECTRONIC CLAIMS -- RECORDS, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT VALIDATION OF THE ALGORITHM AGAINST A BILLING DIAGNOSIS NOT A CLINICAL ENTITY. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE RIGHT NOW. ESPECIALLY WITH THE HETEROGENEITY OF PRACTICE AND SKILL ACROSS DIFFERENT HEALTH SYSTEMS TO KNOW THAT WHEN WE ARE DOING STUDIES ACROSS DIFFERENT HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT WE ARE GETTING COMPARABLE POPULATIONS.  DAVID LOOKING TO YOU. OR JENNIFER.  YOU ARE ON MUTE.  SO THE NEXT QUESTION HAS TO DO -- A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT WERE STIMULATED I THINK IN PART BY MAGGIE'S PRESENTATION ABOUT THE HELP DEMENTIA CARE REGISTRIES. SO I'LL JUST LOOP THEM TOGETHER. SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT A NATIONAL DEMENTIA CARE REGISTRY , HOW DO YOU GENERATE AND SUSTAIN FUNDING FOR THE UK IS SECOND QUARTER DEMENTIA REGISTRY, WHAT IS THE PREVALENCE OF DEMENTIA OBSERVED IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA REGISTRY . YES. HI. WELL, ONE THING THAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT SOUTH CAROLINA IS THAT WE HAVE HAD OUR ESTABLISHED BY LAW SINCE 1990. SO WE ARE BASICALLY BY LAW ALLOWED TO HAVE SECONDARY DATA RESOURCES REPORT TO US WHERE THERE IS A DEMENTIA DIAGNOSIS. SO THERE REALLY ISN'T BUY-IN, IT'S JUST PART OF WHAT WE ARE PROVIDED AS PART OF THOSE STATUTE. SO I'M SORRY I MISSED -- WHAT WAS THE OTHER QUESTION?  THERE WERE THREE QUESTIONS. WHAT IS THE PREVALENCE OF DEMENTIA IN SOUTH CAROLINA, HAS THE REGISTRY BEEN USED TO PROVIDE INSIGHT AROUND PREVALENCE AND OTHER RELATED TO SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT A NATIONAL HEALTHCARE REGISTRY THAT VINCE AND JOANNE YOU CAN DISSEMINATE MORE BROADLY IF RELEVANT TO OTHERS. TO COMMENT ON.  YES. WITH OUR REGISTRY WE COLLECT ALL DIAGNOSES STATEWIDE SO ABLE TO CALCULATE PREVALENCE. WE EVEN LOOK AT IT BY COUNTY AS WELL. WE DO SEE VARIATIONS BY COUNTY IN TERMS OF PREVALENCE. IT DEPENDS ALSO IN TERMS OF OUR AGE GROUPS. WE LOOK AT INDIVIDUALS 65 AND OVER. I WOULD SAY AVERAGE PREVALENCE CAN BE AROUND -- ANYWHERE FROM TWO AND A HALF TO MAYBE THREE AND A HALF PERCENT IN THE POPULATION. OR IF WE LOOK AT OUR 85 AND OVER POPULATION, IT COULD BE AS MUCH AS 10% OR MORE. SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. RIGHT NOW WE ARE CURRENTLY -- WE HAVE DATA FROM 2016 AND IN SOUTH CAROLINA WE HAVE OVER 100,000 INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA OR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. SO I KNOW WE HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY THE -- KIND OF THE CONTACT FOR DEVELOPING REGISTRIES, BOTH NATIONALLY AND ENTERGNASH MILLIONLY. AND THERE ARE -- INTERNATIONALLY. THERE'S THREE REGISTRIES CURRENTLY WE KNOW OF WITHIN U.S., THERE'S ONE IN WEST VIRGINIA, ONE IN GEORGIA AND WE HAVE ONE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND WE ARE ABSOLUTELY, I MEAN, DEFINITELY EXCITED OF THE THOUGHT OF HAVING A NATIONAL REGISTRY DEVELOPED. WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STANDARDIZE AND GET EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE IN ALL THE STATES, INVOLVED.  SO I'M GOING TO ASK JULIE AND THEN PERHAPS DAVID TO COMMENT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.  YEAH, ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING LISTENING TO THE STATE, REGISTRY PREVALENCE NUMBERS, THAT'S MUCH, MUCH LOWER THAN EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES WE EXPECT. THAT SPEAKS TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF USING DATA SETS BASED ON PEOPLE ACCESSING HEALTH SYSTEMS AND GETTING LABEL WITH THE DISEASE OR NOT. AND WE EXPECT THE PREVALENCE HIGHER THAN THAT, 8, 9% AS WE GO INTO THESE OLDER GROUPS. AND WONDERFUL TO HAVE THE REGISTRY AND IT'S ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR POLICY PLANNING AND SERVICES PLANNING. IT'S HARDER FOR ACTUALLY STUDYING BURDEN OF DISEASE BECAUSE I WOULD GUESS THAT AS WE DO A GREAT JOB OF ADVERTISING THE SERVICES AVAILABLE AND PROVIDING BETTER SERVICES, MORE PEOPLE COME FORWARD TO GET THOSE SERVICES. AND MAYBE CRAIG CAN BUILD ON THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THAT CONCEPT AND ACTUAL BURDEN OF DISEASE OF THE POPULATION LEVEL.  HAPPY TO JUMP IN, THANK YOU. SO YES, DEFINITELY I MEAN CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL WE ARE ABOUT A POPULATION BASED SURVEY SO VR POSSESSES A LINK TO THAT. I SENT A LINK TO SHONDRA THAT I SHARED TODAY. YOU MENTIONED THIS EARLIER IN YOUR PRESENTATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF REALLY I THINK THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE PURPOSE AND INTENT OF YOUR STUDY IS AND MAKING SURE THAT IN SOME WAY YOUR BASELINE IS ALIGNED IN SOME WAY TO WHAT WE ARE PURPORTING AT LEAST AT NATIONAL LEVEL. SO THAT IS A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE. AT THE STATE LEVEL ACROSS ALL 50 STATES. WE ROLE IT UP TO PROVIDE THAT NATIONAL ESTIMATE OF SIX MILLION CURRENTLY AND THAT IS ALWAYS CHANGING SO THE 2019 DATA WILL PROVE EVEN I THINK INCREASE AS WE GO FORWARD. SO THANK YOU.  THIS IS VINCE, DAVID, DO YOU WANT TO COMMENT FROM THEETHICS ISSUE ON CONSENT AS RELATES TO THE LAW? AND WHAT'S THE BALANCE THERE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CONSENT AND RESEARCH VERSUS A LEGAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH NEED FOR LARGE ESTIMATE.  I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE LAW. I DON'T KNOW THE LAW. I'M NOT A LAWYER. FROM AN ETHICS PERSPECTIVE , I WOULD THINK -- SUGGESTED AD LITTLE BIT IS THAT ONCE PEOPLE SEE THE VALUE OF THESE EFFORTS THEY TEND TO BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THEM. SO I WOULD THINK IN GENERAL MAKING THESE THINGS OPTIONAL BUT POINTING OUT TO PEOPLE THE VALUE OF THEM WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO GET PEOPLE TO ENROLL BUT I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A HISTORY IN SOUTH CAROLINA THAT LED TO THE APPROACH THEY ARE TAKING AND IF SO, I WOULD BE CURIOUS HOW IT'S GOING, IF THERE'S BEEN ANY PUSH BACK ON THAT.  BUILDING ON THIS LINE OF DISCUSSION, A QUESTION THAT CAME UP IS HOW LARGE POPULATION BASED SURVEYS CAN BE IMPROVED TO CAPTURE SEVERITY OF DEMENTIA.  JULIE, YOU SPENT ENOUGH TIME WITH HRS. DO YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A SHOT? I CAN COMMENT AS WELL. NATIONAL HEALTH AGING TREND STUDIES. I TRIED TO ALLUDE TO THAT AT THE END OF MY TALK, I STRUGGLE WITH THIS MYSELF. DIFFERENT AREAS, THE DRUG STUDIES TALK ABOUT SEVERITY IN TERMS OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION BUT SOMETIMES WHEN WE ARE IN DIFFERENT VENUES WHICH ARE WORRIED ABOUT BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS OR FUNCTIONAL STATUS SO EXACTLY WHAT WE MEAN BY SEVERITY IS CHALLENGING FOR ME. WHEN I DO THINGS FROM A HEALTH POLICY POINT OF VIEW, I OFTEN USE THINGS LIKE ARE THEY LIVING IN A SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. ARE THEY COMMUNITY DWELLING ASSISTED LIVING OR NURSING HOME AS SOME WAY TO AT LEAST GET GENERAL CATEGORIES. SO WE CAN DO MEASURES, I THINK THE ISSUE OF HARMONIZING ACROSS VARIOUS DIFFERENT N HATS AND HRS AND CDC MEASURES SO WE ARE NOT COMING UP WITH ALL SEPARATE MEASURES , SOFT SEVERITY OR STAGING FOR THESE POPULATION, THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.  ANOTHER QUESTION THAT HAS COME IN IS THOUGHTS ABOUT EVALUATING IMPACTS OF DEMENTIA FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES.  I'M NOT SURE WHOM ARE -- MAYBE WE'LL ASK TOM AS THE METHOD DOLL GIST AND BIOSTATISTICIAN , HOW DID THAT FIT INTO THE PRAGMATIC TRIALS HOW ONE EVALUATES DEMENTIA FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES EMERGING ACROSS THE COUNTRY?  I WOULD ALSO ADD ALSO THINKING IMPLEMENTATION AND PROGRAMMATIC SIDE, WONDERING FROM CRAIG AT THE C FIRST QUARTERC AS YOU FUND THESE THINGS, HOW ARE YOU EVALUATING THOSE TYPES OF DEMENTIA CAPABLE COMMUNITIES AS WELL?  HAPPY TO GO FIRST, OR TOM YOU WERE GOING TO SAY SOMETHING.  JUMP IN BRIEFLY THEN LET YOU GO BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY HAVE MORE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE. I WAS GOING TO SAY VINCE, AND TO THE QUESTIONER THAT IN A WAY A LOT OF THE PRAGMATIC TRIAL PRINCIPLES REMIND ME A LOT OF CLASSIC PUBLIC HEALTH STYLES TRIALS, WHERE WE SPENT DECADES TRYING TO GET RID OF THE EXTRA SOURCES OF VARIATION AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SUB POPULATIONS AND MAKING EVERYBODY HOMOGENOUS TO TEST LABORATORY INTERVENTION AND NOW WE ARE UNWINDING THAT. SO I THINK THOSE -- THESE PRINCIPLESES THAT I TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT I'M NOT EXPERT IN, COULD APPLY FOR LARGE SCALE COMPARISONS OF ONE COMMUNITY TO THE OTHER. BUT WE ARE JUST FOUGHT WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT I TRIED TO MENTION. BUT GOOD NEWS IS THERE ARE REALLY WONDERFUL PEOPLE MUCH SMARTER PEOPLE THAN I WORKING ON THESE PROBLEMS AS WE SPEAK. CRAIG GO AHEAD.  THANK YOU. I WOULD SAY WE HAVE SOME EXCITING NEWS AND BY NO MEANS DO I HAVE A QUICK ANSWER FOR YOU ON THAT, IT IS VERY COMPLEX. BUT WE ARE VERY EXCITED, THE HOUSE LANGUAGE CURRENTLY IS FOCUSED ON BUILDING AN AGE FRIENDLY HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE FUNDING TO STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES TO SUPPORT AGE FRIENDLY AND DEMENTIA FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES. THAT WILL REQUIRE THOSE DOLLARS WILL REQUIRE A STRONG EVALUATION APPROACH, OBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD BE A FEDERAL EFFORT WORKING CLOSELY WITH STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS. WE ALSO JUST RECENTLY RELEASED FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOLD WHICH IS FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON BOLD ACT FOR ALZHEIMER'S -- THAT WAS PASSED IN 2018. THIS IS SPECIFICALLY STAND UP TWO THINGS. ONE, FUNDING TO THE STATES, STATE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BUILDING BOLDER ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND TWO, FOR DEVELOPING CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE GAPS OR OPPORTUNITY AREAS, FOCUSING MORE ON SPECIFICALLY ON THREE AREAS, RISK REDUCTION, CAREGIVER NEEDS, AND THEN EARLY DETECTION. SO THOSE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN SEEKING ADVANCING WORK AND CLEARLY AS THIS INFRASTRUCTURE COMES IN AND RESOURCES COME INTO PLAY, LOOK FOR EXAMPLES IN OTHER HEALTH PREVENTION PROBLEMS LIKE HIV WHERE THERE'S DECADES OF WORK DONE IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY INVESTMENT HOW WE CAN EVALUATE IMPACT AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT WILL BE BORROWING FROM LESSONS LEARNED FROM OTHER PROGRAM AREAS TO EVALUATE WHAT WILL BE COMING OUR WAY. . SO IT'S EXCITING BUT I DON'T HAVE A SHORT ANSWER FOR YOU ON THE SPECIFICS AROUND EVALUATION.  MAY I ADD ONE COMMENT? ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE TALK NATIONAL STUDIES AND WHAT I HAVE FOUND IS THAT WONDERFUL NATIONAL TO GIVE NATIONAL WEIGHT BUT THEY GENERALLY DON'T COVER ANY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREA WITH ENOUGH POPULATION TO LOOK AT OUTCOMES IN A SUBGROUP WHETHER THAT'S DEMENTIA GROUP OR HIV GROUP OR WHICHEVER GROUP YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE THOUGH I SAID THESE NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT CLAIMS DATA, WHY PEOPLE REACH TO THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A TRUE DENOMINATOR OF EVERY GEOGRAPHY IN THE UNITED STATES AT LEAST. AND THAT GIVES YOU AT LEAST SOME SORT OF PLATFORM TO UNDERSTAND SMALLER GEOGRAPHIES COMPARING PROGRESS IN SMALL AREAS. IT REALLY IS NOT POSSIBLE BY ANY OTHER MECHANISM LESS OUR DIGITAL PLATFORMS CAN HELP US WITH THAT.  IF I MAY JULIE, THAT'S ALSO A REALLY IMPORTANT AREA FOR GROWTH FOR US. WE ARE -- WE HAVE A SOLID METHODOLOGY FOR DEVELOPING SMALL AREA ESTIMATE USING OUR NATIONAL ESTIMATE TO GET AT LOCAL LEVEL EVEN CENSUS TRACK LEVEL, THOSE DATA WILL BE ROLLED OUT DECEMBER 2019. SO WE ARE HOPING THAT HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES BUT BY NO MEANS IS IT CURE ALL, JUST GETTING TO LOCAL -- THAT'S ALIGNING VERY NICELY WITH THE NATIONAL ESTIMATE AS WELL AND OTHER SURVEYS SO WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS BUT NO IS THE ANSWER THE SILVER BULLET.  RIGHT. LAST QUESTION, WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME BUT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CASE THAT CAME IN THAT RELATE TO INCLUSION CRITERIA. SO CAN YOU COMMENT ON CLINICAL STUDY INCLUDING CRITERIA THAT INVOLVE IN PARTICULAR REQUIRING A CARE PARTNER TO PARTICIPATE IN STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING THIS BARRIER FOR PARTICIPATION OF THOSE LIVING WITH THE DISEASE, MAY NOT HAVE OR WANT CARE PARTNER PARTICIPATION AND THERE WAS ANOTHER QUESTION WHAT IF A PERSON WHO WAS WITH DEMENTIA, DOES NOT HAVE CAPACITY TO CONSENT, SO LEGALLY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE CONSENTS AND THE PERSON WITH DEMENTIA SAYS NO. SO TWO RELATED QUESTIONS AROUND IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AREN'T CONSENT.  DAVID PLEASE. JOANNE DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT?  NO I THINK DR. WENDLER IS PERFECT. THANK YOU.  I'LL START WITH THE NUMBERS. I'LL START WITH THE SECOND QUESTION OF WHAT SHOULD WE DO WHEN THE SURROGATE OR LEGALLY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE ENROLES SOMEBODY IN THE STUDY, THE INDIVIDUAL THEMSELVES SAYS NO. THE FIRST CHALLENGE S THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A NO MEANS IN THIS SETTING. NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WE HAD A WOMAN IN LONGITUDINAL STUDY FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WHO KEPT SAYING SHE WANTED TO GO HOME AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS FROM THE RESEARCH AND HER HUSBAND TOOK HER HOME AND FOUND OUT ONCE YOU GOT HOME SHE SAT IN HER FAVORITE CHAIR AND SAID SHE WANTED TO GO HOME. SO CLEARLY SHE WASN'T DISSENTING FROM BEING IN THE STUDY, SHE WAS JUST BOTHERED ABOUT OTHER THINGS. SO FIRST CHALLENGE IS FIGURING WHAT CONSULTATION INSTITUTES THE CONSENT. SECOND, TO FIGURE OUT TO WHAT EXTENT THERE'S PROBLEMS THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED . PROBLEMS WITH STUDY, WITH THE SETTING THAT CAN BE ALLEVIATED THAT ARE CAUSING DISTRESS. THE THIRD IS TO LOOK AT THE RISK AND BENEFITS OF STUDY, PARTICULARLY THE STUDY THAT OFFERS VERY LITTLE POTENTIAL BENEFIT THEN I THINK DISSENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DEFINITIVE AND PERSON SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF STUDY. IF SOME DAY WE'LL HAVE GREATER ETHICAL DILEMMAS WHEN WE DEVELOP TREATMENTS FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND THEN WE MIGHT FACE CHALLENGE WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD KEEP PEOPLE IN. IF TAKING THEM OUT DENIES ACCESS TO POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL TREATMENT. THAT'S A LONG WAY OFF BUT HOPEFULLY NOT THAT FAR OFF. THEN BACK TO THAT ONE.  IF I COULD JUMP IN TEN OR 30 SECONDS FIRST QUESTION. IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE STUDIES THAT INVOLVE CARE PARTNERS BE SUPPORT THOSE STUDIES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT BECOMING SO DEEPLY ENTANGLED ON THEM THEY RELY ON THEM AN DISINCLUDE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACTIVE CARE PARTNER SO CRITICAL TO KEEP OUR EYE ON.  THANK YOU. IT IS NOW TIME FOR US TO TURN TO OUR CLOSING REMARKS. I WANT TO THANK THE TERRIFIC PRESENTATIONS AND PANELISTS FOR SESSION 6 AND WELCOME DAVID RUBIN BACK AS WE CLOSE OUT THE SESSION.  BRINGING US TO THE CLOSE OF OUR FINAL VIRTUAL MEETING OF THE NATIONAL RESEARCH SUMMIT. I WANT TO THANK THE STEERING COMMITTEE THEME LEADERS, PRESENTERS, PANELIST, VERY IMPORTANTLY THE NIA STAFF, ELENA JESSICA AND COURTNEY WALLEN WHO HAVE MADE THIS SUMMIT SO SUCCESSFUL AND STIMULATING. I WANT TO THANK THOSE OF YOU WHO JOINED IN ON TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY AND LISTENING AND POSING QUESTIONS. NEXT SLIDE. THE PRESENTATION SLIDES AND VIDEO RECORDING OF TODAY'S MEETING WILL BE POSTED ON THE SUMMIT WEBSITE WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO OF TODAY. WE WANT TO MAKE A LAST PLUG THAT WE WELCOME AND ENCOURAGE INPUT INTO THE PROCESS THROUGH REQUEST FOR INFORMATION WHICH WILL BE USED AS WE REFINE ORGANS AND OPPORTUNITIES. THIS LINK ON THE SLIDE FOR THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION WILL REMAIN OPEN AND LIVE THROUGH AUGUST 20TH FOR YOUR FEEDBACK AND INPUT. I'M GOING TO -- NEXT SLIDE, TURN IT OVER TO DAVID REUBEN FOR THE LACEWORK. LAST WORD. WE ARE NOT DONE YET, WE ARE A LONG WAYS TOWARDS GETTING DONE. IN SEPTEMBER THE SUMMIT STEERING COMMITTEE IS GOING TO GET BACK TOGETHER AGAIN, LOOK AT THE REQUISITIONS AND TRY TO FINALIZE THESE. THE IDEA THEY WOULD BE GOING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING AND WE ANTICIPATE THESE WILL BE RELEASED IN EARLY 2021 TO PUBLIC CONSUMPTION. THEN THE HARD WORK BEGINS TRANSLATING GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES INTO MILESTONES, TRANSLATING TO RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES AND DOING THE RESEARCH. SO JUST TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE. THIS WAS NOT WHAT WE ANTICIPATED, WE ANTICIPATED BEING DONE IN THE END OF MARCH AND WE JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR HANGING IN THERE WITH US. I THINK IN THE END WE CAME UP WITH A GREAT PRODUCT AND THAT WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE, THE SPEAKERS WHO ARE FLEXIBLE, THE NIA STAFF AND MY COLLEAGUE IN CRIME JENNIFER WOLF. THANKS, EVERYBODY, AND NEXT TIME.
