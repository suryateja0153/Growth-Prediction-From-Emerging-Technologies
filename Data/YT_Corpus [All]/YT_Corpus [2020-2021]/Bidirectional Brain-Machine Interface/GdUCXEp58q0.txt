 hi everyone today we are going to talk about Java and Python this question has actually never found a solution when I'm talking about Python and Java you can think of them like Messi and Ronaldo the competition is high but only between the two this is how Java and Python are they are quite old enough but their walls are comprising of matured and time-tested libraries so how are they differ by behavior being the compiling language Java had a great advantage by both I generally feel more confident when writing codes on compiling languages once it compiled it stands and delivers like a rock this is the advantage that Java carries on its heart and this feature is attracting the software tycoons to choose Java as its primary language also Java and its sister scalar are very suitable for banking sectors yeah what about Python Python has deliberately decided to be a dynamic programming language as being dynamic Python has both advantages and problems when it comes to scripting Python is the Beast but this dynamic behavior may cause unchecked and unexpected errors something like assigning a string value to an integer datatype at runtime yeah that's a problem as compiled the language Java had converted to bytecode on the process of compiling itself running bytecode is faster than anything as an added advantage you don't have to maintain this source code in your app service as Python is a dynamic language you need to maintain this source code which on executing gets interpreted into byte code so this conversion from source code to bytecode only happens at the runtime which makes it seriously slow to compile the languages clearly Java won the game here so Java is better than Python as Java is a static language you have to define the datatypes before compiling the presence of data types in the source code makes it much more documented this has a very big advantage especially when you are working on a multi developer projects static languages are so much helpful in debugging as you always know the exact return type and the parameter type Python losses this advantage as being dynamic the code maintenance is not easy in Python especially when you are working on bigger projects from Python 3.6 it allows to use type-ins in the source code and there are several libraries like my PI are available to perform the type checking like a sample compiling but this will not enforce any new behavior this is just like a comment in the source code so Java wins this round Python with its syntax feels much more like an English word so you don't feel much strangled when you have just started to learning programming then my words for you guys is start with Python name is chosen by Python ecosystems are so simpler for a beginner thank God but Java will test your patience in this there namings are alienated when compared to Python in a funny note you can say that Java is not for children no strictly prohibited but once you get through the stuff phase then there will not be any more problems in Java also Python is easy to get started compared to most programming languages out there setting up the environment for Python is much easier than Java then any programming languages actually at last Python wins for the very first time both Java and Python has well matured libraries in most cases when you have a library in Python you can also find its counterpart in Java their communities are well grown and their libraries are time tested 90% of the time you can find answers for your doubts on Google so this is a type being the dynamic language Python has everything for scripting so python can be very much useful in networking in some areas even it can replace the same scripting and Java is all changing now from Java 9 onwards you will get a REPL support for Java one of the long requests of the Java community and finally, Oracle heard it but in anyways Java will not be suitable for scripting maybe it's another sister groovy will help you in this clearly Python wins in scripting both Java and Python has an equal amount of the frameworks out there to support your applications and needs python has the Django an MVC based web framework that has everything from authentication to ORM it is so easy that you can get started in an hour it has very simple and clear documentation in a word the Django is a framework that every startup desires I can talk about the jungle all day which itself is a separate topic Python also has flask, bottle, soap, turbo gears and more frameworks Java has bring this table framework which is much suitable for an enterprise industry, Spring is like the Big Brother for the Django spring has everything but it is not as easy as the jungle when you start off with spring you may end up with a suicide note so leave it for another day my friends Java also have hibernate Struts, Play and Gradle as a builder tool but all of them feels bit old fashioned but enterprise-level and much stable if you are startup Python is the best but when you grow as an enterprise Java will give you a big hand you can say that Instagram is a bigger company with more traffic but is still using the Django but why Twitter moved it to Java is also thinkable. You can do Android development in Python but Java is uncomfortable and native, there is no much discussion needed here. Java wins the election with a huge margin, Python beats Java in machine learning in the same origin as Java big python in android more than 50% of the enterprise's are using python for machine learning you know Java will be around only some 10 to 15 percentage in this domain python has more libraries and free then Java for machine learning more importantly you can rarely find a resource for learning machine learning in Java but Python is a sea. So Python is the ruler of machine learning. When it comes to big data you have to choose either Hadoop or Spark but Spark is faster and popular nowadays both of them is written in java Similiar environments Hadoop is actually written in Java and spark is built-in Scala. It also runs on JVM. Both of these tools depend on JVM for its core but as a surprise you will find more resources and libraries for Python than Java you have viewed this long video with much patience so I won't disappoint you by drawing this battery so my solution is for an application server Java is the best for enterprise companies and Python will ease out the pain for startups for machine learning and DAL python is the one lead size and the best for Android and Java for big data Python for analysis and Java powers the increment but in my opinion every developer should be ready to script at any time so if you are a Java developer I insist on learning the basics of Python for scripting combining the powers of Java and Python you can do magics so thank you guys I hope this video was helpful to you and I will
