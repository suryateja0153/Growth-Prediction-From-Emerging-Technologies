 hey guys it's John Kevitz from Acquire Liberty thanks for spending some time with me here today. I want to show you some opportunities to work from home some people will contact me they aren't looking for home-based business they don't want that burden or that what they look at is like a you know too much work all they want to do is do a little work from the home get paid from a company and that have to worry about you know commuting to a place of a place of work they just want to stay at home and have a little part-time or full-time job and make a living that way that's a great that's fine so what I'm gonna do and what I did do is I looked up you know I just typed it in the search engine for you basically and it came up with you know the top 100 companies to work for if you want a remote job and you want to work from home right anybody can apply for these jobs anybody can do it here's the list there's actually a hundred companies I'm gonna give you the top ten and the reason I'm gonna do that from the most reliable they've been around the longest they pay is the most consistent in the best and that's what you want to start off at worst right so you start off with that and you're way to go I mean that's ten companies I'm gonna give you right apply for the ten companies see which one fits you best and go for it the first one or should I say number ten working solution jobs now this one here this basically is a call from home virtual assistant kind of deal I didn't join the community because I have no desire to join the community I don't want their emails but if I were you when I was looking for a virtual assistant position or a customer service position from home all you got to do here is just sign in you log in to their website right you log in on your Facebook Google LinkedIn or Microsoft account there's all your options most people are gonna use their Facebook account click gimme you know log in with your Facebook account boom you're in the community you can find all kind of jobs they have to offer you know usually like I said it's virtual assistant customer service you could take care of cleanings claims work anyone has claims disputes or anything like that I'm sure you get all that information in there it's called working solutions jobs so type that into your search engine and boom it'll come right up you'll see this page right here that was number ten number nine Dell computers everyone's heard of Dell computers right well they have you know a section or division of people who work from home for them and basically that's customer service another customer service you know you're always getting those people you know you could be one of those people you have a problem with their canoe Dell computer you want to call up you want you need technical assistance so you have a billing issue or you know there was a mistake on something you need to get it fixed you could be one of those people that worked in customer service or customer support for Dell and helping people out and I think that's great because you're working from home you're working from a reputable company and you're probably making pretty good pay I mean for working at home right so you're probably in between that nine to fifteen dollar range for Dell so let's just say 10 11 bucks no don't take me you know kind of Crete here it's just an educated guess it's a fairly big company I can't see them you know going down to the lowering completely so you should look into that now what you want to do is go to Dell comm right all you want to do is go for our opportunities and then in the bottom of our opportunities you see I clicked our opportunities here scroll down a little bit and you'll see on the right hand side work flexibility at Dell okay now let me see here I'll show you real quick our opportunities click right and then you will scroll down here and it's right here flexible work opportunities you can search the job see if anything's available in your area yada yada yada but it wouldn't hurt to just apply in the first place that's my opinion I just say throw your name at all and see what sticks we're throwing it up against the wall they say and see what sticks I would do all ten just try it out number eight sites this company here is all about virtual assistants so it's basically means you're applying to work for somebody else and that means you're gonna do a lot of their office work you're gonna do research further you know you're gonna maybe take some of their phone calls it's a really good job these guys have been around a long time they've got a good reputation so if you want to be somebody's virtual assistant right this is where you want to go this is the place and look at here helping through customer service so your virtual assistant positions you have customer service positions so you can't and the best thing I like about this is vision dental and health pay benefits that's phenomenal and from one house all right here I don't know if I could find it for you now I think it's under the FAQ but if you only work 20 hours a week which is considered part time in their book you're still eligible for health benefits dental and vision that's phenomenal you're working 20 hours a week on a part-time job you're working from home and you're still getting benefits that's why these guys are in the top ten but that's up for you guys to decide a go here go to this website going into careers right tells you everything you need to do how to apply where you can go there you go apply online today United States in Canada obviously if you're in the United States here Canada here right easy peasy okay what we do one two three we're on seven language line solutions now these guys are basically translators okay now there's gonna be a little rough for some people like my wife is Laotian right so she could probably get on here if she speaks you know she speaks Laos in English you could probably get out here get a translator job for someone who maybe he's just coming to America and help these people out translate you know and adapt you know to whatever they need to do as far as documentation is concerned or whatever I don't remember where I saw the amount but for some reason I was on here kind of doing a little digging on it and for some reason I saw it's like three something a minute you make which isn't bad a minute so that's not bad but like I said this isn't gonna apply to most people just some people who have that you know ability to speak two languages and have that talent and all that kind of stuff so something you should look into and its language line solutions and and the website is language line comm but like I said you could just google it it'll come right up for you the next one T Tech and you can just type in T Tech like you see right here to get in there or you can go to T tech jobs comm now I don't think anything came up when I typed in my area code but this is for the whole United States and I believe you can actually apply anyway so if you apply the first moment that something is available in your area you will be notified now this here is basically technical support all that kind of stuff you're offering to people now and I'm saying all these things the technical support you like what kind of technical support John they work for a whole bunch of different companies and you would be hired to work with a specific company and you would be trained how to handle those phone calls okay so it's not that difficult it's not that hard takes a little bit of effort on your part but if you want to stay home you don't want to work from home and have to deal with the boss directly anymore and just do your thing you know I have to worry about driving your car to the ground and going back and forth community to work these are the kind of things you got to take a little bit of effort a little bit of Nishat 'iv and if you really want something bad enough I say you could do it I mean so just keep that in mind as you're kind of going through here oh man oh there's any jobs you go I'm gonna bother hey you want to open up as many doors as you possibly can for opportunity so I'm giving you 10 you know websites here that are gonna give you that opportunity or possibility of opportunity so just go for it um okay what do we got here one two three four five we are halfway here is number five LiveOps dot-com go to this website you can click right here boom become an agent do great things from home as a live la paging live la pops agent you can work from home in quite place there's a scheduling at work flexible time and it tells you all this fun stuff in here it gives you a chart here on live ops how much weekly earnings potential you can have now they're telling you basically right here is a part-time position 20 hours a week 225 hours a week you're looking at 250 30 hours a week a looking at 300 bucks right and that's probably before taxes are taken out so that's what I don't even know I'm a calculator for me but I don't know what that is an hour it's not a ton of money but if you're looking for a $300 extra month when I work 30 hours a week and you're working from home go for it probably personally 20 hours a week for 200 bucks that's probably more my speed if you wanted to do something part-time make a little extra chin you know cash so that is live ops comm okay and now I'm under join live ops calm and they'll tell you you know work from home call center jobs so this is another good one and obviously it's my number five so it's obviously a pretty good company to work for stable reliable consistent pay all that kind of stuff so there you go now the next one is called rebel but rev.com revs:1882rpm to do you're gonna listen to audio and you're gonna have to type that all in and make a document for probably a word document of some something of that nature so basically you're your transcripting any kind of audio or video that you have to sit there and listen to and you have to type it into your keyboard now to make any kind of money I think you got to be a pretty quick type ER and you got to be accurate you have to be good but down here it gives you an idea what you're gonna be paying so so see it's not a lot depending on what the audio is you get 40 cents per audio minute so I mean if you're have you ever had if you've ever done piece work you get paid for however much you what you you know basically produce if you could type pretty fast make 40 cents a minute and you're going and you're pretty accurate you can make a ton of money doing this but this kind of gives you an idea of the pay rates and what you can be expecting and all that kind of stuff you can't even work doing you know putting subtitles on videos as it says here or a captioner you know putting the words at the bottom of the videos and whatnot for a whole series on a video that kind of tells you where you get paid now I'm sure if someone's involved with this you could probably make a ton of money doing this if you know the right kind of programs to you and this that and the other thing but it's a great option it's number four on the list I say try it the next one here is conduit now counter using digital technology stream link link claims and management okay this one here these guys deal with insurance companies these guys here you would need training but with training being needed I'm sure that you probably would get paid more but if you want to be a you know a work from home agent with this company it's about insurance claims and you're probably asking questions on people's claims and this thing the other thing which I said requires some training which is okay you wanted work from home it's a real job you're gonna need training go for it's another option and this one everybody should be familiar with who watches my videos because when I did my video on web search web search analyzer and social media you know advisor or strategist to researcher this is one of the top websites where you can get online jobs okay and what you want to do is go to join jobs or job opportunities become an agent and its joint apron calm okay and here you would find a whole bunch of jobs a social media evaluator web search evaluator those are the kind of jobs these guys are at the top of top of the heap here they're number two because they are reliable they do pay and they have a good reputation so aping if you don't want to learn more about that web search evaluate your video and I'll put it up there in the card and the right upper right-hand corner for you to click on and you can check that one out and

know your grammar you have to know how to teach you have to explain things to people people want to learn English the English language you would think you would have to deal with a lot of people who are just coming to the country or relatively new or have been here for a while and don't really have a good grasp on the English language but when you join this site if you want to apply for the position of the job of being a teacher to teach English online yuuup I have to go through a rigorous amount of testing it's the biggest hassle but it's the most reward obviously with 14 to 22 dollars an hour and working from home I mean you really can't be the dad but that's number one it's been around forever it has the best reputation I guess everyone here from what I've read is phenomenal so
