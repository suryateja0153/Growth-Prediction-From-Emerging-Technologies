 Steamies did not want to give us access to our patients data who had already consent yeah yeah I think of about there's a decentralized approach which you mentioned which is each person should be able to get their records and hopefully a format that could be passed on to somebody else then you can say okay well I got my CPAP records that got my my 23andme record and I got these three other things and someone's asking me to be a participant in a research project I'm like being Bingbing here's my here's my format and you can now have permission to study it have clinicians look at it and come up with better ideas so I think it's a good two-pronged approach one is like you bring all these big data sets together it's like oh that sounds hard right or you say you know everyone you know take take responsibility it wants to make a difference and get the portable data so that then they can pass them along to the right groups that they want to pass along to yeah I'm very healthy right now knock on wood and I know that as a as a health care ecosystem we're trying to move towards interoperability but I really do believe that interoperability will happen well after I'm dead there are too many egos there are too many empires and there's frankly a hell of a lot of money wrapped up in our health care system I haven't gotten fired yet and so we can all drive towards interoperability because I think it's probably the right thing to do and there's momentum there but we can have portability now and then we again I don't know how each of you feel but I know that in the disease community typically we feel like there's not a lot of control and so we try to control what we can control if we control our own data and we get to choose who we want to share it with what organizations we feel are doing that deep learning that's going to come up with that next treatment that better treatment or the c-word a cure it's incredibly empowering and I and I think it's really I don't think it's a pipe dream pun intended what's the question on that site what is a format that you know it's or do we have to invent the format for their personal records so there is there are records kept in all different forms and formats and so when we grab data from individuals or you know individuals send data to kind of store in in their citizen profile we take it hopefully in electronic format although if it's sent to us in paper format we scan it in so we actually have a machine learning component that's going through it's a combination of OCR but it's also I don't know how many of you are familiar with codes you know ICD codes and sno-med codes and things like that we we're trying to play with the taxonomy that exists in order to kind of get to sameness and so we're not going to drive interoperability but what we are going to do is kind of bring all of that data in and and give it a structure so that it can be computable by by other groups it needs a structure and it needs to be cleaned from what we've seen from a lot of the raw data form with the data from the consumer apps and honestly that it's not just a wearables or device problem when you have a health record different doctors call different things you know you can have a heart attack or you can have a mic article infraction it's the same thing but obviously we have to teach systems to recognize those things as as the same and I think the other key point to the the AI conversation that's so prevalent since we were the first research capable connected to the IBM Watson health is that it's one thing to have AI it is you still need the human input to design the questions that design the product to design the device more importantly to ask the question yeah so healthcare is the only industry in the world that doesn't bring the end user in to the beginning of the conversation that the design and that is sort of one of the think the key things especially with in in med school that was your badge of honor how much could you do when it's little sleep so breaking that mentality of itself is a humongous effort that we're pushing up that 800-pound boulder we're pushing it uphill right now because it's it's the it's the younger doctors that hopefully are starting to appreciate if I get my sleep I'm gonna make less errors and I'm gonna take better better care of my patients and they're gonna have better outcomes the the irony and all that is I think healthcare recognizes that sleep is critically important right we hear me I was asleep we hear all of the developmental stages and home you know how much sleep you need we are we call ourselves or we say that we exist within a healthcare system but we are in an illness based system we are not a wellness preservation system and so again just being here for a few hours I'm realizing how core this group is just so many other communities that are affected by disease because ultimately that's what we tell every disease community you know you need to need to take your medicine you need to eat right you need to get exercised and you need to sleep and if you start to take some of those pillars out we're in the same mess that we're in right now I'll absolutely agree if they're hearing from both of you this group is in them this has all the all the elements of the problem exists here in and I'll go back to it I would suggest that the CPAP data is a magnification of that because that is such incredibly useful data to study along with all the other objective subjective input somebody might give you in the survey and so forth that it's unbelievable that you're not that the the researchers don't have access to all of that data you know and so there's a really strong example problem and then of course it can rappin you know you're younger than I have been you saying if this problem is not gonna get solved in my lifetime that's a little depressing you know again the apology just being interoperability piece and then the interoperability pieces you just being able to collect that all simultaneously and use it together and it's true so you know how do we fix it you know it's not a it's a it's a great question and then nobody's gonna have an answer in this room but how the heck do we fix this that's a great segue so does anybody have an answer in this room if you don't have an answer I know an answer we've lost our microphone runners actually I have a question I mean it's a well or a question why don't you tell me what about trying to create an open-source standard for interchange of data between the different branches of medicine I have no idea how you know when you're talking about collecting that data you're collecting different data depending on different diseases I guess mm-hmm is there a way to create some kind of you know open source template that would allow everybody to use it so something that's called a common data model and honestly it's a little screwed up that we have to go back and do this retro actively because we don't have one health system we don't have one health record there's a bunch of different individual vendors that had their own models and now they're essentially you know we're trying to get get all the records talking to each other and that's what we call interoperability but it has been painfully slow some of the large-scale initiatives in this country like the precision medicine initiative now all of us research program which is 1 million different Americans participating in research that was the foundation and it's really not a reality yet so we have we have a lot of work to do DoD actually does it pretty well pointed they spend a lot of money on it department it down with the defense yes it is who else has an idea a solution how might we wait okay you just want to mention Apple back in iOS 11 developed the fast health interoperability record which is phenomenal and if you all have an iPhone go to health and you can add in hundreds of institutions have agreed to these standards just wondering why that hasn't been mentioned yet because I think it's groundbreaking and I've got all my Stanford records right here and there are literally hundreds and hundreds of UCSF is in there you basically just go in sign-in and all your records are now in your iPhone in a very easy to use approachable way for individuals to use if you haven't gone in to the health app on your iPhone do it today and go and go to the account and then add your records from any of the institutions that are on there and Stanford is in there for example so I I just want to address that I think that's a brilliant idea and I think that there's a lot of advocacy groups that are working on that I'm full disclosure and Neel Sethi who is the founder of citizen was actually the founder of a company called glimpse glimpse was purchased by Apple and that's the technology that you're actually using one of the things to know about that and probably I know it's a big deal in the oncology community and I'm sure it's a big bigger deal with the with the Sleep Disorders community is 850 organizations feels like a lot but it's it's not it's and there are so many individuals in this country that don't have the benefit of being treated at an academic medical facility a large facility that has bought into that so we still absolutely need to solve the problem of how do those people participate and how do those people get access to to the additional knowledge the other thing to note is what you're pulling in incredibly valuable that is the clinical day but it's also portal data so if you're interested your entire health record is actually available to you as well but it's usually a different request process so I think it's kind of a both and my fits available to you do it but also know that there's a lot more data out there on you but if we could get all institutions to agree to this standard would that be wonderful it would be there are still some people that are working in paper I know Joe paper and working in fax machines but but I would say there's one extra thing to what dr. Borelli just mentioned it is that not everyone has an apple or an iOS and that's one of the things that we want to see going forward with our sleep health app is not just the iOS version but 75% of the world is on the Android platform one of the other sort of a question on this some survey intrigued by the passive nature in it I do consumer marketing and there's always the flaw because you're getting data if the person who's motivated and loves to fill out surveys so I think it's critical that we do it in such a way that's not Big Brother but how do we get it so that you're getting everybody's data you're not getting those who are motivated to answer your questions yeah so I'll just I'll speak to a Venetian in our community of three and a half million we individually can send people and ask but I think you also have to acknowledge it's a connected population right and so as technology comes more into play we really have a lot of work to do on health disparities and making sure like a lot of these AI algorithms that I just I want to be just honest about I feel like some of the data sets in the cancer world they were primarily Caucasian and you see them in the major cities of the US as like who contributed data because it came from the academic health centers and then you look at like the rural us and so you'll see nobody kind of like in the Midwest and then there's like Utah in Denver and there's an outline of the outside and so while it's a new day we still have a lot of work to do to make sure that precision health is reality for everybody in this country I will say to again going from the cancer space which I keep bringing up all the time but we have the same problem with all of our clinical trials they're very white they're very middle upper-middle class we've actually figured out finally that we need to go where the people are into the communities you know California we have a the Central Valley is a very different population than San Francisco or LA and for me to walk into the Central Valley and be like hey you get your health records this is there's a lot of things not the least of which is immigration that people are talking about and probably even more concerned about than their health so it's going to those community leaders and saying hey we have this we'd love to support your community tell us how how we can help it's going into Oakland there's the Catholic Diocese there and they are starting to do faith based health education so going into the churches going into these these community centers I think it's a great opportunity for any advocacy group to go in and say we know this affects your population it might not be your top concern but how can we how can we help me meet the needs and make it a symbiotic relationship the caveat to that is is who the messenger is it can't be the doctor in the white lab coat especially in the african-american community because of past history in this country and same with a lot Latino community and so forth and so on so it's who's given a message that's why we're doing an event like today not just for the people in this room but for our patients that we know it can never be here that they can learn about this because you know once they do get empowered and they start to take care of themselves then they can't help they can go back community the barbershop the church wherever and share their experience so for every one person that we all here help save today hopefully that person was gonna go and save ten more we just need to speed it up I'm going to just operate a couple things so back on the bias in addition to you know Caucasian people filling out the surveys and that kind of thing you also have Caucasians writing the writing of the AI programs right with their bias is called the bias tribe and it's something to keep in mind I was going to also bring the conversation back to you know what can we do because I've been doing this for a while now and I'm sort of thinking that you know the there's a model when I first started working at Apple which was they made sure that the this was a product marketing thing but it kind of worked to make sure that the elementary schools and the middle schools that kind of stuff had Apple products early and often because I knew that eventually they grow up become consumers and in this in this conversation there's there's a lot about trying to treat people like myself and maybe younger people domain and that's really important but when you have limited resources you have to kind of ask the question you know what what can you make the biggest impact with and my personal feeling is the biggest impact you can make is to prevent these things from happening at birth and focus on that type of thing because in another 15 years or 20 years that child will be an adult and and it's not that long and we've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to help people end up in the general community I think it's kind of time for a lot of people to try to focus on what about my child what about my my grandchild or what about you know my my sister's grandchild that kind of thing because you know frankly the thing that frustrates me is I knew about sleep apnea and I had a two-year-old that had a problem so I went to the doctor they took his adenoids out and I thought that's over you know I didn't think about really what his problem was gonna be later as an adult Adam on the other hand you know God got on top of it thinking about it and he's been actively working with his child and I think that's a really interesting place to go where you start working with the pediatric community and trying to cut it out early or mitigate it so that people don't have to wait twenty years and have cognitive dysfunction and and you know suicidal thoughts and that kind of thing so I just thought I'd offer that out as a another alternative thank you and I'm gonna take that as your wrap-up yeah and then Stacy if you leave us with one thing that we could all be doing or that you think is important for the community to do what's your closing thought I mean you are all here in this room so I have a feeling you you kind of walk around and feel like you're kind of empowered and your voices is valid and and can be heard I would just encourage you to take that back out to your communities to help empower others and the system is broken but it is the system we have and a brilliant man just said to me the other day Stacy a Danish Baker says you have to bake bread with the flour at hand so that's what I'm gonna leave you with I'll leave you with just that that when I learned is that you know how prevalent sleep apnea is in our society I think we all in this room think that we all think that it's a much bigger problem than people recognize that it's an unsolved problem and the only way that we're gonna sort of prove it to everybody and solve the problem is to get out there and and talk about and collect data to show it so that's what I'll leave you would and I'll leave you with continue answering those surveys participate in research when you have a chance and I guess work on as a community how you're all going to aggregate your data and then use it to improve research and care so think so thank you all Thank You panel thank you all so much minutes we're just running about ten minutes behind where we're still going to keep with the schedule so we're going to take a little break now this will be the last opportunity for everyone to participate in the round-robin with the experts in the back of the room so we'll see everybody in about 30 minutes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] we have about five to seven minutes everybody five to seven minutes so make sure you get the stickers on your card and then you can see Tina Piazza over here by the double doors she has a Birkenstock collection box you can submit your completed card there five to seven minutes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if everyone will start to wrap up it'll just be another minutes for you to get back to your seat and then we'll continue on with the final two items on the agenda please so if you have your round-robin card you can go ahead and give that to Tina over there by the door show wave her hand will do the drawing at the right at the end of the meeting did you want you and he's gonna go there was just like comfortable whatever you're comfortable can you introduce yourself what would you like me to okay right thank you everyone for taking your seats we just have two more agenda items for the day thank you for sticking with us online hope so far you've enjoyed the topics and the presentations that we've had today we're getting ready to just do a recap of some of the highlights of the day and I'm going to introduce dr. Joseph Morelli who is a radiologist and he has been on the American sleep apnea association board for about six years and so he's going to join us and take us through some of the exciting topics and interesting factoids that we've learned today so hands it over to you doctor thank you [Applause] good afternoon it's my microphone working real good all right great pleasure to be here at my first awake meeting thank you for inviting me Adam a wonderful venue great I mean great audience very stimulating in fact I would say this healthcare conference has been the most informative educational and exciting event I have intent ever intended in my career it was all organized and ironically it was organized by a bunch of sleepy people go figure sleepy but very motivated I would not be here I think literally would not be here or even alive but for this gentleman right here pictured beside me that I'm honored to stand beside just his photograph and before I summarized attempt to do the impossible summarize what we've covered today and I was very attentive because I knew I had to do this I have to just give you a little bit of background on me because it brings in dr. kimono brings in dr. casey lee dr. stacie quo i was involved with all those folks and that's how I met Adam ultimately about 10 years ago I was suffering a cognitive decline about maybe 15 years ago and it was very insidious it's like if you got let's say 1% less smart every month would you notice it and it kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse and that's sort of the nature of this disease sleep breathing disorders excuse the term sleep breathing disorders and it just gets very insidiously worse you don't really recognize it to reach some sort of breaking point or you pass some sort of threshold in mine was I was getting lost in my neighborhood I couldn't remember people's names that I would meet I would speak to someone and I'm five seconds later forget their name my attention was dropping it got so bad I became suicide I didn't attempt suicide but I thought about it a lot and I knew there was a problem I was waking up not well-rested a non restorative sleep that is a term we use and I wake up and I feel worse than when I went to bed which then causes insomnia because the end the bed becomes your enemy and so insomnia is sort of the sort of the main thing that people claim with early early on I believe and we need to be attacking that early as well once we once clinicians hear that a patient has a difficulty sleeping falling asleep or staying asleep or gained a bed late that should trigger an investigation for a sleep breathing disorder or other sleep disorders but I got to the point where you know suicidal eye had to sleep studies done within about two years locally one at a major University of Medical Center I'm in South Carolina I'm not going to mention any names and in both cases they said I was essentially normally the first case they said it was pretty normal the second case they said minimal maybe your age is around four we'll try you on a pressure of five on CPAP and that made me worse even though I tried it diligently for several months whatever could I guessed I don't I don't have a sleep disorder and I continue to deteriorate I developed the chaired the committee that developed the national MRI standards for American College of Radiology is the MRI accreditation standards and at the conclusion once we finished that project I had a three year appointment as chairman after he after we completed that project in year two I resigned because I knew I just could not cope with my cognitive issues I was struggling just with daily living activities it was horrible it was really horrible I broke down in the shower crying and I the next day I said I'm gonna find the best leave medicine facility in the world and that led me to this clinic and this gentleman right here and when I saw him in the clinic he walked in remember he opened the door he walked in behind them were a bunch of fellows and residents and what have you he said doctor Borelli open your mouth and he shined a flashlight into my mouth he took it took two steps back and he shook his head and he said doctor Briella you've had sleep apnea your entire life and I recalled when I was age ten I had a blood pressure of 150 over 100 that was hospitalized to find the source of that they the pediatric cardiologist told my parents I would not live past the age of 21 they told me that thinking that I could handle it and I did I was like I wasn't I was you know I was invincible at age ten and so ironically at that but that same time 1972 CG wrote his first paper which was the linkage of childhood hypertension to sleep apnea which is somewhat ironic but it took me about a year to get comfortable using CPAP I was usually placed on straight a straight pressure a continuous pressure or CPAP right and it felt like I was breathing into a balloon when I'd exhaled it was was intolerable for me and I eventually switched to bypass and I switch different interfaces I started using Afrin in my nose to clear my nasal passages I know some allergists and ENT doctor said don't do that I've been doing Afrin it in both nostrils once a night for 10 years it hasn't give me any problems at all get a little stuffy in the evening beforehand but that was really a breakthrough for me and I'm on BiPAP and I look at the data on the machine would have you with the sleepyhead app that was mentioned by dr. Stein ibly and but it since it took me a year that motivated me to help people become compliant with CPAP so I want the Philips Respironics I had a friend who knew the senior people there and I met with the CEO of the company and I convinced them to develop an app to help to coach people become compliant on CPAP was the first app they ever developed I think they budgeted 7 million for and they ended up spending 14 million it's now called a dream map or not sleep map or dream mapper and it met a lot of the goals I talked about but not all of them but it's still I think it's benefited a lot of people and then ultimately I've been I met Adam and we worked together on picori and then apples research came out and said hey apples done all the heavy lifting on collecting patient data and consenting let's do this on our own and we then built this app with Karl step mouse key and it became a sleep health app and all that was all volunteer work and I'm very very proud of that and I'm very happy to be here before you and have the opportunity to speak to you and I think this is a great meeting I think we have a bigger one next year I'm definitely gonna plan to attend that extremely valuable there's so much to learn it's such a complex issue it affects so many more people that we've diagnosed terribly under diagnosed so many stereotypes that are wrong you know overweight middle-aged males it's this this affects young people and we need to be intervening much earlier but enough about my story let's go on to the summary and this is gonna be very brief and I picked up a few little notes and a few little things some sort of hacks maybe as you'd call them as Millennials might call them that I've learned over the years that I'll share with you right there wrongly I'm a medical doctor but this is not medical advice this is just my suggestions to you also I want to disclose I was recently named medical director of bleep and I'm an in snap cpap LLC that make an interface that attaches to your nose adhesively rather than three straps and of course I think it's great but I'm not gonna here to talk about that we start out with dr. Sullivan and I think for who was formerly at Stanford and she had several panelists and they were talking about these overlapping issues you know asthma chronic pain anxiety depression there are all these comorbid conditions in and I think as Adam said earlier this is where patients frequently contact a healthcare system initially is with a comorbid condition when we didn't hear today was atrial fibrillation I think all virtually all atrial fibrillation is caused by sleep apnea virtually all of it and most cardiologists don't even check for stuff they're just an aside there's no question that you know there are so many sleep affects everything affects every single cell I think someone run the note won the Nobel Prize recently for detecting determining that there is a circadian clock in every living cell in your body it has to do with enzyme production enzyme that's that produces a protein that leaves the cell and it comes back and just a little over 24 hours like 24 hours and 10 minutes and the master clock and the hypothalamus has a 24-hour cycle to it so it's like the master clock but every cell in your body is expecting to rest and that's what all these other comorbid conditions are related to sleep because if your GI tract doesn't sleep you have irritable bowel syndrome I'm oversimplifying right but if your brain doesn't sleep toxins build up that caused Alzheimer's disease and we know now that the brain cells shrink 40% in deep stages of sleep which is extraordinary and why are they why do they shrink 40% it allows room between them for them to remove the toxins and we also found out about five years ago independently in Europe and the United States two research teams found a lymphatic pathway in the brain that allows the toxins to be removed all other all your anatomy textbooks up until about five years ago showed lymphatic stopping here none up here and now we know they're there amazing amazing I personally believe this is you know you know if to take this home I believe the number one reason we do sleep is allow the brain to remove toxins that's the main reason it developed evolutionary because think about it when you're asleep you're at risk for attack by a predator and so we we sleep because we absolutely have to right as we're putting ourselves at huge risk so we sleep for a reason I think that's the number one reason why I developed evolutionarily that's just my own personal theory and I think that's why we're seeing such a huge link between Alzheimer's disease and and sleep sleep disorders so there's all these comorbid conditions and they're not being addressed properly we don't have the resources or awareness to do it right now and that's why we're here is to hopefully improve both of those create greater awareness both organically from patients but also among institutions and among corporations that are involved but and I think what the model we have is what they have at Stanford and the interdisciplinary group that they have at Stanford is a model that we should try to reproduce nationwide internationally we had you know the team sport meeting with dr. Clos and by the way doctor close clinic you have a chance to go to see dr. close clinic it's the most amazing health care clinic I've ever seen in my life and I told her that today I said oh my god is like in cry was like it's like the healthcare clinic that Steve Jobs would have designed well it turns out Steve Jobs and his family were patients of hers and but it is really it's amazing and she's an amazing lady and wonderful to have her here today with us and they talked about how they coordinated all their disciplines with an allergy with insomnia with the Maya fight myofascial exercises the the tongue exercises to help the tongue become a better position in the mouth during sleep it's again it's very complex and people presenting with initial sleep disorders or other comorbid disorders when they get in to the healthcare system we need to evaluate all those areas to optimize their care right we heard a really compelling research from dr. Gartner I believe yeah and I spoke with him afterwards I think there's a lot of opportunity there because you know these devices that we're using late in the hours we showed rough something like a tenfold increased risk of suicide between the hours of like midnight and 3:00 a.m. which is really extraordinary to see that and that's something we can target and a lot of times especially younger people that are committing suicide they're probably doing something on one of their phones and I think we possibly could capture some data maybe they're typing in an anxious way or something we can pick up by the interaction with these devices and I've spoken him about maybe working with Apple and doing something there with their new sort of generalized researchkit app that they announced at the last the big announcement a couple weeks ago but I think that's you know there's an opportunity potentially to intervene there and then we heard about you know the challenge of patient gathered healthcare data we have healthcare data in desparate sources all over the world and stored differently and we see as I mentioned earlier Apple's made an effort probably other comes in made an effort to sort of standardize how we store this data and how we can access it and that's going to be a key to where we get as well was mentioning have machine learning look at these huge vast amounts of data and pour through it to find relationships between multiple factors that we would you man being could almost never find or may take years to find I think that's going to be a key to maybe finding a cure to this condition and I think you know technology is going to be is obviously going to be the answer but we without the awareness we're not going to get the technology or the resources to to go after it and I just have a few just a few little you know things I wanted to mention they've given the opportunity the things that I've learned over time that kind of surprised me I developed arrhythmias on high levels of CPAP which I suffered about 30,000 per premature atrial contraction similar to atrial fibrillation but not each fibrillation and my pressure was very high 20 over 15 and I saw I went to Mayo Clinic I went to Stanford I went to three cardiologists another we could figure out what was wrong they wouldnt put me on drugs would have you one night I lowered my pressure by five and the next morning I woke up in normal sinus rhythm so no question increased pressure with which were present preventing filling of my cardiac atria if your chest pressure is high the blood flowing into your chest is gonna be lowered so it was actually changing the shape of my atria which was triggering the arrhythmias that's my theory but no one's been able to explain it but no question was related to the pressure so if anyone's on high pressure and they get you know arrhythmias may look at maybe lowering your pressure speaking to your physician about that and no one even doctor gman out didn't understand that which is kind of interesting I've also found that bi-level is a huge improvement over CPAP and if anyone's struggling with CPAP and not on by level by level is a huge improvement because it allows you to exhale comfortably right I also found again I mentioned earlier using Afrin to open my nasal passages every night just once a day no more than once a day you will get a little rebound stuffiness the next day some people it does affect more than that for me I can use it and if you're having any problems with feeling that you're you're congested you may want to give that a try maybe try it for a little while but you will become addicted to it because you will get if you stop it you'll start getting stuffy and stuffy so it's kind of like a commitment and again I'm not recommending that just maybe suggest you try it what else I also found that I have I wake up frequently after about four or five hours and I found a miracle drug I just read about it recently and it's been used for a while it's called doxepin you can get it in in a liquid form in generic it's very inexpensive and you take about five milligrams or either one or five milligrams equally effective to help you stay asleep and that to me that's something I discovered within the last six months have been very helpful for me if you have if you wake up after a short period of time that's a form of insomnia so sex it's a it's a type of insomnia where you wake up too soon I have both sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia or did and that that really helped me and if you having trouble with sleep maintenance being staying asleep talk to your doctor about trying some doxepin it's an it's used in the dose like 120 if you would use for depression what else I think this if there's anything I'd like to communicate to all physicians around the world if anyone's listening here um people that have insomnia most likely have an underlying sleep breathing disorder barry krakow has studied over twelve years of data thousands of patients 90% of patients presenting with insomnia have a sleep breathing disorder and the last thing that doctors do is send them for a sleep study they get sent them for cognitive behavioral therapy which yes has a role but it's not the cure you need to open up the airway before any of the other cures are going to work and that is so important insomnia indicates a breathing disorder most likely 90% of the time please get a sleep study if you have any issues or and your friends relatives neighbors that has any difficulties asleep falling asleep staying asleep the first thing they should do is get a sleep study and there's a good alternative a sleep studies are expensive this is one of the challenges sleep sites cost several thousand dollars but there's a company called Itamar they make a device called watch Pat I have no involvement whatsoever with the company I own one of these devices because I use it for friends and family which I test for free and treat for free unless I'm not a sleep medicine doctor I'm an MRI doctor and watch Pat you just wear it on your wrist as little probe that goes on your finger it looks at peripheral arterial tone it's every time you struggle to breathe your body goes oh my god I'm being waterboarded and like literally you're struggling to breathe and it's like a drowning type of mechanism and your body constricts the peripheral arteries cuz it thinks you're under taps if you're being attacked by an animal you might lose a limb well it's a good idea not to have your blood in that limb so that's your natural mechanism is to shunt the blood torture torso and brain where you need it and so that device is extremely sensitive extremely accurate and I'm gonna I may alienate a few people here but I would say it's probably better than most sleep labs at detecting sleep disorder breathing as I've seen because there's a huge variation in quality and and also we also heard about you know differences in interpretation you could take two sleep studies and have them interpreting Liat to different results two different H eyes there's no such thing as your a H I it varies by day at varies by clinic and varies by criteria what else anything else yeah Adam anything else that you know that I like to talk about that I may have missed you a RS okay so you ARS upper airway resistance syndrome okay so it's a sleep breathing disorder but instead of sleep apnea where you breathe breathe breathe stop and then you get aroused and then you breathe breathe breathe that's like conventional sleep apnea right and nothing's black and white there's all everything's all mixed together upper airway resistance syndrome it's like breathing through a tiny straw like a stirring straw but every breath you're struggling and your body recognizes that that struggle you're the tension in the muscles is recognized by your brain it knows you're struggling to breathe it's not a good state to be in and you're in that all night it's like being waterboarded throughout the night and I personally believe that that has more effects systematically than sleep apnea and that's why presents earlier presents in younger people because it affects the whole your whole system because you're triggering the fight-or-flight throughout the night and you're releasing cortisol which causes you to store fat and become obese so I think people that are obese and have sleep apnea became obese because the sleep breathing disorder and often upper air resistance syndrome an upper airway resistance syndrome was discovered by this man right here and and and described by him but it's not as well recognized or accepted in the in the healthcare community this guy was right trust me this guy was right and the reason it's not diagnosed is because it's much harder to diagnose it because you have to spend a lot more time looking at the electroencephalogram I was trained on polysomnographic interpretation at Stanford and I know the differences and the difference between someone that knows how to look at the encephalic go and Safa which is a bunch of squiggly lines and looking for arousal which is what you need to do to diagnose upper airway resistance syndrome is much more time consuming and they don't get paid anymore to do it okay so and hopefully and I know it's Stanford and other centers that are using trying to use AI and machine learning to read these electroencephalograms to make it more efficient and and not require so many resources but I think the vast majority people that are misdiagnosed was not of not having a sleep disorder after they've gone to a sleep lab they probably have upper airway resistance syndrome as I did misdiagnosed twice a good Stanford this and they did they did the polysomnogram for me at Stanford and yaa chide Stanford was 27 prior to that it was 4th at the other one institution nailed own it was zero so lots of variability so there are many many many areas of improvement we can improve diagnosis we can improve public awareness awareness of the payers weight where awareness of you know government authorities we have there is so many opportunities for improvement here and we have so little resources right now and we need to divert many more resources and the main thing is I think the main thing we can do the lowest hanging fruit long term is early intervention and screening of the entire population at an early age maybe even near birth as you know at this point maybe with genetic testing or something may be a way to analyze the tongue or the frenulum but we have to be doing population-based screening screening to be effective has to be low cost and sensitive you don't want what's called a false negative you want to tell someone hey you don't have this disorder you want to catch everyone that has this order maybe a few people you say yeah you you probably you might have it and if you do like an in lab study then like it's not as bad as we thought but you and I think we can do something like a watch path that we could you know do universally maybe test everyone every five years or something like this that might be a way that may be a pathway to go but ultimately we're going to get to the point where we're gonna pardon me we're gonna take we're going to through through this organization I think we're gonna have a huge impact in long term not very long term I think in the next three to five years we may be able to cut the incidence of sleep disorder breathing untreated by half and I think it'd be a really great goal and I'm happy thank you on I'm happy to take any questions that I might be able to answer or offer any questions anyone in the facility thank you [Applause] or talk about today yep anything about today it's just a comment but I've been like this all day we've been talking about the fact that people who have sleep apnea have cognitive end up having cognitive problems just like people who are alcoholics or drug addicts the difference is that they don't know because they don't they're not doing anything you know to get to that point but you know listen to the story of Adam a Peter of Brian it's when they got into an accident you know that endangered their lives and lives of others then suddenly they realized something was wrong somebody who is an alcoholic knows he's doing something that you know so I think that's that's something that's a that may be obvious but it's very interesting to me that that you know we're not aware of things that are as bad you know you could you should get be able to we should get like a D us you know and I agree with you nobody knows about it or not enough people try a general blanket test should probably I can tell you that I know GM has technology their self-driving technology does detect sleepy drivers and it's actually very effective GM General Motors yeah and I think we're to see more of that but to address that specific thing yes that's you're right on absolutely that's interesting that you bring that up Shawn Doyle because a few years ago and it infuriated some people but there was going to be a saliva test that policemen could give to drivers that they suspected had not you know had any sleep and it the saliva would be able to tell whoever was it you know checking out the test that they you know whether they slept how many hours they hadn't slept and I I don't know whatever happened to that science but I just thought it was kind of you know 1984 ish but interesting that it could be done with saliva it was something about interleukin that could be you know I think most people they have sleep breeding disorders have insomnia and therefore get less sleep total sleep time and you could possibly document it with that that's a good idea for a pressure screening I mean if you are sleepy because you have Slee Batman you don't realize it that's one thing but if if you I mean I was a sleep tech and there were many times I tried to drive home in the morning impaired Leslie how would that be if a sleep tech you know hurt somebody with their car you know I used to take many naps in the hospital parking lot just so that I could get over that hump and get home safely but you know sometimes it's not safe to sleep in a car like that either so anyway I just wanted to just say that don't be interests Tetris my way over here I yeah that device is called a watch Pat one word by a company called Itamar IT a ma are again I have no affiliation whatsoever to disclose with them I think it's a great device it's FDA approved designed and built in Israel and I think it's a revolutionary tool actually have a little more representative there you go we'd be happy to show it to you I'm free for dinner tonight by the way just kidding just kidding any other questions about the day's topic something you want to revisit I'm very opinionated I'll give you an opinion on anything this is your chance last chance stereo I guess my concern is like so many medical situations that evolve in our society that the sleep study that I took was you know I am lucky to have good health insurance but it was well over $3,000 yes and when you think about the population the demographics whatever and how many people might have sleep apnea I would hope in the future that that that process and that amount of money I mean that that the whole procedure the the the expenditure would be reduced as as we as the technology evolves they I mean you are talking about something that you're wearing on your wrist right I'm hoping someday that we have something like that that can be provided to people so that we can diagnose more people I mean I probably had sleep apnea all my life and I was just diagnosed a year ago with severe sleep apnea right so it has affected my life I thought it was just getting older and I would just be exhausted like for the rest of my life tired not sleepy but tired right hi you're tired so so when I was mentioning that device I believe that device is as good or better than the majority of full sleep lab studies overnight sleep size of that device which that cost about $250 to have a study I'm maybe I'm about right maybe got move around but maybe about 250 dollars versus 3,000 yes and so yeah the technology is allowing the cost to come down no question we'll be able to screen people the whole population at relatively low cost where screen we screen for : with colonoscopies that cost several hundred dollars you know but let's be clear we can train every pediatrician every dentist in the country every school nurse to look in the airway in about 30 seconds and know right away whether if someone needs actually go have the sleep study looking at you heard yeah Christine Simon I talked about scalp tongue scarred scar cheeks bruxism they look at here what they call your Mallampati score how much room is in the back of airway and just those three or four variables alone should send you in the right pathway and triage the word to get the best intervention yeah so it's not just about studying in the field is sort of done a lot about that we need to make sure we're treating people and now we have remove as many of these obstacles and barriers because if the bad partner witnesses the apnea or the bedwetting for a child or the the night terrors of sleepwalking whatever it may be that's the best objective science measurement because it's witnessed that's observed and the insurers don't care and I might like to add one thing and you know segwaying from what you said orthodontics the mouse smaller to align your teeth by removing teeth and making it smaller no one should ever have that done ever again the small mouth reduces the volume and the tongue has only one place to go to block the airway I've seen so many people that have had multiple teeth removed to have their teeth straightened and then they put that retainer on that pulls their teeth back and makes their maxilla smaller that's the opposite of what you want you want your mouth to grow during during childhood and adolescence and I've seen so many people that have had that procedure done I met a woman that had four teeth removed and around age 12 she started developing pots postural tachycardia syndrome which is a comorbid condition condition to the point where she became an invalid and as soon as she went on CPAP in two weeks he was up and running was a night and day difference and she went back to her orthodontist in Germany and they denied that any association between doing orthodontia and sleep apnea which is complete BS I'm sorry which is a great segue for me introducing this man's son who's in the back of the room has been who's been nice enough to come and be an honorary chair to help us launch what we call our run campaign and run is an acronym for right under your nose you've heard me talk about that today it's also the last words that doctor Jim medow gave me about two weeks before he passed he said you go wrong with this cure and make sure nobody gets in your way and that's our job as an organization that's where we're going and I'd like to invite up Eric Gaiman talk about his dad this guy probably knows more about sleep medicine before the age of 10 then anybody in the world and he'll tell you his story and while Eric's coming up there I'll just show you this is a photo and a portrait we did at dr. Goodman oh and this is a infographic that's set up for the public that we've designed that will be released on our website and via social media outlets and this helps explain the career of dr. Goodman Oh from 1968 the 2019 he was a true 49er thank you Adam I promise I'll be brief don't worry first first let me thank everyone here for allowing me to participate and something that my father doctor gave me no dedicated his life to unlike the many other speakers at this event I don't have any formal expertise in the subject matter unless you count the unplanned attendance at sleep conferences my father took me as his child rather I want to simply talk about the man who was behind the great researcher and professor my father was passionate about his work he loved the research and exploration of sleep medicine and he dedicated most of his time to it his weekend schedule was generally some light garden work followed by a bike ride through the Golden Gate Park and riding and reading in his office he had this incredible ability to focus on a subject and spend hours working on it many years ago a friend of mine wound up sitting next to him from a flight from Paris to San Francisco my friend foolishly thought he would have someone to speak to during the flight instead after some brief pleasantries my father spent the next 11 hours of flight working on a paper this surprised none of us not only did he not only did he have a passion to explore and discover he also wanted to share to teach and to spread the knowledge of sleep to as many people in as many disciplines as possible it didn't matter what disciplines you covered what country you were from growing up I would go on trips or attend dinners with him and he would be talking to people from friendly Japan or Turkey giving them advice on how to establish sleep clinics if you were interested in sleep and sometimes even if you weren't he would happily give your guidance on your journey he wanted the knowledge and teaching to sleep to spread like wildfire he had the same approach when working with colleagues in the medical profession you could be a cardiologist pulmonologist a surgeon or a dentist and if you wanted to collaborate on sleep he would work with you it was important to him not to work in silos but to work together to give the patient the best possible care because that was the crew of everything to my father the patient's the desire to share and spread knowledge has many origins his French um upbringing his time in Africa his life as an immigrant all these factors played a role the result is that his patients well-being was always always at the forefront his mind he generally cared about them he would listen to them and work with them patients were his motivation the reason he wanted to share Nagy to make sure that they got the best treatment it would seem perfect stupid as he would say in French to forget that the reason he to forget the reason he and all his colleagues were in sleep medicine was to help people the fact that so many people remember him today and all all over the world be the be they patient colleague or former student is because my father consistently put his energy into helping that most of all have met read or worked with my dad you probably already know most of this are can add is that I think that would I think what would be most important to him is that you continue to learn educate and help others my brother jokingly talked about the sleep family when speaking of when speaking about our father's colleagues and patients so you guys are all the sleep family I can think of no better term and for him no better legacy all I can do is to encourage you to keep that family strong and keep it growing thank you [Applause] it's one of ink Erica as brave and telling your story and what he meant to you he's I think asleep families exactly right we're he's a father to a lot of us whether biological or not I know when he passes some right the first time I felt like I felt that kind of emotion since I lost my father from early onset Alzheimer's which was later described as Lewy body Parkinson's in 2002 so that was about 17 years ago for me and Justine to be here today having this conversation ten years after my diagnosis my treatment to help save our child's life to intervene early on and to now help spread the knowledge and the education so that she's not the the exception but the rule is really what dr. Gillman does legacy is and when it comes down to it this guy is you're talking about a Nobel nominee Louis Pasteur he's he's in that ballpark and every in every way that you can imagine we will carry on his legacy the rest of our lives I just want to thank everyone for coming today I know it's not easy to get into the city especially in a city like this where everyone's busy and fast and moving and important I'm happy that we got such beautiful weather someone was looking over us we were not stuck in the fog freezing the death in here the fact that we windows are not in a closed hotel room with with no air and no way to breathe this is our vision of what a patient conference should be it's interactive it's bi-directional and it's hopefully got something for everyone whether it's your first day being diagnosed or if you've never been diagnosed or if you're a 20-year veteran we're trying to provide as much information and as much knowledge as much education to the community out there no matter where they're at whether it's on our website or on our social media channels you've been seeing us filming this today it's for the audience that's not here we've also been doing interviews and you'll see us continue to show these patients stories and all their different perspectives over the course of the year so that next September we can have another awake meeting maybe in a different location in a different part of the country and maybe with a different agenda because we can't cover it all in one day but we will keep on going we will keep on doing the research we have been doing it and you know we like to say there's nothing about us without us and what that really comes down to is that if the patients are not involved in the conversation if the end user is not there from the beginning we don't have the whole story and we're missing it I could have never helped myself if I didn't get self-advocate and start reading dr. amends book and talking about this this French doctor Jim I know we brought in from France and you know it really inspired me to say okay I got to go meet this guy and I could tell you to this day the hair on the back of my head hair on the back of my neck stood up when he walked in the room because was the first time someone walked into the room and knew they were looking at me and I was not the victim he explained to me what all my life's issues were and why all these things that happened and I got to say I used to live in the North Bay and I used to drive across that bridge and some days it was covered in fog and let me tell you that's my ass my brain was had I was in a fog I couldn't make sense I couldn't put two and two together and once I went to see that man in that clinic and his team of sleep family it burned away that fog and that was one of the other reasons why we chose this room this venue in this location because you have a national military cemetery and the PTSD and the suicide rate we heard about earlier you have the Golden Gate Bridge yeah Robin Williams tunnel literally we're looking right at it you know it's it's this sleep touches everyone it's not that we think that sleep is sleep apnea is the center of it all but if you don't have the sleep component under in the formula you don't have the full story I want to thank everyone for coming on today our online audience I want to thank my my wife who I wouldn't be alive with she put on this venue she's getting ready to plan my daughter's wedding eventually we're not doing it here but I want to thank all my board members is probably the first time more of our board members have been in the room together I want to thank my staff members who flew on from Minnesota from DC from from San Diego we have we have people from all over the country I want to thank our patient panelists we've been come from all walks of life and come through this journey through one very key issue and that's nobody owns the airway so depending upon which door you walk through is is usually that the intervention and in the pathway you're going to be given and our job here today is to educate the public at large to go in informed with as much information as you could possibly know that so you can help make the best decision for your precision health pathway and journey until next year good night and get a good night's sleep [Applause] thank you everyone thank you for joining us today you
