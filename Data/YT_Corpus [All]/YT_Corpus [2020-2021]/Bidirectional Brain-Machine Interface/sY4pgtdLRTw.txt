presentation Tony please proceed once you slides are up all right well good day everybody I have probably more material than I can cover in 40 minutes so they'll be a little bit more but I left the slides in mainly for for completeness sake so if you want to peruse them later next slide please so overview I'm going to cover solar and wind technology and given time talk a little bit about kind of the project types from the contractual point of view where do the electrons go where does the money go why would you want to do one over the other for the each of the technologies I'm going to follow kind of a three-step process where I'll talk about the resource how do we how do we describe it how much is their technology and trends and the market status how much how much is being deployed and the cost trends and the idea to kind of give you a working knowledge of how these work next slide please solar start with that first next slide I'll let you look at those definitions and hit a few of them talking about the solar resource you can break it up first I wanna talk about irradiance versus insulation irradiance is instantaneous what's happening second-by-second insulation and we talked about in terms of kilowatts per meter squared it's a typical unit we use insulation or radiation is energy per area so over over a given amount of time and just to give you a sense of how much no sunlight hits the ground here in Colorado typical average daily insulation is about four and a half kilowatt hours per meter squared just to give you a number you can you convinced you can turn around in your brain this unit kilowatt hours per meter square you sometimes hear refer to as a Sun hour the pieces of radiation there's basically two and they add up to the global one is the direct normal so that's what's coming directly from the Sun and then the diffuse horizontal which is basically coming from the rest of the sky because the so the sunlight hits the atmosphere and gets scattered all around and you add those up do some math and you get the global horizontal irradiance and that's nothing to care about for PV whereas you're concentrating technologies care more about the direct normal the other pings need to be concerned about is reflected some hits the ground and will hit your panels so you need to keep track of that as well next slide next the next slide will show just shows that graphically again you have the direct which the direct normal you have the diffuse which is called the sky and you add them up as shown in that in that formula at the top and you get your the direct normal times the cosine of the incident angle plus the diffuse is your global is your global and then you add and reflected to to account for what's actually hitting a a surface next slide so when you're looking at the online resources your typical your global is going to be shown in one of two things one is global horizontal so that's basically you you put something on the ground a panel or a piece of paper what's hitting what's hitting the ground and you can see from here it varies from somewhat under four to the top scale is above five point seven five so key thing is it varies over the US by a factor of about two so not a huge variation compared to win which you'll see later and also you can see that over the medium to short short to medium distances you know miles or tens of miles not a huge change in the resource so you can kind of put your thumb up in the air take and take an average number and and get get at least the right order of magnitude on your calculation and you can see the the best resources in the south southwest and the the lowest resources in the northwest and is in the Northeast next slide the other thing you'll see is maps you'll see is surface tilted latitude and the reason that's important is because that will maximize your annual production usually and so just to spare people from doing the math they'll say okay if you're orient due south and your surface is tilted latitude what what do you get and so that that's what these maps show so you've got to read the fine print carefully on the maps and make sure you know what you're what you're looking at so one way to Ballpark the the amount of sunlight hitting 6th array would just be to look at the ground and tilt it south and latitude and you're going to probably be somewhere in between assuming your pure array is more or less facing the equator so next slide few more angles talk about the angle of incidence that's basically the angle between the beam radiation and the normal to the surface where the normal is the arrow sticking out of the surface the other thing we talked about is the zenith the azimuth which is basically whether you're tilted towards how far you're tilted away from the equator and those are probably the big one-oh and pills that's the angle between the panel surface and the ground so a tilt of zero means it's just lying flat on the ground and it tilt of 90 means it's vertical it's like a wall most panels are somewhere in between again a tilt of latitude generally gives you close to your maximum energy production next slide this kind of shows the effect of Chilton azimuth you know so if you're if you're having your house and doesn't exactly face south and the tilt is not quite latitude the takeaway here is that you're going to you're not going to lose that much as you can go about 45 degrees either way from South and you know maybe 1020 degrees away from your optimal tilt and you're still going to get decent production that's that's basically take away from the slide next slide all right you're moving more the technology you have some tracking options your first one is fixed tilt where basically your array is just tilted at a specific angle all the time again tilted latitude for maximum production seems you're facing equator if you want to maximize your summer gain you want to tilt less and if you want to maximize your winter gay and you tilt more you have one axis tracking and there's a couple different ways to do that and this is where I wish I was doing this live because then I can I demo it I tend to move around a lot when I'm presenting the main tilting tracking is mainly used for larger arrays and the what they do is they normally imagine two poles sticking out of the ground and a shaft between them and the orientation that the poles are on a kind of a north-south axis and your panels are on that shaft and so in the morning they're tilted to the east during the day the shaft rotates and at the end of the day the panels are facing west that's typically how you do tracking is mostly done the other thing you can imagine if you're you're a pole standing and you have a panel you're holding a pen with your hand somewhat tilted and you just you just turn as the day goes across that's a way kind of a few small systems are done that way I'll finally have two axis tracking where the panel's face the Sun all the time that's not used very often because while one axis tracking is pretty easy to axis tracking tends to have more mechanical headaches next slide and this just kind of shows the effects of orientation so if your red line and this is seasonal is your horizontal four point seven for this particular sent hours per day for this particular issue if you tilted latitude you get a little bit more if you tilt vertically you get a lot less if you do the one axis tracking and this is the one where it's mounted on the pole it's the light blue line and finally two axis tracking is the dark blue line as you can see you have a noticeable difference if you depending on the tracking the tracking option you use next slide this I'm focusing my presentation and photovoltaic so you do want to acknowledge there are other solar technologies there's solar thermal very widely deployed over the world mostly for domestic hot water and then concentrating solar power which is used to also use roots electricity but PV is though is by far and away the go on being mainly installed nowadays next slide your your basic building block of your PV arrays your module for your silicon type they're basically composed of cells the cells are put together on a module and then the modules are put together into array so the modules are strung to put together in series to form what's called a string you do that to get your the voltage you want and your and then you may have more than one string depending on how much how much energy production you want but your basic chunk when you're designing your system is going to be your string and that's going to be based on your your desired DC bus voltage next slide so just to kind of give an overview the panel's convert the sunlight directly into DC electricity so if you're going to want to use it on the grid you have to convert it inverted to AC your panel efficiencies for off your typical office shelf anywhere from about 10 to 22 percent and the panel ratings are given in watts or kilowatts or regular the array size might be in kilowatts or megawatts DC so that's their DC output your DC energies convert it's an AC by an inverter of your system losses going from your array you're a loss in the inverter losses somewhere between 15 and 20 percent typically on average the panels themselves are very very reliable no moving parts all update electronics if you don't get a you know I haven't seen a warranty less than 20 years in decades so you're usually get a twenty twenty five year warranty for the inverter capacity to the rate capacity for your residential Tsai systems are usually the same the AC rating same as a DC rating for look for your larger utility systems typically the array is larger than the inverter and that's because you're not getting your maximum production a lot and so it's just cheaper to - to make it go with a smaller inverter and take a few losses alright sorry I just lost my computer would that please sorry I just lost my screen you sorry rebooting Tony would you like to try to jump to another presenter and join back in one year no I do write back I should got a I'm back I'm back I can wiggle my mouse occasionally so my my computer is go to sleep mode alright next slide I used a picture you have the modules you have a combiner box where the various strings are combined shows your inverter larger systems you may have a transformer you know probably going to see that for a residential or small commercial system and then it goes into your your panel box nextslide so deployment trends going to transition the market so this kind of shows or this does show deployments over the last years and anticipated deployments going forward this is a shout out do e sponsors a series of market reports so the solar ones are they're paid for by do e but they're put up there they're produced by Lawrence Livermore Laboratories LBNL let me do tracking the sunny chilly scale solar so these are these next few are from from those documents you can see annual installations of the bars and then the cumulative installation is kind of in the background and you're seeing us you're seeing on the order of you know nine nine ten plus gigawatt gigawatts per year so the markets really exploded utility is by by capacity the largest but significant amounts of commercial and residential PV as well this slide also shows utility scale C or CSP but hasn't been much deployed since 2014 next slide this shows the cost trends this is for non-utility for facility size system so residential small non residential and large non-residential and you could replace non-residential with commercial and you can see how the costs are really plummeted since since the beginning of the millennium and we expect kind of future v6 the modest cost reductions going forward into the future nextslide and this shows cost trends on utility side the difference between the blue and the red is the blue if you're basing it on what DC and the red is Watts AC and just so your the watt AC are typically smaller and so you come up with with a larger number but you can see costs are approaching a if you go from on the D if you count DC costs are approaching a dollar a dollar a watt installed so very getting very very price competitive on the utility side nextslide so an example of the Pickers pueblo they installed a community size system a couple years ago and are selling the energy to to their local co-op next slide so just to recap the resource you know varies from about global horizontal about six by three to six kilowatt hours reader squared over most of the mostly commonly United States various technologies described in terms of the capacity in terms of watts or kilowatts DC panel conversion efficiency typically tend to 22% facility size PV you can do pretty much all size scales utility down to really small distributed systems or or off-grid systems and you're kind of get some spatialization factors if you're doing a rooftop system and kind of plan on about 10 watts per square foot that you actually use usually can't you can't counter using your whole roof so usually the part or inch of the Sun assume you can use about two-thirds of it ground mounted for utility scale you're looking at about five to eight acres per megawatts DC and there's just explosive growth worldwide at both utility and distributed scales next slide all right we're going to go talk about wind energy and kind of go through the same three-step thing fortunately math is a little more complicated this is I think the only equation I'm going to torment you with the energy in the wind so if you imagine a straw moving wind the the power in that wind is is the value inside the parentheses so it's it's Rho AV cubed or rose your air density you know it is what it is you can't really do much about it at a particular location you will go in from say sea level to Denver where I'm located you do you know the density is about 20% less in at sea level so you will see that rotor area that's the swept area of your rotor and then the V Cube and that's velocity cubed you can see that your power output and that's over time your energy output is very very sensitive to your wind to your wind speed the efficiency is your C sub P and there's a kind of a theoretical limit of about 59 percent and might ask why and give you kind of a hand wavy argument basically you're trans wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of moving air particles into energy and so if you take all the energy if you could you essentially stop the air from moving and so we just pile up so you actually got to let it go but it let some go so that you can take the energy from me from the follow-on particles and so that's why you can't get 100% efficiency from from a turbine and again the stuff at the bottom just emphasizes that v-cube relationship if you're the wind speed increases by 25% power increases by a factor of two so the develop the utility scale developers especially are looking for the very windy sites if you're doing a facility scale you're kind of limited to the wind resource apps at that site and there's not much you can do to increase the wind speed except go with the taller tower nextslide so how much energy are powers in the wind these wind classes developed kind of historically but you can kind of and most people live in areas the vast majority from us live in areas with a wind class of one or two so if you're talking about a facility size system you're probably in that in that space so you're looking at say maybe a hundred watts per meter squared so if you imagine a straw with with a cross-sectional area of a meter squared you're going to you know just put in a ballpark average about a hundred watts of production um so just to give you a sense of how big you need to go as far as your rotor swept area to get significant amounts of energy so how do you calculate the power density you basically measure the wind speed and do some math is the short sweet answer and power density is basically we're dividing by area to just and that's what that's what the power density is is power divided by a next slide so wind characteristics various ways we describe the wind you know the average wind speed is obviously very important there's a wind speed distribution so Howard so you can have two sites with the same average wind speed but if you have different distributions they the power density will be different so the distribution does matter vertical wind shear that's basically how much the wind changes with height and so typically the higher you go the higher the wind speed you'll see direction where do the good winds which directions of the two the two of these strong winds come from you want to have good fetch and less ground clutter from those directions next slide diurnal wind distribution what time of day does do you tend to get the strongest winds seasonal distribution what time you know what parts of the year tend to see the strongest winds and they finally turbulence that's you can imagine that as being dustiness how gusty is the wind and if you're really turbulent you're going to your turbine is going to get beat up a bit more and you're going to pay a bit more an O&M next slide so a few of the big ones wink shared kind of gives an example of how the wind increases with with height its varies all over the place but you can see in this great example going from 5 meters to 50 meters the wind speed increases by about 25 percent you're going to see an see the wind speed double so so there is some motivation go taller and why weathers a big emphasis on tall towers next slide turbulence this is more for facility scale basically you can see the effect of an obstacle a house a tree a cow there's going to be a turbulent region downwind of that obstacle about 20 H and a downwind and about 2 H in height and so ideally you want your turbine to be above that that turbulent area and which is really hard to do in an urban area so it's not usually not recommended to do to try to do turbines in areas that have a lot of distributed when there is I have a lot of ground clutter like trees and buildings and whatnot next slide so this is a resource map good one is good site of the wind prospector you can kind of see the the wind belt going across the center of the country and you see that basically it's a lot more short there's a lot more short variation within short distances so that will be more clear in the next slide please so I'm like TV or unlike the solar resource which usually doesn't vary a whole lot with with distance the wind resource really can you can go a quarter-mile from the top of a hill to the bottom of a hill and see a very a significantly different wind resource and this just kind of makes that point so it's a lot harder to predict so when resources to give insight than it is than it is for PV next slide so our turbans care Rize that probably the big one is its power curve which basically shows how much power produces based on on the hub height wind speed so there's a cut in speed below which the turbine doesn't produce any power usually cut in is usually three to four meters per second production will increase very rapidly until the turbine reaches cut reaches its peak power then it will be flat or flat ish depending on the turbine and then when the wind speeds get high enough it will actually cut out to protect itself and so this is this is a key thing you typically want to look at when you're evaluating the wind turbine the gray line is efficiency and you can see that the efficiency will generally be highest in that shoulder part of the of the power curve which is actually where you do want the maximum efficiency because that's where it's most useful so next slide so how do you calculate energy production of a turbine so you have your power curve which is the black the black dotted line you have your wind speed distribution which is your blue line and you just basically take vertical strips and multiply them together so you multiply and you get your red which is your energy production for the year from that wind speed bin and so the area under the red is basically your total energy production so that's how it's shown graphically it's pretty easy to do in Excel assuming you can get a good wind speed distribution next slide technology trends kind of the big things in the US that you're seen is bigger rotors is probably the biggest thing and bigger on the chilly side bigger nameplate so the blue bars are the average nameplate capacity per year so 2018 is about 2.4 megawatts per turbine the blue triangles of power so the tower height has stayed pretty constant at 80 meters it's starting to increase a little bit in the last couple years for about the last ten plus years and that's mainly due to transportation issues it gets a lot more painful to to transport taller towers and so the developers hasn't felt the need to do it in Europe it's a somewhat different story and then probably the big story is just the the the rotor diameter is getting bigger and bigger over time and so you know you're seeing rotor diameters of 120 meters so basically the rotor would be longer than the diameter is longer than a football field now same thing is happening as far as increased rotor diameter is happening at the distributed scale as well next slide so this is the deployment trends the different colors show the different regions in the country so the per installations are happening in the interior which is basically the plane and you know there's been kind of where most of the installation be taking place in 2019 we did bust through 100 gigawatts of cumulative install capacity so that's over a hundred thousand megawatts and kind of expecting installations stay roughly about the seven to ten thousand by seven to ten gigawatts per year kind of going going forward loose them in the near term next slide cost trends you can see costs have come kind of gone down and up there was a trough in the early aughts was probably unsustainable the manufacturers worse we're selling them a kind of low cost than kind of if you went to 2010 one the dollar slid against the euro and just material prices there's a general increase in steel and everything increased peak around 20 2009 2010 and then cost of started coming down again in addition to these costs coming down there's been performance improvement so your levelized cost of energy is going down even faster than this is showing here but just kind of show you so your utility scale for a large project you can put it in for you know sixteen seventeen hundred dollars a kilowatt next slide shame has not been the the the case with distributed wind costs have been probably gone up a little bit or they went up a little bit between 2009 and 2011 and then event stable and it's a very smallest up to about 10 kilowatts they're having some performance improvements so the levelized cost of energy has gone down somewhat but your install costs have been kind of flat as opposed to you know facility scale PV which is which is plummeted in the last decade and this is kind of caused it caused this this small wind turbine marks to be kind of rather stagnant over the last few years next slide an example of a distributed wind project the Seneca installed a single 1.7 megawatt turbine some years ago and the website there can you can go there for a few more details next slide so just to recap wind the the resource varies you know by over an order of magnitude their spots that have less than 20 you know power density of less than 20 watts per meter squared to areas spots and have over 600 watts per meter squared most most people live in areas where it's under 200 watts per meter squared so that's if you're doing facility scale that's that's what you have the wind resource varies by height and is affected by severely affected by ground clutter typically they're described in terms of either their peak power of the rotor size you do utility and DG and market status utility side going gangbusters worldwide on the to be decided the markets been rather stagnant nextslide I want to spend the next few slides just kind of describing project types so your first one is off-grid pretty straightforward you have a load that's not on the grid at all and so whatever your energy system is whether it's a generator or wind turbine or PV facility that's what it gets and the electrons goes straight to the load so no no real complexity they're typically paired with a battery to firm it up a little bit behind the meter what's happened here is that your power source is connected on the customer side of the meter and so those electrons so the the green electrons go directly to the load and they will displace energy that that load would otherwise purchase from the grid and so you're basically competing against retail power and so the retail value the financial value of those of those electrons is basically whatever you would otherwise pay the utility ie retail value so the and this kind of describes it thanks Monica connected customer side of the meter your size can be really small one or two kilowatts DC to over a megawatt DC depending on the size of the load typically you're the it's not the the power facility is typically sized no larger than what it needs to serve the load so it's more of a cost-saving measure than then an economic development measure and you can you can pair it it's often not but you can to provide backup power if you're concerned about grid outages so those are pretty straightforward where you're directly physically connected to your load now we're going to get a little more complicated front of the meter projects where the power is purchase by specific person and so physically what happens is the electrons are just injected to the grid and they go where they go but at least contractually the energy is going to the load and so I thought the very large end you have large corporations like Google you know General Motors those actually doing PPAs to buy a utility scale wind and PV and contractually at least they're saving money even if the electrons aren't going directly from that project to to their loads going smaller there's what's called community gardens where you have one central system and you have multiple owners that get the bill credits or the benefits of that of that system so you can do one common thing is you buy a share of the system and then whatever it's produces its credit against your bill that's kind of one model there's more and so thus but lets people who would otherwise not be able to do PV at their homes because you know the orientation or because they live in apartment or whatever they can they can participate in PV to try to help out the the people at the you know with low-income people who still may not have the money to buy a share there's some some utilities will let people kind of by paying as you go pay as you go so you don't have to have any capital cost so it's a way for people who may not be able to do TV at their house or low-income to participate to get the benefits of solar next slide please the the downside of this I think I hit most of this and so what again this is virtually the electron you may not may or may not see the green electrons it's not allowed in all jurisdictions I really depends whether your utility wants to do it or whether the state mandates it or you know what you need one one or both of those systems for it to be to be able to participate in this but a lot of utilities are doing it the next slide and then finally have your utility-scale project where you're just like a coal plant or natural gas plant or some big plant where you're just feeding the grid and you're selling it to either utility or they mentioned a third party and basically you're more playing in this case in the wholesale market and so the value is more at the wholesale rate which might be you know as low as two cents you know you're talking two three four or five cents range rather than like the ten twelve fifteen cents you might see at the at the retail level next slide used to recap so I hit solar and wind technologies I talked about the resource the technology the market status both technology could be deployed at a variety of scales and with the exception of distributed wind both have seen dramatic cost reductions and all of them have seen the performance improvements and then I finally tried to drill a little bit more deeper into kind of the project types and when you would want to do one one over the other next slide I will take questions at the end to you James sings two things Tony excellent presentation a lot of good material packed in there and good job on time covering that all that in the initial period of time next we'll hear from dr. Stan dad to see oh yeah can you hear me okay yes your son great okay great yeah again my name is Dan at City providing just a brief overview of introduction to energy storage and quicktype storage in particular so I I'm actually with Sandia National Laboratories were located in Albuquerque we have the in NFA lab in Albuquerque is where I work 25 plus years Marshall engineering and so just wanted to point that out the program that I'm talking about me from Albuquerque New Mexico Sandia location next slide the Sandia has multiple sites as I've mentioned I'm at the Albuquerque Mike to a site we also have Livermore and other locations and in Hawaii Texas and Nevada next there are multiple energy storage research and development at Sandia all the way from materials to systems and grid analytics and we have shown my photo there in the park inversion system that a program that I lead which interfaces grid grid tied storage with various types of energy storage and I'm the person in between doing the power conversion and energy extraction we're using power electronics later I'll talk a little bit about demonstration projects and some grid analytics project next slide the energy storage program a lot of different activities the one of which is it program funded by the office electricity energy storage program that by dr. Emma joke the program is focus on advancing technology working with academia industry and others to to focus on energy storage performance and sustainability for decrypt electric grid also in the program is working with municipalities States and tribes Imre dr. Jacques is very eager to work with tribes and you see his quote they're achieving energy sovereignty through energy storage is an important aim of the program and we also have a web link if you're interested next slide I mentioned the grid this is what we're talking about the electric utility grid has been around for over 130 years starting in New York area and migrating towards the West including Alaska multiple voltages as low as 120 volt AC and above 500 kill both AC and a transmission distribution and just multiple systems thousands of generators millions of transformers just a lots of investment into this overall system which is the grid type and it could also be what we call micro grid they can either be tied to this main grid or it can be disconnected from the main grid and energy storage has a play in both of these areas next slide the electric utility industry they they have multiple applications and they typically put them in either energy or power charts like this that when you see there this is one from every there are things that happen very slow on the grid with slow energy related like for example village power can happen in hours renewable energy hours to you know that time thing would but much more higher power rating and then you have like power quality of the blue chart right there for example you have a voltage dip if you have a tribe has lousy power with outages and stuff they happen in the sub cycle regime in the blue area there and and the level of power rating varying from from various different power levels so they like the electric utility grid like to put these in a time frame and power rating and next slide in terms of energy storage technology therefore grid tight storage there are a number of them their electrochemical capacitors sometimes they call them super capacitors their electric magnetic devices that uses magnetic coils you have mechanical like flywheel energy storage a rotating mass producing energy thermal storage could be high temperature utilizing molten salt with concentrated solar power for example ice storage for low temperatures and most prominent is the electrochemical system a lot of systems out there are battery systems which we call non flow rechargeable batteries these or lead acid lithium ion Naik adds or some of the examples and we also have some flow batteries League bromine and others under grid and another example of electrochemical system of the peel fail and one other thing is that there are hybrid energy storage systems you could utilize a an energy battery couple that with a power high energy storage like electrochemical capacitors are solutions where super capacitors are combined with a lit acid battery for example the let acid battery takes care of the longer charge into discharge duration whereas the electrochemical pastures or super catheters because capacitors takes care of energy that are fast-moving so you can do a combination of those and that's why we call them hybrid to energy storage next slide similar to the electric utility community putting systems and and timeframe and power regime there's a similar plot that the energy storage industry utilizes the bottom is the system power rating module side versus discharge time the high energy super capacitors for example operates and the minutes regime but they are low power whereas compressed air energy storage are larger power and and they operate much slower and everything in between the flow batteries and let at the batteries in between and and this is what the energy storage community likes to do put them in certain bins if you will and there's always the thing about power and energy the power or fast energy storage that that handle fast moving electrons like the electrochemical pastures and magnetic devices compared to an energy device which is more pumped hydro compressed energy stores and some batteries handle energy storage so the key question has always been for the grid if you're if you have a grid application that you're focusing on what is the best battery for that particular application and this is this is one of the research and development questions that we go through is like is this going to be a power bad power energy storage or more energy or a combination between next slide we doctors joke actually initiated a deal with global energy storage database we have been collecting data we currently have over 1,600 projects which is a readily available whoever is interested you just go to death of this exchange website and you can download information of where energy storage have been deployed who has been involved what type of chemistry you can acquire you this thing so it's very useful information that you can gather and and that that's available to whoever wants to download this for free and do things there the point I like to make is that energy storage market is really increasing it's just the deployment of energy storage is is quite large in fact if you look at the green bullet there with Mackenzie the energy storage market is set to grow to a coup motive deployment of over 85 gigawatts by 2025 so they see a huge deployment of energy storage that are becoming online next slide I would love to provide just introduction on all the technologies that I talked before but due to the interest of time I can only do this to the battery I'm just doing this for a battery introduction just focus on that because it's quite prevalent on the grid battery storage on the bottom right you have cathode and anode separated by a barrier a separator that barrier what it does is it provides electric separation it keeps the electrons from moving one or the other but it's also permeable which means that they have ion passing back and forth during this chemical energy conversion process ions are passing back and forth through this barrier ultimately you are producing electrons once you produce electrons where the light bulb is it's typically tied to a power conversion with them to extract energy from the system on to the grid and likewise if a bi-directional system is what we call it we take power from the grid and recharge the thing so these are rechargeable system and it goes either way so most of these energy storage technologies that I talked about in the earlier slide ultimately they're producing electrons in different ways well once is produced and then it the those electrons are utilized by the electric utility grid in certain ways and application and the bottom left is the what we call the depth of discharge and we the life of the battery is typically utilize the battery cycle life is usually the lifetime of the battery is how we how we look at these things if you discharge them a hundred percent typically your cycle life the battery is diminished quite a bit but if you're discharging at a very lower percentage you can have a lot more cycle life meaning that you can do a lot more charges and discharges and whatever you need for the system so that you have to be mindful of that next light um the battery energy storage system has many elements starting from the left you have the battery storage themselves which comes in individual cells to Rack and then it has they typically have a battery management system which determines the voltage and current of the cell and the temperature it just keeps track of those cells and those that system is typically tied to a power conversion system which is bi-directional charge and discharge capability and the over overall thing is typically managed by an energy management system to determine what the grid want and what is needed for the overall system in it and a toss to the power conversion system and then you have a site management system synchronization is there an Eileen Dean Michael grid controls all that and then the overall package to the right is the balance of plant you have Trent is a tied to a transformer or not the overall container right system most of these large grid type battery systems are in container containerized transportable system so with all these bits and pieces it's very important to have a single entity responsible for the integration because you have multiple pieces putting together it's best done by a single person next slide this shows the energy storage kilowatt hour and install capacity circle there you have system pack module so if you look at the lithium ion for example lithium ion battery you notice 1995 these are the blue triangle 1995 above $2,000 per kilowatt down to below $500 per kilowatt in approaching $200 with a lot these days that is the trip and the cells themselves of becoming lower-cost the modules themselves and system costs are coming down there's a number of things on this slide here as the energy storage market energy storage research space is happening so fast there are a lot of technologies that are emerging so a newer type of technology obviously will have a higher cost and as they mature like for example lead acid battery systems a yellow dot is a mature technology has been around for decades and it's reached maturity and of course the cost would drop down the key question here when you're considering an energy storage depends on three three simple questions who are you how much are you going to buy and what what are you going to do do with this thing the who are you is important because you know if you're a big utility company well ready to buy an energy storage the battery company will give you some price breaks knowing that you're going to buy a lot so there's a there's a bulk rate like like buying a product from Target versus buying a bulk of products from Costco to get a per unit cost break by doing that and then how much you going to buy so it is there's you know the quantity and then the longevity are they going to buy more if the battery company sees that they seem to give you some price breaks so there's a lot going on with these numbers so you have to be very careful when looking at cost per kilowatt cost for install cause of LTE oh the levelized cost of energy even those have some disparity so you just have to be very careful when you're looking at cost next slide these are just some of the high-level benefits of energy storage reliability cloud control stability and all that one of the key things here is the last bullet increase the value of variable generation renewable generation renewable energy is available for example photovoltaic system is available to produce energy when the Sun is out when energy will produce energy when the wind is blowing so what happens in between and that's where energy storage comes into play - what what we call firming up the system so it's less variable that's what we use and if you compare if you're used to an energy storage system sometimes the question comes about how is it compared to a generator a diesel generator which you'll hear after this presentation you know energy storage are typically faster responding because there's no moving parts where is a digital generator has moving parts so it has a startup time all that kind of stuff going on it also can this energy source system can absorb power unlike the generators and you can also because you have a power conversion system you can emulate a generator you can be fast responding or you can slow it down to to make it respond like an actual generator so you have all these flexibility much better control compared to a energy generator next slide this is just examples of benefits to the grid earlier I showed the electric utility putting a certain application and power and time space this is just to give you an example high-level example frequently see control for example the electric utility grid is always trying to balance the source and load with the transmission did the wires in between it's always trying to balance it so if there are quick changes to that system let's say a big photovoltaic system is on on a reservation and all sudden the table comes through and all sudden the photovoltaic is non-existent the generators have to pick up that loss of of source so the the generator is now trying to pick up the frequency so energy storage can be utilized in that scenario it's kind of analogous to since I grew up on the nav already vation we used to have a car my uncle well we didn't own a car my uncle had his vehicle and when it hits a bump there's oscillation because we have bad trucks the car will oscillate and then once you buy new shocks once you get that bump again the car will stabilize so in a sense we're utilizing energy storage in a frequency control case as an electronic and electronic shock absorber and it just smooths that out you don't want perturbation like that you see on the right plot that's an example of a quick seconds regime type energy store health vision a longer duration is like peach shading very similar to arbitrage I don't get too technical here but peak shaving is looking at the load curve there's without energy storage there that's what happened and what you do is you charge the battery longer hours longer time frame using a technology that can accept an a power and energy type battery charge it during that night and then discharge it during the day so you don't have to pay P prices and you're discharging the battery at at the at the lower price if that is in essence a peak shaving application and longer duration application next slide here's another example a benefit to Navajo Nation we have a project with the Navajo tribal utility authority looking at various types of energy storage on the bottom right you have a photovoltaic system with a battery which is a bell regularly that let at the battery is typically used and and you have a they typically have a wind turbine a tiny turbine in a single-phase system 120 volts to supply power to that household and the bottom left shows the photovoltaic power the first from the left of the first bump on the left is very smooth indicating that there are no clouds in the sky and then the second bump you noticed a little bit of changes in that waveform that's due to a cloud that comes through in the afternoon late afternoon or something and then the same thing happening with the third bump so the first month basically when the photovoltaic is readily available you charge the battery and then when the when to win when the Sun Goes Down the power is reduced indicating by depth at the transfer of power their lower power from the photovoltaic you discharged your battery so this is a way to firm up the system otherwise when the Sun Goes Down there is no power that means there's no light in the house there's no power lecture utility power in the house this is a way to continue and broaden the availability of power by utilizing energy storage next slide please this is my last slide earlier I'd mentioned there are many different energy storage R&D activities including power electronics materials and one of which is the demonstration project this is run by my colleague dan borneo and also Ben Shenkman is involved in these projects and we are Sandia energy storage program is considered a third party independent analysis group we are not in it to make money we are not in it to profit off of this way but we provide technical assistance when tribes we do have some tribal project when tribes come to us and say we are considering photovoltaic on our system but what about energy storage do we really need energy storage can you look into that yes absolutely by by doing some what we call technical and economic analysis the technical piece determines how the energy storage is going to be used the economic piece will determine how much of a benefit financial benefit that you can gain by a coupling a photovoltaic to a battery system whatsoever and we provide that and it's and it's paid for by the energy storage program and other things involved with the RFP request for information a lot of times some of the tribes may not know what to ask for for a request for proposal and we help them out the team help them out to say for this particular application this is the type of energy storage you should be requesting and this is what you should consider in your request for information and then we back off and then the tribe makes their own decision and how to take that further they are informed and they have a more of an informed basis to to approaching the industry as they're requesting for poor proposals so we've helped them out with that and then a design and procurement support is offered and then the commissioning plant at the tail end of the of the the project and all that so the there are over 25 projects including some tribal projects that we have under this portfolio in the energy storage program that is my last slide and thank you for your attention and I look forward to the questions after day next an excellent presentation as well challenging to cut her all those stars technologies in this short period of time but good job and we'll ask you some questions here at the end next we're going to hear from Stan's colleague Ben Shenkman yes thank you James so I get to talk about diesel generators so let's go to the next slide this is just kind of an overview of what is in the slide deck we'll kind of discuss what is a diesel generator we will discuss some of the different type of generator the fuels basically gasoline natural gas propane some of the differences between them we'll also talk about the diesel generators and the grid where they usually set then we'll kind of talk about a little bit about the maintenance enhancements to these diesel generators and also at the very end we'll kind of go into what they have been doing lately with hybrid diesel generators specifically this one will be with energy storage next slide so let's just start talking about with what is a diesel generator typically all of us have seen a diesel generator either you own one have been buy one or you've actually heard one when you're walking by they're pretty loud so the history that comes behind this diesel generator is we had of course a guy by the name of Rudolf diesel I guess if you invent something you get to name it after yourself so he actually developed the diesel engine in the 1890s and at that time but we had four different type of engines or the steam engine and the gasoline engine the steam engine was producing about at 6% efficiency and the gas was doing at 12% so when he actually developed it it was at 26.2 percent which was tremendously high and it really revolutionized how engines were used to create electricity and by the end of 1912 they actuary had 70,000 of these diesel engines in place in working nextslide I'm not sure oh there - so guys start so this is lyft is kind of talked about and a diesel generator what is happening so on the far left you'll see the picture that says intake right there what you're doing is you're absorbing air into the into the piston here and at that point you're just getting the air in the next one is you compress it now when you compress the air it really heats up and gets really hot at that time that's where you have the next one is called power is where you actually inject the fuel into it and the heat from the air and the fuel create a combustion which pushes the piston back down and then now you have all you have left is exhaust which once again the piston goes up and it actually pushes the exhaust out so it's really simple on how this actually works so you can kind of see the four cycles there that's where you get this four-stroke if you ever hear that term on how diesel generators work next slide so if you've been inside of a powerhouse or actually if you've seen a diesel generator just sitting on the side of a building this is kind of what you will see now the one that's on the inside of them won't be inside of enclosure but this is actually looked inside that enclosure you kind of see on the far left that's actually the fuel tank that's where you actually house all the diesel for your generator usually this is about one to three days worth of fuel you'll have your alternator to excite the windings within the generator this helps out with providing the voltage and exciting the wires to actually produce the power what you would really see right there is on number one the engine that is actually the diesel generator itself so that's the engine that's pushing it and then what you have going forward is you have some sort of like genset which is basically like a magnet which that's actually producing the electricity so what we're talking about here is really that number one piece on this diagram the engine itself and that can actually be different types of fuel or different type of generators so that's what we'll go into now is kind of going into the different type of engines that we can put there so our first one is diesel versus gasoline now this one is actually I was kind of comparing for cars in this sense because we're just talking about the engines so if we go to the next slide I'm sorry we did we're kind of going into the different advantages of each one as you can see diesel it evaporates a lot slower than gasoline so you're not losing it as much has a higher boiling point than even water actually now when you're refining a like oil into these different fuels diesel is actually kind of the byproduct while you're trying to create gasoline so it's actually kind of the waste but it's actually because of demand and supply that it has a cost to it now diesel actually has a higher density than gasoline about 30% more diesel generators require less maintenance in frequencies but once you do have that maintenance it is quite costly compared to the gasoline one and also diesel is less hazardous to start a fire than a gas but now let's look at the gasoline engine it is lighter and more compact that's why you see more cars using gasoline engines for the smaller vehicles because it is lighter it is higher in a fuel efficiency and it doesn't have to be as robust as a diesel generator the fuel we have seen at gel in cold cold temperatures so sometimes you even have to keep the diesel fuel heat it when you're in a very harsh climate the maintenance cost on the gas are cheaper and it usually has a faster response to load changes next slide now we'll just kind of go in from gas to the natural gas generators which is typically this is the two that you see that people have to choose from these are the same stuff the advantage of the diesel versus the advantage of the natural gas generator the diesel generator actually has a higher efficiency about fifteen to twenty-five percent and this is according to Generac which is a large generator company the lifespan of a diesel generator is longer so once you install this it will last longer than natural gas generators the capital cost expenditure is about eight hundred fifty six dollars per kilowatt versus the natural gas which is right around nine twenty to a thousand dollars per kilowatt so if you don't have a lot of money when you need to put generators down a lot of people move to the diesel just for the initial cost but the actual diesel has a higher one em coughs than the natural gas looking at power plants type size you'll get about four dollars and eighty cents per megawatt hour for diesel burst the natural gas which is about two dollars and eighty cents per megawatt hour for O&M once again diesel has a lower hazardous to start a fire it actually has no spark plugs or wires such as the gas engine or the natural gas on-site fuel supply is easier for diesel verse natural gas now if you do live in an area where you do have natural gas utilities it is recommended that you should look at the natural gas generators just because they can be combined with cooling heat and power so you can increase the efficiencies this cost of fuel is typically cheaper except lately with what's going on it's kind of becoming it's still cheaper but you know diesel right now is pretty cheap so it's just something to think about the emissions of the natural gas generator are also less so the sulfur nitrogen carbon dioxide are considerably low compared to the diesel now when you have loads that are really moving around diesels are better at the transient they actually have because how robust in the heavy equipment that they use they can respond a lot easier to a transient load versus a natural gas generator not gas generators typically one just run at a hundred percent or around 80 percent all the time they don't like to move around too much as much unless you are a very large natural gas speaker plant next slide now I just kind of put this in here because we do see some of these propane generators which is almost same thing as the natural gas dinner but when you're using propane we usually see these at homes or telecom type applications they are very small they run pretty efficient they're very quiet and you just don't see typically a lot of these propane generators but we have seen them in the past and they typically do run because they are quieter and it's a lot easier to get some of the fuel to the places besides diesel so go to the next slide will actually talk about diesel generators where they actually reside in the grid itself and the first thing you have to know is there are different types of ratings when you look at a diesel generator the three typical ratings that you see is prime power continuous power and standby backup power majority of the times you will see in buildings such as hospitals of data centers any place that has backup power is the typical place you will see diesel generators now if you do have like an island grid or your off-grid typically that's when you'll see a prime power to a diesel generator what happens here is these winning have a prime power generator they typically can follow the load so they go up and down they also come with like an overload capacity so when you what I mean by overload capacity capacity is if the load is greater than the rating of the diesel generator it can do this for about one hour out of a 12 hour cycle of operations so you typically want to run this around 70% all the time and it can follow the loads continuous power is if you run a diesel generator it's not really trying to follow the load what it's trying to do is just run at 100% all the time kind of like a base load generator it's just going to provide let's say you have a hundred kilowatt diesel generator it's just going to provide 100 kilowatts all the time and you have other type of generators that would follow the load so if your loads are going up and down a different type of generator would follow that and what we have a lot of us seen is a standby backup power generator it's mostly like I said a lot of place we need emergency powers or any type of backup power with these units you don't really get any type of overload capability and usually do not run these in parallel with if you are connected to a utility grid usually you'd have some sort of transfer switch which would switch you from the normal power being the utility over to the diesel generator during an emergency outage next slide now where are these generators actually located so when we're talking about the prime power generator we're looking at the top left there this is actually a military base or it could be just an island grid that's where you'll see some of these prime power generators being used now if we go to the grid you will sometimes see like a diesel power plant as the main source or for micro grid they're larger I mean it's a big power plant type building if you look at the bottom left that's what we were talking about for a standby backup generator that would be a hospital and once again it would most likely disconnect from the utility before it would turn on and we've seen a couple of them at homes majority of the ones that we see at homes are off-grid type homes that we see these at but some homes do have a backup generator and such as a generator or something next slide so now we kind of get into the maintenance here a little bit next slide please so what you have here is a maintenance schedule this one is actually from a manufacturer which is on the far right here it's from comments so the two or three different ways you can look at is there's a NFPA 70 B or NFPA 110 which has recommended maintenance record recommendations what you do there is they have stuff such as the maintenance of frequency which is stuff like it talks about weekly monthly quarterly half a year each year and then every three years so what you have here let's go to NFPA 110 they would actually weekly to check for leaking fluids inspections of hoses fuel level oil levels and coolant levels so it does talk about where you actually want periodic maintenance to happen and there's also test frequencies so you have something like we can do a load Bank test or under load which we'll talk about in the next slide so if you can go to the next high please load bank testing is basically putting your generator under load when you turn it on we've seen too many times going out into the field where people do not do monthly maintenance on their generators and then when they actually lose power the generator does not start so it is highly recommended to do some sort of testing with your generator on a periodic basis as monthly and we say to do it under test basically when I mean our test I mean under load so what you want to do there is as you see here is a load bank which you would just turn on and run your generator and it's usually at higher than 33 percent vote it as that's to prevent wet stacking basically wet stacking is when you have unburned fuel and is staying within your system and it causes a lot of efficiency problems firing problems it basically starts killing off your generator faster and faster so if you are having a diesel generally put it under a load bank test monthly this would be like going on if you do not put it under load going out and start in your car and never putting into here so you could know your car would start but you don't know when you put into gear if it would actually go so this is highly recommended as a maintenance program next slide so diesel dinners have been around for quite a while so I was going to talk about just some of the fuel enhancements that diesel generators have done since then the ultimate goal for diesel generator is to improve fuel efficiency and to decrease the emissions that occur so what we've seen lately is as better fuel injection transfer from the tanks to the valves they have in now this is not according to the deal generator but they've been removing a lot of the sulfur from the fuel itself that actually clogs up your generator so the fuel itself is being enhanced they've changed the controls from analog to digital now by doing an electric digital you can bring in a lot more feedback into your controllers which allows you to optimize the operation now the generator by optimizing it you can actually increase your fuel efficiencies you can increase your life cycles it actually overall it makes your generator better this is exactly what's happening with cars to Boeing the computerized type systems and cars it does increase fuel efficiency and the power output that you can get from your engines and also for the emissions that are coming out we have exhaust gas recirculation and selective catalytic reduction basically this is just being increased all the time for filtration of the greenhouse gases that actually are being emitted into the atmosphere next slide so we're going to go on a hybrid diesel generator which is actually the part where they're starting to tie diesel generators with other type of sources for this one I am going to talk about the energy storage hybrid system and what you see here is on the top right you see the AC diesel generator and it goes into some sort of controller which is there in the gray box that is named the hybrid controller which are sitting there in the blue boxes is an ac/dc inverters so on the bottom right you know you can kind of see the wind or PV that you can bring in and that's optional on to the DC bus where the batteries are tied to with these systems if you do have like a DC sort of load you can actually connect it to these hybrid systems but majority of people use it for the AC so the green lines that are coming out of the inverters itself are the AC power so this is one type of AC diesel generator set up let's go to the next slide you can see that now we've taken oh sorry little too much you go back one so here what you're seeing is that top right diesel generator is now instead of producing AC power it's producing DC power so by producing DC power all your generation sources are now on the DC input to the actual inverters some parts about this is the DC generator can now directly charged the batteries without going through some sort of conversion from the from the inverter converting it from AC to DC so it becomes more efficient by doing this now the AC generator on the other hand could by itself power the whole system on the AC side so if you had to work on one of the inverters you could actually turn those off and have the AC generator go in so this one you would not be able to do that everything is funneled through the inverter itself even though it's more efficient you do now have a failure point so if you lost one of those inverters you would actually lose the power that's coming out next life so the question becomes why would you even look at a hybrid system now in a hybrid system you can see that running the generator now you reduce it by sixty percent and the diesel fuel though this was done in one study where they actually saves out a month's 528 gallons so by saving 528 gallons this system would pay itself off in about six or seven years so it's kind of showing that by saving the fuel in the runtime and the maintenance on your generators you will actually have a better payback by putting one of these systems and it also reduces the co2 measure outside and the noise pollution so by using batteries along with a diesel generator you get quite a bit of benefit for doing this now there are some companies that provide a diesel generator and hybrid type system they're still kind of costly they're still new to the market so I would say not all the bugs have been taken out of them but a lot of them have most people right now when they're doing a hybrid system they'll use something like Stan was talking about a battery that would just be connected to the system and they would have a diesel generator on the side and they'd just be running in parallel together so that's typically what we're seeing performed out in industry right now so these systems that you're seeing here are more still conceptual they are new they are starting to be put into different places and the controls are being built around them so in the future you will see more these systems coming to solution I believe that's all I have on diesel generators you yes thank you thanks Ted thanks Ben excellent presentation I appreciated their comparison with the other sorts of fuels fuel jet fuel generation sources and then last like we had kind of a transition there with the compression and the combustion excuse me of fuels we get heat so now we got opportunities for combined heat and power so our last presentation here we have Gil McCoy talking about CHP opportunities welcome yet thank you James yeah we're going to get go a little bit further than just talking about diesels in this presentation we're going to also talk about other types of what we call prime movers or producers of electricity and then we're going to talk about recovering and beneficially using the waste heat from the combustion process next slide please we're going to give an overview of combined heat and power itself talk a little bit about how the efficiencies associated with this technology are achieved we're going to talk a little bit about resiliency and a little bit about the performance characteristics of the different combined heat and power technologies and then finally we're going to talk about emerging trends what's kind of new and on the horizon and then lastly we'll talk about technical assistance that's available to you from the Department of Energy at no cost next two slides please yeah combined heat and power like diesel engine generator itself it is a mature technology as a matter of fact it was a way to go in the 20s before electrical grids were built out and the Department of Energy maintains a database of CHP projects nationwide and they have over 80,000 listings so it's a mature technology it's proven and it's comprised of of what we call distributed generation that's kind of the new term uh but its generation at the sight of a thermal host so it's an integrated electricity generating and waste heat recovery project usually it's located at or nailart near a building but the CHP project can involve a district heating loop where you serve dozens or even hundreds of buildings and obviously the CHP project is supplying a portion of the electric load which may be used on site of the electrical generation may be used on-site or sold to the local utility the thermal energy can use for be used for space heating process heating hot water heating do you humidification or about other you know other types of applications but the bottom line takeaway from this slide is CHP uh is more efficient generally than conventional generation we're showing a combined power plant and boiler efficiency of 50% CHP comes in that maybe 75 percent or better and so CHP at a given site has the ability to provide efficient energy with cost savings and emissions reductions because less fuel is required next slide please now this example kind of walks you through how the efficiency benefits occurred on the conventional cane ish we're looking at 94 units of fuel being provided to a power plant with a 32 percent efficiency including transmission and distribution losses to provide 30 units of electrical energy below that we're showing 56 units of fuel being used in an on-site boiler with an 80 percent efficiency to give you a combined efficiency of 50% and to get achieve the load requirements of this site the conventional plant would require 150 units of fuel a CHP project with a 75% efficiency would require only 100 units of fuel consumption and what that means is not only fuel savings cost savings but also less greenhouse gas emission reductions next slide please [Applause] now what about the thermal energy how can that be used can certainly be used for space heating domestic hot water heating laundromats or washing serious our grade thermal hosts within the industrial sector a lot of times we're looking at recovering waste sheet in the form of steam for hospitals we look often either steam or hot water for space and water heating sometimes steam is used for humidification control and sterilization of instruments a great sites for CAHPS includes pools or spas or aquatic centers which you often find at hotels schools of recreation centers or casinos up in alaska and the northern climates a thermal energy is often used for freeze protection for both water supply systems and wastewater treatment flows and finally in the hotter climates thermal energy can actually be used with absorption chillers to provide for space cooling or even refrigeration a next slide please so what are the benefits of the CHP of potential energy efficiency depending on utility rates and the difference in the cost of electricity versus natural gas and dependent upon load requirements higher efficiency usually translates into lower operating cost even with maintenance costs are taken into account you can come up with reduced pollutant emissions at your site and more recently the value of energy reliability and resiliency at critical facilities has really been emphasized and that's because with the recent spate of hurricanes and whatnot we've had a lot of instances where backup diesel generators at hospitals and other critical facilities have not started operating as long as they were needed and CHP is a way of bringing in additional reliability redundancy and resiliency and then sometimes utilities will want to selectively locate CHP projects to reduce grid congestion and avoid the cost of distribution system enhancements next slide please and the next one a lot of options when you look at a CHP system the last time we talked about the different kinds of fuels and the properties of the fuels uh besides diesel engines or reciprocating engines we might also look at combustion turbines micro turbines steam turbines fuel cells or organic rankine cycle or what they call bottoming cycle turbines and then of course the heat recovery from the CHP project can you be used at a number of different applications so when you go in and look at a site in its potential for CHP you look at fuel supply availability and cost you look at the prime mover type depending on whether you want to produce steam or hot water and then finally you look at the thermal modes that are present at a given site and their coincidence with the electric loads and lastly we consider the avoided cost if we produce a like electrical energy what would the utility uh pay for the surplus next slide please [Applause] now different prime movers uh tend to come in different size ranges the reciprocating engines we tend to see them used in applications going from ten kilowatts up to ten megawatts and that's for a single generator if you Shack multiple generators at a given site you can go even higher of the smallest project I've been involved with personally as a seven and a half a kilowatt engine genset a few of sells five kilowatts up to three megawatts I've been involved with the fuel cell that was rated at one point five kilowatts which basically could serve the needs of a large residential unit fuel cells unfortunately still have high of very high first cost and installation cost micro turbines are great hot water generators as our reciprocating engines and they can go from 30 kilowatts up to about a megawatt that would be five two hundred kilowatt modules in a single shipping container and those shipping containers can actually be stacked you can consider microcell turbines even in a multi megawatt application a gas turbines or combustion turbines can run on fuel oil they can run on natural gas they tend to rate range in size from one megawatt all the way up and generally these are used where you want to produce steam so you see a lot of this type of technology in a campus district heating systems or serving industrial processes the finally steam turbines you see these in industry you see these in biomass you know field combustors where high pressure maybe superheated steam is produced and then run through either a condensing turbine or a condensing extraction turbine to meet on-site load on-site loads and provide load following capability uh uh next slide please now there is an economy of scale with respectable CHP projects what that means is bigger is cheaper from the standpoint of the cost of producing electrical energy uh you tend to get economies of scale with respect to equipment cost and installation cost or dollars per kilowatt of generating capacity installed you tend to get better heat rates or higher electrical generating efficiencies with larger equipment uh maintenance costs might go down a lot of times the larger equipment you can get better prices on your natural gas you can buy transport gas or interruptible natural gas and the bigger project will justify the cost of putting in an underground fuel storage tank and providing a backup fuel of our on-site resiliency needs and then sometimes you have advantages in terms of financing or permitting for the larger projects versus some of the smaller projects let's look at emerging trends a next slide please well the first is there's a huge interest right now uh in packaged combined heat and power uh industry has put in a lot of CHP in the past pardon me but more recently we're seeing CHP being installed in student housing multifamily apartments aquatic centers hotels motels automotive dealerships YMCAs and there's a lot of these small sites that do have coincidence electrical and thermal loads the goal with a package CHP project is to have the prime mover and the waste heat recovery provided as an integral pre-assemble item shipped on a skid or in an enclosure like a shipping container what you want to do is avoid costs associated with a site-specific engineering and design and you also want to avoid delays uh the the term you hear bandied around a lot is plug and play a ship the CHP project to the site uh undertake the electrical interconnection which is fairly straightforward with inverter technologies hook up the heat recovery assist system you know usually to the same system that would be deployed with an original hot water or steam boiler and then hook up the fuel supply and hopefully in a very short period uh be ready to commission you know the CHP powerplant next slide please well Department of Energy provides a number of services to those interested in CHP and one of them is what they call their CHP II catalog a catalog has performance information on package CHP systems uh you know they have data on fuel consumption as a function of load electrical output thermal output as a function of load a catalog can direct you to equipment manufacturers and distributors and better yet CHP service providers and installers in the vicinity of your host site next slide please another thing we're starting to see it's not a new technology but it's one that's kind of being rediscovered is combining CHP with greenhouses and the bandhas benefit now that people are starting to realize is they're really three uh streams of benefits from your CHP project one is the electrical energy production that can be used in conjunction with the greenhouse you know grow lights or tunable LED lights the second is the waste heat recovery that can heat the greenhouse and the third is providing a co2 rich in atmosphere that can basically enhance growth rates and increase crop for action and really even in northern climates provide an extended or even year-around growing season so we hear the term sustainability with respect to energy you can also look to sustainability in terms of food production a next slide please this slide is actually showing a CHP project associated with a greenhouse and this particular project is located in Delta British Columbia and showing that you know you can combine CHP with greenhouses and back up withers even in climates that are pretty far north next slide please another term you hear bandied about a lot now is micro grids a lot of interest in California because communities have been losing power access to utility power due to fire hazards and as mentioned earlier a micro grid basically enables a a community or thermal load an electrical load to Island or operate independently the utility grid some of them would Island periodically or intermittent when they lose utility powers other micro grids would be designed to operate independently the utility at all times and this is also not a new idea we see this up in Alaska they call it village power they don't have a extensive grid network in the in the state of Alaska and so remote villages have have been micro gridding for a long time and basically the background about phone of their a electrical generation system and heat recovery and distribution system is usually combined heat and power projects lately we're seeing a lot more interest in combining CHP with solar and wind resources uh fuel prices Alaska are very high so if they can build a wind generating facility into their a remote village power system they could basically use less fuel you know either at the end users or at the CHP power house itself the remote you know village power systems with solar and wind contributions often also consider energy storage both thermal storage as well as electrical storage and of course you need control systems for that and another new aspect that's coming into play is basically a data vehicle charging and of course using the battery systems on the vehicles to feed back into the grid on during times when the cost of providing the energy is high bottom line though is the CHP system is often the backbone when you're coupling it would intermittent resources that really makes use of the flexibility that the CHP project has to load follow and provide backup and support services when needed next slide please so the bottom line is what you're looking at is integrating CHP solar wind projects and battery storage projects in the optimal manner and the NREL is designing a tool that basically makes recommendations as to the optimum combination of technology that would be appropriate a given site that's tools called reopening it with the Northwest CHP tap and would love to test it in conjunction with a tribal project a CHP and microgrids I mentioned flexibility resiliency and another thing that sometimes can be brought into a CHP project is it it can be fueled by a renewable fuel like a anaerobic digester biogas with the biogas either being generated from food waste or from a wastewater treatment plant next slide please so key benefits of the CHP project can provide in addition to just cost-effectiveness include reliability and resilience a CHP is ideal and Remote Grid applications M CHP is very very good with respect to being able to integrate with both Internet and solar in wind generating technologies next slide please I just wanted to give an example of a CHP project serving a casino this is a two megawatt project or two thousand kilowatts this particular project has anaerobic digesters on-site they take food waste in from the casino and a lot of times plants like this would take waste in from you know nearby food processors sometimes digesters can have their bio gas output supplemented by what's known as fats oils and greases or fogs collected from local rest a fog is a wonderful fuel and produces a tremendous boost and biogas production but I just wanted to point out with a 2,000 kilowatt capacity project if you had a utility rate of 10 cents per kilowatt hour oh I'll pick that because it's easy uh the electrical benefits of that project amounted to hundred dollars per operating hour at full output or forty eight hundred dollars per day and that gives you an idea why how and why these projects can be cost effective and it also gives you some understanding as to why maintenance and high availability and capacity factors are important if you got a project you wanted to operate continuously and hopefully in full power output next slide please and the next so how do you go about getting started and understanding if you have a an opportunity for combined heat and power at your particular site uh first contact your combined heat and power technical assistance partner and in a few slides I'll give you phone numbers for all the states uh you know for all of the taps in the country when you contact the tap they'll want to gather site information they'll want to look at probably at least a year's worth of utility billing both for electrical energy and for natural gas or liquid fuels they want to understand not only use some coincidence abuse but cost uh at no cost will conduct an initial screening uh to kind of determine if CHP has a potential to be viable at your site will then send you a screening letter and if the project looks like it might be feasible we can then provide advanced technical assistance help you size a project select a prime mover site based on your site specific characteristics and again these service these services are available at low cost and finally as a project moves through the development pipeline we can also conduct design reviews again at no cost next slide please this is basically summarizing a CHP project we looked at at a health center uh at Casa B which is a small Alaska town or village north of the Arctic Circle and they have a lot of wind energy at that site over the connected we looked at a health clinic we looked at sizing a project for the clinic but then because this is a remote village with a public CHP power house in operation uh we talked with the local utility to basically look at ways that they could work with the clinic to provide waste heat at the clinic site and maybe provide a low cost utility bulk purchase power to the CHP project which would reduce generating a cause for the CHP project you know what we're looking at here is really a win-win type of arrangement uh that in this case might involve fuel shifting from number one to number two fuel-oil both purchase utility oil which doesn't include various types of taxation and then waste he'd provided to you know the health center for me the Riu Tillet ii project located at the health center or building a district heating lube to the health center next slide please so bottom line whenever we look at a project uh we're not necessarily trying to disconnect from the electric utility sometimes a partnership with the utility is beneficial and definitely you want to contact the local utility early on to understand reach back up a ratchet charges net metering possibilities uh you know internet interconnection requirements etc bottom line is we want to cost-effective project with a win-win solution if possible next slide please there are a lot of resources available uh from the Department of Energy contact your local combined Eaton power technical assistance partnerships will do a CHP screening analysis uh we can point you towards case studies of CHP sites at facilities similar to yours and then lastly we can look at advanced technical assistance and sometimes we look at emissions err permitting co2 reductions given to going to CHP we can do lifecycle cost analyses sensitivity analyses whatever is needed to move a project down the road towards development next slide please and my last slide is contact information here are the phone numbers from your CHP tap representatives for all the continental US states and Alaska and Hawaii and again it's a no-cost service put us to work I'll make make use of us because you might have a you know a good and cost-effective project at your installation well thank you I think still another excellent presentation I love the CHP topic it's always so interesting and applicable in unique ways so it's pretty cool to see those examples we do have time well we're over we're over are a lot of time but our speakers have agreed to stick around for a few minutes so we do have time to a couple of the questions that we have let's get to those now first one floating solar panels this is probably for Tony did do you see a future application for those is there is that a growing market segment it's done yeah if you have the space on a lake or some sort of sheltered body of water it can mount them on you know a raft or a barge or whatever this only can be done I expect it might be cheaper than Grand Mountain but I I don't really know the details of it except I know that it has been done and it's being done yeah okay thanks Tony going on to storage end of life issues and recycling issues can you can you talk about any of any of that obviously is all sorts of batteries so maybe just you know touch on the highlights and then friend yeah so in a life yeah we are looking at various technologies with the electrochemical group we actually in the energy storage program both have the electrochemistry guide along with the parla chronics one of the things were looking into is a power conversion system that can accept multiple types of energy storage that could be integrated to the grid and it could be at various life of the battery including end of life how can we we're asking questions like how can we extract the usable energy by utilizing advanced controls for power electronics to do so so the days are at the early stages of research that we're looking into right now and we're right in the middle of it thanks Deb um question here on diesel generators um probably need a rough answer but what's the what the cost are we talking about for a diesel generator so we made money on it damn right on England $800 per kilowatt is what you're looking at if you need a budget line item okay you have to say you're looking at a CHP project with the waste heat recovery total installed cost more likely you're talking 20 200 228 $2,800 per KW and again it depends on the project size sir thank you um another question for you and you talked about technical assistance that could be available to tribes I don't I don't have what it was called here but I'm helping with our eyes and and that sort of thing how would tribes access that or apply for that we have a different process in the office of Indian energy the office of Indian energy has a more of a formal process which has a webpage provide asking for technical assistance on microgrids or whatever and lisanna is the one that works on that and determines how and when de to assist a tribe the energy storage system is left formal and the amount of help and the amount of assistance provided it depends on the availability of resources that year so it's not unlimited resource we are limited in we look into a project and strategically look into to how feasible is this how far is this project going to go those kind of things and we prioritize that way so it's a little bit less formal process than than the office of Indian energy so sounds like this connected to yours reach out to the office in some way and yeah probably the best way to talk to me you have my contact information okay okay oh because they can gain they can also put in a formal TA request through the office of Indian energies website and then stand and I can coordinate that as well that might be another option actually that's probably a much better option because you get to get both eyes of the office of Indian energy along with the energy storage program looking at it and making the best decision based from there so that's that's the best that's that's the best option actually wonderful thanks Kay um fuel cell technology cost dropping is that that anything that we're seeing or is that kind of a mature technology and that's question for me uh anybody who hadn't had hundred I think I briefly touched upon he said feel felt right yes yes yeah I briefly mentioned that but I it's not part of the energy storage program so I just have old data on that which is you know it is that those the data is pretty much outdated right now and you know these are systems that that used to be a fuel cell program a while back but that the you know I just have all information on that so I don't have the most current information you does anybody else have any thoughts on fuel cells that are cost dropping out there in that technology that I think are still drop I'm going first this is Gil I'll just add a few comments on fuel cells they they are expensive that little 1.2 kilowatt system I looked at probably had an equipment cost of 12,000 dollars and total installed cost which was even higher than that maybe $20,000 for larger scale systems you might get down to five to seven thousand dollars per KW the fuel cells though do have a very high electrical generating you know efficiency a you know compared to other diesel engines or the gas turbines another aspect of fuel cells is a lot of times you have to treat or condition the bio gas or the natural gas that you're going to run through the fuel cell for natural gas just to remove the the odorant that's added to the natural gas so that people can smell and detect a leak of fuel cell stacks or subject to fouling you know if the gas is not properly conditioned but you know I do know the the Pacific C HTP tab down in California is very active with the respective fuel cell installations and they are cost effective down there thanks go let's take one more question here and then and then we'll wrap it up things for everybody stand up given the proliferation of gasification base CHP around the world why do you believe the growth in North America has been much slower certainly a Gila question well you know it's CHP has been growing I don't have the numbers on my on the tip of my tongue but we had a CHP meeting recently and we talked about the number of new projects and and new capacity that's been brought on my nationwide CHP is is in competition with other resources you know I'm located out of the Northwest CHP tab and it's a tough sell here because you know utility hydropower is very inexpensive in other parts of the country natural gas costs are gone down a natural gas you know utility scale combined cycle systems are out there and producing energy at low costs uh in the northwest we actually are kind of awash in surplus energy due to decrease low growth in large part due to energy efficiency project conservation projects coming online and of course we saw the lines for solar solar costs are declining uh so that's why we do the analysis we look at CHP relative to the cost of other opportunities to an end user and try and help folks decide what makes sense for them and what might offer substantial serving of savings not only in the short term but in the long term great okay thanks Gil um for that let's let's wrap up here we appreciate everybody staying staying on audience and presenters as well so we're always interested in receiving feedback on this training and the webinar series in general so please do provide us status if you have feedback to provide here on this final slide we have the remaining webinars of the 20/20 series the next webinar titled how to select energy projects
