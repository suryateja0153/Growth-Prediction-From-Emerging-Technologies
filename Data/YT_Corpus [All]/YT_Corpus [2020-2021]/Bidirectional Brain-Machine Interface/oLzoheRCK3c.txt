 hello everyone good afternoon I know it's difficult to be back after the coffee digitate let me take you a journey of what is it we do and probably link it to how is it we use the graph database like near for J's how many of you are from the data center IT backgrounds oh handful so probably this would click lot more with you guys in terms of what we do can you just dim the lights a bit if I ask you to imagine some of these scenarios which happens at the data center side of it from the operation side of it imagine that you are a utility organization and you have a couple of hundred new Janey's contractors employees joining you on weekly basis imagine you are the head of IT operations and you have a flurry and a storm of alerts happening in your data center because of the sheer size of that and maybe 45 to 50 alerts every minute but someone has to look at that monitor imagine you're a retail company and your website goes down for few minutes and imagine the same scenario happening during the Black Friday Thanksgiving sale what happens imagine you're a bank and you run a couple of hundred thousand batch job transactions every night so that you can ensure every branch of your bank opens at time every morning at ATM imagine you're the head of SCP operations for a large utility organization and you were just made to realize that you have not been billing close to 150,000 customers of yours on time every month does it sound little scary that's what we have been seeing in some of our customers places and that's kind of made us think that the main problem is at the enterprise IT side of it on one side the scale of the technology components you have in your IT data center is running into a hundred thousand components now the complexity is deep the kind of diverse equipments being used at your IT data centers at every possible layers the kind of different vendors coming up the different versions you have been using up over there is humongous and on the other side every stakeholders of yours expect everything to happen on time right now right here kind of a thing no one wants to wait at all I mean a very simple example if I am working on my laptop and suddenly something pop-up and says you need to change your password I'm not gonna wait for a few hours so that I can do a password reset I would like it to happen now and with the regulatory requirements cyber threats things are becoming more and more complex and we started realizing the whole issue is on this unmet need of what's happening on one side everyone wants a predictable proactive agile reliable and a silent enterprise no one wants to see what's happening and everything should happen smooth up over there but the overall reality what we see over there is far from what the truth is over there things are sluggish look at the ite the way it happens today everything is reactive and something fails for managing different kind of technologies organizations have been kind of putting different managers operators orchestrators different tools and that's how things have been happening and then my favorite Murphy's Law come in picture I know who found that but the famous 80/20 Murphy's rule how many of you have heard that the famous 80/20 rule that 80% of your problems in your organization's are actually human errors may not be created generated by human but maybe because someone just missed it and think of the same organization which I just asked you to imagine if there are 45 50 alerts every minute is it humanly possible to monitor all of them it's okay to miss one or two here and there but the moment you missed a critical one that's it everything is reactive the way quality of operations are things were supposed to go beyond what it is so we thought of something I mean Tara consultancy services we have in industry since last 50 years managing lot of IT operations globally we are a large organization half a million people and we thought there has to be some smarter way of doing things and I will you rightly said most of the technologies which people talk about these days is a IML deal and we also thought let's go that way and being the star war fans our self being the matrix fans ourselves with all our something let's go on that particular side of it how many of you are star or feds that's it I thought more people would be Straub our fence may the force be with you we also thought of an AI and we thought if there is a smarter AI way of doing things up over there and that's what after working on it for close to five and a half years in our so called garage and Pune India we launched a product called igneel in 2015 that's our answer to the world if you know about the other AI is the logic was very simple human brain is quite powerful and if I have been managing the data center IT operations of the world over the years if I have been managing sfe operations if we have been managing the batch workload management operations or community procurement and we have that kind of skill with us knowledge with us can I actually train any eye to do that job for us we combine the overall machine learning and all the other technologies to kind of help the ingenious I mean I will I will did a really good job and he was talking about the different organizations were trying to send human beings to Mars finding the cure of cancers and other things we're not doing those yet but we are doing our fair bit to this society especially in the IT guys life by reducing his pain minutes over there we are trying to ensure we're a CIO of IT or a VP of Phi T Anders here more office every morning he doesn't look at a graph which is read he can actually go grab a cup of coffee chart and probably afternoon lunch he can have at a golf course with a friend or a colleague office we are trying to ensure that things in his life and his team's lives kind of become better sounds nice thank you some of the examples when I asked you to imagine let me show you some of the things which we have done with few of our customers the first example which I'm taking is from a large media analyst company and most of us probably would have responded to their media some point in our life for the other on one side we worked with them to look at their overall patch which is the window patch process sounds simple but when we started going into that journey realize it was quite complex while we made the whole thing simple agile for them we also realized working with them over a few months that we were saving close to 1.5 million dollars for them every month and there was a reduction of almost 85 to 90 percent in their overall manual efforts in the whole of space the second example in that is from a large European bank we worked with them we looked at the way change happen in that organization every time they get new set of processes new people who join them any new acquisition of merger they did up over there any new technology they want to insert and we went into the overall logic of what if and if what analysis before you run the process we can actually look at the whole thing run it in a simulation environment and can tell you if this process runs in a real time what failures would you see and what is that you need to do to make those Corrections the third example is from a utility organization the same and I asked you to imagine where couple of hundred employees joins every week when we work with them we realized the average employee onboarding time was in few weeks and probably it's common to most of the large organized by the time you provide them the right kind of excess from HR IT facilities securities it takes three weeks and those few weeks everybody is speed but probably they're not productive for the organization so he worked on the overall process for them give them a single point of view I looked at every process looked at every possible relationship and now the process for them is in ours rather than weeks and the employee becomes productive on day one so whether he really starts working on day one we haven't gone that far up over there then yet let me take you to the jury of how that we do that when we look at any IT operations especially the overall infrastructure side of it we look at everything which is there in an IT environment in a data center as one particular unit and we want to create the overall structure of that when we look at it the first thing we do over there is learn the whole context and this learning the context is very very important to us looking at every possible node relationship how are they independent and dependent on each other which one would affect the relationship with others is something we look at on the whole side of it based on that we kind of work handle incidents manage alerts perform actions and ensure those things are being learned by this AI on its own by the way this AI does not just give you smart alerts triggers and recommendation it can also self heal the environment it can go and take actions autonomously also on the sides of it for our context of the new power of it learn context is what we want to focus on today when I look at the Learn context part of it the logic is actually to construct a single source of truth for your overall IT landscape we want to have visibility of everything which is there in the data center from the applications to the middleware to the infrastructures or any of the tools and paraphernalia you have invested time on we assimilate data from every possible source over there and we kind of support twelve different data source types into this we look at the data quality look at all the gaps try to fill those gaps and those and improve them over the time we also look at the historical data in terms of how things have been happening so if you have your logs up over there and you probably give us those logs of what happened in the IT in said last three months you let this particular a I think about it you can actually tell you if it has been this particular a I how's it it would have solved those problems lot of people are still not ready to let the AI manage the data centers and act on those problems autonomously so they normally request okay give the recommendations what should be done let one of my engineer take over on that particular part of it and over the time build their faith on what is the probability and the success factor in terms of the recommendation given the action taken by the engineers and how many times that was successful over the time the moment they realize that the success rate is almost 90 percent slowly and slowly they start going towards that when we learn the whole context is what when we create a blueprint of the whole organization again from The Blueprint perspective let me take a very simple example in terms of your house blueprints suppose one of the light switches in your home is not working you call up electrician he doesn't have a blueprint does that mean that you will allow him to break up all the walls and try to find out how the wiring is running right he will look at the blueprint try to find out and pinpoint which wire which switch which main to focus on to make those things happen that's what we also try to do when we look up and create the blueprint of the whole organization both from the IT perspective and the business side of it when we look at the overall blueprint up over there if on the one side if we look at the relationships and traceability from business to IT we focus from host to VM to OS to application components and application on the other side from host to network interfaces and network devices anything and everything is what we look at based on this thing is what we create our logic of normal behavior characterization every time you bought a car you're told on as for the road condition or test condition this is how this car performs right or a very simple example of a human body all of us feel good almost every day that's the normal behavior your body is supposed to react suddenly a small itch in your ear or a nose whew sneezes in the morning extra heart palpitation raise some pain somewhere that's the body's way of saying something is not normal something needs to be taken care of is what we also look at when we do the normal behavior characterization more Syre data centers our focus in terms of there is a threshold which is created that the moment you go beyond this threshold things are not normal but we started looking at that every morning 9 o clock when the bank branch opens everyone logs the storage rate the compute rate goes up does that mean that's abnormal no so looking at the temporal way of it week on week month on month if something went up that's where we realize that these are not abnormals this is still the part of the normal behavior characterization but does it which is not seen every day and that's where the new comes in picture for us from the dependencies and the relationship perspective when we looked up the overall thing of how to manage alert for the different organizations sorry and how to look at those look at which ones to focus on which wants to suppress which one to correlate which ones to act on if there is a sudden flurry of alerts in your data center most ID data center have a cascading effect the moment one thing fails lot of their fields if that happens and at that particular point of time if you know which one to focus on and correct that will actually help you look at and make the corrections immediately you also looks at every time a failure happens and if there is a storm of failures which one actually will create the most or a major business impact out of all of them focus only on that and act on that so that the overall business impact is less I know sounds boring till no that's not what you came to hear right you came to hear what is it we do with neo4j am i right I know but then my marketing would ensure I talk about this stuff too let's talk about new and igneel all the nature lovers we name over products and diversion of our products on the animal kingdom the earlier version was butterfly the one we just launched John 20:19 is cheetah cheetah is the fastest running animal in the world and that's where the whole thing comes in picture for us so in our life as Lance announced we launched this product in 2015 so we kind of divide our life pre and post new so 2015 we invent when we launched butterfly everything was perfectly fine things were running nice we picked up 65 70 customers from the Global 2000 list things are perfectly nice and suddenly is somewhere in end of 2017 beginning of 2018 we got a customer we're the way we were doing things especially from the relationship data database perspective things in work up to quarter million nodes of million-plus relationships things were working perfectly fine and here this large retailer who said number of nodes are around a million relationships are around five million things in work that was our era of the Premio and some of the challenges which we faced over there from the pre in your perspective these and all of you from the graph database perspective I'm sure you would have seen some of this in your life or the other that's where our journey of searching a new database started on da one I don't think we realize that neo4j was the one for us Tim worked extensively to work at the features what we want to focus on whether these were the performance metrics or the functional features including the soft features like the robust user community and market presence we looked at multiple products into the market did the benchmarking and POC with few of them and we realized that nu was the one which could actually help us meet some of our things and this is a version post near journey we had things happen good the way product Soraka 2099 words what have been shipping cheetah to the customers have given us features including your overall data soldier cells to be a schema less for the context and the overall process the way things work behavior and structure of data is of importance to us while behavior is time wearing involves lot of data structure is what helps us create the overall nodes and relationships and neo4j really helps us on that particular part of it just to summarize it wanna show you a small video of what we have put on this particular part of it with the rapid adoption of digital technologies assuring business outcomes demands a stable resilient and agile IT yet achieving this is anything but simple is due to three reasons first most business activities involve an interplay of many technologies second the rate of change in technologies and their interdependencies is accelerating third enterprise IT organizations are partitioned into layers with each silo having limited visibility today 90% of the time required to handle an IT situation is spent in isolating the cause and identify a fixed this leads to fragile sluggish and inefficient IT operations the outcome is missed business opportunities and a high cost of doing business igneel AI UPS an award-winning product addresses this core problem by combining artificial intelligence and machine learning with automation egg neo first minds different data sources within an enterprise to self learn cross layer technology dependencies and behavior of each component egg neo then leverages this contextual awareness to mimic human experts in handling situations it isolates the root cause for an observed IT fault prescribes the best fix and applies it autonomously to recover from the fault igneel checks the health of business-critical technology components proactively and continuously identifies potential hotspots and recommends different options to prevent any business disruption and takes appropriate action the outcome is highly resilient agile and efficient IT operations that allows enterprises to cash in on business opportunities and run their operations optimally are you ready to reimagine your enterprise IT operations let me also share a small anecdote with you guys in terms of what ignore did beyond the data center any marathon runners here few New York Marathon last year did anyone run realize if this is an AI and it can assimilate data it can look at all relationships and nodes can I actually use it to predict something we put ignor on the job to predict who would win the marathon we kind of put the data of every runner who was there their historical data their timings the locations and venues they have been running and their experience and their timings on that and how did we do for the vendor category igneel was off by 23 seconds this is a 26 mile the winner Melissa I think she won with two hours two minutes and 36 seconds it knew was off by 30 those are the things which we do something about us that's a last light we are digit 8 launch 2015 100 plus customers for years I mean we are not completed for years and having hundred customers from the fortune 2000 list is actually that makes us one of the fastest growing companies software companies which is there right now multiple flavors multiple accolades which we have won over the time and we are very happy to partner with neo4j I joke with my team some time this was integration or marriage which was destined to happen if you look at the names itself ignore and knew there is a neo in the naming knew itself this was supposed to happen and which happen thank you so much ladies and gentlemen
