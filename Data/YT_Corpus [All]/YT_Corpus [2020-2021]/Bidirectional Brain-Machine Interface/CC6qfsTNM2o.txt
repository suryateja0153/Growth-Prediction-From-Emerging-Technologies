 a timeline of United States inventions 1946 to 1991 encompasses the ingenuity and innovative advancements of the United States within a historical context dating from the era of the Cold War which have been achieved by inventors who are either native born or naturalized citizens of the United States copyright protection secures a person's right to his or her first-to-invent claim of the original invention in question highlighted in article 1 section 8 Clause 8 of the United States Constitution which gives the following enumerated power to the United States Congress in 1641 the first patent in North America was issued to Samuel Winslow by the General Court of Massachusetts for a new method of making salt on April 10th 1790 President George Washington signed the Patent Act of 1791 stat 109 into law which proclaimed that patents were to be authorized for any useful art manufacture engine machine or device or any improvement therein not before known or used on July 31st 1790 Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford Vermont became the first person in the United States to file and to be granted a patent for an improved method of making pot and pearl ashes the Patent Act of 1836 ch 357 v stat 117 further clarified United States patent law to the extent of establishing a patent office where patent applications are filed processed and granted contingent upon the language and scope of the claimants invention for a patent term of 14 years with an extension of up to an additional seven years however the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 ura a changed the patent term in the United

transistor is a semiconductor device commonly used to amplify or switch electronic signals because the controlled output power can be much larger than the controlling input power the transistor provides amplification of a signal the transistor is the fundamental building block of all modern electronic devices and is used in radio telephone computer and other electronic systems from November 17th 1947 to December 23rd 1947 John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT&T Bell Labs underwent experimentations and finally observed that when to gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium a signal was produced whereby the output power was larger than the input the manager of the Bell Labs semiconductor Research Group William Shockley saw the potential in this and worked over the next few months greatly expanding the knowledge of semiconductors in order to construct the first point-contact transistor Shockley is considered by many to be the father of the transistor hence in recognition of his work the transistor is widely yet not universally acknowledged as the most important invention of the entire 20th century since it forms today's building blocks of processes

ousterhout while working at the university of california berkeley 0.198 ate ballistic electron emission microscopy ballistic electron emission microscopy or beam is a technique for studying ballistic electron transport through a variety of materials and material interfaces beam is a three terminal scanning tunneling microscopy STM technique that was Co invented in 1988 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California by Al Douglas Bell and William Kaiser 0.198 eight electron beam ion trap the electron beam ion trap is used in physics to denote an electromagnetic bottle that produces and confines highly charged ions the electron beam ion trap was Co invented by M Levine and armours in 1988 point one nine eight eight nicotine patch a nicotine patch is a transdermal patch that releases nicotine into the body through the skin it is usually used as a method to quit smoking the nicotine patch was invented in 1988 by Murray avec Jed rose and Daniel Rose 0.198 eight firewall a firewall is an integrated collection of security measures designed to prevent unauthorized electronic access to a networked computer system at AT&T Bell Labs William jezik and Stephen M Bell oven were continuing their research in packet filtering and curve invented a working model for their own company based upon their original first generation architecture of a firewall 0.198 8 resin identification code the SPI resin identification code in system is a set of symbols placed on plastics to identify the polymer type the resin identification code was developed by the Society of the plastics industry SPR in 1988 point one nine eight nine zip file format the zip file format is a data compression and file archiver a zip file contains one or more files that have been compressed to reduce file size or store disease the zip file format was originally invented in 1989 by phil katz for pkz IP and evolved from the previous arc compression format by Tom Henderson point one nine eight nine selective laser sintering selective laser sintering is an additive rapid manufacturing technique that uses a high-power laser to fuse small particles of plastic metal ceramic or glass powders into a mass representing a desired 3-dimensional object the laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3d digital description of the part on the surface of a powder bed selective laser sintering was invented and patented by dr. Karl Dekker at the University of Texas at Austin in 1989 point one nine nine zero self-wringing mop the self-wringing mop is a type of mop designed to be wrung out without getting a user's hands wet the first self-wringing was invented in 1990 by joy Mangano the mop head was created from 300 feet of cotton and was developed so that it was possible to be wrung out by turning a plastic handle above the mop head itself it became widely used in America by the mid-1990s point one nine nine zero sulfur lamp the sulfur lamp is a highly efficient full-spectrum electrodeless lighting system whose light is generated by sulfur plasma that has been excited by microwave radiation the sulfur lamp consists of a golf ball-sized 30 millimeters fused quartz bulb containing several milligrams of sulfur powder and argan gas at the end of a thin glass spindle the bulb is enclosed in a microwave resonant wire mesh cage the technology was conceived by engineer Michael Urie physicist Charles wood and their colleagues in 1990 with support from the United States Department of Energy it was further developed in 1994 by fusion lighting of Rockville Maryland a spin-off of the fusion UV division of fusion Systems Corporation 0.199 1 and robotics and robotics is a special case of swarm robotics swarm robots are simple and cheap robots with limited sensing and computational capabilities this makes it feasible to deploy teams of swarm robots and take advantage of the resulting fault tolerance and parallelism in 1991 American electrical engineer James McClurkin was the first to conceptualize the idea of robot ants while working at the MIT computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology the robots consisted of sensors infrared emitters and communication systems capable of detecting objects in their path McClure Koons invention was through studying the behavior of real ants in ant colonies and keeping ant farms as a basis for his programming through this examination he could better understand how insects structured their workloads in order to produce a viable and working prototype of robotic ants topic see also topic footnotes topic further reading did Jo Anne Weismann a nation of inventors Carlisle Massachusetts Discovery Enterprises Limited 2001 Haven Kendall 100 greatest science inventions of all time Westport Connecticut libraries unlimited 2006 hoppin Egan lorraine inventors and inventions new york city new york scholastic incorporated 1997 mg eow evelyn inventors and inventions new york city new york Marshall Cavendish corporation 2008 Philbin Tom the 100 greatest inventions of all time New York City New York Kensington publishing corporation 2003 topic external links American inventors Google US patent search PBS they made America MIT invention dimension NASA scientific and technical information NASA spin-off National Inventors Hall of Fame foundation the great idea finder United States Patent and Trademark Office
