 okay YouTube this life okay so we're gonna wait a few minutes because we had 66 pre-registered you do this one so we're gonna wait a few minutes because we had 66 pre-register do this one I think that's the delay in the YouTube that I'm hearing that's in a way in the YouTube but I don't know who has their YouTube playing better yeah thank you whoever did that maybe Steve well we're certainly glad to see everybody who's here and we'll be getting started in a few minutes we want to make sure everybody can join the meeting do I am I right that there are seven there are nine people right now nine panelists and sixteen attendees here where do I see them if you click on the participant educator at the bottom of the screen you can get the sidebar to have two sections the upper is panelist and it includes two divisions and the lower is the chat we have just a few people on YouTube now but I'm glad to have it available know a number of people who are in the attendee category okay are increasing yeah so why don't we go ahead Ted and welcome everybody to bake high July center of the summer and a beautiful summer it seems to be except for that we're all by ourselves and so this is one of our chances to get together earlier this week we had the online party for a very small party for bake high and I hope that people knew about it and we talked about several topics that should be interesting or are interesting to to anybody that's interested in computer to human and interface they gave us a chance to get to know each other better from that from that conversation we decided that we are going to start we hosting the dinners before bake high meetings in which we're gonna have a few topics and maybe people will get together and discuss them what they do in in computer human interface and also what computer interface is coming and is baked hai is a sub organization of the Association for computing Machinery's Kai special interest group which is usually was a conference of about several thousand people a year this year it was did not and one thing I'm hoping to do is to make some of the talks that happened that should have happened at Kai be something that maybe some of those speakers would would give to our audience so that's one of the things that might be coming up for August we are we are planning will see if it if it happens as it as it was going to to have a bar we Tversky well I'm a famous psychologist talk about what it's like to be a person she wrote a book a nice book about that in any case I'm kind of interested in knowing how many of you here are are new to the big high meetings and you can just indicate by raising your hands and virtual virtual hand yeah yeah virtual hands and I see it I see a whole bunch of hands going up that's very exciting we're always excited about having new people come and we are interested in them becoming people that helped build the experience of baked I so get a hold of any of the offers or online there's a person that looks for volunteers and there's many things you can do we have a variety of ways that this group tries to engage the computer eminent interface community and that is we are also considering people making groups versus a feather but in any case I'm happy to have you all here and we will put a statistics about how many people came from different sources this is a very special night tonight and I don't say too much about it that's really Nancy that's put this together and I'm interested in her talking about why why she did it and what this special night is is here or and how we will all benefit from learning about disabilities some more thanks Ted and thanks to everybody who has come tonight bake hi we're delighted to have you we usually meet in a historic building in palo alto zero what used to be Xerox PARC parc but now it's called just Park and one of the reasons I'm happy that we're meeting online instead is it's a difficult building to get into not impossible but to get into if your mobility impaired we have a another friend who's come to bake I several times but I think he feels like it's just a pain in the neck for him to get into the auditorium by walking through get letting the security guard let you in and then wander down the hall following the security guard and take the correct elevator to go two stories down and you come in at the stage level of the auditorium and then get to roll or walk with your crutches or whatever your mobility thing is over to the seats so it's very awkward placement but really what I want to say tonight is I've been looking forward to this particular meeting for many months I offered to have done come and talk last summer at this time and then we had a bit of rigmarole about hiring interpreters at that time and then I was starting to follow Sherry's work and I'm so excited that I get to introduce you to both of them here or maybe some of you already know them for one or the other of them a couple of ground rules for how we're going to conduct this as you can see we have one interpreter who is working right now from voice to sign and when our first speaker starts speaking he will be signing for himself and you will hear the other interpreters voice in English so Don's going to sign in American Sign Language and the interpreter day will interpret for him when we get to questions and answers we're going to have patty signing for all of you who don't sign and Dan will continue to do the voice-over and then when we switch speakers to Cherie we'll have one of them doing the signing and the other one doing the questions and I don't know how they've worked that out I'm very excited not only that we have the kind of dream team of two really different dimensions about disability and accessibility being brought up here one with respect to products and one with respect to employment and so these are you know just crazy different ideas and nonetheless we're trying to serve the same wide variety of people with digital products and with crazy new ideas and inventions so let's see ground rules we have captions going on you can turn the captions on voluntarily yourself and each of your own stations okay and it's there's a closed caption control on the bottom of the screen and it says show subtitles and that will indicate in the black area at the bottom of the screen what my voice is saying only in English text and in order to do the interpreting well we'd like you to not anyway we'd like you to take advantage of the interpreters enjoy it and also to realize that this is another language that's happening at the same time and one of the reasons I'm so excited about this is I've been dreaming for years of my two academic specialties rolling in the same stream and here it is accessibility especially with respect to deaf people and human-computer interaction and it's so exciting to see this here tonight so I'm going to remove myself from the visuals and sherry I think we're going to take you out of the visuals for the moment if you can stop your video and we'll bring you back in a few minutes and now if all of you put yourself on speaker view you'll be able to see just the interpreter and our first presenter Don brush Ken a professor at CSU Sacramento in deaf studies who also V logs vlogs on YouTube and has a column on Facebook and as a contributor to Quora and that's where he and I bump into each other we're in the same neighborhood in Korra so without further ado Don tell us whose design isn't anyway Thank You Nancy well hello everyone my topic is whose design is it anyway my focus is really going to talk about technology and how technology actually has ways of being disempowering about myself my name is Donald crush ghen I am deaf my PhD is from the University of Arizona where I specialized in language reading and culture and now I teach at California State University Sacramento and my field of teaching there is deaf studies before I start I'd like to throw a point out there for you to consider among people who can hear their perception of deaf people is something like a person who has a broken subset of society and a person who is in need of repair or recovery through some kind of medical intervention or technological method as using a cochlear implant which we'll be talking about a bit later on in my presentation but that particular point of view is actually at odds with those of us who are deaf we deaf people do not view ourselves as hearing people who happen to not be able to hear that's not our self perception we view ourselves as a social group with its own language its own history its own literature its own art its own forms of expression we are a people that have all of those things one example of that is the the artwork that you're looking at now which was painted by very famous deaf artist named Chuck Baird this painting shows a child gazing at a deaf person who's an adult who is looking down as a child and relating to that child is saying yes I am deaf to making a symbol with their hand that indicates we are the same so this is very much reflective of how we feel about each other that we are all the same as deaf people that we share a common and very unique culture Marshall McLuhan once said this famous quote here he said we shape our tools and afterwards our tools shape us makes a lot of sense but actually that leads to an important question which is why are we making tools in the first place and I couldn't find the particular quote that reflects my particular thinking on this so I came up with my own it decided to document that quote which which I put here which says the tools of a culture reflect its priorities what the people of a culture view as important what we think we need and how we can capture that need and in our goals in order to help us succeed in attaining our goals what tools do we need to help us attain our goals that's what we would prioritize as the tools we need so for deaf people technology has a way of disempowering us it actually give us gives power and it taketh away if you will here's an example if you look at this cartoon way back in the old days when you'd go to a store to purchase something you'd go up to the clerk or the cashier and the person would type in to the cash register the price and the price would visually pop up in a way that a deaf person could see it visually and know exactly what the total was and they could make that transaction effortlessly well now with new technology all the new electronic scanning type gadgets we have in the stores whereas before a cashier might the the cashier could actually see the price and then would kind of verbalize it so to the deaf person suddenly they've lost access to the visual that they had in the past and now the clerk is sort of representing this on their lips which is not accessible to them so it's all this is an example of we had accessibility in the past and that we no longer do there are certain devices now in stores where the pay device is visible to us and you can't see the total on it but in the beginning when they were first introducing this technology and it was scan only you weren't able to see anything in many ways technology is not accessible to us deaf people and here's a video that shows that catching up with a while sorry the term is voicing for the captions sorry about that so obviously a technology here that was developed for hearing people at the airport is really great but for deaf people it's inaccessible the accessibility is not there many times hearing individuals might think hmmm I wonder what deaf people might need and they'll come up with inventions of things that they think are going to assist deaf people have more accessibility in the hearing world so to speak and here's an example of that in this next video the headline says a new gadget and then it went away sorry I couldn't read a microphone detects sounds in the surrounding areas and it converts it into vibrations and light the device can be worn in your hair or as earrings fujitsu is developing it to be worn on the skin the device will expand the sensory experience of sound for the Deaf and the video seems I think it's over so now this device is was created as a way of helping deaf people to capture speech and sounds and converts that to something visual but if actually might be rather annoying for a deaf person to have these vibrations coming at them on their body that way and also the idea of having something attached to your head like that is not very appealing what it does is it marks a person it marks a person is being different and so then they stand out which is actually a harm to them and for myself you know I'm a man and call me old-fashioned but you know I don't want to have anything sticking out on my head so the fact that these designers are expecting us to just welcome wearing this device on our heads I don't think that's going to fly our tongues help us make sounds and speak and of course we taste with our tongues but get this we soon may be able to hear with our tongues thanks to a research team at Colorado State University this is the part of the device that we actually put into our mouth this testing gadget covered with electrodes to translate sounds into tongue stimulation is the experimental first generation of what this tongue experts Professor Leslie stone Roy says could be a less invasive less expensive alternative to cochlear implants the ultimate device is gonna be something that fits inside the mouth that you can't see like a dental retainer it's tempting to compare this tongue device to Braille with Braille if you can't see well enough to read the words then you use your finger and you teach yourself to read the words that way but you haven't taught your finger to see researchers say that with this tongue device once you've taught your tongue and your brain to work together you've actually taught your tongue to hear you would have to wear it typically three to four weeks we think maybe even two or three months to fully begin to allow your brain to interpret these signals as words or sounds engineering professor john williams co leads the team should he feel having his tongue mapped for sensitivity to figure out how much variety there is among tongues and what pattern of electrodes works best these little electrodes here are being kind of energized depending on what frequency i'd like to make a good impact on the world you know maybe change some people's lives and to be able to get those people to be able to hear like they did when they were younger when their ears were working is what really kind of excites me about this type of technology we're really up in the game for the tongue here yes and tongues could soon be even awesomer if these researchers can put words in our mouths by teaching our tongues to hear now I look at this and I think I'm gonna have to learn how to interpret sounds complicated speech through my tongue Plus this this device is going to create vibrations in one's mouth and having that in your mouth all day long it's not appealing it might lead to some numbness it might needs to some lack of taste destroying your taste buds it's not appealing at all to me it's a very silly idea so here's the concept so as I'm speaking my sound is getting captured by the tablet and then it's getting mapped onto a vest that's covered in vibratory motors just like the motors in your cell phone so as I'm speaking the sound is gonna translate into a pattern of vibration on the vest now this is not just conceptual this tablet is transmitting bluetooth and I'm wearing the vest right now so as I'm speaking the sound is getting translated into dynamic patterns of vibration I'm feeling the sonic world around the hours so we've been testing this with deaf people now and it turns out that after just a little bit of time people can start feeling they can start understanding the language of the vest so this is Jonathan he's 37 years old he has a master's degree he was born profoundly deaf which means that there's a part of his loom belts that's unavailable to him so we had Jonathan trained with the vest for four days two hours a day and here he is on the feels it on the vest and he writes it on the board Jonathan's able to translate this complicated pattern of vibrations into an understanding and what's being said he's not doing this so there's another variation on the same theme having deaf people perceive sound through vibrations on their body now I look at that and once again I'm gonna have to interpret things through sensing vibrations I really doubt that's gonna work one of the big things I notice here is that words are being tested in isolation so maybe a person can learn the pattern of one word in isolation at a time like that but when you speak you don't speak in one word you're speaking several words all string stringing together which means you're gonna have a really florid series of vibrations happening all over your body and I don't think that's gonna work another big issue here has to do with the fact that all of these things you know that that we've been shown here have all been designed by hearing people I don't know to what extent deaf people have been involved in their design I'll oh I doubt it's been very much you'll notice that everyone in the audience had a lot of applause for this invention and what they were applauding was quote the deaf person quote unquote overcoming their deafness and that's the part that probably bothers me the most as I said before we deaf people do not view ourselves as broken hearing people or as people who want to become hearing people and yet this device is attempting to make us become hearing so that leads to cochlear implants which is of course beak with us now and there's a lot of hype around cochlear implants and how they quote-unquote you know are so great and make a person become hearing which is actually not true the way the cochlear implant works is electrodes are put in the brain and they're a very limited set of electrodes that are use there are only 22 different touch points that they have in the cochlea out of all the possible touch points there are only 22 are used and supposedly with they replicate what hearing people can hear but if they don't actually because net the natural cochlea has access to a much wider range of frequencies than what these electrodes cover if you get into similar sounding words such as ADF you're going to get certain frequencies of those sounds hit but not the full range and so it's not restoring anything like normal hearing and I will give you an example of that here screen saying this is a video simulation of what a cochlear implant speech through channel through for channel a four-channel cochlear implant sorry and now speech through a 12 channel cochlear implant and they'll speech through a 20 channel and now normal speech says cochlear implants also work for music the type of music demonstrated is considered to be the easiest for implant users to appreciate this is due to its dominant single note instrument playing at an appropriate pitch combined with a strong rhythmic beat now music through an 8 channel CI now it's rich 12 channel cochlear implant and now 20 channel cochlear implant [Music] so oops there's my and now the normal music so there's obvious this obviously the cochlear implant doesn't provide anything close to normal hearing at all [Music] [Music] so this is a Star Trek episode where the computer can understand speech interact with the person who's speaking and so that was theirs that's really a priority for hearing people it's a very hearing person centered design it suits their needs it fits their needs easily so that a hearing person can speak to this device without any need to type anything for deaf people this doesn't really work if you've tried use I've tried to use Siri before and it doesn't understand my speech I speak into it and it does anything but what I'm really asking for so Siri was really designed for hearing people name is tamas competition access to communication is a basic fundamental human right and every single person deserves a part of the global community however those who are deaf or mute communicate differently than everyone else they primarily use sign language while the rest of world communicates verbally this puts the deaf mute weenie at a disadvantage it has like a foreigner in another country they can't communicate like everybody else what we decided to do is create gloves that translate sign language with a text and speech we have had extensive work with individuals in the disabled community they have seen firsthand their daily struggles we wanted to develop something that help the deaf in you they don't communicate with the rest of all about changing how they already interact with each other by simply putting on a pair of gloves those who utilize American Sign Language can now communicate with the rest of the world same way they communicate with each other the gloves worked by utilizing sensors on the hand and wrist to measure hand position and hand movements the gloves then send the state into the computer via bluetooth for processing once the computer recognizes and interprets a sign it then outputs the corresponding word or phrase and text in speech you were to say hello I'm well thank you you look something like this hello I'm well thank you and just like that we've translated their American sign language and to spoken English instantly there are approximately 70 million deaf new people in the world who use sign language but on a 7 billion humans on the planet our device revolutionizes the way these two communities understand to interact with each other currently there is no commercial sign language translator on the market with this invention over 70 million people achieve a new level of Independence 70 million people gain access to a new job and 70 million people secure an improved quality of life all with the help of a pair of gloves we believe that access and inclusiveness are catalysts for change these gloves were crafted with this principle in mind and seek to promote a more unified global community so here once again we have hearing people coming up with something that they think is going to help deaf people and it's not clear that they know so much about deaf people apparently not especially when they use the term deaf mute which is a big no-no I will have you know but the other big glaring problem here is that when they're talking about putting on a glove you're not just fingerspelling isolated letters isolated letters on a glove are not sign language and there are other people who have attempted to make those kinds of things this this this particular device that was in the video attempts to go one better and do actual signs but those signs were not really reflected of the true natural American sign language which is quite complex and has a very complex grammatical structure which includes using parts of the body and parts of the face so having the the glove that they're making while they think it's making actual signs is only making parts of signs so there's a lot of problems with the gloves first of all they're unidirectional you can only point them one way you have to point them towards the hearing person that you're talking to so it's it's really before the hearing person to understand everything I'm trying to say now how about when the person's hearing person is gonna say something to me where's my access to what they're saying I'm still deaf and I'm still not going to have to do a lot of extra work to understand this person whether or not I'm wearing a glove so there's a imbalance in the communication happening [Music] that says technology is constantly evolving and speech recognition is the future its virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa are making many people's lives easier [Music] showing people using the Alexa by speaking to what about people who are deaf or hard of hearing meet Bobby Shaq Shaq is signing he's the camera on the PC on the laptop is capturing his sign language now he asked what it signs what is the weather and now Alexa is answering and print the weather in New York is 96 degrees whatever so proving that sometimes accessibility just takes a little bit of creativity and you see more examples of Bashan signing to Alexa and Alexa responding in print these waves goodbye Alexis says bye for now so now making Alexa be able to understand signs is again not really ASL Alexa's able to maybe capture individual signs signed in a very stilted manner which is not really natural it's not natural sign to communication the way we deaf people sign with each other and I'm sure some of you have used speech to text software it's been around for a while now how reliable is it let me ask you that it isn't very reliable still is it now imagine that same situation with a three-dimensional language that's ink that you're you're asking this device to not only capture the individual phoneme input you're having it to have it interpret facial expression body language and all the complex parts that go into a sign so once again it's unidirectional I can sign to allow but when Alexa wants to say anything back to me it's not using sign language to communicate back to me and of course you know it's a hearing person who's been behind the design of this thing for the Deaf now when we go to the movies we're all sitting in the same room together but what I have to do in order to watch a movie is somewhat different than everyone else I either have to put some kind of a device onto the chair in front of me which cut is called a cap view I don't really call it a cat for you my word for it is the crap view because actually it's a it's a device that makes it really impossible to watch the movie along with the caption it's it's it's about the size of a of a little rear view mirror so you're looking at this tiny little saying and then readjusting your eyes to look at the big screen that's in front of you and having to go back and forth between those little things it's it's really doesn't fit another technology are special glasses that a deaf person puts on that has the captions being beamed onto the lens of the glasses this is a little bit better it's a little bit step in the right direction but both of these devices don't always work perfectly the batteries die parts get worn out and and again it marks us it's marks us when I go to the movies when we deaf people go to the movies suddenly we can't just go sit down we have to go to a special line of customer service get this device carry to our parent in plain view of everybody else at the movie theater who are now talking amongst themselves saying what are these people doing with these funny devices we're being marked whereas a hearing person can just go get their popcorn go to their seat and watch the movie we have we deaf people have to take this additional step in order to appreciate the same thing that you do just as a matter of course now you might be thinking I'm just here to complain well no that's not true I'm here to also tell you what we really want what we deaf people really want let's talk about the movies why can't we have open captioning on films it's really not that much trouble it doesn't take that up that much screen real estate it really doesn't attract that much from the movie watching experience for everyone else or why not invent some kind of filter something like 3d glasses because that people sometimes go to the movies in hell and watch put on those 3d glasses we wouldn't stand out so much and they could be designed in such a way so that the captions would show up without us looking like we've got you know the strange robotic thing on our heads instead we're using 3d glasses which everybody can relate to touchscreen machines that are used for ordering things are good for us when you walk into a restaurant or whatever things like that but now in this time of coronavirus I don't know if it's such a good idea to have touchscreens available for people to order because of the ability to spread germs so this is a strobe light on a traffic light it's really kind of unnecessary because a red light communicates being a red light anyway but this might be something that you could that a city could use to alert people that emergency vehicle is approaching and for that I would really applaud that kind of views that's the street light the traffic light would suddenly have a different sort of light flashing that would indicate that an emergency vehicles approaching and that it would be automatic or that it's the red that's a strobe light is flashing when the lights about to turn red to warn people that's about to turn it and this wouldn't help just deaf people would help hearing people too it would help everybody now automobile companies if they're making amazing great strides it's towards deaf friendly design [Music] [Music] there's English on the screen let's talk about how the delivery of visual explorance from the - distances - obstacles on the road are detected using sensors and then the user is notified with vibrations of different lengths on the steering wheel in 2018 December the quiet taxi takes off [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there's some help so now the touchscreen is asking please state your destination it automatically appears on the screen since the beginning the the steering wheel is lighting up on the left side as well as the audio saying there's a left turn and 200 meters little kids in the backseat are getting a kick out of seeing the lights an emergency vehicle is approaching and the steering wheel is now flashing all kinds of red lights and there's also a sort of a reflective image on the dashboard that shows an emergency field Don now I really like this because it's visual and it's also kinetic it's it's giving me kinetic information as well so I think this really suits what deaf people need and deaf people would embrace this kind of technology so my recommendations are first of all don't do anything about us without us instead of a hearing person taking it upon themselves to get some recognition and perhaps some monetary value out of doing something for us hold on bring in deaf people to work with you work with deaf people get their input and their feedback and have them have some opportunity to be completely involved in the process and even if you don't listen to what deaf people want listen to our voices listen to what we want what we have to tell you secondly design things from a deaf perspective which amplify our strengths don't highlight or try to fix what you perceive is our weak that's not be able to hear but work with what's our strengths third make sure that any functionality you're providing is going to work both ways it has to be bi-directional it's not just for hearing people to take advantage of it's for us deaf it has to be for us deaf people's benefit as well it has to go both ways and be bi-directional because communication is a two-way street so any questions Thank You Don and Smith if you can start up Patty's video Don I wanted to sorry I want to see patty here okay so Don I want to thank you very much you're highlighting so many of the things that we have talked about several times and I wanted to bring up also that one of the people in the audience Michelle Vincent made the observation which I think you implied but I'd love to underscore it all these technologies depend on the deaf person doing the training and the work do you want to comment on that yes it goes back to the point I made before my first point which says don't do anything about us without us nothing about us without us make sure that deaf people are involved in the process every step of the way and at every level I'm gonna read to you from the chat faint from Daniel Fisher who says thank you for presenting these informative case studies and examples and as you and I have mentioned before there is a construct in user experience design and research called participatory to cementing exactly approach for anything involving disabled people that is to say those of us who are disabled by the environment we've all created so I appreciate that are there any other questions from the audience you can put them in the chat yeah um maybe say something about that I just wanted to just add to what Nancy just said there and I totally support universal design as an idea and I think there are things that really do help deaf people ork and can't help hearing people as well for example the steering with the steering wheel of that car we just saw in the video that's gonna help everybody the strobe lights flashing on the on a regular old traffic light having that extra light there's providing more information to everyone not just deaf people so hearing people are gonna benefit as well so Universal Design is a great concept yes so let's say we've got a couple of questions here Carla I'm gonna read your question which says how are you getting along done during the pandemic with everybody wearing face masks do you have any suggestions for products that have come out of this it sucks it sucks yeah but you know there are a few masks that are transparent in a way now there's one of them that the FDA has approved but I'm not really wild about it it's kind of small it's just got this small little narrow opening which isn't really enough there's another one that actually has a wider transparent area which is better but the one I like sort of covers more of your face with a transparent area or it's actually more like the face shields actually those work the best for us and I bet there are lots of other product ideas that haven't been explored well Ted asks do you have any favorite collaborations with companies or inventors have you participated in any myself personally mmm well no not that I can think of off the top of hand right now but I think any company that really wants to involve deaf people at all levels and you know provides equitable compensation to them for their involvement I would support that great any other questions for Don right now and if we want to pause for a moment and let you all think about it I'll be happy to introduce our second speaker any other parting thoughts Don we're gonna okay hmm no no okay beautiful work thank you so much and so I'm gonna let your video you could turn off the video Sherri bring yourself back on or Smith's up bring you back on and we'll have you again for Q&A done okay cool and I'm gonna get rid of my own image as soon as I introduce Shari Shari bernheimer is an accessibility lead at VMware she is extremely accomplished and a determined person and she's going to talk to us tonight about hiring and recruiting underrepresented minorities including people with disabilities so Shari take it away thanks Nancy and my secret fun fact is I'm probably the only person who's ever come to a bake high event on a date with my now husband here so we're both in HCI related fields he works on user interface design for system administrators and I work on accessibility so we keep it all on the family oh it says my screen sharing is disabled so I need to be promoted you looks like you should be able to do it now yep that looks more promising okay slide show beginning alright so hi everybody I am sherry burn haver I'm here to talk a little bit about one of my favorite topics which is employment specifically related to people with disabilities but a lot of it overlaps with just underrepresented minorities in general and when you talk about underrepresented minorities you just say you RMS the people with disabilities frequently get left out the government definition of you RMS is largely gender and ethnicity base so if you belong to any other category you're older than the average person in your employment field you're you have a status as a caregiver status as somebody who was a veteran you're not considered and underrepresented by an authority for the purposes of what the government is measuring so that's why we usually call them out separately because when sometimes we're talking about the government definition of minority and sometimes we're looking at the larger definition of what constitutes a minority so a big fan of the a da I have a congenital disability I was born with club feet and a spinal curvature and so up until the time I was 25 there were very few accessible parking spaces there were very few curb cuts I chose to go to Cal Berkeley largely because Edie had trail blazed for people in wheelchairs a decade earlier and so Cal was more accessible than the average college but one thing the a DA has not been good at is it's not been good at employment for people with disabilities and so I could go on and on about the statistics and and everything involved it but I think this graph speaks a thousand words so it starts off in in the 1990s when a DA was passed the employment rate for people with disabilities was 50% so 50% of people who had disabilities had a job more recently we're looking at employment rates hovering in the low 20s so we've lost more than half of our employment since the a da was passed and the a da was intended to be something that was supposed to help with employment but it hasn't really turned out that way so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna talk a little already talked about that but I'm gonna talk about the three basic phases that you have to make sure that you're working on because it's not just enough to find people with disabilities you have to make sure that you have policies in place that support people with disabilities and you have to make sure that the people with disabilities want to stay around because if you hire people with disabilities and then you know don't involve them with the decisions that are being made about them just like in Dawn's presentation they're not gonna feel welcome they're not gonna feel like they're they belong and they're gonna try to go find somewhere where they do feel welcome and they do feel like they belong so um just to talk a little bit about the pandemic effect on employment before we move on so in a survey that was done by the global disability Institute 51% of people with disabilities feared losing their jobs this survey was done in June or had lost their jobs and uh and 20% of them had lost their jobs looking at the same question amongst the non-disabled community it was 28% feared so almost twice as many people with disabilities feared losing their jobs okay currently because it's it's the famous lastin first-out type of mechanism where people with disabilities are frequently hired only when they're the employment market is really tight and there no other alternatives and so they're also first people shown the door if people are getting kicked out by seniority and the other reason being that people with disabilities tend to have lower levels of employment I'm generalizing here Don is very educated he ends the PhD I have two graduate degrees so there are plenty of people with disabilities who are highly highly educated but if you look at the dropout rate in high school the dropout rate in college how many people with disabilities go to grad school the pipeline keeps on getting more and more constrained as you move further up the education chain and so again those people are more likely to be in blue-collar jobs because of lower levels of employment which means they're more likely to have been in fact sorry affected not infected by the pandemic okay so there are five steps to the recruiting process that need to be considered when you're trying to recruit people with disabilities and so I'll go to I have a slide on each of these in detail the first is organizational research so that's somebody looking into you know what company do I want to apply to for work looking at the career site what jobs are open is this a good place to work is this a bad place to work then the second is the Apple the actual applications process the third is the interviewing stage and interviews can be in person or they can be digital either way it has to be accessible there is an offer stage and the unboard stage now one thing that's really different about recruiting today versus recruiting 30 years ago when the ATA was passed especially on larger companies is so much of this is done now on the internet and so much of it involves third party companies large companies they don't do their own background checks they outsource that to people they don't write their own paychecks they outsource that to people they have somebody checked your password they have somebody take your job application nobody does any of this work beginning to end anymore and so it's really important at every step of the way in your corporate recruiting process you own the relationships and the contracts that you're signing with people it's your job to ask these companies hey ATP are you accessible hey brass ring can somebody who's blind apply for a job on your website because you control the money and money talks so that impacts literally every single step of the recruiting process and it's something that's really important that I wanted to call out first sorry I lost my cursor there for a second okay so in terms of organizational research some of the things that people will want got to decide whether or not they're interested in a job at your company is they look at your website okay so some people just have marketing websites VMware's website it just talks about VMware we don't have a store we don't sell things but some places do have stores and sell things or some places colleges for example you can take classes through their portals so what constitutes an accessible website kind of depends on the organization and what it is that they're doing with it another thing that's important is accessible social media so although the WCAG and that's web content accessibility guidelines doesn't necessarily apply to social media it's still really important to make your social media accessible because especially for younger people that's literally where they get almost all their news and information about companies these days they don't even go to the web sites anymore they go to instagrams to see what's showing up about your company or Facebook accessible events are really important if you're having a hiring event in person or online you want to make sure that those are accessible so there are physical access considerations for in-person events and that's including things like and I remember using my cane to get into parks oh I I know how much fun that was because that was before I went back to using a wheelchair full time you know making sure that it's easy to get around making sure that there's no cords that people are gonna trip over or that they don't have those really monstrous plastic covers that you can't get a wheelchair over because you can't get enough to work for them making sure that the registration process which is usually through evite or some type of electronic reservation system is accessible for digital you want to make sure that you have the you know a perfect setup it's like the one we have here we have two interpreters and I'm sure the interpreters are happy that there are two interpreters interpreting is tiring they need to be able to switch off and then I'm enjoying the cart down at the bottom because I'm more of a visual learner so even though my hearing isn't that impaired I still like to be able to read things out at the bottom and you can see some of you may see if even if you didn't have closed captioning turned on I have it turned on all the time through PowerPoint so that's a new feature with Microsoft any time I am doing a PowerPoint presentation it automatically captions for me and another thing is what I like to refer to as ablest job descriptions so I did a whole article on these on my blog because I was really annoyed one day so I actually saw a an ad for a graphic design manager okay so an artist type person they wanted somebody with UI and UX experience you know website design things like that for a major retailer let's just say the initials are BBB and leave it at that and one of the requirements was that this person had to be able to use a mouse and a keyboard simultaneously that was actually written into the job description three months ago 30 years after the ADEA was passed which is ludicrous I can't use a mouse I don't use a mouse at all um lots of people don't use mice that doesn't mean I'm not qualified to do that job and so that's a basically code for disabled people need that apply and you see that in some obvious places and some less obvious places so the less obvious place is going to be the you must be able to lift 20 pounds who who was the last programmer who had to be able to lift 20 pounds what the heaviest thing I left is my laptop um you must be able to stay on for hours or you must be able to sit for hours um these requirements are really trying to eliminate people with disabilities from applying they're saying you're not welcome here and preventing them from getting into an awkward situation where they interview somebody who is qualified and it turns out they're in a wheelchair and they don't really want that person working for them so um really review all of your job descriptions make requirements make sure that everything in there has to be there if the job description is for a surgeon that absolutely leave those requirements in you do want a surgeon who can't stand or sit for four hours probably not okay for programming it shouldn't matter it doesn't impact that person's ability to do that job at all so that is the summary of step one of phase one which is organizational and step two is the applications process so the standard we want to see met at a minimum is the wcag 2.0 double-a preferably 2.1 double-a but 2.0 at a minimum many third-party job applications are not inaccessible do not confuse overlays with being accessible so you see these um blue and white pictures of the true vien man the the da vinci guy and you click on them and it brings up a bunch of stuff this is Don's classic example of nothing out of nothing about us without us is for us except for the non deaf community so they designed this for young somebody who could use a mouse design that tool for somebody who couldn't use a mouse somebody who could see design that tool for somebody who couldn't see somebody who is colorblind decided that they wanted to be able to specify colors for somebody who is colorblind none of those options are what we would have selected for ourselves even with the overlays installed you're still not passing the compliance the WCAG compliance standards they are for my definitions useless and sometimes worse than useless and in fact the litigators who have been suing over inaccessible websites have now sued almost a hundred websites who have been using these overlay tools and saying hey we know you use this overlay tool you're still not accessible hey any assessments that your company is performing must be accessible hacker rank is not accessible hey that's the most common assessment tool used in Silicon Valley you need to make sure that if you're using an inaccessible tool that you have an accessible substitute process if somebody requests a an accommodation and you want to put it in large print saying if you need accessibility accommodations this is what we want you to do hey the last thing you want to do is tell somebody that the assessment process isn't accessible that you're gonna get back to them and then two weeks later tell them oh yeah by the way you've already filled the job okay somebody just paid out 75 grand for that in an EEOC complaint okay that's gotta stop this needs to be real-time you need to set it up in advance these nice people who are interpreting for us and doing the cart for us you have to have contracts with them you have to have gone through your procurement if you won't work for a really large company you can't turn these things around in 24 hours like you could for somebody who don't need accommodations so that stuff has to be set up in advance so when and I'm saying when not if somebody asks for an accommodation you can pull the trigger on it as quickly as possible okay well described an easy to find accommodation process probably goes without saying that I've already said it and then you want to think a little bit about best practices there are things that you can do above and beyond the minimums that like for example perhaps you could avoid using an ornate script or you could avoid have the use of italics that's not mandated under the WCAG but it sure makes it a better experience for somebody with dyslexia for example so think about the things that you could do even above and beyond the 50 well actually a 2.0 double-a has 38 guidelines and then 2.1 has an additional 12 so 50 altogether between the two of them so that's the applications process I'm gonna stop at phased one I don't know if people are typing questions in or not but I'll check for questions on that and then I'll move on to phases 2 & 3 so interviews probably a duh statement interviews must be physically or digitally accessible if you're doing digital interviews they have to be accessible like the talk we're having right now if there are physical interviews then you need to make sure that people can physically access the space that you're doing the interview and so like one thing that drives me crazy is that you know conference rooms with that are overstuffed with chairs I can't get my wheelchair around the table sometimes so think about where am I going to put this person for the interview are they going to be moving from room to room or am I going to be bringing people to them you need to kind of map the whole thing out in your head to make sure that you really get it right but probably the most important thing on this list is anybody who's ever doing an interview needs to have unconscious bias training and specifically they need training on how to interview people with disabilities okay the fact of the matter is you're not going to get firm hand shake and eye contact from everybody with a disability that you're interviewing I don't shake hands at all because of the arthritis in my hands doesn't mean I can't do the job but if that's what you're evaluating on then I'm gonna end up getting inherently discriminated against okay again accommodations are required throughout the process from even thinking about applying to the job all the way through after they start the the disabled individual starts a job and at no time during this process does the person with a disability need to disclose that they have a disability so you should not be asking questions about the disability you should not be saying things like well are you sure you can do this job or yeah I two jobs ago I got the question this job requires a lot of travel are you sure you can travel that much which is a question in today's day and age just should not be asked and then finally multiple communication channels using multiple modalities my 28 year old daughter is deaf she wants a chatbot that's how she wants to be able to communicate with people if you only provide a phone number she's not gonna use it if you provide an email address she may or may not use it but if you provide all three she's gonna know a you thought about multiple modalities and B she's gonna pick the chatbot because that's the way a lot of people her age with hearing loss want to communicate and finally return the darn messages I can't tell you how many times I've heard stories about people trying to leave a voicemail to request an accommodation and getting a thing saying we're sorry this mailbox is full so yeah having somebody follow up on those things is really important okay the offer stage I call this death by a thousand PDF files now that may be because of the way VMware's offer stage works but I think we have something like 21 different PDF files that we send back and forth with our candidates as part of the offer they get the offer they get the benefits package they get to choose between all their different insurance plans so there's enrollment there's health insurance that are long term disability insurance I nine paperwork retirement plans everything has its own PDF file and lots of them in fact most of them come from different companies so every single company needs to make sure that the PDF file that they're providing to you the the hiring company is accessible because you can't change those PDF files typically they come to you in unedited form so you need to get somebody to try them out with a screen reader try them out with a switch and see if they're actually accessible or not if they're not required the company the vendor that you're using to provide you with accessible information um and then background checks I actually heard a story about somebody who had been told that their job offer was gonna be revoked because they hadn't passed the background check and the reason why they hadn't passed the background check was because all of the options that had been given to them to provide proof of their previous employment were inaccessible they didn't have access to a paycheck stub through the inaccessible portal they didn't want to turn over an entire copy of their tax return they could have done that but then like Don pointed out you're just treating somebody without it with a disability completely differently than you're treating somebody with a disability so that that's really important if you've got any steps along in the offer process where somebody could actually lose the offer because they're not turning around things quickly enough or because third party paperwork's not getting filled out you really need to double to check all those points to make sure that they're accessible and then the onboarding so this is kind of like if if you think about it in terms of being pregnant and giving birth they talk about after the baby is being born as the fourth trimester onboarding is the fourth trimester of the job hunt so all of the necessary software needs to be installed by activatable and usable in an accessible manner if you have a software catalog which lots of larger companies do you need to make sure that software that hasn't been approved by IT can still be installed if people need to use it to get their job done and so I've included a few examples in the deck jaws NVDA color analysis magnification all of the videos should be closed captioned and and described on audio described as necessary at vmware we set up a buddy system where the new employee could reach out to somebody outside of their organization and outside is really important because you don't want people to feel awkward about asking stupid questions they're their first couple of weeks of work so having it be somebody who can help them immediately but also who doesn't have any involvement with that person going forward in terms of reviews or promotions or anything like that having them be independent is really good and on the second side of that communication cycle having people outside of accessibility which is where we hire a lot of people with disabilities getting them exposed to employees who are deaf employees who are blind employees who use wheelchairs or have cerebral palsy that's really important too because especially in global markets as bad as the employment rate is for people with disabilities in the u.s. it's vastly worse in developing countries so unemployment rate in Armenia for example for people with disabilities is 92% hey the employment rate is 8% so it's a quarter of the bad rate that we already have in the United States just you see the word here compliant a lot and wcag 2.0 double-a repeated over and over emails have to be compliant if your Microsoft team's is compliant slack is compliant but some communication and collaboration tools aren't so we try to keep everybody to teams and slack where we work and where do those things go to do they have a link to an accessible web page or a link to an inaccessible PDF file it's not just enough for the email to be accessible everything that connects to the email has to be accessible as well so Nancy I'm gonna stop at this point and check to see if there are any questions and then I'm going to quickly go through the last two sections because I assume you're making this deck available and I know it's getting a little bit late sounds good I wanted to add one piece to your last one about onboarding a particular anecdote that I think is very telling I started work at a particular company in a cohort of about I don't know 25 people and one of whom was somebody in a wheelchair who uses a wheelchair and so we sat through the full first day of you know orientation and met all the executives and all alone and we get to go out to dinner as a group and meet one another who are in our cohort of new employees and what did they do they scheduled us for a place that wasn't too far away and we were on the second level and of course there's only a staircase and I said surely somebody checked on this before no and so our friend Joe or Bill or whatever this guy's name was was not going to be able to get into the dinner and miss the whole social thing and I could just see from his expression that he was used to having this kind of thing happen and he said don't worry about me I'll see you all tomorrow have a fun time and I thought whoa you don't get it if you know this is where you actually make your connections with other people in the organization we're gonna help you get things done and you know we're we're part of the same alumni entry group but he didn't get to be fully part of that group I have one other I wish I wish I could say I was surprised secondary and and this is probably something you'd only think of if you are wheelchair user or you're close to somebody who's a wheelchair user we work I work at VMware we have a lot of buildings that have been retrofitted after da da with elevators and so like in the building that I'm in we have one elevator that connects this the the basement in the first floor and we have a second elevator that connects the first floor in the second floor well my team who existed before I came on board was on the second floor so of course I'm on the second floor with my team and they took that elevator out of commission oh yeah for maintenance and I couldn't leave the building for four hours until the elevator back together because it was the only way out of the building and a lot of our buildings are like that and partially like I said because it's post ad a retrofitting and partially because we're built into a hillside but you really need to think about things like okay if the building caught fire how am I going to evacuate this person how are we going to let who is responsible for telling the fire department that there's somebody that needs to be you know carried down the stairwell better that are really important to wheelchair users that until you actually have had a wheelchair user you your facilities people may not have thought of those things exactly I want to introduce you to Nandita Gupta and then DITA I have unmuted you so you can speak now and tell us a little bit about your situation hi can you hear me yes we can hi Nancy thank you so much um thank you all this again so much for the presentation has been pretty amazing to see auditing everyone speak one of the situations I ran into recently was you know when when I was advocating for again accessible within the website um I this happened the orange is the personal experience of checking my own website and on portfolio for accessibility I was trying to add audio to my website to kind of provide you know like a different mode of entry so if someone wanted to listen to my website instead of just reading things and so I added these things called audio blogs and after I added them one of the things I did was let me just do a manual check run tested with the screenreader see what it does and when I test I was really shocked to see that it completely skipped the play button and the other wave checkers and things they didn't catch that so I was really confused I was like hold on a second it it passes the audit but when I'm testing it it's just completely going over the play button so someone who wanted to listen to my website all of a sudden they just never even know it's there or if they're using a screen reader they're never gonna know it's there so I was in the situation where I didn't know what to do um I was tempted to just reach out on LinkedIn or Twitter and be like hey this is super inaccessible but then I found a support website I don't gonna take it and they reply really really annoyed me um I got the fluff about Oh our company is committed to accessibility and you're some links on what we do blah blah blah and the last line really shot me where they said there may be specific elements that are inaccessible so we recommend you go ahead and get with an accessibility consultant and I just wanted backers like no you don't get my problem what do you send me didn't fix it your other specific issues I'm happy to get on a call and even demonstrate what's going on and can even tell you how to fix it it's just a matter of fixing it then someone else responds back and says oh thank you so much for clarifying and add this to a feature request but we give you no guarantees so I'd really love to get advice on how to deal with that I've had some instances where I mean I'm attending the disability in conference right now and I was one of the next young leaders and they matched us with some companies and during the match making some the companies I would paired with I realized they had an accessible websites and when I brought it up they were super receptive like they were like oh we get it awesome thank you for letting us know but this experience with my portfolio just really I guess astounded me and love to get feedback on how to proceed on something like that so I will be the first to say that VMware is not a hundred percent accessible yet our accessibility program is only about a year and a half old we have I want to say something like ninety-six remediation projects process right now so sometimes our hearts are in the right place but our actions haven't not quite necessarily caught up with our hearts so it's important to stand what's your current state and what's the roadmap okay because it's the combination of the two that's going to decide what your relationship with that technology might be in the long term so in terms of audio blocks wave can only test for about thirty percent of the overall WCAG requirements seventy percent of the test testing still has to be manual and it might have been that the third party wasn't exposing through the API the bit that wave needed in order to do the accessibility test so you're never gonna be able to count on just the wave results to deter or lighthouse or acts it literally does not matter what accessibility tests tool it is there is nobody that gets it more than I've heard one claim of thirty five percent and that's with AI and machine learning added it and I'm not even sure I believe that probably the best way to handle it is to have some hidden text or something at the top as soon as the page loads to make that information available to a screen reader user even if you know you can say oh this is you know you could tell them what the keystroke combination is to trigger it for example or you could say hey this block is coming up and it's inaccessible but your screen reader is gonna pick everything up that you need to know the the rule of the Americans with Disabilities Act and some people don't like it when I explain this rule is you don't have to make every path accessible okay the ad a did not make stairs illegal the ADEA says that you have to have one set of ramps and one set of elevators at a minimum that connects you to all the points that the elevators and the stairs take you to so it's perfectly fine to have an inaccessible path as long as the accessible path is highlighted and the accessible path contains everything that the inaccessible path contains so but that answers your question because kind of harkens back to these um the audio tweets that Twitter tried to release about a month ago they they're like oh well you know we have audio tweets and we have text tweets we just don't have tweets where you can do audio and text at the same time and we're like okay that's not cool you need to be able to associate the two so that a deaf person can be able to participate in the audio tweet and a blind person can participate in the other type of tweet as well and then of course it came to light that Twitter had allowed their accessibility team to evaporate and they didn't replace them so that didn't helped your image amongst the disability community either right were there any other questions about phase one or should I just quickly go through phase two and phase three I think I'd like you to go through phase two and phase three and will cycle back to if there's some more questions how about that sure that sounds great and I want to stop my video and so you'll just see you and the interpreter okay so policies and the policies are where'd you get into more this is what you do for people with disabilities and that is what you do for other underrepresented minority groups in the in the previous section largely we were talking about actual access and the only thing that would be different for people with disabilities and people of color or people you know women in tech would be where you would go to recruit those individuals really the only only recruiting was the the different aspect of it policies are somewhat to disabilities like the centralized reasonable accommodations process but employee resource groups for example could be about any underrepresented minority talk circles can be for any underrepresented minority so I'm gonna I'm gonna touch on a couple of the ones here that I think are the most important and the key word for reasonable accommodations process is centralized especially once you get over about 50 75 employees you're gonna get to the point where if the managers are making decisions about reasonable accommodations they're gonna be making them based on two things neither of which what are whether the employee with the disability actually needs the accommodation that they're requesting and the two things that they're gonna decide based on are one do I like this person and two how much is this gonna cost me is this coming out of my budget when you centralize that process you pull out both of those biases because you have somebody in HR who has the budget to spend who is in charge of making all the decisions who makes sure that the decisions that are applied equally everybody across the company because it's not fair for one manager or to say sure from home is fine this is more of a precoded thing but something that I actually experienced were two different managers and in our department one was said work from home no problem and the other said no I don't like people who work from home if you want more than one day you're gonna have to go to the to the mats and fight over it so even when it was being made for medical reasons they were you know one manager was fighting it in one manager didn't care and if you were lucky and had the manager who didn't care you know you were fine but it shouldn't be at the whims of the manager it should be at a centralized standardised well-defined process employee resource groups are really important before I took the job at VMware I specifically asked do you have a Disability Employment rece employee resource group and the answer was no not yet but we're trying to get one to start started would you like to be in charge of it so be careful what you ask about sometimes but seriously we now have two or three hundred people regularly attending the meetings we're you know providing support networks both for people with disabilities and for allies we get people who have siblings who are disabled we have people with children who are disabled people who are dealing with disabled parents it's it's really important to provide this support at all of those levels and then talk circles what D&I is important because you know you you ratcheted up you year geez have sometimes been seen of as as social gatherings and not with a business mandate in mind and you need to make the leap from being a get-together where you just talk about stuff to actually getting the point where you can actually get stuff done and getting stuff done requires access to the people who can make the decisions so our ERG and many other er G's at VMware have regular meetings with people in D&I we bring in people as needed from procurement or from IT and to make sure that if if there is something that we see that we need to benefit all people with disabilities at VMware like for example we decided to do a reasonable accommodations catalog that all the people who need to buy into that are or can be brought into the room and and can be put under pressure to make a decision and then obviously DNI policies our goals its possession that specifically call out the target groups 96% of DNI charters do not include disability so those 96 percent we call diverse ish it means they're pretending to be diverse but they're not really diverse because they're not including disability under their definition of diversity I'm happy to say that I work for one of the 4% and so that it's really important to make sure that if you're doing a DNI report you know disability needs to be all doubt in that DNI report what are you doing for people with disabilities how are you tracking your self identification rates so regular self identification campaign is is down here on number five just from adding our disability ERG our self identification rate literally went up almost seventy five percent overnight because people felt like okay I can I can bring my authentic disabled self to work I can talk about my disability and nobody's gonna make fun of me so I do not underestimate the power of having an ERG of any kind be it for Latin X LGBTQ you know women in tech whatever it's for energies should be led by the people but should be supported by DNI okay how do you know if you have a problem so the government goal for employment of people with disabilities is seven percent there is exactly one company in the fortune 200 that is achieving that goal in order to achieve that goal one out of every 30 people needs to have a visible disability and one out of every seven should have a hidden disability that actually that should be 15 I apologize one out of every 15 should have a hidden disability that they're willing to talk about Google doesn't you know even have 7 percent their their rate is slightly over 6 I've heard so if you're missing any of the things on this slide or if your self-identification late rate is vastly below 7 percent and if you want to find out what the self-identification rates are for your particular industry there's a group called the National Organization on disability and they actually keep track of self-identification rates by by sector so what's the rate for health care what's the rate for higher ed you can actually get that information if you're a member of n OD so those that's what you should be looking at to tell whether or not you have a problem silence is not sign that you don't have a problem silence is sometimes a sign that you don't even know that you have a problem or that there's not enough people to even talk about the fact that there is a problem okay finally retention so again you're starting to see some variations on a theme here so I'm not gonna harp on accessibility too much more Easter public transportation is really important a lot of people with disabilities don't drive you know I have had the privilege of having a good enough job that I could afford be you know I think it was $3,000 retrofit to my car so that I could drive with hand controls not everybody can afford that and you know people with substantial levels of vision loss you know self-driving cars aren't there enough yet so public transportation is still important to this group sensory friendly rooms so nine percent of people in tech according to a Stack Overflow survey of about 60,000 people in tuk nine percent of them identify as being a neuro-diverse meaning they have autism or attention deficit disorder or dyslexia okay all of those people can benefit from having a place to just go to to shut out outside stimuli when they've kind of reached their their their processing limits when it's starting the stimuli is impeding their ability to get work done so having having a place that you can go off and and separate yourself from for a little bit as necessary is really useful and then you want to look at specific benefits for people with disabilities sponsoring disabled related organizations and even having disability as part of your board discussions so for companies who sign up for something called the valuable 500 which is a nonprofit that's EU based but its global that's trying to get disability on board agendas disability as part of diversity should born agendas and it's something that even I'm work working towards at VMware so yeah that's pretty much what I wanted to cover today sorry I think I probably went a little bit over and I started late so that didn't help but I'm happy to answer any other questions yeah D&I sorry yeah Dee I wanted to just clarify because somebody asked about that so Dee and I means diversity and inclusion and then we sometimes now hear it as Dei Dei which is dis diversity equality or equity depending on who you talk to and inclusion or sometimes you even see belonging and there as well right right right okay we've got a couple of questions one for done so let's see if we can have done visible again now we've got two interpreters and maybe I should just turn myself off so that's gonna be big enough or sherry you could get rid of that's not something I'm gonna turn I'm gonna turn mine off there we go okay Don I don't see you yet Smita I know you can help us with this yeah I'm here now yeah so Don I'm gonna read you a question from Jackie Lee who asks how do we assess assistive technology for people will become deaf later in life and don't know ASL let me start again but hang on just trying to clarify who's interpreting right now because that wasn't clear on my screen okay I think okay I think I'm oh sorry I didn't have my screen quite set up to see the interpreter okay so Patti you're interpreting yes okay go ahead sorry okay it's a question that please Patti's interpreting for me and Dan will interpret for you so hold on so the question for me is how do we assess assistive technology for people who become deaf later in life and don't know ASL versus people who are born deaf or learned sign early would technology that Maps sound to another sensory modality such as the vibrating best or chip on the tongue be more relevant to people who could speak but lost their hearing later in life hmm yeah I think for that group of people because they already have awareness of what these words sound like the expectations are already there so it suits them but for a person like me it's rare I'm rather doubtful about the ability for me to interpret those signals via my tongue or via vibrations on my body I think it's it's too much of a stretch for a person like me but I guess if you have the motivation anything is possible but I think for the Pacific category of people that you're talking about that that may be true people who are becoming depth up for deaf people who are in the community of deaf people you really need to talk with us to see what we want and it can't be from a purely non deaf hearing perspective I'm just gonna throw in my own two cents here and that is think about your aging parents or grandparents are they going to want to stick a chip in their mouth and learn how to read tongue vibrations and walk around with this device that they keep putting in their mouth here you so I I think there could be some acceptance but I'm not sure it would be universal with the late deafened crowd but thank you for the question I want also to have Ted I'm gonna turn on your where I lost you Ted hi hi oh you've got audio okay you had a question that people didn't get to hear yet what was that yeah I think it was actually for sherry and it was about the same disability positive job postings yeah I have a you know I mean I know many people that are disabled that are quite daunted and in fact you know come away I have a high-functioning autistic son with a degree in graphic is design that has no idea how to get a job and you know it has to do with a lot of things but his experience is when he gets a job or you know they often anyway I just wanted you to speak to that a little bit sure so then we're in a lot of larger tech companies have started doing what are referred to as autism at work programs and that originally came from I think s AP and I can't remember who with them you tried to get through to that s AP people I went to their their kick off and of course nobody responded to our requests after that so so we run two cohorts of the year it's it's a week long process so we have an applications round then we get it to a smaller group of people who go through the evaluations and then we pick a smaller group of people still who are brought onto campus and then they spend a week getting accustomed to the campus and the hiring manager so the actual hiring managers participate for the entire week and then we do offers at the end of it so we had I think something like 700 applications for five jobs it's pretty competitive it's but it was a pilot program and and we're expanding it it's been very successful we make sure that people who identify as neuro-diverse get paired up with people either on their teams or outside of their teams depending on what their preferences to help them work through communications issues some people who are coming through vocational rehabilitation come with job coaches so the job coach is involved with some of the things that are going on at the campus or we'll meet individually with the person and the manager to try to figure out you know just how to make the person who's neuro-diverse more more comfortable with the situation but also to help the other team members learn how to best interact with the person who's neuro-diverse also so I'm hoping that the we're looking at opening up a program like that China I know that doesn't help your son sorry but those kinds of programs are getting more and more popular and I I would definitely look for one of those and if your son's not heard of vocational rehabilitation and he's over let's say 24 that might be an opportunity for you as well because they know where those programs are being run they know who's doing that hiring it's not always enormous companies like VMware because sometimes it's smaller companies as well um it was funny when you said disability positive I usually have a line on my job descriptions that says native users of assistive technology preferred it's like reverse discrimination I mean one of the things I think is that these you know is people that are trying to do the right thing like you when you take 700 people and then they have a chance of being one of five when they're already when any interaction that's true for all of our jobs though you know at this point we're getting 700 applications for every job and and you know hiring is what it is right now so III know it's it's not optimal but it's definitely a starting point and it's been successful at every company I know that's done this and I'm hoping that once we talk amongst ourselves about all these successes that we'll be able to build it into something bigger you know the fact that you know four-and-a-half percent of people in tech say that they identify as it ought istic means that a lot of them are getting jobs and a lot of them are hiding it and that pre that creates its own set of problems I don't think that that's necessarily the right way to go either I think encouraging an environment where people can talk about their autistic traits is the best thing to do for everybody because it D stigmatizes autism for the people who are not autistic and it helps the people who are are autistic not worried about oh my gosh I have to hide this I don't want anybody to know the the Harvard Business Review paper on the cost to industry of people hiding district disabilities is it's just crazy how expensive it is in terms of engagement and job turnover and it's a hidden cost because people companies don't see that hitting their balance sheet but the the HBR study proves that it that it's true and the Accenture study on the value of having disability diverse employee basis also helps I think something about that about the value yeah so Accenture did a study about the net profit trying to remember the three things that they met they measured they measured net profit no gross profit shareholder value and the third thing but anyways it was between twenty and thirty four percent I think higher for companies that identified as highly diverse as opposed to the companies who did not that's cool any final comments from Don do you have anything somebody asked about accessible social media and I just want to mention that Microsoft and Apple are both pretty much the gold standard when it comes to accessibility in all forms including down to packaging so if you want to look at somebody's social media campaign that's really accessible and how to do it that would be who I would look at and also I actually have an article that I read about a year ago about how to make your own social media posts accessible so if you ping me on LinkedIn all or Google my name and accessible social media you'll find it so lisa rose mentioned then maybe you can read along with me here when I first began listening to a deaf person speaking through an interpreter I had to learn how to concentrate my focus visually on the deaf person and not on the interpreter when the signer is interpreting me for the deaf person how does the deaf person modulate back and forth between looking at me and looking at the signer I saw assuming you're asking me that question I'm assuming it's you oh yeah okay okay well it's it's a bit hard to describe because I do focus on the interpreter but I'm also talking to the person who's actually having the conversation with me and try to share my gaze with them as much as possible with the interpreter but when I'm watching the interpreter I have to to do that sort of back and forth dance and it's just sort of a gut feeling that I know when I have the affordance to check in with a hearing person and maintain eye contact with them then look back at where this where the message is being interpreted so it just comes from experiences just starts to be a natural thing you do and it's sort of how you get to Carnegie Hall right exactly yes I signed practice okay sherry any last comments thank you for not nandita found your article about accessible social media and it's in the chat it will disappear when we hang up on this call but it will still be available I'll try to collect some of these links from both sherry and Don so that you can find them without going through the whole hour plus video that we're doing now yeah and tomorrow posted the link to the Accenture study cool all right I'll click those for myself and then we'll be able to find them later thank you that's great and I think that we are going to say thank you to everybody who made this evening possible of course thanks to our speakers sherry bernheimer and Don Bruskin thank you to our two interpreters Patty Lessard who you see on the screen and Danville tree whose voice you've been hearing and thank you very much also to our captioner Cindy Hines who came to us through ACS captioned and I'm going to wish everybody a lovely evening and we'll see you next month at bake high same bat stations same time that is we meet on the second Tuesday of the month at 7:30 unless you see a posting otherwise so next in August the second Tuesday will be filled by Barbara turski TV ers KY professor at Stanford and we will look forward to more fun baking soon thank you [Music] you
