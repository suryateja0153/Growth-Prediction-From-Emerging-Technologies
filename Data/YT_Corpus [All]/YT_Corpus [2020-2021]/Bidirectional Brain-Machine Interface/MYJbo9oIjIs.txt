 so you see a higher response to faces than anything else right there that's the fusiform face area uh that responds selectively to faces okay right next door is this little region in green that responds for the same set of stimuli very strongly to scenes not at all to faces and weakly to everything else that's the para hippocampal place area that likes places okay over in the left hemisphere is this particularly cool little patch in yellow this region responds strongly when you look at visually presented words and letter strings and not when you look at or much less when you look at faces and bodies and scenes and objects and other stuff and so what's cool about that is that humans have only been reading for a few thousand years and that's not enough for natural selection to have crafted a special circuit for just that process of reading and that means that since we find the spec this specialized response here on the bottom of the brain that bit of brain must have been wired up by this person's individual experience learning to read not by the ancestral evolutionary experience of their ancestors now so that suggests this person's experience that wired up that selectivity doesn't tell us how these bits got wired up a question we will return to later in this talk okay out on the lateral surface of the brain we have a lot of other good stuff so over here that little purple bit responds more to images of bodies than anything else um and over here on the left temporal lobe that orange bit responds to the sounds of speech and importantly one of these bars is when you're listening to your native language and the other bar is when you're listening to a foreign language you do not understand so this region is not interested in understanding the meaning of a sentence it's interested in processing the sounds of speech like the difference between a ba and a pa okay so right now you're doing both those things you're analyzing the sounds you're hearing and you're also let's hope understanding the meaning of the sentences that i'm uttering that little orange bit is just for processing the sounds of speech okay so all of these things i've talked about so far are involved in analyzing different perceptual problems for you know recognizing faces visually scenes bodies visual words and hearing speech sounds so you might think maybe we only have specialized machinery in the brain for aspects of perception do we also have them for higher level cognition well ed federenko who is a faculty member in our department and was my postdoc a bunch of years ago decided to ask that question for the case of language so she figured out how to identify these language regions that i showed you actually in the first slide they've been known for 200 years from studies of brain damage but only very blurrily she showed with functional mirai you can see my lab tech david that's his brain here you can see these red bits right here on his temporal lobe and his frontal lobe that respond selectively when you read or hear sentences compared to everything else okay so what ev wanted to know is are those regions really selective for processing language just as the face place and body regions are selective for processing faces places and bodies so to find out she scanned subjects while they did a whole bunch of different tasks and the details don't matter she included basically all the tasks that people had thought might overlap with language in the brain like arithmetic like music like holding information in working memory and like a whole bunch of other things and so she scanned people she had already identified their language regions here by scanning them on language tasks and then she measured the response of those language regions to all these other tasks and the question is do those language regions do all that other stuff or not and the answer is pretty simple here's a region in the language region the back of the temporal lobe sometimes known as wernicke's area here's its response when you read sentences and when you enlighten when you read strings of non-words that's you know meaningless um meaningless things that look like they could be words but they're not actual words and here's the response in all the other tasks big bunch of nothing so what that shows is that this region is very selectively involved in processing language information how come some of them are upside down what are what are oh the bars yeah that just means they go down so it's a good question what does zero mean so with functional mri um a given number you scan somebody you get some mri magnitude number from some voxel some 3d pixel in their brain and it'll be like 647 and that's meaningless doesn't mean anything at all so the only way to interpret mri data is to compare two conditions two or more conditions and say which one is higher so in these experiments we usually have a rest condition which is ridiculous because what would that mean you tell people okay don't think now turn off your brain for the next 20 seconds no cognition nothing we can't do that so instead we just have people stare at a dot and we just let them rest and whatever happens happens but at least they're not focusing on one particular task we're asking them to do so in next line is staring at a dot yeah so zero is staring at a dot and this blue thing just means that uh what is that that's a spatial working memory a difficult spatial working memory task it says that maybe you have slightly less activity in that region when doing the difficult spatial working memory task than when staring at a dot okay now you can also see the error bars are huge so that's not even a significant difference but if it were to become significant that's what it would mean okay does that make sense yeah that's a good question i'm glad you asked okay so does everybody get how this is showing like really pretty extreme selectivity of that region for language it's not engaged in all these other things and i will say that lots of other brain regions respond to all of these things so we know that they can strongly drive the brain it's not that they're crappy tasks they just don't activate these regions similarly if we look up here in the frontal lobe this is basically an area called broca's area and it does the same thing higher response to sentences than non-words and pretty much almost no significant response to any other condition so what's cool to me about these data is it's not just oh we get to put another selective blob on the brain that's always fun i do like that but i think this is a particularly fun blob because it tells us that language and thought are not the same thing and probably every one of you has wondered about this at some point like do we think in language do we need language for thinking what is up with that and i think here we have a very concrete answer from the brain it's telling us that the parts of your brain that are engaged when you understand the meaning of a sentence are just not engaged when you do all kinds of other thinking like arithmetic and holding stuff in in memory and appreciating music and lots of other kinds of thinking just don't use those regions at all so language and thought are not the same thing in the brain uh but maybe the coolest wildest freakiest part of the brain is that little pink bit right there that's been studied most extensively by our our own rebecca sacks and she showed that that region is selectively engaged when you think about what other people are thinking now if that seems nuts to you reflect on the fact that you do this all the time every time you have a conversation with somebody you're taking into account what they already know so you can decide what you need to tell them right now as i'm lecturing to you i'm trying to figure out okay these guys have lots of technical background do i need to say this other stuff do they already know that what's in their heads are they following me all this kind of stuff and that is kind of what it means to be a human being is to just spend a lot of your time thinking about what other people are thinking it is the essential ingredient and novels we don't have novels that are about mountains or inanimate objects not just because they don't do much uh you could have a novel about a tornado but it wouldn't be very interesting if there weren't people involved what we care about is what is going on inside other people's heads that's what human beings care most about and so it turns out we have a specialized region of the brain for processing just that okay so what's cool about rebecca's work is she has spent lots of effort showing that that region is not engaged in processing um what other people look like or even their bodily sensations like thirst or hunger or pain it's very specifically involved in thinking about the contents of their thoughts which is remarkable okay having told you all this stuff i want to say that i don't think this is true of every patch of the cortex not every little patch is doing something hyperspecific like the regions i just described in fact those white bits up there are sometimes called the multiple demand regions because they respond to almost any different kind of difficulty or demand so pretty much any difficult task you do those white regions kick in and so here's some data showing that here's a whole bunch of tasks where they filled in bars at the difficult version of the task and the light bars are the easy version of that task so basically showing that across a wide swath of tasks those regions are turn on more when you do something harder so i was wondering when can fmri show inhibition as opposed to just the activation of neurons and is there like some kind of baseline that you base that off of right it's a great question um so functional so i skipped over what functional mri is actually measuring so let's do just a 30 seconds on that so functional mri is actually looking at changes of the oxygenation of hemoglobin in the blood in your brain and because we have fine capillaries all over the brain with a really dense blood flow supply um uh we can look at that and it turns out that if you use a little piece of your brain like some little piece up there you turn on the neurons there because you're doing some tasks using those neurons turns out that the blood flow increases to just that part of the brain just like if you go running blood flow has to increase to your calf muscles to supply them metabolically because it's metabolically costly to run it's also metabolically costly to have neurons fire so blood flow increases to that region and that changes the concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin okay and so those two are magnetically different in a way that an mra machine can detect so that's the basic signal so now if you think about it it's actually looking at metabolic cost measured by way of blood flow okay so because it's metabolic cost it's possible that inhibition is also metabolically costly and so it may be that the activation we're seeing is actually suppression of some neurons in those regions right so there are many many ambiguities in functional mri data and an early researcher in the field pointed out mostly as a joke but it's technically true that that face area that could be the part that really sucks at face recognition right that's what the neurons are they're going you know right or it could be the part that gets shut off right where there's active suppression of those neurons now i'll show you other data to suggest that that's not the case here but your point is exactly right that when you see a response with functional mri it's very ambiguous and in some cases it could reflect inhibition rather than excitation okay you have a second question which i forgot now yes um so this is just more for curiosity but you talked about a region that um tries to process other people's thoughts and i was wondering um you know in people with things like anxiety or mental disorders that are known for quote-unquote overthinking have you seen maybe like an over-activation of these areas or yeah that's a good question i don't know the answer to that question i'm not sure people have looked at that but another thing you might wonder is what does that region look like in people with autism who famously have relatively specific deficits in understanding other people yeah and so the surprising result is so rebecca sacks and many other people have looked at this and first of all you have to scan quite to answer the question you have to scan quite high functioning people with autism because if they're not verbal you know they're not going to cooperate with your task you're not going to be able to explain to them what to do um so she needs people who uh can basically do her tasks that require thinking about other people's thoughts and that's already you know a subset of people with autism but if you scan those people and say okay yes they gain those abilities much later in development than typically developing kids and maybe they're a little worse at it but they can basically do it now do they use the same machinery or have they solved that problem in some totally different way the surprising answer is they use the same damn machinery they get exactly the same magnitude of response it's in the same place it looks the same in every possible way except for one very obscure difference which you could ask me about at the end of the lecture if you like but surprisingly it looks really similar and um so there must be you know but again what we see with functional mri is just that it's there and just you know basically when the neurons are firing that leaves wide open the question of what exactly the neurons are doing and what they're computing and what they're representing and how they're doing it and all of that but at least the same basic architecture is in place thank you sure so these multiple demand regions they just turn on whenever you do anything difficult unlike all the other regions that are very particularly and only turn on when you do one little thing all right so that's my whirlwind overview um highly idiosyncratic featuring uh lines of research i've been involved in and i'm a fan of um but um what you can see even from this uh this overview is that um is that we've made real progress uh i really like this picture because this picture of the set of functionally distinct regions that are present in every one of us that includes highly regions that are highly specialized for abstract uniquely human functions like language and like thinking about each other's thoughts i like to think of this diagram as a kind of initial sketch of who we are as human beings who we are as thinkers but at the same time this is just embarrassed beginning this diagram is like a thumbnail of a theory of brain organization not an actual theory because it leaves out a huge number of questions and the way i like to think of it as just a road map for the questions we asked next and so what i'm going to do is consider a few of those questions what is the causal role of these regions in behavior what other specializations might exist in the brain how do these things get wired up in development and then there's a million other questions but i'm going to focus on these three starting with this one here all right and i probably won't get through all three but we'll just do what we do all right so what do i mean by saying what is a causal rule well first let me remind you that in science causality is of the essence right scientific theories don't just say stuff like well when this happens that other thing tends to happen at the same time like no that's no good we want to know did this thing make that thing happen did this thing make that thing happen did something else make them both happen we need to know what is causing what in science that's the essence of a scientific and here's the bad news functional mri will never answer that question it's a drag but we should face reality it's not going to answer that question so that means that if we want to know not just okay these regions tend to turn on when you do these tasks we want to know are those regions necessary for those tasks and to answer that question we need different methods okay so a few years ago i got a phone call from a colleague and he told me that this gentleman here was awaiting neurosurgery in japan and had already been uh implanted with electrodes all over the bottom of his brain for clinical reasons so that the neurosurgeons could plan the surgery they planned to treat his intractable epilepsy okay and so they said we have electrodes all over the bottom of the brain and the patient has agreed to allow us to record data from those electrodes in the few days while he's awaiting neurosurgery did i want to collaborate it's like duh of course i wanted to collaborate so for comparison here's the bottom of my brain showing you in red my face selective regions in green my place selective regions in purple are regions of my brain that respond more to color information than grayscale and you can see by comparison that it looks like those electrodes are going right over some of the interesting stuff back here so we sent some stimuli um to japan quickly and they sent us back data from this strip of electrodes here so each little graph is the response of one of those electrodes over time this is two seconds on the x-axis here and this is a kind of measure of mean neural activity measured electrically at each point and so what you see oh and the colors are different kinds of stimuli so you see a bunch of electrodes here that respond a whole lot to faces and pretty much not at all to anything else look at that selectivity much better than the selectivity i showed you with functional mri before because functional mri is based on blood flow which is pretty good but blurs together adjacent brain regions and here we have electrical responses from just one little two millimeter patch of brain and it's extremely selective so the first cool thing about this is that these data validate what we see before with functional mri okay um but the cooler thing is the neurosurgeons wanted to know about the causal role of those regions i think one of these neurosurgeons had accidentally cut out that bit and made the patient unable to recognize faces so i think he was very wary of that and wanted to make sure he knew which of those regions were causally involved so they said okay they're going to stimulate right there electrically through those same electrodes and see what the patient says so let's see what happens oops there we go okay so you're going to see um here's the patient looking at the neurosurgeon and this shows you that foreign right there right in his feet okay so shows that that region is causing involvement here he's been created in this place we're asking is every causally involved no change foreign i am one more time all right you get the idea he doesn't know where he's being stimulated um he's just asked to report if anything changes he doesn't even know that there's a fusiform face area he doesn't know where the electrodes are he's just looking at those things and reporting what he sees okay so the point of all of this is that shows us that that region is causally involved in face perception it doesn't just turn on when you look at faces if you disrupt it you can actually create a percept of a face right and further it shows us that it's um selectively involved when he's looking at a box or a ball or a character it doesn't change the shape of the box or the ball or the character it just puts a face on top of it so now our next question is okay but maybe anything you do maybe you like hit your head or something it makes you see a face maybe anything you do makes makes a person see a face so um what if he stimulated right next door in a region that prefers colors we showed that both in his brain and you can see it's also true in mind so what happens when he's zapped right there well let's see can you just ask what is it oops i screwed it up start again museum foreign pretty wild huh scientifically i mean it's just wild to see again okay scientifically what's important about this it shows that those regions are not only activated by but causally involved in the relevant function and those causal roles are very specific you zap one region you get a face percept you zap the color preferring region you get a rainbow it's like i wrote the script but i didn't i have a question uh so so uh i was confused in the first video so when he is looking at a face and then they zap him he sees a distorted face but when he's looking at something that doesn't have a face he sees a face exactly exactly okay and so we wouldn't have necessarily predicted exactly that um because we don't know basically when you stimulate you're basically activating probably tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of neurons all at once in some area so that's a very crude sledgehammer you're taking that whole chunk of brain and saying okay guys turn on a whole bunch of stuff here so you can imagine how if you had a representation of the face and the pattern of response across those neurons before you stimulate it then you throw in this big signal you disrupt it you change what the face looks like whereas if you're looking at something else you you make a net face signal right it didn't have to be but given that that's what happens it's consistent with the idea that those neurons are you know activation of those neurons is sufficient to create a phase perception okay i i have a question so i i don't i don't know if i completely understand you know like the stimulus itself but was was there a lot of research into like quantifying if different stimuli have different effects on like what the patient saw yeah you mean different kinds of electrical stimulation yeah or like if it was in the same region maybe if we stimulate it by like 20 more perhaps it could have a different effect yes that is possible and they in this study they stimulated at just two intensities i think it was four milliamps and eight milliamps and with four milliamps there was just a weak version of the same thing um with eight milliamps that those were the data i showed you right so there's plenty more room to ask all kinds of more sophisticated questions like suppose you stimulate at different frequencies um uh or in you know or in slightly different locations and with this case you know when you get data like these these are extremely rare and precious to get these kind of data with humans monkey labs you just go in this and do this to a monkey anytime you like it's up to you right but here we only get to piggyback on what the neurosurgeons have decided to do for clinical reasons anyway and so it will be wonderful to explore all that stuff in rich detail but it's kind of unlikely anybody will get to do that yeah so it's kind of wide open the degree to which it depends on all kinds of other things because we just don't get enough data to find out and you can try stuff like this on monkeys but the real advantage of doing this in humans with a monkey you would have to train the monkey to do a task like did it change or does it look like this or something you could ask the monkey a specific question you spend months and months training the monkey to be able to answer this question but then if something else happens the monkey's gonna say well you know this thing you asked me didn't happen but this other cool thing happened you might want to know about monkey's not going to tell you that a person will tell you all of that right so there's a real advantage to doing this in in people which you can see just watching the video i had a question for you yeah thank you so um do you think then that the sort of appropriate direction of using fmri with its own limits of um like you effective connectivity being really difficult to do um that it would be appropriate to sort of use fmri to find uh that like functional segregation of areas like diffusive form and then use things like that where you actually go to the the document part of the brain and then stimulate it to see like like use functional connectivity to sort of localize where you think that is more likely to be the case where it would be like a face area and then you stimulate it um so then my question would be then if because that seems like a really good path but obviously doing that on humans is just really really rare i mean this time it was possible because of that specific scenario do you think that would be more common or do you think it's still going to be very rare to well okay so me seems like a really good way of doing things but obviously it's awesome in the very rare cases where we get to do this we're like oh my god but it's very rare so i think many people in studying the human brain have realized that these intracranial studies are where it's at it's a very delicate business because you don't want to go overboard and pressure patients here they are in dire straits we're really lucky when they're generous enough to let us you know run one or two experiments and record from their brains um but they're you know not feeling good and they're undergoing a really scary horrible situation and they're very vulnerable to be very careful not to pressure them but um but many people actually i think really appreciate the opportunity to do something scientifically useful and after all they're hanging out in the hospital for a week anyway basically waiting to have a seizure with nothing much else to do it's not that awful to look at our stimuli while they're at it right so there are many efforts to increase access to these kind of data and we're very lucky at mit because we have a new collaboration that's just been started with a new neurosurgeon at mass general hospital mark richardson he's awesome he's the nicest guy ever and really excited to collaborate with us and so he is now um working with us and we think we'll have much increased opportunity to get these kind of data at least the recording data if not the stimulation data stimulation data are even more rare um but we'll get some of that so i think with this kind of work um you just have to be patient and so you do you develop many other lines of research and then you're in my lab if there's a patient with electrodes in their brain usually we hear about it the day before everybody drops everything and focuses on that because it's just so exciting and so so special okay thank you and so is transcranial like magnetic stimulation too big of a and it's not as good as that electric yeah so there are many many methods in human cognitive neuroscience and if you guys want to learn more about this go to my brain site nancy's brain talks i have loads and loads of lectures there on all the different methods of cognitive neuroscience but the simple story is there's lots of them and each of them has a slightly different niche right and so um the the ideal thing to do is just for any scientific question you're asking you want to figure out what is the right method to answer that question so tms transcranial magnetic stimulation is great because it's a causal test right like electrical stimulation like studies studying patients with brain damage but unlike functional mri tms is a causal test uh but it has many other limitations like it can only you know it can all it's not very spacially specific it's it's not terrible it's good for like maybe two centimeter resolution something like that um so it's very useful but it has tiny effect sizes it can't reach deep in the brain and it has other limitations basically to answer any questions fully you need all the methods in human cognitive neuroscience thank you sure um okay so we're going to run out of time but that's okay um i mean actually if i get through a little bit of this next part then any of you want to hear more can watch the talk can email me i'll send you the zoom link to the talk i gave a few weeks ago and that will actually just build right from here so that will work great okay an obvious other question when you look at a picture like this is okay what else we got speech and visual motion and bodies and reaching and words and like what else right so one of the things we do in my lab and that lots of people do in in other labs is to ask that question and so one paper we published a couple years ago that i'll just mention the results if you're interested i can send you the paper um is my then postdoc laila ishik um said well one of the things we humans do is not just look at other people's faces or listen to their language we look at groups of people pairs of people and we try to figure out are they interacting with each other so she scanned people and showed that a patch right about there in that kind of dark teal turquoisey color responds selectively when you see two people interacting with each other compared to two people um acting independently so that seems to be specific for perceiving third party social interactions so that's pretty wild and cool another thing we've been looking at is these set of brain regions here in purple approximately this is work in collaboration with josh tenenbaum and josh has been saying for a number of years now and it took me a while to get you know what he was talking about often i go through this trajectory with josh where he'll be making a whole big point and think what planet is this guy on and then after like a while i hear it third fourth time's like oh oh yeah he's really on to something there and that happened here and the point is that um when we go around in the world we do lots of interacting with other people and so a lot of these brain regions are social they're involved in seeing or hearing or understanding other people but we also have to understand the physical world but you can't take a single action on the world you can't pick up a pen or dial something on your iphone or take or get up from the chair or walk across the floor without having some kind of mental idea of the physical basis of the world you're acting on how heavy is the pen how frictiony is its surface you know if i grab this phone will it slide right out of my fingers can i is it squishy no it's not you know how exactly will this floor support my weight all that kind of stuff so we published a paper a few years ago in collaboration with josh um with preliminary evidence that these brain regions here may be involved in understanding the physical world it's very early days in that line of work we're doing other things to try to build on it we've shown well anyway it's ongoing work but something actually i'd love to fit in if i can before i run out of time um is some studies that i did a few years ago with josh mcdermott on auditory cortex okay so let me tell you a little bit about that because they're quite different from the other things i've talked about so here's josh this was done by sam norman hegner who was our joint graduate student and when we started this work almost nothing was known about the organization of auditory cortex it was known that all this stuff on the top of the temporal lobes here is involved in processing auditory information but beyond that we just didn't really know much so we said okay let's take a totally different approach to trying to understand how auditory cortex is organized instead of sitting around and making up hypotheses like okay do we have a bit that's good for voice recognition let's test that do we have a bit that does this do we have a bit that does that i mean there's nothing wrong with that i've been doing that for a few decades now but who's to say that the things that we think up are the things that are going to be true in the brain maybe the brain has its own ideas about how to organize itself that are things we would never think up so this is a study that tries to use the data you collect a lot of data and you try to let the data tell you what the structure is instead of going at the brain with a specific hypothesis okay so we scan people well they listen to lots of different sounds basically all the basic categories of sounds you hear frequently in daily life stuff like this okay um 165 different two-second sound clips we scan people listening to each of these we then measure the response of each 3d pixel or voxel in the brain to each of those 165 sounds and that gives us a big old data matrix like this okay so now here are our actual data very compressed so kind of blurred out but here's our 165 sounds and across 10 subjects we have voxels up here in auditory cortex of roughly a thousand per subject and we just stick them all together in this data matrix so the brightness of each pixel tells you how strongly one of those voxels responds to one of those sounds okay so now we have this big matrix and now we just do some math to basically say what is the structure inherent in this matrix okay and if any of you have had any linear algebra this will be basic to you this is a variant of principal components analysis called independent components analysis it's actually a variant of independent component analysis but that's close enough and if you don't know what that is don't worry it's just a bunch of math that enables you to take a matrix like this and say tell me what its basic structure is what is the structure hidden in here okay and so what's cool about this is this completely neutral to any hypothesis about the locations of particular things in the brain this analysis doesn't even know which voxel is where they're just all thrown together in the matrix and it doesn't know which sound is which it's just math pure math okay and so what we do is um we find that just six components can explain eighty percent of the replicable variance in this matrix so what that means is that we have just six response profiles of the sounds each of them paired with a set of weights across the cortex and if you take those six you can reconstruct basically all of the structure in this matrix that's replicable and that doesn't mean there are only six kinds of neurons in auditory cortex and part is a statement about how impoverished functional mri is but it's pretty cool the data are just telling us there's basic structure and so now we can say what are those components and to find out what we can do is we can stick the labels back on and look at them and the first four that we see are kind of expected properties of auditory cortex for example one of them is a selective response to high frequencies another respon is a selective response to low frequencies and that replicates the long known tonatopic organization of auditory cortex basically there's a map of auditory frequency laid out across auditory cortex and we rediscover that long known map with our hypothesis neutral uh methods and that's great because it tells us these methods can discover things we already know to be true that's like check check good and that makes us more likely to believe the new stuff it discovers okay so there were two new components that were not like anything we predicted and here's one of them so this is now the response of one of those components inferred mathematically from that matrix to each of the 165 sounds now those sounds are color coded by the basic category of sound over here so if you look at that you say look at those green things if we then average within a category you can see that that component reflects high responses to speech sounds whether english or foreign so just like i told you at the beginning of the lecture there's this patch of brain that isn't about processing the meaning of language because this region responds the same to both english and foreign speech rather it's it's it's responding to the sounds of speech okay what's this blue bar oh that's vocal music so there's also speech sounds in there okay so this component just that emerges from the math and the data without our going into a hypo in with a hypothesis is showing us that there's a specialized aspect of the brain that responds selectively to speech so that's pretty awesome there was actually a little bit of prior evidence that this might be true but our evidence is much stronger with all these all these um sounds here we can show how strongly selective this response is um okay so that's cool um okay i just said that okay then there was component six and component six was the real surprise so if you look at component six you say oh it's always blue and purple stuff what is that well if you average by category you see the compute component six is selective for music here the different um the dark blues up here are the instrumental music sounds and you can see they're all interleaved with the music sounds that have vocals in blue and you can see there's almost like a drop off a cliff like all the music sounds are high and then you go off a cliff and actually some of those orange ones there are things like cell phone ringtone which is was categorized as not music but actually kind of is okay so this is awesome wait sorry before i say how awesome that is each component also has a set of weights in the particular fossils in the brain so we can also say okay where are those components primarily located in the brain and this one this is a kind of close-up of the top of the temporal lobe this is the temporal pull back of the head the white black and white are high low high frequencies that's primary auditory cortex this is that tonotopic map i mentioned before and what you see here is the speech component is just below it okay okay the music component is just in front and behind that part of auditory cortex so this is awesome because now we have a what's known as a double dissociation of speech and music in the brain that means we have a part that does speech not music and another part that does music not speech and that shows that those things are really separate in the brain and that's great because a lot of people why we have music in the first place has been this long-standing mystery in the field nobody knows it's clear why we have to be able to recognize faces or understand language uh we need those things to survive but why do we have music why does every human culture have music nobody knows one of the theories has been that natural selection is built in um speech and music machinery in the brain um but once you have that you can then co-opt it and do other stuff with it and use your speech machinery to process music and this says nope that story doesn't work because the speech and the music machinery are completely non-overlapping in the brain okay um i'm almost out of time okay so when you find an awesome wild result like this your first reaction should be really let's try to find it another way just did somebody asked a little while ago when do we use different methods we use all the methods we can get our access get access to to try to reinforce what we're finding and so we were very lucky to be able to work with girv shock here to collect intracranial data just recording data not stimulation data from the temporal lobe in patients undergoing neurosurgery while they listen to our sounds and so what we found is without doing any of the fancy math of factorizing that matrix just looking at the responses of individual electrodes here's for example one electrode this is time here because now with intracranial recording it's electrical so we have time information you can see this electrode responds selectively to speech the two green curves are the time course of the response to native and foreign speech and pink i believe is vocal music so that's a speech selective electrode consistent with what we found with functional mri and here is a music selective electrode vocal and non-vocal music consistent with what we inferred from functional mri but with intracranial recording we actually also found something new that we had not seen with functional mri and that is song selective electrodes so these are electrodes that are so specific that they don't respond to any in any music they respond only to vocal music isn't that awesome um okay so i am running out of time so what i'm gonna do is skip the whole second part of the talk and go to my last slide and say that we've argued that there are that some of these regions are causally specifically involved in different aspects of cognition we're still discovering new bits like this music bit here and the part you didn't hear about development um shows that we know there's a role of experience in development for example that visual word form area i described it's only selective for visually presented words after you learn to read not before and in data i didn't show you we think it lands in the same location across subjects because of pre-existing long-range connectivity of that region to other parts of the brain and they're just a whole host of other wide open questions that weren't part of this lecture and that are wide open like how does all this stuff all this intricate structure the same in every one of us get built up over evolution how did it evolve what exactly is represented and computed in each region as a little advertisement i think i used to think this was like the coolest question and like mostly out of reach but now i think what the advent of um of deep neural networks and the ability to compare them to brains we're starting to make new progress here i'm almost done what is the exact connectivity of each region to the rest of the brain and how do they work together to produce intelligent cognition and behavior and my favorite question that's also in my recent talk if you're interested is why is this a good way to design a brain in the first place if you were an engineer would you build a computer with all these specialized bits well we've been using deep nets to ask that question and ask whether the particular specializations we see in the brain are for mental functions that have to have their own machinery because if you try to get one network to do all those things together it can't do all of them
