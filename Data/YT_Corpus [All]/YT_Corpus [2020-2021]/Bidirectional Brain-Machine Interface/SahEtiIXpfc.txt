 good morning everyone I'd like to go ahead and  get us started here I'm Kelly Born executive   director of the cyber policy center here at  Stanford University and today our webinar is   going to focus on questions around technology  and well-being and we are fortunate to be   joined today by Jeff Hancock who's an affiliate  here at the cyber policy center a professor in   Stanford's department of communications and the  founding director of the Stanford social media   lab as well as Amy Orben from Emanuel College  in the UK whose research amongst other things   explores social media use and teenage mental  health and finally by Erica Pelavin from My   Digital Tattoo, a Silicon Valley nonprofit focused  on building healthy habits critical thinking and   thoughtful online behavior and Erica has been  working a lot with schools including Jeff here   at Stanford and healthcare professionals across  the country quickly for background for those of   you who aren't familiar with the cyber policy  Center our research and teaching focuses on   digital technology and questions around security  geopolitics and democracy or home to about a half   dozen programs and our work is really intended  to help inform the policy agenda of governments   academics civil society leaders and tech platforms  globally and we are hosting these webinars now   every other Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. PST with  experts from around the world and a little   bit about today's focus but as I said on tech and  well-being which i think is especially important   now given our massive increase in technology  use under kovat and so before going into this   with our colleagues just a couple of facts before  kovat everyone was online a lot we have research   suggesting that 30 percent of people said they  were online almost constantly and this is before   kovat with 45 percent of teens saying the same  and that's up from just 25 percent of teens saying   that in 2014 so these numbers are growing we see  that tech use daily before kovat was on average   globally about six hours and 45 minutes a day half  of that on mobile devices with the US right in the   middle and the Philippines in Brazil at close to  ten hours a day Germany and Japan only three or   four hours a day and of course this has increased  dramatically under Covid we see that YouTube, Tick   Tock and Twitch usage are all up 15 to 20 percent  Facebook up 25% NextDoor up 73% Google classroom   up a hundred and fifty percent I'm surprised not  more demand when children's use of that and Zoom   up more than 400 percent at 300 million users now  daily so significant usage of technology and I   think there's been a lot of discussion about both  the harms and the benefits of that which we want   to explore today on the harm side we've heard  a lot about how the impact of technology use on   how our minds work our capacity for analytical  thinking memory focus creativity and reflection, concerns about addiction social divisiveness, anxiety and depression information overload   and the lack of in-person connection and then  we also hear a lot about how technology helps   us through connections like this through access  to real-time information and services especially   health services under coded and through increases  in our general contentment our ability to meet   partners volunteer and so forth so there has been  much discussion about this and the last thing I'll   say was based on some pew research in the last few  months they found that half of experts predicted   tech experts that individuals well-being will  be more helped than harmed by digital life in   the next decade a third said it would be more  harmed than helped and 21% are predicting about   no change at all so I'll be curious to hear what  our colleagues say today I'm gonna start with Jeff   and Jeff would turn to you to share what you see  as the biggest risks or concerns around our use   of technology as well as the biggest benefits  and opportunities I'd love in particular for   you to talk about your recent meta-analysis  on the impact of social media on our over well   overall well-being I found that fascinating and  then any relevant Co good related research that   you want to cover and then from there I want to  turn to Amy for you to talk about what you see   as the relationship between social media use  and life satisfaction how you see all of this   across different types of apps and different types  of users and then putting it all on historical   perspective what you think about the moment that  we are in with digital technology as it compares   to additive books or radio and then Erica lastly  would love to turn to you to share with us what   you think of as the best sort of principles  or philosophies to better support kids use of   technology and also what you've been seeing around  how kids are using tech platforms to help support   their mental health and stay connected during  the pandemic and then we'll save hopefully 30   minutes or so for Q&A so please anyone feel free  to enter questions in the chat box and I'll do   my best to moderate those as well but first thanks  to the panelists and Jeff I'll turn it over to you   thanks Kelly and thank you for inviting us and  in organizing this panel and hello to everybody   out there excited to talk about today this I mean  I'm really passionate about I think it's important   anytime I talk to any parent there's you know real  concerns about how their kids are interacting with   technology but when I talk to almost anybody  they're concerned about the world in general   about their parents so there's real concerns about  how technology is doing what it's doing to society   and I think this is not unreasonable because it  is having such a tremendous change they want to   change just in the last two decades if we think  back to the 90s to now it's it's pretty serious   change whatever that happens there's deep concerns  about the technology that's doing that and Amy can   speak to that a little bit she's done some really  nice work as a paper out on historical aspects of   these kind of moral panics about technology that  I really recommend to everyone it's fantastic   but whenever there is these kinds of technological  disruptions it does mean that there are vulnerable   populations and there can be real issues so I want  to jump into some of the research that we did and   then come look forward to some of the research and  ideas that I think we need to move towards I did a   large meta-analysis with my team in the social  media lab Henne Mackowski is one of the people   and she's in the audience here today that worked  on this looking at hundreds of articles the reason   that I wanted to do that was I was receiving kind  of updates and alerts about research around social   media and one day would be that things like  Facebook increased loneliness and then the next   day would be that it improves social connectedness  and just wasn't making sense so I wanted to take   a look instead of individual studies across what  the field of evidence could tell us about and when   we looked at the research this is about 2006 up  until 2018 2019 there were a lot of studies turned   twenty-six of them and in there was over 200,000  participants we know a fair bit unfortunately   a lot of the work was pretty correlational  I'm just gonna share a slide here with you just give you a little bit of a background  on this so we wanted to take a look at how   often people use social media which is the no more  concern that parents and almost everybody has how   much were using this is affecting us and whether  that's connected to our well-being and we did we   looked at all these studies and AM analysis allows  you to take apples and oranges and turn them all   into the same kind of fruit and look at what is  the effect across all these studies and what we   ended up finding was a very small correlation  not significant it's equal to 0.01 and as Amy   and others have found in literature when you look  at these large-scale studies the effects are very   very small and tend to be not significant and so  there isn't a straight up relationship between how   often we use screen time and our well being and  whenever I tell people this how can that be and   they're right to be suspicious of this because  in fact it can have a little bit of an effect   with anxiety and that can be negative and make us  feel worse but it's offset by the value you get in   learning about what's going on with your family  and friends and feeling socially connected and   those are like kind of obvious when we step back  and think well what could the values and harms be   rather than just technologies doing things to us  I think another problem with the research so far   and the way it's covered in the media is the way  we've been focusing on screen time when we look   back through history at these moral panics and  even now we have a very much like a DOS metaphor   a mindset where the more you get of this thing  the worse it is and it's all focused on screen   time as if you know me connecting with say my  mom on canada's day which is today happy Canada   Day everybody me connecting through social media  with my mom is the same as say me being mean to   somebody or or or stalking my ex-girlfriend  or something like that it equates those two   things which are psychologically very different  as exactly the same because it's amount of time   on the screen when we take back a step back and  think of it that way it's pretty clear that that   doesn't seem right and that screen time is really  problematic I think mindsets really matter one of   my students at social media lab has been working  on this mindsets idea she came up with this notion   that mindsets about social media could matter  they go something like this if you think that   social media is addictive and it's like screen  time dosage then when you do need to use it   because many people in current society are using  it regularly me to use it for schoolwork or to   find out where the soccer game is etc you think  it's addictive you've used it you feel bad about   yourself and you feel guilty and that's gonna be  harmful for you because you feel bad even though   you've just used the device whereas if you feel  that this is a tool a powerful tool like a primate   and sticks with when you use it you realize  that you're in charge and you're doing that   and you're responsible for your actions with it so  I think these mindsets really matter and to date   researchers and scientists including myself have  sort of focused on screen time and I think that's   led to a really problematic way for us to think  about it and it ignores the fact that in my view   psychology matters much more than technology I  think that's really one of the key conclusion here   ok so what can we do going forward well there's  been other technologies that have been actually   quite harmful for us and have sick benefits the  car continues to kill many people it's one of the   most common ways that people are killed in the US  anyways and back in the 70s when I was growing up   and this is the car that my dad had we weren't  rich but my dad loved the idea of a continental   Lincoln Continental so we were carting around  in this car all the time and they would smoke   both my parents smoked at the time we didn't have  seatbelts on and you know you think back to it it   was like deadly time indeed they were but people  didn't want to just give up tech you know cars   or somehow limit car time instead what we did is  we developed regulations so drinking and driving   became illegal wearing seatbelts was mandatory  a lot of regulation came into place we developed   technology so now my car will will dinging me  angrily until I put my seatbelt on and we have   safety bags except your airbags and those kind of  things we developed new norms so there isn't a law   against smoking in a car with children but that  just doesn't happen anymore people will be very   judged towards that you can also drink and drive  and not necessarily get caught but that's now   frowned upon very serious we developed new ways  of thinking about how we behave with technology   an education changed a lot when I got my learner's  license I had that for 30 days and then after a   test I was able to drive by myself and with my  friends and as a mail a lesson that's pretty   dangerous now it takes about a year to get through  all of that sort of thing so I think we can change   the way we think about technology by thinking  more about how young people are using it yes   there are real risks especially around bullying  porn seems to be coming at children more and more   younger and younger ages and Erica can talk more  about the real risks and benefits of kids face it   also needs to be more science-based rather than  just this overall concern and I think we want   both kids but also society in general and older  adults who are really using technology much more   and in really positive and powerful ways to thrive  and what I mean here is instead of just thinking   about screen time think about what we can do to  maximize the positives and minimize the negatives   and since Erica and Aimee will talk a little bit  about younger people I'll just conclude by saying   let's think about older folks for example under  especially kovat 19 we've been doing research   right now that suggests they're under a particular  threat with the pandemic they're already socially   isolated and lonely and they're being asked to  use technology more and yet they're the number   one vector for misinformation both around the  pandemic but also about cures so they're being   targeted but they also have these real powers and  assets that aren't really thought about they have   a lot of time they're very civically engaged and  they want to do well they want to help the their   community and so I think we need to do much  more research with older folks to help them   overcome the threats that they're facing which  assume it and help them thrive online as they go   through this pandemic and increase the sort of  isolation so I'll pause there and return to the   other panelists and thank you all very much for  your attention I really appreciate thanks Jeff   really helpful and I've always so appreciated  your underscoring that point that it's not how   much time we spend online it's what we're doing  and and to your last point was just fascinated to   see that something like I think 30 or 40 percent  of the the quote-unquote silent generation born   before 1945 are actually on line and using social  media and have tablets which I had some have not   really appreciate it so it's a great point and Amy  can we turn to you now yes great um thank you Jeff   that was a great introduction well I'm told in  general wait I'm just going to share my screen we go you should be able to see my slides now so  yeah thanks for the the cyber policy Center for   inviting me I research mainly adolescents and as  Jeff has already mentioned so most of well I'll   be talking about is technology and young people  so and because I only have a very short amount   of time I wanted to kind of do a whistle-stop  tour about all the things that we know and then   to show actually the big things that we don't  know and I hope it will it'll make sense so I'll   focus mainly on the link between screen time and  adolescent well-being sometimes I'll digress into   social media use and lifestyle satisfaction in  particular because that's why I've been focusing   on recently in the last year but in general as  Jeff's already said the link between screen time   and also adolescent well-being not just well-being  in general is something in between null and and   negative so there's been multiple meta-analysis  and systematic reviews and by governments and by   researchers and if you look at the correlations  cross sectionally they're all near to zero or   an or very slightly negative and so my second  point here is that if they're slightly negative   they're very very small so that puts us into  kind of a bit of a conundrum because then you   start debating what is small kind of what how  should policy we react to that etc but what it   does show us is is yeah but if we open at each  set and we look at kind of adolescents and they   report how much technology they use their screen  time and they also report their well being you   for probably find a correlation that's either  zero or a small negative correlation but it   doesn't really tell us anything about the effect  of screen time a lot of people know the dogma of   correlation is not causation but how it interacts  in our lives makes it very clear that screen time   could be decreasing well-being but we'll decrease  in well-being a change in life circumstances might   be changing technology is in screen time might be  increasing it or a third factor in our lives might   be influencing but it's causing a correlation  there has no causal mechanism whatsoever for   example low socioeconomics family is in low  socio-economic status their children often use   a lot more screen time especially in the u.s. we  have some great stats on that and they often also   score lower on well-being questionnaires quote  that which could be a cause of some of these   negative correlations so while there's been a lot  of interest and speculation and media coverage on   these correlations they actually don't tell us  very much and they don't really tell us anything   that is relevant to policy because policy wants  to know you know what needs to be done and what   can be done and correlations don't tell us a lot  for that so what needs to what we need to look   at is a longitudinal relationship so it does for  example if I personally increase my social media   news or my screen time does that then decrease my  my well-being and I just want to talk a bit about   a study I did with colleagues of mine at Oxford  and the University of horn home in Germany which   showed that the relationships between social  media and life satisfaction are actually pretty   complicated they go in both directions so this  was looking at thousands of teenagers in the   UK between the age of 10 and 15 and if a teenager  increased their social media youth from their own   average in one year that predicted a very small  decrease in life satisfaction in the next year   however the opposite was also true that if there  was a if a teenager teenagers life satisfaction   decrease from their own average that predicted  an increase in social media use a year later so   instead of a one-way street with technology  affecting our lives actually our lives also   affect the way we use technologies which makes  it really hard to disentangle what the driver   of you know all these correlation or that we see  reported in the media and discuss on a day-to-day   basis so it's a lot more complicated than we  expect and this complicating kind of value of   this is increased by thinking about the need to  to consider individuals and so this is my fourth   point and I find that the need to think about  individuals is best communicated with a metaphor   that I often use with journalists when they asked  me you know does social media decrease adolescent   well-being and I often say you wouldn't trust a  scientist if I would tell you I can predict how   this adolescent that just walked past me on the  street is going to react to eating a chocolate   bar like the one we see on the screen you know  the adolescent turns out to be a heavy diabetic   that might be really really harmful it might even  be deadly however the adolescent just come home   from a massive sports match and they're really  yearning for some food some energy to replenish   their energy levels then that talketh or might  be really beneficial for them so we need to   think about the type of adolescent we're talking  about we also need to think about for example the   frequency are we talking about a chocolate bar  every second every minute every hour every day   for their birthday and then we need to think about  motivations are they eating the sugar bar because   they're sad or lonely or because they're hungry  and so around food we already have a lot of the   nuance that we need to have when we talk about  screen time and and social media because it's   not as easy as saying this chocolate bar will  harm adolescents we need to think about the   types of uses the types of users of frequencies  and motivations and I'll only cover two now so   the first is the type of user so that is the  individual differences that we're all different   and we need to account for that it but then it  could also go all the way to maybe trying to   figure out do we have diabetics of screen time and  that's the project I'm funded by at the University   of Cambridge now we already know that individual  differences are important from this longitudinal   data I talked to you about before so this is the  link of life satisfaction to social media use for   teenage girls and what I mainly want you to see  is that this is the zero access showing kind of   no effect and most of the effects are to the  left so they're negative and most of them the   confidence intervals don't overlap zero so they're  statistically significant and negative however now   it will merge into teenage boys and teenage boys  if we see they're all all the effects become non   significant of life satisfaction predicting  social media use the same as the other way   around so this is social media use predicting  life satisfaction we see teenage boys now and   then teenage girls we start seeing the kind of  directional effects becoming more negative so   if we already see these gender differences there  are probably other individual differences that are   much more important that we need to think about  the next is the type of use this is something   Jeff already mentioned and I just want to cover  kind of one of the most classic now models of   this and that's that for example actively  using social media communicating chatting   posting it maybe increases social connectedness  that increases well-being but the opposite is   also the case that passively using social media so  scrolling just looking at other people's content   might increase social comparison which in turn  decreases well-being my fifth point that I'm   getting to the end of my talk is that there's  a lack and evidence of this link so as I said   there's it's near annulled it's small if it's  correlation it's bi-directional and incredibly   complex if we start looking longer tuna Li and so  a lot of very kind of high-impact investigation   into this like the chief medical officer for  England reported that they actually couldn't   figure out whether screen time or social media  use is actually bad or good because the evidence   is not available and the last more complicating  Derr is that these concerns that we have around   technologies are reoccurring and it's something  that I've been thinking about a huge amount in   the last year and it's actually from a paper  I read a paper by somebody working out of San   Francisco and actually did some of her studies  at Stanford Mary Preston about the radio on   where she found in 1940s that you know majority  of American children were addicted to the radio   they use it like alcohol it affects their body  affects their health and it will have long-term   consequences and you know this is very similar  to the debate we're gonna have now as well you   know our screens addictive how do they affect our  children and so we need to sometimes think in the   meta perspective and start questioning why are  we having these conversations you know and so I   just want to highlight that as Jeff said I have  a recent paper out talking about this sick lissa   T of Technology panics it was actually officially  published today so on my Twitter feed I actually I   uploaded a YouTube lecture on this so if you're  interested in the meta perspective um do have a   look and I'm also happy to answer any questions  or feed this into the discussion so just to   conclude what we know is that it's complicated  and we definitely need more work before we can   we can figure this out um and give a good policy  advice thank you Amy thanks so much that was great   and I am happy to admit that I am not addicted  to the radio so at least I can check that off   of my list of koba concerns and and would love  in the QA to speak more about this question of   what other variables outside of gender you think  might predict outcomes here and would encourage   anyone who wants to enter questions in the QA to  go ahead and do so otherwise I have a barrage of   my own that will be coming your guys way in a  minute but Erika would love to turn to you now you although I'm actually not seeing Erica ah there we   go oh you see me excellent to  do now then so what do I push can you see that yes we can and I always  appreciate the irony's of doing these tech calls   when I have the same problems with my technology  yes and I have my teenage son right next to me for   this because I never mind talking but I always  worry about connection so how appropriate yes   we can see you know yes I really enjoyed the  chocolate bar analogy that was awesome because   a lot of the time when we're talking with parents  were constantly saying if your kid is experiencing   issues with gender identity or socialization or  isolation it's going to show up in their online   life and that we need to pay attention to that  so that was really interesting I'm really happy   to be here I'm Erica Delavan I'm one of the  cofounders of a nonprofit called my digital   tattoo I think it's actually appropriate during  this conversation and about our expanding our   definition of wellness to support and include  online connection to talk about the way we were   chose our name my digital tattoo and I think eight  years ago when we started working in the classroom   and we've now had the privilege of working with  over 20,000 kids and face to face conversations   from fourth grade to twelfth grade and they are  definitely our experts and have a lot to share   with us we thought we would be teaching them  about how to create a positive digital tattoo   and how to be mindful about what they say in the  sites they see and really be able to control the   device rather than the device controlling them I  think what we learned pretty soon into it is that   not only do we need to teach kids about their  tattoo but we really need to think about how   they're impacting other people's tattoos by and  mental health by what they post and the things   they forward and what they like so I thought it  would be interesting to share with you what we've   learned just in the time that we've been with  our students around how their use has changed   and where they're going on their platforms  during this time of sheltering in place and   and we found it really interesting and one of  the things that I lead at my digital tattoo is   the media in the middle podcast it's a podcast  by students for parents kind of as a fishbowl   to listen to them have conversations about what  they're struggling with and this year as kovetz   started we have a quarantine te en show as well  as our advisory is in our internships that keep   us up to date during this time and culture so  this is no surprise to anything but most of our   students would say that almost overnight teens  lost what they value most their autonomy their   independence and their social connection we have  a lot of our kids that say we just thought we'd   be gone for two weeks and be back or we they  were seniors we didn't even get to see people   to say goodbye to them or have any of the rituals  we need and things really changed overnight but I   think what has been most surprising to me in my  conversations with kids is that the black hole   was really for parents they had to learn how to  do their work online they had to rely on their   kids to help them as I just did to get back on  to the screen and share panic they're interested   in changing their zoon backgrounds and kids  have are already taken on a leadership role   with their kids but even though the parents were  in the dark I feel like our kids really knew how   to navigate some of it and one of the things that  I think it's been fascinating is and I think it's   important for us to remember because I know that  my talk would Jeff a lot and his student Angelo   we talked a lot about the idea that it's all bad  that all technology is and one of the things that   I think is interesting that you both talked about  is what kind of technology are they using and for   what purpose and I loved what Kelly said about how  exhausted they are was Xun fatigued and using the   classrooms how how much it's it's just increased  but I want to point out that from our kids during   Coppa they will say that many of them say that  their mental health is improving and I think this   is important for us to think about that we don't  put our own anxiety on to our kids experience so   for some of our kids are saying they're resting  from the pressures of school that actually we   used to say that they were so busy with all their  extracurriculars that getting online was the only   time they had time to connect but now they're  finding that they don't have this much pressure   and after school activities teachers have calmed  down a little bit about what's expected of them   I love this one that there's a freedom social  anxiety and commitments for a lot of our kids I   said yeah you know I hate going to the prom and  I hate being in big groups and I hate looking   on social media and seeing what everyone else  is doing it makes me completely anxious it's a   time for them to look at new hobbies and I'll  tell you how they're doing not an opportunity   to get to know that families better one of the  kids again with my mom so much now actually know   how weird she is like I didn't even realize how  weird she is so time to really get to know them   and be frustrated with them and kind of that a  chance to take a break on social media which I   know sounds really strange but the kids are saying  some of them that they're bored or there's not   much new or the news that they're watching is too  overwhelming so they're choosing to actually and   I'll talk about the app they're using to do that  but to step away and the part that I think is   really interesting during the black lives matter  and and the pandemic is that it's an opportunity   for virtual volunteering and activism much of  which I'll show you we're doing that as well   but like always if you have an existing mental  health issue there are also are teens who are   finding that this is amplifying their experience  in making it harder for them they're going some   going to homes that are not safe and uncomfortable  the financial stress is there taking on and having   many of our teens to go back to work to deal with  helping out their families there's a of tension   and pay rent so those things still exist but these  are the ones I wanted to tell you about and I'll   try to go quickly the heightened awareness of  the uncertainty the generalized anxiety about   what's going on and many of our kids say that  they catch that from their parents who have   on the news or conversation about that all the  time the anticipatory grief is interesting to   me it's not it's already feeling bad for things  you're not going to be able to do next year we   want the other go to college next year we won't  be able to have a prom a lot of kids telling me   they're alone with their thoughts which are really  scary the fear of being forgotten if you can't be   connected I'll talk about productivity pressure  when we talk about Instagram and the anger and   rage and I think all of us can relate to this that  we're kind of all on edge and that the people who   are closest to us we go off on but we're also  seeing that happen on social media people are   putting in there so I'm just going to quickly talk  about expanding our definition of wellness to can   include online connection I think for most adults  we always think that we have to go to a therapist   or a good friend to unwind all stuff in our head  and I think that's still a good place to go and I   know a lot of my therapists friends are moving to  to zoom to have those conversations but I actually   think our kids are doing a lot of this on their  phones so I loved this the second or third day   that kovetz started I got this text from my son  who I told you is in the tech field that said to   my parents that's they playing video games would  never pay off in the real world checkmate and it   really made you think that was from Alex it really  made me think our kids are on this like even the   world scared to how it's going to work out they  have a lot of this already in place so I want   to talk to you a little bit about how teens are  using the apps and influencers and platforms to   navigate their mental health and to really stay  connected so the first one is snapchat which is   definitely replaced texts our kids are saying  they're using more face time or even face timing   more with family members doing it more so they can  see face to face I think I mentioned productivity   pressure that the kids are feeling on Instagram  when they feel like everything they look at people   are making soured or reinventing themselves  or doing their own haircut they are doing all   of that watching on Instagram they are having  a lot of fun on tik-tok I think you mentioned   this Kelly spending a lot of time on tick-tock  they're getting a little bug to that parents are   getting then we had one kids my mom wanted to do  a graduation so that was very embarrassing to her   but they like it because they see people that  look like them they know that anybody can do it   tick tock has been a place where they're enjoying  themselves having fun there's a constant stream   they're doing next parties where they can connect  and watch movies together they're getting on   reddit's to the subreddits that means something to  them and have deep conversations in those places   that are safe and people have commonality they're  watching a lot of YouTube how to YouTube's we   have kids telling us they're getting better at  makeup giving a haircut to one of their family   members and learning how to do something they  always want to do and then of course our kids   who are going on Twitch and watching gamers  and watching these sports and actually getting   better by watching other people talking on their  disciplines together your power and community our   kids are going to places to get the support they  need anonymity is one of them that I think is so   important that they can share their struggles  in a space for maybe they wouldn't with their   friends so the first one is the butterfly project  it's for self farm project semicolon is a place   for depression where there are support groups  and places to do things for depression and The   Trevor Project that supports LGBT two kids so  they're really creating their own communities   there these are the self help and support apps  that I love they use cognitive behavioral therapy   I'm a counselor at a high school and I used to  give out handouts or books for kids to use but   instead of me picking them now kids can find  the ones that work best for them these are   self-motivated they use cognitive behavioral  therapy they may have a focus like anxiety or   if you're anxious and are suicidal there's that  happy you can use that notifies several people   that you're not moving shape packs for depression  apps for mindfulness and then lastly there are the   new online counseling and therapy I think many  of you probably know crisis text line that maybe   teens are more comfortable texting and calling  our own suicide hotlines but there are also   places like robot which is actually just a chat  bot that guides users through the management of   depression and sends little notifications like  hey how you doing okay or hope you're having a   good day when I first heard about I thought no  way but the teens really react to it they really   feel like someone's so that's me thank you we  have our podcast in our Facebook and I will stop   sharing my screen Erica thank you so much and  finally a good bot I'm always looking at very   good but we have not seen too many of those lately  I think this was incredibly helpful in thinking   about you know whether use of social media and  technology under kovat is actually contributing   to the problem or if it's really only a problem  with children who have existing mental health   issues or other extenuating circumstances around  Cova dysfunction in the home or something that are   more problematic this was very very helpful and  just as an aside and as you guys may know it's   been interesting to talk with some of the social  media platforms trust and safety programs and they   have I mean we work a lot around questions  of disinformation but when it comes to self   harm just how many automated mechanisms they have  developed to start identifying people that may be   at risk of self-harm a particular use and sending  them automatic messages and connections to some   of these help lines that you reference it's been  interesting to see social media companies taking   sort of a proactive step and directing people  to resources and I think in some instances even   notifying law enforcement oneself right mm-hmm  a possibility um lots of questions and would   encourage folks on the line to go ahead and jump  in if they have some but the first one because   it's good I think on all of our minds so much I'm  gonna see if I could just quickly share a screen   relating to this is a question about the digital  divide this is from colleagues Common Sense Media   and because there's a lot of content here I'll  just quickly hit on it but just the number of   students in rural areas that don't have adequate  connectivity you know close to 40% and by race and   ethnicity of obviously much higher percentages  of groups that have no connectivity especially   in the african-american and Native American  communities and then this point that even in   states with the smallest digital divides one in  four students are still lacking adequate internet   access so would love to just at risk of getting  people to look too long at a slide with too many   details I will stop sharing this but would just  love to hear any of your thoughts on how you see   this digital divide playing out in your research  and other concerns that you might have for less   advantaged communities when it comes to social  well-being intact and Emmie I mean even whether   this is a variable that you've looked at at boys  versus girls if there are other variables there digital divide is one of many divides you know  and I think that something like coded or any   major trauma in society always shows them in a  lot more and a lot more prominence than in kind   of normal life and so naturally the digital  divide is incredibly important and it goes   alongside other divides like kind of rooms in  the home being able to have personal space as a   teenager being able to have support when you're  at school during homeschooling and there are a   lot of researchers kind of in my department  who are working on different kind of facets   of this divide you know and naturally Aztec  research we look at the digital divide which   is incredibly important and it's something we've  been thinking about a lot here in the UK we also   have it you know we're a smaller country but  there is a huge huge difference between Internet   connectivity and that's in increasingly important  now that technology is the way that we live our   everyday lives in a review paper that I wrote  with Saturday Blake Warren who's an expert in   adolescents and Olivia to mova MIT for the lancet  child and adolescent house we really focused in   on how for teenagers social connection and social  interaction is such a key developmental feature of   life and now that most of it is happening online  you know that's really important that it's great   that you know we're now sheltering in place at  the current time because we can connect online   but it's still not the whole of society and we  often forget that in terms of measurement um I   I was funded by Barnardo's which is a children's  charity in the UK to do some work on disadvantaged   children and their tech news and for the last  years for 2019 and it's a lot more complicated   than you expect because disadvantaged isn't like  gender or age it's a lot more multifaceted and   it's a lot more difficult to actually figure  out what you want to measure you know do we   want to measure household income do we want to  measure deprivation of the area do we want to   measure whether they're on free school meals  and so we found that the picture is actually   really complicated but something interesting is  that we didn't for example see that little link   between social media use and well-being is a  lot more negative for those in disadvantaged   households quite the opposite at time we saw  that they're actually the people who don't seem   to have that negative correlation there so it  shows us that technology might also be really   important to lift those people out of a certain  neighborhoods and allow them to connect I've now   talked too much so I'll let the others answer  as well that was very helpful other thoughts   on this a relatively quick one because I agree  with everything Amy was saying but one is that   it's experience so you know we think about like  short term medium term and long term solutions   to the way that you know the negative effects  of all my technologies and one of them medium   term ones is that if you don't have access to  it you really don't get a chance to practice   and almost like any other social skill without  just time spent doing stuff and practicing and   getting feedback and figuring out what's what can  this do you you run into problems and you're more   likely to to get tripped up we see this with  older adults in some informal interviews we've   done people that used email before they retired  they're they're pretty good with social media they   understand and you know when misinformation is  coming or not they can figure out who's in there   networking who's not people they didn't have  any access to to emails to people in their 80s   and 90s they really struggle just to understand  the basic sort of like concepts of the way that   social media works it doesn't work like a letter  right so I think that practice and experience is   hugely important and if you don't have access  to it that's a giant problem and the last thing   I'll say is the pandemic has just made all of  these divides even that more problematic I have   a friend that's a kindergarten teacher it's just  broke her heart because she would see a couple of   kids in the class where they have one computer in  their house let's share it amongst everybody and   they you know the kids just could not do what they  were being asked to do because the assumption is   everyone as connectivity everybody has devices  so yeah I think it's a huge issue for lots of   different reasons yeah he's gonna follow up on  what Jeff was saying my sister's the principal   in an underserved community and she asked all  of the families if they wanted laptops when it   started and they many of them said we had one  but what they didn't realize was they had to   use it the other problem that I'm hearing a lot  from kids is that that feeling like our teachers   are feeling like they can't they can't teach  to the younger kids because the parents aren't   available to help and it requires two people to  get online and to learn or to supervise youth   while they're using their devices so that can be  created divided to the people who are essential   workers they need to go out and supervise thank  you because I was doing a program now where she   teaches a part of her class from 5:00 to 8:00  that night so parents can be there to help thank you and um Jeff I appreciate your point  about this this concern about older generations   and I think it's quite consistent with what  we've seen in the distance for mation space   that something like 80 percent or upwards  of disinformation is shared by these much   older populations because of some of the reasons  you mentioned and okay I mean they go to three   questions that have come in from the audience and  then a couple more that I have on my own but if   others have questions please go ahead and throw  them up there and I'm appreciating that with this   webinar more so than any that we've had before  it has such direct relevance to people's lives   that we have questions that are very specific to  to to their own interest to all go ahead and list   all three and then let any one of you respond and  so one is this question around the I think Jeff to   your points about screen time is this helpful at  all as a measure perhaps even just longitudinally   do we get rid of the whole thing or is there  some role or way to think about screen time   that is helpful or meaningful second is a question  about the physical impacts of tech use and I'm not   sure that folks on this call would have a view  on this and you know does it if the effect on   people's eyes headaches night shift more like how  do we mitigate the effects that these technologies   are having on us physically right now and then  a third one around particular and I'll sort of   elevate this question a little bit more broadly  and the question was you know are there particular   platforms and I think maybe Erika this one is for  you and for teens who like to write or draw that   you recommend but I guess overall do you have a  sense of like here are platforms I think are a   net good and maybe here are some that on average I  would stay away from because I presume they're not   all treated Emily so Jeff maybe you want to start  with do we care about screen time yeah I will   though if I ask Amy to weigh on this to because  Han is my student and she and I've been talking   about this issue a lot and but she's put in in a  way I haven't thought of it before is there even   any value and thinking about screen time my guess  is that that that there probably is in the short   run of research it one reason is because people  are thinking about in terms of like how much am i   doing and is that is it fitting in to what I want  to do in my life or not so the number one argument   that my daughter who's nine and I have is how  long she can be on her iPad watching shows and she   loves watching things like Netflix and she goes on  YouTube and we've talked a lot about that but what   she really needs practice at is knowing how to to  stop and I think if we continue to be like well   you're only allowed this much time and we create  all this technology to force that and that that's   preventing people like my daughter from developing  the skill sets they don't need to know when enough   is enough I'll just finish by saying I have done  some ride alongs - Erica and the my digital tattoo   teams workshops with kids it was so amazing  to listen to the kids talk about what their   concerns were it's related to the second question  and Erica knows more about this but Eric and her   team were really good at listening the kids so  they asked them where are some problems and one   of the problems was well my my thumb hurts after  I've played booty games on or my eyes hurt because   I've been watching too long and the kids were just  starting to sense like wait a minute like this is   like not good for my eyes forget about like is  this harming my brain or making me depressed it   was like it hurts my eyes so I'll tell brenno  cute I don't do research in this area but I   have a friend that works Apple and it focuses on  this topic and his conclusion is that yes that   the night shift mode is valuable it reduces the  blue light a lot but that for kids going to bed   require some time away from the screen it turns  out regardless of night mode so that was his take   and that's coming from somebody that works on this  very topic at Apple great thanks Stefan can I turn   to each of you guys for maybe one minute each and  then I want to get one final question in before I   close I want to say that when we do our parent  presentations when we talk about screen time we   tend to look we get a lot of questions about is my  kid and dicted to their device and the way we try   to see it is is it opening up their world or is it  closing it down and if it's making it so they're   connecting with friends and learning about things  and being passionate about what they're doing and   they can still get along and do the rest of their  work then it's opening up their life if you start   seeking closing down their world and they're  getting depressed or they're not engaging in   things as they'd like to do before it's time  to pay a little more attention and thank you   for the shout out about their bodies they are  telling us about gamers thumb they are telling   us about texnic they are telling us about their  eye is hurting and being blurry they are talking   about selfie wrist they have lots of things that  are going on we have digital yoga that they do we   have exercises for the eye is the 20-20-20 rule  which means you look at a device for 20 minutes   take a break for 20 seconds and look at something  20 feet away so we are starting to think about   how to take care of our bodies Greeks great then  I'll kind of chip in on the screen time question   I think it's a crucial one that we're figuring out  and in the minute I'll just whizz through that the   first thing is that I think it's it's a we need  to again take the historical perspective you know   when we're talking about radio and television time  still made sense because it was a pretty uniform   content it was all the same for each person  but now that we're in the web 2.0 you know it's   interactive it changes you can actually make your  own stuff it's always different so I think that's   where the challenge for this medicalize approach  that just said the stairs response relationship   based on time I think that's why it's broken down  the last ten or so years but I still think that   screen time has a place but it's gonna it has to  have a place with other things around it and we   need to work and this is work that in my and issue  scale also they are doing a lot with the UK policy   pressing forward kind of data release that we need  to have a better idea of the technological world   and I think that will be a lot about collaboration  between tech companies and researchers that is   not completely disproportional in terms of power  relationships um but yeah I think that screaming   time we need to study screen time as if it were a  concept you know figure out what drives people to   say they have a lot of screen time you know are  their well-being impacts and their gender age   you know how does and once we made me figure out  what drives that as a measurement it is still a   valuable measure and it's still a valuable measure  because we have such great longitudinal data on   it so I wouldn't throw it out of the window but  we need to put it in context thank you Amy okay   and one last lightning round of questions if I may  and because we are a policy center at an academic   institution would love 30 seconds from each of  you on if you had the answer to one question   what would it what research question do you think  is most pressing that we need an answer to or and   Jeff kind of going back to your slide earlier  about how we dealt with automobiles and there   were tech and education and regulatory responses  if there was one policy you could recommend either   for governments to impose or for platforms to  adopt voluntarily any thoughts on that so we'd   love to to maybe give you each you know 30  seconds to respond to that and then to make   your job even more complicated and if there are  any written resources or links that you would   want to share with the audience to go ahead and  throw those up in the chat now while you are you   know patting your head and rubbing your stomach of  answering these questions and putting in links at   the same time and if that's not possible send me  the links and I will get them up on the site well   I'll go really fast because I'd like to promote  an op-ed that just came out by my colleague   Janine Zechariah that talked about the new bill  by representative issue that wants to limit micro   targeting of political ads I think this is a  very concrete step around regulation that we   can take now I think that a lot of regulations  tend to that we academics talking about tend   to be really general but this is very concrete  it's going to prevent political campaigns from   basically hiding in plain sight by doing racist  or sexist or in civil kind of advertisements   and so they'll have to advertise it at a certain  scale so that way it's not like somebody they've   identified as a racist we'll get the races to  add and nobody else will see it so I'll send   you to like imagine I mean a great point and this  isn't space I worked in for almost 10 years and   will say defining a political ad is just about the  hottest mess I've ever run into but I think it's   an important measure and he's been interesting  that I think Twitter and then second Facebook   had decided to decline to accept political ads  and so it's been a very interesting debate and   who can I ask to go next okay I can go next I  would really like it there to be a policy mandate   the kids need to have early digital learning in  their classrooms I think that's really important   how to navigate technology and use it safely  and ethically sort of like I know we now have   health and/or sex ed mandated in the California  classrooms I'd love to see digital health be part   of the everyday classroom discussions and ated  Amy last week they're not yeah I'll finish off   I think I'll take the meta perspective here as an  academic institution in policy we need to think   about how academia interacts with policy and I  think something I've been thinking about a lot is   how science is just really slow and it supposed to  be slow we're supposed to criticize were supposed   to scrutinize however technological change is  accelerating it's really fast and we know that   technology is entrenched very quickly they become  part of society they change how we act they change   how we earn our money they change how we live our  lives and so they then become really difficult to   regulate I think we see that with social media a  lot of the regulation I feel like it's catching   up you know there's things off the surface and so  the question is how do we do policy evidence-based   policy in this time and I think that I've been  talking a lot with post makers in the UK and we   feel like maybe it needs to move from evidence  base to evidence focus and we need to take more   risks in policy and then invest a lot of time  and money into evaluating that policy decision   once it's made then we've seen that now with Co  vid you know you can't put scientists in a room   and make them come to a decision even if they  don't have all the answers and all the consensus   and I think that that's that we don't have that  link yet sorted in a time when you know there is   a huge strain on that um and again this is in  the paper and I might dig advertising at every   point in this talk but yeah I've talked a lot  more about it in there oh good thank you well   I mean to support your further advertising Amy  if you can oh it did go to attendees great and   well thank you all so much this has been a huge  help to have you all take the time to do this   it's been totally fascinating and one of the  more as I said practical webinars that we've   hosted especially for me who is going to have a  teenager sooner than I would like and so wanted   to now turn and if I can ask Micah like David  to show where we're headed next our next webinar   will be on July 15 I am thrilled to say that  it is going to be guest posted by my colleague   Marie tashaki who is a top tech legislator in  European Parliament it is my birthday so she is   taking over to save me from having to moderate in  the morning and we will have a conversation about   cyber peace with I believe Camille Francois and  leaders from the from grafica and leaders from   the cyber peace Institute so we'll be looking  forward to that but most importantly thank   you Amy and Erica and Jeff for taking the time  today I really really appreciate it stay well
