 do [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to this virtual session we're glad you can join us today before we get started there's a few housekeeping items we'd like to go over with you now firstly you can resize the webinar windows to cater to your viewing preferences you can maximize minimize and drag the windows to your preferred viewing size if you look at the bottom middle of your screen you can click on the widgets that you'll need to get the most out of this virtual experience secondly microsoft specialists are on hand to answer your questions in real time so feel free to type in your questions using the q and a window and we'll answer them as soon as we can lastly we've provided some additional resources for you to supplement your learning you can access them by clicking on the links in this section without further ado i'll hand over to our speakers hi everyone welcome to day one of this two day azure fundamentals course today we'll be focusing on the course overview we'll cover module one around cloud concepts and we'll finish out our day with module two where we'll discuss the core azure services joining me today is matt hester matt take it away so welcome to this course az 900 azure fundamentals we have four fantastic modules we're going to cover in this course we're going to talk about cloud concepts more on that in just a moment because we're going to get right into that course as quick as we can we're also going to talk about azure core services i like to think this is an inch deep but a mile wide you're going to look about all the fantastic solutions from virtual machines to internet of things to machine learning and kind of everything in between then we have module 3 we're going to focus on security and privacy compliancy and trust oh it sounds like a big topic and it is matter of fact we have a separate course az500 and that's all it talks about is that module so we're going to be the tip of the iceberg on the security stuff and then module 4 we're going to talk about pricing and support that align with our environments how do you buy azure how do you get support if you get into a problem that's our course and what's designed to help us learn more and so cool thing about this some of you are going to take the exam and when you look at the exam guess what we have four study areas for the exam that align to those same four modules now you'll notice on the right hand column they have the weights what's that mean well our exams kind of come out of a random pool of about a few hundred questions you're going to get anywhere between 40 to 50 of those questions based on those different weighted areas for you to study and work with when you look at the right end column that's more than 100 but that's okay because everybody's exam is going to be different you're going to get different questions the nice thing about this is that when you look at this exam you pass it once and you're done and you don't have to worry about taking it again because it's the fundamental level now the other exams you may take on your certification journey you might have to take the exam after a couple of years because azure changes so much now if you're looking to study if you're looking to learn more about azure fundamentals look at http colon whack whack aka dot ms slash azfun path this is an online version of the same course we're going through they have some hands-on exercises it gives you some additional materials to read and study and prepare for the exam in fact when i took the exam that's the same area that i went on to learn more about the the areas that i was a little weak on so every exam has a challenge and every exam you want to be prepared for as you go into it hey matt what is actually a passing score for the exam so the passing score great question we get this all the time it's 700 so if you get a 700 or higher you've passed now folks let me be honest with you you're going to have friends and some of you made those friends and you might be that friend that say well i got an 800 and you only got a 700. don't let anybody do that to you when they say that to you and so if garrett were to tell me says matt i got an 800 you only got a 750. i'd be like well garrett that's i'm glad you got the easy exam because i got the harder to the exam so the score is there now with that said if somebody comes up to you and say they got a thousand that is worth a crisp high five maybe a hug that means they got a perfect exam they didn't miss a single question and i don't care what exam that you take a thousand is a thousand that's impressive no matter what anybody will tell you so understand passing 700 if you get a 700 you pass and it's no different than somebody gets a 900 they pass two it's just like a hit and baseball a hit as a hit as a hit a passes that passes a pass so when you look at this exam folks you really just want to get over that hump to pass it the exams are tough you have to study and work with it and that's why we have this course for you that's why we have the online version of this course for you because we want you to be successful with that our promises over this course is really we're going to have some fun heck it's in the title i think it's even garrett's title as a matter of fact we're going to have fun it's azure fundamentals learn at least one thing certifications are important yes especially if you want industry-wide recognition but really my goal is to get you skilled up in azure i want you to use azure in your company i wanted to use possibly in your life we have free services and we'll talk about that in module four that you can leverage that if you're part of the community and maybe just need a little bit of compute power to support a non-profit or an organization guess what azure may have something free for you to solve that problem and lastly we're going to make ourselves available to you throughout this course we're going to have some questions and answers as we go through you're going to let us know engage and enjoy this course is for you now who am i my name is matt hester i've been with microsoft for 19 years there's my email address if you need to ask me questions about the course of what we're going to go through and study but i live in frisco texas and if you don't know where that is it's a northern suburb of dallas i live three miles away from the dallas cowboys practice facility the nfl football team in america but the cool thing about this i am not a cowboys fan i am a cleveland browns fan an ohio state buckeye fan so if you are a buckeye fan o-h io there you go so gary you at least know the proper response um inside of it but i also have lots of certifications i've been taking certifications pretty much my entire career before and after microsoft the cool thing about this i'm in my dream job but the reasons i get up in the morning are my family my reasons why i do this job and i love this job so much is i get to support my family i have a wonderful daughter nicole she's a flute player at steven f austin in nacogdoches texas the cool thing about nicole she's a math major she wants to be a math teacher my son mitchell he currently stands at six seven and he's a volleyball player and a trombone player he's kind of a natural instrument really long instrument the really tall person works perfectly and then caitlyn my heart and soul and everybody will tell you that caitlyn is uh got me wrapped around a little finger that is a true statement she's a french horn player and i love her to death but she loves bacon trust me this is important for something we'll talk about later and then i have two fur babies pepper and sugar we're doing the annual spring thing in texas where we're taking pictures in the state flower of texas which is the texas blue bonnets and so you have an idea of what we do in texas every spring you can see all the forced fun smiles that we have but the cool thing about it i have garrett with me throughout this course so garrett why don't you talk a little about who you are sure yeah thanks matt so i'm garrett bundy as matt mentioned and i am a director on our fundamentals team i look after a team of trainers that are based anywhere from uh in the united states all the way through the rest of the world and china japan all over the place i'm based in los angeles california i also have been taking a lot of certification exams throughout my career been at microsoft for 14 years so not quite 19 years like matt but i've been here for 14 years most of the same certifications that matt has and i enjoy the technical part of this and as far as my reasons why you know very similar to matt it's my family so my wife my older children my oldest son james who's in college in a second year skyla who started college this year she goes to uc santa cruz so go banana slugs and then my other daughter kaley who's in high school my son caden who is in first grade and my daughter devin who's a kindergartner and really my family is why i get up in the morning and why i do everything i do so very similar to matt but that's why i do what i do awesome and i love i love your new your title fundamentals it's perfect it fits what we're going to cover today and let's go ahead and get started with azure module one azure fundamentals cloud concepts and in this module we're going to talk the basics of cloud computing from private computing to public computing to hybrid cloud computing that we have the cool thing about this whether it was azure amazon or google these terms are industry standard we're also going to focus on kind of the key terms of infrastructure as service is platform as a service or paths or software as a service sas these are once again terms that we use broadly across the industry so the great thing i love about this module it sets the stage now if you're listening to this and watching this and going wait a second i got all that stuff the one thing i want to stress to you especially when you take the exam is you have to think like a microsoft person so yes we use industry standard terminology that's for all of these services but when you take the exams you kind of have to if you work for a company that's been using azure for several years you might have to ratchet yourself back just a little bit to understand what we're asking because we have to ask a question at a general level not specific to your company i love the fact that if you're using azure thank you so much but the exam is going to test that general azure knowledge that general cloud foundational knowledge as we go into it so let's talk about some of the key terminology of why we use cloud services as well as some of the foundational things so why do we use cloud it's all about the compute power when you think about amazon and google and microsoft how big our data centers are well how can you leverage that power well the most common way is using compute and compute doesn't always mean virtual machines understand everything you do in a cloud service is run by some piece of hardware and computer underneath the underneath the covers the cool thing about this we have a you know huge amount of resources for use to leverage so we can do things that you may not have been able to do like analytics being able to just do truckloads of data petabytes and terabytes of of data and we want to find out that seasonality we now are on a network and fun fact about azure last time i checked we have enough fiber to go to the earth and the moon three times you're on a private network and microsoft has gotten really good at this a lot of people think we're new to the cloud business we've been in the cloud business since 1995 our first cloud service was windows update so we've been doing this for a long time we've gotten really good with our networking we also have storage now when you think about storage in our environment we'll talk more about this in module two the cool thing about storage is that we have really just a wide vast array of storage for you to leverage for files databases anything else that you want to store inside the environment so why do we use cloud computing it provides this ability to leverage resources that we otherwise couldn't do on-prem and hopefully at a point that's less expensive than what we do on-prem we're going to talk more about that in this module and in module 4 because it's not necessarily just about how much a machine costs but the whole total cost of ownership so when we talk about why we use cloud computing to do things that we couldn't do normally but also do them at a at a price that's less than what we could do on-prem and so when we start working with azure and we start working with our cloud terminology we have some very key concepts and availability uh that we have to understand that how we think about azure and the first one is high availability what is high availability really it's the ability to make sure that our services are up and running as much as we can now when we think about high availability it's making sure that it's service when somebody comes to my website it's there for me when somebody comes to my web my database it's there for me it's available now when i think about availability garrett what do you think do you think that's a microsoft responsibility is that our customer's responsibility or do you think it's both of our responsibilities i think it's probably a shared responsibility definitely and you used a great term there you use shared responsibility and when we look at availability we're going to provide a platform that has guaranteed service level agreements we'll talk more about those in module four but we also have to give you an ability to design solutions so they are available and we'll talk about in module two two very important concepts and and they're critical by the way exam tip you'll see these two concepts availability zones and availability sets you'll see them on every exam you take from az900 az-103 the architect exams az-300 301 and we'll change those names as we grow them but trust me you're going to see them in the wide variety of those things we also have two terms scalability and elasticity now scalability we've been doing on-prem for years you've been able to scale up what's that mean when you scale up a resource you add more memory you add more cpu maybe a bigger hard drive you're trying to solve a problem on a server think for example or imagine a a query that's running in a database where we just need that query to run a little faster well we can't solve it with another server but we can solve it with more horsepower another cpu maybelline that's called scaling up inside the world now if you were to take the hardware away which we very rarely did on prem that's called scaling down whereas what if your website is announced on a popular tv show and all of a sudden you need 10 more web servers to handle that problem it's called scaling out and we have scalability that we can use and by the way if we remove those servers it's called scaling in generally speaking we've been scalable in our cloud technologies for forever but also we've been doing this on-prem but now we have this term elasticity what's elasticity garrett what do you think i don't know i was actually looking at them those terms seem so similar to me how do you really differentiate and distinguish between scalability and elasticity yeah and a lot of people when they see the term elastic well azure is not scalable nothing is more further from the truth we are scalable but in cloud technologies we use the term called elastic when you think about scalability on-prem if you add more servers or you add hardware server you very rarely will take those things in so you scale up or you scale out but you never do the inverses well in cloud we have a thing called elasticity so we can scale up and we can scale down and we can scale out and we can scale in especially when it comes to scaling out and in we can do this dynamically and automatically so when you think about elasticity how i've put in my brain is its dynamic scalability this is a huge benefit of cloud technologies and a lot of your organizations are looking at this i'm willing to bet everybody that's listening to this and watching this right now you have seasonality in your business at some point in time you need more resources you know here in the u.s if april 15th tax companies they need more power well we know that well we had they had design solutions that were scalable for that one day what happened after that day the cool thing about cloud technologies and it's hard to capture cost for this hey i spike up for the time and i come back down because we're consumption based service why use it for the entire year when i only need it for a week inside of it so we're elastic we have agility means we can do things very fast for anybody's ever done anything in the cloud we're talking minutes in module two we'll create a virtual machine in minutes from something that doesn't exist to something fully running in just minutes think about how long it takes to work with those environments take along how long it takes to put them on prem well guess what makes it very agile in the cloud when we can just start working right away then we have fault tolerance fault tolerance is an interesting concept is what happens when hardware fails everybody is maybe woken up in the morning and you hear that tap tap tap tap tap of the old magnetic drives when a drive head broke inside of it you have fault tolerance well whose hardware are you running on here you're running on your cloud provider's hardware you're running on microsoft's hardware and so when we talk about fault tolerance so garrett i'll ask you the same question again is this microsoft responsibility customer responsibility is it both of our responsibility i think fall tolerance falls more on us as microsoft most definitely falls on us as a from a standpoint we talk about the physical hardware in the framework it is definitely our responsibility to make sure that we provide hardware because at the end of the day let me on a secret guess what azure giant data centers in module 2 we'll talk about how big these data centers are but it's physical hardware so we have to provide fault tolerance for you now when we start thinking about bigger concepts about business continuity and how do i make sure my web server that's running on prem if it if it has a fault how can i fail over a whole different concept of where cloud can help you provide that but in the context of right now on our fundamentals fault tolerance is how we handle those errors on our side we want to have fault-tolerant solutions you don't have to worry about that and this is one of those once again garrett use that term shared responsibility you're on our hardware which means we have to be responsible for you as your cut you're our customers we have to make sure it's up and running some other key terms we have disaster recovery this is another one of those ones when we think about well we can use azure as a disaster recovery platform and you think about just something as simple as backup azure is a great backup target you have your on-prem resources you back them up to cloud technologies now if that on-prem resource goes away it's up in the cloud and everybody thinks hey that's great it's a great backup target the cool thing about azure from a disaster recovery standpoint it's also a recovery environment if i don't have that server on-prem to restore the data to you can create a virtual machine we'll learn more about those in module two but also disaster recovery takes on a whole nother level when you start using shared responsibility in a cloud provider what happens if our data centers go down how do we work with azure to make sure that hey it doesn't impact your application we're going to talk about our concept of geographies and regions and region pairs all in module two to talk about how we do disaster recovery then we have global reach and customer latency capabilities these two are tied at the hip when you think about an environment we have 56 regions around the world where are you going to put your stuff where are you going to put your regions generally speaking you're going to put it in the regions that are close to you wherever you happen to be in the globe wherever that solution is going to be used you're going to put that information close to it in a way that we don't have to travel across the globe now here's the cool thing about azure if you did have to travel across from one region to another you're on our network a really high-speed network and one of our case studies is nbc sports and you can look this up online they actually use the olympics uses azure to help distribute the media files so if you're watching the olympics anywhere online your chances are you're coming out of an azure data center and nbc sports is using that global reach and customer latency to make sure that people can watch whatever olympic event they want to watch either stream it live or watch a recorded event the other one sometimes cause people a lot of trouble with one predictive cost considerations and i hear this all the time i will not use the cloud because i don't know how much it's gonna cost true we're gonna give you an estimate but it's a very predictive estimate of how much it's going to cost you it's a consumption-based service so like here when i you know when i'm at home in texas during the summer we turn on the air conditioner well how much is my electric bill going to be well i know in the summer it's going to be higher and based on the seasonality i have a general idea of how much that's going to be it's still predictive i can still budget for it is it the exact number no it never will be in module 4 we'll talk about how to leverage the calculator so you can be predictive about this and the last one oh boy garrett this one this one this one always calls problem security so when you think about security what are some of the things that you think about when you think about cloud and security well wanting to protect uh protect my environment from malicious actors out there uh you know why i'm putting my data in the cloud now so i need to be more conscientious about how i'm putting that data where i'm putting it and who i'm trusting with my data yeah and i think about it whenever i hear people about security the one thing they worry they lose control right they're no longer in they don't see the hardware anymore they don't see the blinky lights they don't see the servers um they don't have um and i always choke uh with customers when we do these classes live in front of folks we have hey look do you have a friendly receptionist or an unfriendly receptionist now folks you want to air error on a courteous but unfriendly receptionist why because if i were to go to any of your companies say hey my name is matt i work for microsoft can you show me where the lunchroom is will they walk me back and maybe buy me a cup of coffee along the way that good i love it by the way but that could be a person here how they know who i'm at so we have to look at security once again this is another one of those shared responsibilities i often say when you move things from on-prem to the cloud it's going to be as secure as it was on prem when you move it to the cloud however the cloud has some built-in capabilities we'll talk about these in module 3 and one of them let's say you have a website one attack that your hackers may come after you is called a distributed denial of service or a ddos attack and what that is is really an attacker of your organization doesn't really not really trying to compromise what they're trying to flood as your website with so much traffic legitimate traffic can't come in well when you put things inside inside of azure automatically you have ddos protection it's turned on for every customer and it's free the basic skew there's another sku that we'll talk about in module 3 that cost a little bit of money but when i think about security it's a really big term in module 3 we're going to talk talk about some of those key security concepts and really security in the cloud is understanding how we talk to the cloud and make it more secure how can we do things that we didn't do on-prem but now we have a chance to fix when we move things in the clouds when we talk about security it's really that shared responsibility you have to think about it from your side and we have to provide you an environment from our side that governs that and we'll talk all about that in module three at least give you kind of the tip of the iceberg when we think about some other key terms we have economies of scale what does that mean it means basically we have so much hardware we can offer this to you at a cost that's less than what you have and we pass those benefits on the more efficient we get in our cloud guess what the less expensive those resources are going to be for you in module 4 i'm going to show you this we have cost for virtual machines and if i run them in west it has a certain price point if i run it in west 2 which is one of our newer data centers the price drops that's the cool thing about cloud when you think about what's happening in the cloud technology and this is different than what we've ever done before in technology you know think about when you bought a version of software you know version one we had a price point version two was a little more expensive version three was more expensive version four is expensive but what's happening in the cloud you have some very strong companies in the cloud and guess what competition is driving a price point that is going down now of course garrett and i are biased because we are microsoft so we're all about azure we'll talk about that journey in just a moment but we get economies of scale because we have these large data centers and we can pass those costs along to you we also have another benefit of cloud and this is capital expenditure versus operational expenditure capex or opex capital expenditure is what we've done for years on-prem you had a large up-front cost you had to build a data center now think about this you might think oh yeah i had to go buy the racks of computers i had to buy the cabling i had to do all that you had to have a building you had to have some place to actually put all that stuff in then run power to it then run your internet access to it what i'm starting to get to think of is all the upfront costs that go into this and all the total cost of ownership we had high up front costs and they devalued over time one of the accounting principles when you acquire an asset the minute you acquire it it starts to go on the books and devalues this is different because that capital expenses are all about on-prem cloud is operational expenditure you get a monthly bill there's no upfront cost now you might have cost to train and use your people but there's no upfront cost to use the technology it's pay as you go as you work with this you basically deduct the expense from your tax bill in the same year you get billed immediately and when i say immediately you start using azure on let's say the beginning of a month you're going to get the bill at the beginning of next month for the previous month so you do get billed immediately but the bill shows up the next day or the next month or the next period of time the cool thing about this is that's how all cloud services are operational expenditure and we look at the different models especially when you compare i as in paths versus sas how that operational expenditure model changes and we'll talk about that in just a few minutes when we think about consumption based model this operational expenditure no upfront costs you don't have to purchase or manage anything uh infrastructure and this is when we looked at it pros and i know garrett you talked to it pros as well when cloud first start they the the sky was falling right because they thought they were going to lose their jobs right did you have those conversations as well yeah i had those conversations on a very regular basis everybody thought i don't want to get into the cloud this is not where we're going because they felt like they had to protect their domain on premises yeah and and what they didn't understand is unless they like the rack and stack hardware and run cable which if you've ever talked to anybody who's ever done a data center in the history of ever nobody likes to rack and stack hardware nobody likes to run cable and and something by the way just kind of picking up people that are born in the cloud there's a lot of companies that don't have the joy of doing that stuff i think by the way matt's personal opinion here um before any company can use the cloud they have to go make an rj45 cable and crimp it properly before they have to do this something that with the pain of this but when we talk to id pros about this guess what oh wait i don't i i don't have to make an rj45 cable no you don't you don't have to worry about the hardware that's our responsibility but what about the server up there do i have to back it up yep do i have to maintain it yep do i have to configure it yep and the list goes on you still have to architect these things even though we have the physical infrastructure done for you you still have to architect virtual networks you still have to architect the storage you still have to worry about making sure the security is there so when you think about this consumption based model it takes away a lot of things we used to do but there's still plenty of work inside the world that we have today the more you use the more you pay for and when you're done using it and think about scale up for or scale out for a moment we just got mentioned on we you know our website just got mentioned in a popular podcast or tv show and all of a sudden we need 500 more servers to govern the traffic well i just spin them up 500 servers solve my problem the minute i don't need it anymore i simply start taking them away and i no longer have to pay for them it's a huge benefit that elasticity is huge around consumption based model it's hard to put in a price point but think about how you would have done that on-prem you just spun up all the servers now you're kind of stuck with all those servers so when you have a consumption-based model we help you lower the cost for those same solutions in some cases do things you couldn't do before let's talk about the types of cloud models we have and we have three and most of you have heard these terms we have public cloud private cloud and hybrid cloud let's start with public cloud what is it you're going to microsoft you're going to amazon you're going to google you're going to somebody that provides the cloud services you don't own them you basically use those resources you leverage those resources for whatever you want to do all the cloud resources you go into are going to be accessed over some kind of secure connection and we'll talk about these in module two as specific to azure in azure we have a couple of ways that you can come in and work with it we have ways you go over the public internet you can even get via technology called expressroute a private dedicated link into azure we'll talk about that in module two but you're going somewhere you're in that shared responsibility model almost every organization that's born in the cloud that's all they know all they know is public cloud but a lot of your organizations that as we go through and look at our customers today you started off with private cloud what's private cloud think on-prem it's your data center which means you had full control full security it was yours you also had the full responsibility for managing that private cloud in other words you had to worry about everything you had to worry about the rack and stack the cabling the physical infrastructure if something failed you had to replace it if somebody supported it you had to solve the problem you had to have all those resources and that's okay guess what everybody started with private cloud every most of our organization started with private cloud now when you think about this how do i connect the two it's called hybrid cloud and all hybrid cloud is is connecting the public cloud with your private cloud to allow applications to run in whatever is the best location whatever the most appropriate we still have customers that are in this model why compliancy they might have to run a certain part of that application on-prem for something internal or governmental compliancy or maybe a compliance that we don't meet in the cloud and that's okay but what can we move into the cloud let me let you in all a secret for those of you think hey we've never used azure we're looking to jump into that if you're currently using office 365 today you log on with an id via azure active directory and most likely the it department of your organization took your on-prem active directory environment and connected it to azure active directory in other words if you're an office 365 my friends guess what you might already be in hybrid cloud for your identity the key thing there is one you're already there two i mentioned a very specific workload and so when people think about hybrid cloud they think oh i have to do everything no no pick the workloads that make the most sense and run them in the appropriate location well i have to run this on prem but i can do this other part up in the cloud find what works out for you and get hybrid cloud hybrid cloud gives you the most flexible model that we have the most flexible design because now it's kind of do what you want to do microsoft came up with a marketing term several years ago and i loved it cloud on your own terms now make no doubt about it we are a cloud-first company we believe in azure we believe in office 35 believe in all our cloud services that are out there but we want our customers to choose what's important to them so cloud on your terms at a microsoft even at a microsoft employee level means a lot because one of the few cloud providers allows you to pick and choose and if something doesn't run right in the cloud you can bring it back down to on-prem to work with it inside of air when we look at those different cloud module comparisons just a quick refresh public cloud it's no capital expenditure it's operational expenditure we have applications we have the agility of the cloud organizations pay only what you use consumption based private cloud you have full control over your security over your resources everything but you also have full responsibility over that hybrid cloud gives you the best of both worlds you get flexibility you determine what makes the most sense to run your applications and that's hybrid cloud now let's talk about the types of cloud services that run in those different models and really now we're going to focus in on the key terms is paz and sas and really it's a level responsibility so when you look at infrastructure as a service if you look at words governing on this slide the physical data center that's us the physical networking file wall security that's us the physical servers and storage that run your environment that's us now what are you responsible for operating systems the applications that run on top of them or the configuration and development of those applications that's infrastructure to service now if you look at platform as a service guess what you don't have to worry about you don't have to worry about the operating system there's definitely a compute resource behind those path services but you don't have to worry about it then you have sas services where generally speaking you just have to configure that client to work with it so if you use any streaming media today if you sub uh you know subscribe to any of those cert you know watch movies on planes or download that stuff guess what most likely using software as a service the great thing about software as a service it's a very predictive cost model generally speaking it's a ten dollars per user per month kind of thing depending on what service you're using inside of there now i like this slide because it kind of lays out the story but really most of you've probably seen a slide like this of how we describe the shared responsibility model so garrett brought that up it's a huge term right if you're on-prem what are you responsible for everything that's in green well that that's everything on the list that we have for us to use infrastructure service what are you responsible for for that virtual machine that operating system so do i have to patch it yep do i have to back it up all those things is what we're responsible for if you look at paths all you have to worry about is developing your application developers still develop and they still have to have right access to it versus software as a service guess what they just have to worry about data and access now generally speaking at a real high level when you move from infrastructure service to platform as a service from is to pass you're going to save money in your cost consumption model why you're consuming less resources you're just leveraging the application you don't have to worry about the operating system or the virtual machine you don't have to worry about maintaining that from a cost perspective we see a lot of customers now that are in that kind of crux do i do i do i just take my vm from on-prem and do what is called a lift and shift and move it into a vm in is if you do that today i'm willing to bet tomorrow you're going to say you know what i don't want to run that vm anymore i don't want to pay for that virtual machine anymore i want to just re-architect or refactor or redesign my application into a platform as a service so i can get out of that business i don't have to worry about that anymore and you're going to save mo money with most azure services by doing that a lot of our customers today are looking at hey i want to migrate to azure moving that vm lift and shift is generally not their first option it's the option of last resort in other words you know what i can't get the application to work the way i need to just yet i'll move the vm up because i need to leverage cloud resources for it and whatever else i want to do and they're going to leverage infrastructure but we see them on a journey and now it gets interesting we start talking about platforms as a service this means you organization has the skill and the developers to be able to write and work with those applications but ah guess what we have software as a service inside of azure as well via what is called the marketplace so the question becomes is do i build my solution or do i buy the solution something in sas to leverage inside the cloud services we have so when we look at this folks it's really designed to solve the problem how you want to solve it what's going to be the best and what is it going to cost you to do all that now a couple things i love about this slide first off from a microsoft perspective all those services can talk to each other from on-prem to is paz and sas these services can all leverage each other more to the point microsoft is the only cloud company today that does all four of these we our dna was built on windows servers we leverage i as paths and sas so when we think about this we're the only company that understands all four modules or all four modes of this the cool thing also about our company everybody goes well you know when we look at one of our biggest competitors amazon they jumped out to a huge market lead and in recent years we've caught up and it's going to be a seesaw battle for the next probably as long as our lifetime is that's going to be there but where did microsoft start we started this platform as a service why we're a software development company why do you think we developed the azure path services for our developers in the company to get more efficient more agile get global reach customer latency get elasticity all built into services it's in our dna as a development company where we see the organizations going in the world today and this is gartner and forrester and any research organization people are leaning towards paths and they're leaning and leveraging either azure or amazon to do that but that's when you look at those general modules it's in our dna folks our past story is incredibly strong because and not to belittle any of our competitors at all but it's incredibly strong because it's in the dna of our company we were born to be developers everybody's like what's microsoft do we're a software development company and so we have a great platform and we understand because we built things for on-prem before we built azure even though we had cloud 95 with the windows update we have the ability to work with this and so when i look at comparison just as a summary of all this is infrastructure service it's a cloud it's a flexible cloud service because really it is hey i want to move that machine from on-prem into my cloud environment and all you have to do is configure the hardware from a from an itpro standpoint this is where a lot of people start with cloud hey that application is familiar i know that operating system whether it's linux or windows oh yeah i did say linux we'll talk about that in module two we also have platforms as a service where we just focus on developers developers like to develop now the cool thing about this when we think about path services i'm starting to get these questions again garrett they're starting to go wait a second paz is going to take my job what's going to happen when those folks come in to pass well guess what you still have to have governance you still have to have security you still have to architect networking you still have to architect storage you may not have to worry about those virtual machines anymore and guess when it pros learned that they're like wait i don't have to worry about updating no more patch tuesday and a pass service no who does the patches in our servers if you're running on pass we do that's our responsibility to make sure those servers are safe and secure when you're running those workloads inside of it and then of course we have sas which is page ago so when you look at all those models it you got to keep them straight for the exam folks you have to keep these straight they're going to ask you on the exams hey what's the difference between this or gave you some scenario what would you use is pads or sass you know that's a really great question matt we actually have a lot of activity happening behind the scenes in the chat happening here people that are attending and there's a great question and i'm curious to know this too how do you personally keep i as paz and sas straight in your mind i mean these are all potentially new terms for us so how would you look at those three and just separate them and keep them in your mind as how you look at them so i would love to take credit for what i'm about ready to show you and it's been on the internet for a long time but let me ask you a question garrett do you like make at home pizza is that a fun family night you got five kids and i mean i know you want to do pizza everybody likes pizza so do you do you have that fun family night of make your own pizza yeah i know we absolutely do okay so how i think about this how i keep it straight i like to think of it as pizza as a service all right now when we look at this when we think about on-prem that's your that's your fun family night that's making pizza at home and work with it now people listening to this are going wait a second matt this breaks your cost model this now we do make it on pizza night what's the what's the major value add the value prop when you when you do make it on pizza night well you get to pick and choose how you want your pizza to be pick and choosing it's quote unquote less expensive right all right now what i'll tell you especially with five kids it's a concern for you but garrett now the next time your beautiful bride comes along and says that when you pick it up uh make it on pizza night i gotta i got a solution for you all right so when we think about this yes the ingredients will cost less your pizza your dough your wood tomato sauce whatever toppings that you have will cost less they're not going to be the same quality as restaurant quarter even you know if you if you have make taking baked pizzas or even delivery they're not going to be the same quality but also what goes in to make it own pizza night you have to turn on an oven you have to have an oven first off i have to turn it on and now there's like these new ovens that are out there that are just designed to make pizza i have to go get them because they can make a pizza in a minute i'm like i'm in when it's there but also who cleans up what's the rules at your house or who cleans up when whenever you have dinner well whoever cooks doesn't do the cleaning so typically my wife will cook and i end up cleaning everything afterwards and do you like to clean not my favorite thing to do not your favorite thing to do or the kids have to get involved with that have you ever had remember kaitlyn she loves bacon have you ever had the weight they took the last piece of bacon argument in your house yeah that typically happens frequently with all of them emotional cost right yes and then when you take away electronics that cost keeps going over the next week right the point is when you look at the total cost of ownership with make it on pizza that's why we talk about this will it save you money no if you look at the whole cost of it saves you money on the ingredients yeah i'll give you that but you have to look at the whole cost of an inside environment and with caitlin when she when you get the last piece of bacon if she hasn't gotten it there's a lot of arguments that happen pizzas get spilled dumped and uh like i said we're all scared of it but when you look about this how to keep it straight you know infrastructure service is that's taken bake you go to your local grocery store or and in texas we have a thing called papa murphy's well hey i want this pizza i still got to take it home and cook it i still have to maintain it or i have it delivered i pick up phone call somebody and they deliver a pizza to my house or i go out to eat and i can leverage all that now dining out has some costs associated with it but which is more expensive so the next time your beautiful bride comes to you and say hey i want to go out to eat or i want to make pizza night and say no matt said it's cheaper for us to go out to eat for pizza and you can put all five kids in your van and the way you go off to uh eat dinner so that's how i keep it straight it's a fun way to think about this i don't think although i don't know 100 certain because i don't have previous exam questions you'll be quizzed on pieces of service but my friends it's a way you can keep it straight in your head it's a way you can keep these different terms if you've never heard them before you're going to be tested on them so how do we work through them so that's pizza as a service with that that brings us to the end of module one where we talked about the different types of computing models we talked about private versus public versus hybrid we talked about some of those key terms elasticity versus scalability where remember elasticity is dynamic scalability we have in the cloud we also talked about how to keep straight infrastructure service software as a service platform or service is pas and sas especially when we compare to on-prem in module two we are going to cover some more technologies around all these services and we're going to focus squarely on azure on how azure is physically designed as well as some of the services that will run on top of it let's get into module two azure core services and when we look at this module we're going to talk about not only the core physical components of how we build our data centers in our regions we're then going to take a look at a lot of the products and solutions and even all the management tools we have available to work with azure as a good friend of mine on our team says we're going to go an inch deep and a mile wide and guess what on your exam folks you're going to have to go an inch deep and a mile wide you'll have to know the concepts of these different technologies you really won't have to know how to do a lot of the stuff but you'll have to know what they are and what they look like so when i look at the online learning course anything that says core services is a great area to focus because you will be tested heavily in this particular module so when we think about this let's look at the core azure architectural components and how do we design our data centers it first starts off with big buckets we call geographies and they really help us contain our different data center areas which we call regions and the good thing about this we set up our geographies from a data residency a compliance and we try to make sure that all the applications and everything that run in those geographies are all closely related by their regions inside of azure we have americas europe asia pacific middle east and africa where we store all of our regions inside of it so we have this big geography and this is something we design at microsoft you as our customers don't worry about this but just understand that everything goes into geography and inside the geographies we have our regions our regions represent a collection of data centers and we have regions all around the world we have a lot in the u.s we have a lot in europe we have them in asia pacific but when we think about our regions their collection of data centers important to note here especially when we talk about some concepts coming up around availability zones and sets understand a region is a collection of data centers on the average talking with some of the folks in the product group an average region will have 16 data centers now folks i want to make sure i'm very clear with this sometimes a data center will look like hey this is all the same place when you see the picture of a northern europe region which we actually think it's most of the northern region it's going to look like one building but in reality they are separate facilities and we'll talk about that in a moment but the main point is they have separate heating power cooling networking they're a separate facility although they may look like they're under the same roof in reality they're separate facilities why do we have regions gives us flexibility and scale gives us data residency uh inside of our environments they allow us to work with our deployments they're they're really global services and the good thing about regions you can find resources that are all around the world for you to do your job be careful although this is not um you know not big differences but not all regions are equal some of the regions have different resources especially our newer regions well from a virtual machine perspective we'll have some of the newer hardware for those virtual machines where some of the older regions may not have some of that new hardware hey matt so i understand that you know hardware choices that's one of the things that could pick this region versus that region but as i'm thinking about architecting a solution let's say i'm brand new to azure and i'm watching this what are some of the other reasons why i might select one region over the other yeah and so the first one is definitely making sure you pick a region that has all those necessary features and functions for whatever solution you're building but the other things might be cost i mean if you think an example we talked about a kind of scale west 2 on a lot of the resources are less expensive so i might pick a region where i'm not really concerned that it's you know too far apart but we're also going to pick regions from a standpoint of what's closest to our users the general rule of thumb with regions you're going to pick the region that is closest to the people that are going to be using that data and so when we look at the regions that are around the world you're not going to be here i don't know in in seattle and pick a region in africa to put your data you're going to pick one of our west coast regions for this or you're going to pick a region that might driven by compliance for example we have canadian regions that are available too and most canadian customers don't want to cross the canadian u.s border for some compliance issues so they're going to use the data center that are up there and local to them and so we're going to look at that we're also going to look at latency and when you look at you know solutions like the olympics they have to be able to distribute content around all the regions the most important thing about this you put the data in the regions that you need to choose we don't choose them for you you choose the regions the geographies have some nice things for us and we work with them we'll talk about a second with region pairs because every region has a buddy and that buddy is designed for our fault tolerance for our disaster recovery something happens to a region we can fail over to another region for it so really cost is going to be a concern and then location location location is going to be one of those other areas that we want to work with and then also making sure we have the right services or some of the common reasons we choose regions and sometimes you know that feature hey i want to choose i want to use that new feature in azure it's not in region 1 but i got to use region 2 to get a hold of it so there's lots of factors it's a very easy decision to make it's just drop down list but now you've got to make sure you you pick the right one and that's not even mentioning we have special regions we'll talk about in module three for the us government and for china data centers so we have some special issues with those of how we adhere to the compliances for the china government and us government as well and we'll talk about those in module three i mentioned this every region has a pair uh inside of here this is a small subset of the region list we have lots of regions around the world but you see some of those common pairs the general rule of thumb is every region pair has to be at least 300 miles apart from each other so we're talking about huge physical separation between this this is done by design you don't pick the region pairs once again just like our geographies at microsoft we design these region pairs it's really designed in case one of our regions goes down we can fail over capacity to the other region pair bear in mind we also look at inside those regions we have a lot of we have capacity something happens inside the region we can fail over with inside the region before we go to the other region we also do updates in a very controlled fashion we do not update both pairs at the same time we update pair you know one region a get that update and then we update region b so we do it in a very controlled fashion so we don't want to do this at the same time the the reason we have this is in case something happens inside the region now i actually asked a product interest what if both regions and the region pair go down technically possible um and the answer i thought was pretty pretty interesting at first it might sound flippant but he says matt if both regions go down that means dinosaurs are roaming the earth and understand what i just asked them two separate physical facilities separated by at least 300 miles that have over 600 000 computers in each of them go down at the same time is it possible yes is it likely most likely not but if it does happen that means there's bigger fish to fry that something else is happening in the world that's causing that huge outing and that's that would be a massive outage do we have regions go down in my career i've only seen a couple times where regions went down for periods of time and and just be very clear this is not acceptable this is why we have service level agreements we'll talk about those in module four and why we make sure we help guarantee those if those things do happen our customers get full credits when i've seen regions go down i've seen customers get a full monthly credit on their bill for those outages and the worst outage i've seen as of recent was a 19 hour outage we had which was a really bad outage now here's a cool thing about this not to say that you know regions can be brought down for longer periods of time but when you think about how we design the data centers and it comes back to that dinosaurs roaming the earth folks not saying the region couldn't have gone down for a longer period but my rose cluttered glasses come on for a moment a region was down for 19 hours but the true story was and the true kind of information that's important the region was back up in 19 hours and that region in question got hit by multiple lightning strikes is what brought that region down and it was back up in 19 hours fully functional so when you think about our data centers you think about these global companies especially microsoft that does this we've been in this business for a long time and we know how to design them to be very resilient so let's take a look at a region it's my favorite region it's where i'm hoping i'm getting garrett will send me one of these days i get to go to the dublin ireland um this is although there's a lot of debate on this one this is most of if not all of the northern europe region capacity that we have look how big the facility is if you just look at the cars that are around it you get a general idea of these facilities on the average most these facilities are 400 000 square feet in size they have multiple power centers they have multiple heating and cooling they even have a lot of physical security it might be kind of hard to see but if you're looking at the picture you might see the roundabout has a big cement barrier you can't drive straight in the facilities there's a lot of physical security here and by the way if you're not on the list you don't get in the facility i mean even if satya were to walk up in the data center if he's not officially on the list the data center text will not let him in now i'm pretty sure satya probably gets put on the list but he'll have to be on that list not saying he can't get on a list but it'll have to be on the list before they let them in because there's so many compliancies our data centers are here too there's a lot of internal security so if you ever get a chance if you're microsoft rep ever i invite you to go to a data center tour go because you'll learn about the physical side of azure where all your stuff is and our cloud service is running these regions now if you look at this you said well matt a region's made up of multiple data centers it is you actually see at the minimum at least three in this picture you have on the very top of this environment you have that big long strip of white uh at the top you have the building in the middle and you kind of have the building that's kind of out back if i had to guess and i don't know for certain but those are three different facilities i even could take this a step further and this is kind of a debated question with me and some of my teammates if you look at the top facility you see different towers now i don't know what those are my guess is and because i can't zoom in enough those might be separate electric power and cooling but the point i want to make is even though this looks like one facility in reality there are multiple data centers in this one geographic footprint and that's how i think about it so we're looking at a region and we have these multiple data centers that have separate cooling networking and power there's even separate physical firewalls that will separate and kind of a fun story i got to tour the south central data center which is in texas and the the person giving us the tour had a stop midway through the tour and had us look up and we all look up and there's a giant block of cement above our heads he's like what is that and we're like i don't know what is it well that's the firewall that if something happens on this side of the facility we can drop that wall it'll physically separate the two data centers we design these for data resiliency in case something happens as i was slowly stepping to the side to get underneath said block of cement because on my brain i'm going i hope they carried the one inside of there so when we look at these facilities you get an idea and i want to make azure real for you and you can look at it we have lots of videos online on our site we can kind of see the physical design of this for me i'm curious about this is it something you'll ever go in and tour if you get a chance go but folks you have to understand what your stuff is going to be inside the facility so we start with geographies we have our regions our regions have multiple data centers and every region has a pair and that pair by the way only exists in the geography they're in so we're not going to have a region in the u.s pair with a region in europe those are separate geographies they have to be inside that same geography of those region pairs to work with it so northern europe pairs i believe to either central europe or southern europe i can't remember the pair off the top my head but we designed them for resiliency and there's tons of stuff that's inside of here i could go on i could go on for days about the tours and my experience down in south central my favorite though out of all the stuff i'll tell you besides the firewall in texas during the summer people turn on the air condition there's a lot of power demands on our local power company in texas the local power company can actually call the data center and say we need power we need to take you off the grid and the south central data center region can completely disconnect from the local power company and run self-sufficient on just the battery backups that are inside the facility so my friends these things are designed to withstand a lot and they're great environments and and south central is one of our older data center designs we're getting even better at this as the generations expand so with that why do i spend time on this we have two critical components that we're going to work with in availability zones and availability sets now before i dig into zones and sets let's talk about what they're trying to do first off zones and sets are for at least two virtual machines or more so i am squarely talking about is here i'm squarely talking about infrastructure service zones and sets are only for virtual machines you've got to have at least two or more zones and sets are also mutually exclusive you'll either pick a zone or a set to do what they're going to do all right so you got to pick them but what do they do well inside of our data centers we have updates we have to update our data center facilities just like everybody else we also are running on physical hardware which means we might have faults from occasional time a hard drive might fail or a rack might go down or a network switch might go down this is a physical computing environment so we might have these faults so what we have to do is work with our virtual machines and when you think about the possibility of something happening from an update or a fault how do you make sure your virtual servers are still available so if we have three web servers that run our front end i don't want an update to bring down all three it might bring down one so i'll lose some capacity but i'll still have my solution being available to me so zones and sets are designed to become essentially make your applications fault tolerant and update tolerance they're designed to make sure that those systems keep up and running if something does happen on our side so it's our way of saying hey look an update we don't want it to impact you zones and sets are also free they don't cost you anything now the resources running in a zone or a set definitely cost you something but this is the design and architectural decision when you choose a zone or a set it also locks you into a region for those virtual machines that are going to be in that particular zone so when you design this and say hey i'm going to make an availability zone inside of south central guess what you're locked into the south central region for all those virtual machines this also has to be done at the creation of that virtual machine if you i just created a vm but i forgot to put in the zone you'll have to recreate it now there are some ways you can export that vm and re-import it but you're essentially exporting it and recreating it inside the zone but you have to do it at creation time well matt i think it's important to notice that uh you showed us in the in the dublin slide that there are uh independent facilities for power for cooling for networking and i think that's really important for everybody to understand is that the one of the key benefits of these availability zone is if we have a power outage in this availability zone and you have your second vm in the second availability zone then you will not go down in that scenario because you have independent power and networking there exactly right and that's an availability zone and so that gets into how do we make our vms be fault tolerant and update talent and what you described garrett was electricity went out you just described a fault so we're not just talking about a hard drive failing here now we're talking power to that facility how do we make sure we keep things up and running for your solution but you as a customer of azure have to make this choice you have to make what i want a zone or a set now zones are a relatively new construct and generally our advice is if you see an availability zone if it's available in the region choose that sets are an older construct and they've been around forever but how they do their job are differently and so when we start with the zone we're talking about as garrett mentioned those two different regions so if we look at the if you think about that dublin data center we had those three facilities if i have three web servers what will happen is when we tell azure to use an availability zone under the covers azure will take a vm put it in zone one take the other vm put it in zone two and take the last vm and put it in zone three so that in case one of those data center facilities inside the region goes down guess what we still have the other two up and running all right our solution's still available now you have to start thinking about wait a second it's available i lost a third of my capacity i just lost one of my three web servers that's what will happen potentially if an update or a fault hits that zone well what do you do then well either just make sure those servers have enough capacity so they can run and two servers can run your full solution but that's where a concept called scale sets come in and we'll talk about that in a little bit where we can say hey these are increasing let's add some resources and it'll take care for us automatically under the cover so we have ability to work with it so the nice thing about zones they provide that great isolation boundary they give us independent power cooling and networking of how they become update and fault tolerant because guess what we don't update all the zones at the same time we update zone one then we update zone two then we update zone three and there's three availability zones in every region that you can choose from for your different solutions to run but you have to make that choice so now bear in mind we started with geographies we went to regions multiple data centers in that region is where zones live its counterpart are availability sets and availability sets i want you to go okay geography region data center racks of computers although inside of our data centers we use containers we use a physical containers i should say they're i t compute containers but think about just multiple rash computer now what happens when we get down into an availability set we're inside of a single data center inside of a region across multiple racks same concept i put those three virtual machines in different what we call fault domains you can have up to five fault domains inside of a availability set and up to 20 update domains inside of a availability set as well you have the ability to separate all these and once again what you're telling azure and you're telling microsoft look i don't want a patch or something hardware like an electrical outage or workload to fail or a different rack to go down i don't want that to impact the availability of my virtual machines and remember you need at least two virtual machines to use a zone or a set and what that does it just distributes them so those single points of failure guess what it doesn't impact the availability of whatever solution you're deploying inside of our azure key notes here locks you into a region when you choose a zone or a set they are mutually exclusive you can't choose a zone and a set you got to pick one a general recommendation if you have a zone use it it's going to give you a little bit more of a better sla which we'll talk about in a second but we also look at it fault and update tolerance that's what we're trying to design our solution and what level do you want to live at what your application compliance going to work with all kind of determine that you'll see sets pretty much in all of our azure regions you'll see zones in a lot of our newer regions inside of it when i look at this why do we choose a set or zone it's all about this part of it it's about performance and resiliency but when we look at our slas our service level agreements when you choose an availability set you get three and a half nines for those vms availability and uptime and what does that mean that means that that server is going to run 99.95 percent of the time and in module 4 we'll make those numbers a little more real and kind of give you an idea what that means from a time perspective if you choose a set you get three and a half nines if you choose a zone you get four nines and so why do i recommend zones you get a better sla you get that same resiliency it works a little bit better for us now when we think about what we're doing with a zone you're basically saying microsoft i don't want a data center to bring down my solution if something happens i don't want to bring down my solution there's another way to do it and that's when we talk about region pairs you can deploy one vm in region a and one vm into region pair and guess what you now have data center resiliency and because they're pairs you have update resiliency so there's ways to design solutions to leverage the built-in architecture for azure with that said most customers live in zones or sets when they're trying to design that real resiliency inside of it now here's a cool thing we were the first company to do this what if i just have one hand clapping what if i just have a single server or i'm not going to need a buddy it doesn't need a pair don't want to do anything else with it can i get an sla for it you can get a service level agreement you can get three nines for a single vm but you have to make the vm with what is called premium storage which is performance and by the way if iops and disk performance is important to your solution you're always going to choose premium storage but you also choose what is called manage storage if you choose premium managed storage azure will give you three nines for that single vm so you can still get an availability you can still get an sla for a single vm but most times when you have a virtual machine running inside of azure guess what you're gonna put them in a zone or a set depending on what's available inside of your region [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] bye [Music] [Music] bye [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah matt there's a lot of activity going on um i mean one of the questions here is how important really are availability zones and availability sets i guess probably not just from a technology perspective but a lot of people are thinking about taking the the azure exam so how important are these are these concepts to really understand so first off from from an exam standpoint solely and we'll get into the real reason why we use these from a from a practical usage today i will tell you folks from my personal experience you'll see zones and sets on every exam you take from an it infrastructure side and then some you'll you'll see it on all the exams that i've taken in past to get my architecture i took az300 and 301 um which are being updated and being refreshed as we work with it i saw it on both of those exams i saw it on our administrative exams i saw it on our fundamentals exam and understand the concepts and really the difference when we look from exam is how they ask the questions in az 900 specifically you're gonna have to know what they are and some of the differences between it but you're really not gonna have to know why you would use it or you're not gonna give in like a big giant scenario and which one would you pick you're gonna have just generally fairly straightforward kind of questions but in those other exams you're going to have to figure out the puzzle and the game that you'll play inside that question that's going to be inside of it but you get to that with that really important question of why do i do this if you don't choose an availability center option you're just kind of rolling the dice you're winging it you're hoping that azure will put the machine so an update doesn't impact those multiple virtual machines you're hoping that it does do it and chances are azure won't most likely if you don't choose a zone or a set azure will have a tendency not all the time but when we think about the concept of geographies reasons data centers racks it can put all three vms on a single rack of computers inside of our data center what if that rack goes down you've lost all your virtual machines at the same time and the cool thing about this since they don't cost anything it's really just a design decision you still have to pay for those three virtual machines but you want to tell azure how you want to distribute those vms inside of our physical data center remember everything that we create here ends up in the data center at a physical level and all we're telling is how we want to do this and since they don't cost anything it's now about making sure that they're updating fault tolerant now a great thing about this especially before we offered the single vm sla when updates were going to impact where my vms were running for my test environment i would get an email from azure to my global administrative email account saying hey we're going to have an update this may impact that if you don't choose an availability set or a zone you're going to get that same heads up saying hey we're going to have an update it may impact your solution that's running because you haven't chosen to do this and just one more clarification point that was being asked you you mentioned that we have to select the zone or the set at the time of vm creation and i think if i heard you correctly what you're saying is that's because otherwise azure will just randomly place your virtual machine and it could end up on the exact same set of hardware exactly yeah exactly right when we and you hit the nail on the head is that understand that when we make a vm azure under the covers will allocate hardware for that vm to run and we'll talk more about that in just a few minutes we're going to step through the creation of vm what's that hardware look like that's the ultimate answer in every it it depends how much do you want to pay for how many v cpus and things like that but azure has to allocate it physically and all we're doing with zones and sets is telling you where to allocate you can do the same allocation but they have to be in that same region for that to occur and more importantly has to be done in creation because we have to allocate that you can move the vms and there's there's actually a really good article that talks about and i'm so excited when i saw the article like how to move a vm after creation to a zone or said i'm like oh we finally figured it out when you read the article it's you're exporting the vm creating a new one and importing that vm to that new creation and so you still have to recreate that's really good especially if you already have vms that are mature they're running for a period of time and you don't want to have to recreate the whole wheel but folks if you just make your life easy at creation whatever you choose zone or set the other thing that we'll see is oh why i know i created an availability zone why am i not seeing during my vm creation nine times out of ten it's because you've chosen a different region so when customers see this for the first time they go wait i know i created i can see it in my resource group it's there wait a second why can't i pick it you're in the you put that vm in a different region has to be in the same region so garrett let me ask you a question when you think about azure what do you think the very first thing you're going to create storage a virtual network a virtual machine maybe an app service what are you going to create first i probably would create a virtual machine first nope you actually create a resource group first so when you look at res i trick him it's kind of like whenever i talk to my friends like how do you say uh how do you say louisville lewisville louisville how do you say the capital of kentucky lexington anyway work with me here these are the things that we have when we look at resource groups they're they're the they're the easiest thing to create there's actually just metadata it's a container um that contains all of our resources inside of azure so before you create anything you'll create a resource group now when we create a virtual machine here in just a minute it's going to ask what resource group you want to put it in or you can create a new one during that but the very first thing azure will do under the covers is create that resource group which is just a bucket those resource groups are used to help us have the same life cycle for an application they're a single management unit for all the different servers so we might have a resource group for our web frontends a resource group for our database back-ends it really depends on how you want to organize your resources but a resource has to exist in one and only one resource group now that doesn't mean resource groups can't talk to each other they talk to each other often and we'll be able to leverage the resources in different resource groups we use it for simply organizational purposes of our resources and why and how it's really up to you how do you want to set them up we also set security at our resource group with what is called role-based access control we'll talk all about that in module three but it's how we secure environments resource groups can contain resources from multiple regions so you're not locked into a region when you create a resource group you pick a region for the metadata for that resource group to live but resources can be from multiple regions of different types of resources so you don't have to have just all vms and a resource group you can have the vm the network the storage whatever you want to put inside of a resource group and they can be anywhere now nine times out of ten with most customers when they create a resource group all the resources in that resource group live in the same region that's often just a general design principle now the last thing and it's the last bolt on this slide and it's very very important we don't back up your resource groups on your behalf if you think about all of our customers we just don't have capacity to back them up the reason i mention this is if you delete a resource group you delete all the resources in that group so if i were to go delete a resource group it deletes everything inside of it so how do i back it up how do you back up your data today make sure you have your backups and your templates and whatever you need exported inside of it in module three we're going to talk about a fantastic concept called a lock which prevents accidental accidental deletion of resource groups and it's important to do that because you want to protect your resources because once that resource group is gone it is gone so be aware of what we want to do with our resource groups and treat them very carefully they're containers now for what garrett and i do in our jobs resource groups are great whenever i deliver a class like i'm doing here when i'm done with the class guess what i go in and i delete the resource group so i can stop the consumption of my resources that makes it very easy for me to manage my azure subscription that i work inside of it so resource groups will be the very first thing you create they're for organizational purposes only and that's that's all they can have whatever you want inside of it after that all all bets are off after that now i mentioned a key term and it comes into the hierarchy of when you think about how our structure of our azure environment is created we have a very specific hierarchy at the very top we have this concept called management groups under the management groups we actually have what are called subscriptions inside of azure and subscriptions are where you create resources now in module 3 we're going to talk about another term and i want to just bring it up right now we have subscriptions is where you create your resources and if you look at the slide you go subscriptions to resource groups to resources right that's how we flow down but there's another term you'll hear inside of azure it's called a tenant and tenant and subscriptions get used interchangeably all the time folks they are very different terms where i want to keep your brain at tenet when you hear the word tenant think that's where my azure active directory lives because that's where it does live it's what you authenticate against remember i can't do anything inside of azure until i first log on and in module three we'll talk about azure active directory and we'll talk briefly about the tenant but you log on to the tenant to gain access to your subscriptions and we'll talk more about that in module three but it's important you understand we have to log on somewhere you're gonna be logging on against the tenant that's one of the things that does there's a few more things but at a high level that's what you need to keep it straight so we have management groups subscriptions resource groups resources and why do we have these because we can do things like policy at different levels we can set security at different levels of how we work with this that's how we organize and work with our resources and depending on what level you want to work at what scope you're working at you have the ability to do that work and control how people work inside of azure we're going to talk a lot in module 3 where policy comes in role-based access control comes in from a security standpoint lots of reasons why this hierarchy is important and lots of reasons why you need to keep the term subscription and tenant different and my my kind of my pet peeve if somebody comes up and says matt i'm going to create something inside of my azure tenant my polite remark will be back and you're not creating a tenant you're creating the subscription is where you create your resources inside of there so when we look at course services and products let's take a look at how we can actually create a virtual machine inside of azure so i'm going to take you through the creation of a virtual machine from the beginning to the end and the cool thing about this virtual machine you'll see how easy it is to create a resource but you'll see all the resources that are created so let me hop into my portal here so i can actually show you what azure looks like so here is my azure portal you see my environment ready for me to go a couple quick things that you want to tour around inside the portal first off over here on the left hand side you have your management bar now by default and this is actually a debate question inside of microsoft this is how i learned how to use azure but a lot of my teammates do not use this it's a docked flyout menu i can minimize it this way so i just have to remember the icons for screen real estate or i can bring it out so i can work with the resources now i do like to show this just from a standpoint if i go to all services here notice i have different services i can bring in if i highlight app services i have this little star that's available for me to fill in and if i mark that i mark it as a favorite folks when you first come into azure i'll tell you that we i i don't know if we do this on purpose but we try to confuse you we put all the stuff in there and we're just trying to show you the highlights and by the way the default favorites are the most popular things that people use in azure chances are when you think about the hundreds and hundreds and thousands of services that are here guess what you're only going to use a handful of them so make them your favorites don't have this big long menu structure you have and you can organize it inside of it so use those favorites to add and remove the services that are important to you and what you do inside of azure azure should be easy for what you do inside of it because you're not going to use all the services and features of azure you're going to use a certain subset for whatever your job is inside your organization so you want to have that set up now the other cool thing about this notice that i'm on the resources for this and i'm going to click on the star in a moment but i always like to point this out inside of azure we want to make it easy for you to learn how to do these things you notice that i'm an app services by the way the app service is the main model we use to write applications natively against azure so we're talking about platform as a service paths here but look at below the description of what the service is there's some free training so we actually give you links to outside of azure articles to help you learn about this particular app service so we want you to learn these things and we want you to be curious about these things and if you're like me that's how i learn all right so i'm just going to click on the star and notice what happens it puts app services at the bottom of my list over here on the left-hand side of the screen i can drag that up if i want to and if i don't one of my favorites anymore i simply move over and i clear the star so navigating this portal is important and notice where i'm at here folks i'm at portal.azure.com of where i'm at this is called the management portal we'll talk about some of the other tools in just a little while of how we can work with and manage azure i'm just showing you one way to get things done there's actually like most the products we create at microsoft lots of ways to whatever you want to work with whatever your personal preference i don't want to use the portal i want to use script okay we have a solution for that or i want to use an app we have a solution for that we'll talk about those in a little bit another little quick tour here if you don't like the menu on the right side you do have the ability if i look at the little cog wheel here and go into settings i can have that menu docked or slide out if i choose fly out all it does it puts it up here in the left where i can simply click on to get the same menu so it just kind of hides it once again people do that for screen real estate to work inside of it you can change the colors we have high contrast for some accessibility needs inside of the portal so we have the ability to work with it including language and region now the other thing that i like about this and the last thing i'm going to talk about right now and then i'll hop into create a virtual machine is this screen at the top and this very important thing that says search let me just kind of minimize that out of the way this is huge folks when we look at this if i just start typing in availability okay notice what happens it starts coming in some of the services i have in azure but more importantly over here on the right it gives you some of the information that microsoft docs and i click on what are availability zones it actually takes me an article on our doc website that explains what zones are what zone services how they work what services actually use the zones we have the ability to work with this and notice there's no additional cost for virtual machines running in a zone but you get a four nine availability all right the cool thing about this all i did was a search all i went up the bar said this is what i look for folks azure should be easy to find things inside of it this is how you find things you simply run a search inside of it and then it has the added bonus of giving you a search engine um that'll query outside articles now not on az 900 but when you take other microsoft exams we have what are called performance-based testing aka you're going to have labs in other words our newer exams you're going to be asked to go do something oh you got to go create a virtual network or you got to create a storage account or you got to create a virtual machine and they'll give you all the parameters but you have to make them in other words you have to know how to use this portal or it'll say hey this resource is broken what do i do when i take these exams i just run the search now in case you're wondering now i didn't do this only somebody told me this when you run that search it will give you the links to the outside articles but when you click on them that's what somebody told me i would have never done this never nope not me ever it comes up to a the link does not work it will not let you go look in other words our exams are not open book definitively not open book but you can use the search bar to navigate around those exams very quickly when you're trying to create a certain resource or move around to finding a navigator resource to whatever that task or question they're asking you for so exam tip learn to use this search bar real life world tip learn to use the search bar it is important how to move around the portal inside of it so let's go ahead and get into the story of how i actually create a virtual machine so i'm going to go and this is just one way we can do this i'm going to go to all services actually i'm going to create a resource i should say and create a resource i'm going to go to windows server data center i'm just going to go ahead and click on that make a windows server and now it takes me into the wizard to actually step through this now folks the first time you create anything inside of azure i recommend that you use the gui to create it so you can see all the wonderful parameters all the things that go into creating a virtual machine down the road in real life folks you're going to learn how to script and automate this and i'm going to talk about some of those tools and techniques in a little while when we get into the management of azure but you're going to want to learn how to automate this but for us right now we're just going to step through the gui i can show you all the stuff that's being created for it so it says basic what subscription and notice the very first question here what resource group i have a resource group already created called azfun for our phone that we're going to have today i'm going to give it a name we'll just call this uh fun v vm this by the way the worst part of my day is typing things in public i'm going to say fun vm 2 because i already have another vm created i can choose what region i want to put this virtual machine i'll choose west2 and notice it comes up it says availability options and if i click on the down arrow notice i have the ability to choose a zone or a set and i have this option called preview now i'll remind you again in module 4 but at microsoft the life cycle of all our products go through three really big general stages we have a private preview and that's where we're generally looking for a certain type of customer that's going to do a certain type of thing and they're invited for a private preview to work with those custom to actually work with our product group to develop a solution after it graduates from private preview it becomes what is known as a public preview and in azure we show you those you're seeing one right now with virtual machine scale set with preview in parentheses what that is it's a public preview product now the only thing i want to be very clear on friends don't let friends put production stuff in preview why because there's no guarantee that a preview product will graduate to its next step which is called gender availability now most products that hit public preview will become general availability but understand while it's in preview generally there's really not a lot of cost associated with it there is some but there also is no service level agreement we give you no guarantee that they're going to run it doesn't get its official cost or service level agreement until it hits general availability inside of here but notice i have availability zones i have the one in preview and sets but i'm going to just make a quick change instead of west 2 i'm going to choose south central and notice now when i highlight this notice what's not available for me availability zones remember not all regions are created equal south central is one of our older data centers now i don't know if south central will ever get availability zones but right now it doesn't have the ability to have availability zones inside of it and if i want to choose an availability set because i'm going to put it in south central it's going to ask what set do you want now remember what if i already created a set so garrett if i i know i created a set why am i not seeing it here what would be one of the first things we could check very likely because you put that in a different region your availability sets in a different region than where you're trying to create the vm 100 yep understand folks if you've created an availability set and i get this question all the times why don't i see it i know it exists i created it you're probably in the wrong region okay that are there so i'm gonna choose availability stuff in this case i don't have one i kind of fibbed a little bit let's see if garrett was paying attention keep it awake over there and i'm going to say create i'm just going to say fun set one inside of here now folks word on my naming convention i just kind of have fun because we're in the fun class general rule of thumb have an amy convention i don't really care what you call your stuff just make sure it makes sense to you so you can find and work with resources so i have an availability set then i have an image and right now i'm pulling a windows data center image and this is coming from the marketplace understand what we're doing here i'm buying a brand new license for windows server well if i want to choose one of the other regions that are the resources of the here if i click on this i have ubuntu i have red hat wait a second those aren't microsoft stuff those are linux machines azure is a heterogeneous environment matter of fact linux from a standpoint from virtual machines is outgrowing windows servers currently we have more linux systems running or will be running in our environments people like those servers whatever they want to choose right why do we choose other systems it solves a problem for whatever we're trying to do might want to save us money you have images that you can pick and choose from they all come from the marketplace but the cool thing about the images you also can upload your own image so let's say you have an example hey this is what my sql server looks like or this is what my apache server looks like you can take that image and upload it into your subscription so now you can use that image for creation of virtual machines that help speeds up the process for you now for us i'm making a brand new machine so i'm just going to choose windows data center then we have the size of the virtual machine that we have and notice the size is a ds1 v2 which currently on my subscription costs 46.43 a month to run but it's one cpu with three and a half gigs of memory a fairly generic server if i click on change size i have the ability to change the size to other vms now this is not all the vms when you first come into this wizard and you go to change size it's highly filtered for the different types of generations but let's say i want a bigger vm i can simply choose a d2v3 and that system is going to cost me a certain amount of money but i can select that and now that's going to cost me 80 but now i get two cpus and i get eight gigs of ram so i get myself a little more headroom my general rule of thumb when you're choosing the size of the vm is make sure you pick a vm that you can resize so go small go low all right you can always change the size after you create the virtual machine as long as that site's available to you in the region you choose the next thing here it's important this is a local administrative account so i'm going to go ahead and type in my local administrative id and my password oh and by the way just kind of a fun here you can't use words like admin or administrator for my open source folks out there you can't use root um but if you happen to be a marvel fan you can use groot we have to have fun with this folks and if i type in m hester i'm just going to use my alias here and i'm going to type in my password and trust in the fact that i'm not typing dots i just typed in the word password um inside of here notice and in case you don't believe me if i hover over top of that and click on that type and password it doesn't let me use those words so you have to come up with a complex password of numbers and numerics that we have whoops i'm going to hide there we go and then you have to repeat it in case you just forgot it two seconds ago so i'm going to repeat it in i knew i got that wrong worst part of my day right now is typing passwords all right got a matching then we have this thing called an inbound port rule what this is allowing us to do is open up port 3389 for rdp management so i can log into this vm and do work on it remember this is a virtual machine it's a server there's nothing there but if i want to install and configure it updated this is where i would come into that we're actually modifying what's called the network security group here we'll talk more about that in module three but it's important but also notice the warning message here it's telling you you have a public ip address for this vm and a public port in other words this is potentially vulnerable in most of your organizations you won't be able to do this you won't be able to open up this port and this virtual machine won't get a public ip address i'll talk more about that in just a little bit when we connect to the vm after we create it but that's here we can save money using what is called the hybrid benefit i'll talk more about that in module four if i go next to the drives just at a high level i can choose what type of drive i have which is a premium ssd if i pick on the down arrow and choose standard notice what happens azure come up and say hey look you can do that but this may not be as performant as you want you want to leverage premium drives for all of your virtual systems it just a performance benefit but if i just create down here and i expand the advanced notice it says use manage drives or manage disks what's that mean that means microsoft is going to manage the storage of this virtual machine under the covers for you you don't have to worry about it now you pay a little bit of up charge for that or a little bit of a premium for that but the cool thing about it you don't have to manage that and remember we talked about sets and zones to give machines availability inside of here if you just have a single vm you'll use premium managed drives to get that guaranteed sla but if i simply say no to this notice what it asks me where are you going to store it now i'm responsible for the management of the drive for us i'm just going to choose yes because i want to have it managed by azure and by the way most customers will do this because they don't have to manage a story even though i have a set or a zone i don't have to worry about it hey matt yes with the managed disks does that actually allow for a more predictive cost model we talked about predictive cost versus you know variable cost is this using a managed disk does that give us a more predictive cost on the disk it will because we have controlling of what how much traffic is coming in and out of it that's part of that premium managed storage but the only thing we can't tell you for certain how much you're going to put inside the vhd how much data is going to be there we can give you a really predictive cost of what that service is going to cost you but then it's how much are you storing inside of that and hopefully you have a general idea the cool thing about this and and this is just it101 this is just where the os drive runs right where the actual operating system's run in real life and you see the options here you're going to create and attach your drives for data drives and where you're going to put that information there so it does help us have that predictive cost but once again we still don't know how much you're going to store so we can get close but how much is that vht going to be and bear in mind this is a virtual hard drive and i believe and i'll get this wrong i always get it wrong it's going to show up like you have 127 gig but in reality that vhd file is maybe one or two gigs in size so you're only paying for that one or two gig not for the actual what looks like capacity inside the virtual machine just virtualization click on next for networking notice inside of networking everything has to live on a network now i'm not going to do a deep dive into the virtual networks uh in this course it's kind of out of the scope of what we have but folks i just want to point out notice we use this what is called slider addressing or seeder addressing depending who you talked to but you see that nice pretty slash 24 that tells us our subnet subnet mask for our network id and our host id and ip4 mathematics you won't really see this on this exam folks most likely but i guarantee you'll see it on the other exams you'll have to know what that slash 24 is now for the folks that are going i know ip i can't remember if i were to tell you that slash 24 means the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 that's what it's telling us if that makes sense to you then you're well on your way but we do offer some courses that help refresh modern i.t essentials that are online and available to you if you want to leverage it so i'm not going to go into a lot here you'll also notice that inside of here i have my port for the inbound we have load balancing we'll talk about that in just a little bit as well next if i go into management it tells me different things i can do inside of management notice we have the security center basic plan every customer gets that i think of security center as a way that we can advise you what's going on inside the virtual machines we also have boot diagnostics which is the general status of the machine is it restarting is is it up and running what's the general cpu performance what's the general networking performance but if you want to reach in and leverage azure monitoring service you can reach in and install an agent on this vm that will pull out in this case it's a windows server to pull out the event log from the windows system so we can manage that fully and now i get one single pane of glass that tells me hey this is how the machine's running in azure but also now under the covers how is that machine running and you think about kind of the problem when i'm looking at metrics inside of azure it's going to say hey this person this machine's at 85 you're probably going to ask the question why the log files inside that vm will tell you that other part of the story azure will say you're 85 why you'll reach into the machine and look at the log files to pull out that y inside of it it's not turned on by default for the simple fact that does it uh create some additional storage you want to make sure customers are aware of that and you may not need to log inside of there it all depends uh how you want to work with it we have a system managed identity here just real brief on that what that basically means is that this machine may need to go access resources in azure but it doesn't have a user id and password so if i give it a system managed identity i basically give this vm a user id so it can run around and consume resources that it may need to do its job we have the ability to auto shut down on vms you know our mom always at least my mom always told me i'll turn the lights off when you leave one of the common methods that's happening inside of azure is why do i have 15 servers running over the weekend when i know five servers will cover it during the week i need all 15 but on the weekend i only need five well we can enable what is called auto shutdown of those vms so that every day at five o'clock on friday it turns off those vms why is that important you reduce your cost charges i don't need them why leave them on why didn't we do this on-prem we were afraid that the server wouldn't turn back on monday morning if anybody's ever done this okay i gotta turn the server off i gotta reboot it i hope it comes up and you hit the power button you're just going please please please please please come up well guess what auto shutdown turns off that machine now i want to be very clear here and it's a marginal thing i just want to make sure you're aware of notice it says auto shutdown there's no auto turn back on although you can do that very easily in script to have a scripts turn vms back on on monday it's actually a very straightforward and within the shutdown article they talk about how to create that script i wish it was auto shutdown and turn back off and so my request if any product group people are listening to this broadcast can we get an auto turn back on please feature whatever you want to call it i'm going to turn it off for the particular demos here we can leverage azure backup if we want to back up the vm i'm not going to do that for this particular instance if i go to advanced it tells me what extensions do i want to install here extensions add things bear in mind what is this wizard doing this wizard is installing a brand new virtual machine what's in the virtual machine nothing just the os that's it so it's a single hand clapping doing that exactly right this is where we can come in and configure it now if i choose the extension install just want to give you a quick little tour here we have all kinds of extensions we can add to this we can add in our backup we have microsoft anti-malware but we have a really pretty one here it's my favorite one the reason i come in here custom script extension what does that mean not only will i build this virtual machine now i can tell azure run a script when you're done in other words turn the machine on create the windows server now run this script to go do something that might be to configure it that might be to work with that environment it all depends on what we want to do but we have the ability to add these custom scripts after the fact very common that we do this very common that we work with it so i'm not going to choose any extensions here just close that down tags tags are a huge governance control that we have inside of azure we'll talk more about these in module three but one of the common reasons we're going to tag resources is for the simple fact that we want to make sure a resource is properly built so if you have multiple departments how do i know the finance department well that vms are on the finance department i can use a simple tag to do that to help work with the bill we'll talk more about that in module three and the last one i'm going to hop into is next review and create now if you're like me when it comes to technology like just click on things okay just hit create you're going to miss something just wonderfully important here on this screen at the very bottom to the far right of the word create it says download a template for automation you might be impressed to know that guess what as i was going through this wizard azure was remembering everything that i was making a choice of and it was storing it in a template file and it's a json template file that i can use and i can save to recreate this vm down the road and all the template will do is remove all the uniqueness my name of the computer all the ip address it just makes it unique so i'm just going to say download a template because i want you to look at this file for just a moment and this template file basically has all the parameters that describe that particular vm and if i go into parameters you can see the different choices under the covers that are here if i scroll through this list notice i have south central us i have the name of the vm i have that rdp port opened up i have the different environments that are there i even have my storage type i have my username all that stuff is being captured for me i can take this template and i can add it to my library inside of my subscription which means now i can pull this back out dust it off and deploy another solution now i will tell you quite frankly folks this particular template is bigger than it probably needs to be most templates that you create inside of azure are very singular focus this template's going to create the virtual machine this template will create the network this temple will create the network security group they will generally be that way this is a really big template because it has everything virtual machine storage networking public ip address network security group any management extensions blah blah blah blah blah it's all inside of here but we can we can capture that now for us i'm just going to go back to the creator virtual machine inside of here and if i scroll down you'll notice that hey you've opened this up you open up rd once again give us recommendation you're doing something that could possibly create a vulnerability it tells us all the information about what we're going to create here and i'm going to simply go ahead and go create and azure is going to go run and create um this virtual machine and this virtual machine will be up and running in anywhere between uh one to two minutes depending on what you're doing inside that virtual machine now under the covers it leverages a thing called the azure resource manager for the actual creation of the virtual machine you can see the resources are already being populated uh inside of here the actual creation notice that hey look at all the stuff it created all the resources it's creating the availability set it created the ip created the network security group it created the virtual network interface and we're going to see this and as i refresh this deployment we can see different information that's there for us to use in leverage and it'll take another minute or two it'll create the vm we'll just take a quick look at where that vm is created and then we'll move on with the rest of our presentation so we'll give it a second to run here but garrett when you think about this what are some things that kind of strike you as you as i went through that wizard what are some things you were kind of interested in or kind of some areas you want to dig into a little bit you know when i'm thinking about how you're building this i'm thinking about reusability right as an admin if i'm going to have to stand up a large deployment i don't want to have to go through this wizard every single time just to create another virtual machine so i really like the fact that at the end of all of it you're able to download that file and create that repeatable process in a much simpler fashion yeah and and i'll do you one even better at the end of the module we're going to talk other ways i could have done this all in azure powershell we also have a thing called the command line interface um cli for short i can automate all this in lots of different ways and so you know people sometimes joke at us microsoft well we have eight ways to create the same thing we do because we want to give you the flexibility what's the most point but you bring up a huge word there repeatability we want to make sure that we can duplicate this in a very consistent controlled fashion and we start talking about deploying things templates are one way to do this i talked about another one well i i want to i want to have a server and this is always going to be what my web server looks like it's going to have this server it's going to have a patch it's going to have this certain configuration this is where it's going to pull its images file directory from and i have all that stuff well i can actually just create that as one of the images so i can hey my starting point is just not the os my starting point is everything installed in a figure just deploy it and then i can use a template to call on that or i can use it via script and really it's up to you to actually work with this inside of azure now while i was talking it's kind of my stall tactic 101 the vm was all created for me to look at let me just go ahead and hop into the resource here there's a button that says go to resource and in the resource i can find information about its public and private ip addresses that were assigned during creation of it i can also connect to this we have the rdp opened up i'm not going to connect to it in this particular one but we can connect it we also have a new one called bastion because the question is wait a second matt i have to go in to control it but as you're saying that if i open up port 3389 it's a security vulnerability and they're right we actually have a new service in azure called the bastion service where i can actually put this virtual machine with no public address be signed behind a separate network that does have a public ip that i have to authenticate against first before i can access that vm and it becomes a really nice way to connect in a safe and secure kind of a little scope out of scope which you might see on the exam but from a usability standpoint remember what was my one thing i wanted everybody to learn at least one thing during this class understand the bastion service will eliminate the need to have that public rdp port and public ip more to the point folks chances are in your organizations you won't be able to distribute public ips onto vms you'll have it governance that prevents that why because you don't want your organization to have a security vulnerability and you also don't access a vm directly we'll talk about a couple other ways inside of it so if i go back in and take a look at the environments here just a couple highlights i can connect but i can always change the size if i change the size remember we talked about scalability in the cloud inside of here i can change the size of this vm anytime i want i can scale it up or i can scale it down by simply picking the new size of whatever i want to choose and clicking resize now just a word of caution here when you click on resize there is a period of downtime that occurs because we have to reallocate new hardware we have to move this vm to new hardware the cool thing about that that downtime is fairly minimal when i say minimal think seconds because we actually have to move this file to brand new set of hardware and redeploy it now from my personal experience if you stay inside the same family like the d series 10 15 seconds if you go to a whole new family like go to a g series vm it might take a little bit longer so we have to go dig up that hardware inside the region that you're in but always think small but this is a manual process when you're scaling up or scaling down remember what that is adding resources to that virtual machine for us to use and leverage inside of here so just a quick tour of the vm but it's there it exists it's available for us to do uh to whatever workload that we want to use in leverage what are some other virtual machine services we have inside of module two so understand we have azure vms creating the virtual machine that's inside there we have a concept called scale sets inside of azure we have this concept called an auto scale set what this allows me to do is take an azure virtual machine and say hey i need to add 500 more virtual machines to solve a problem maybe you got mentioned in a popular show your website's going to get popular and need more virtual machines and the scale sets based on thresholds will scale out automatically whether it's a cpu or a memory threshold the cool thing about scale sets is that they are elastic which means not only we will scale out but as those thresholds are unmet will start to scale in automatically for you we also have two other ones app services and functions wait a second virtual machine services matt those are platformers of service and yeah exactly right app services and functions are very much platform as a service but what did i tell you about azure everything runs on something under the covers now who manages the virtual machines for those app services or functions we do you're in the path side of the house that's part of our responsibility you don't have to worry about patching the os but know that when you create an app service you write code natively against azure or you create a function which we'll talk more about those in just a little bit under the covers there's an operating system there and there's something that's running to support that app and to support that function inside of azure they're all there for us automatically so you can't just think when you think virtual machine yeah if you're thinking azure vms that's definitely infrastructure as a service but when you think app services that's platform as a service they all use virtual machines under the covers now other common technique that we have inside of azure that we're leveraging is actually an industry environment we have it's called containers and containers are different than virtual machines vms when we look at them when we look at virtual machines they're some people call them bloated or i call them heavy and what they are is whenever you have a virtual machine you have your common os you have the runtime your whatever operational framework and the application running on top of it but if something happens to the application generally you have to reboot the entire operating system to get the application to restart in a proper fashion and pretty much with virtual machines you rinse and repeat that you have the same operating system it has the same run time and you have the application on top of it more importantly you have the same os so they're very large files they're they're heavy they take they're not very portable they're not very close platform friendly in other words hey this os is windows or this os is linux how do i work with it well along came a concept called container and i believe docker was the first one to do this and mostly for the open source if you think about open source systems you think about the different varieties and distributions of linux there was a problem here with folks that were developing linux and when i mean problem just understand there's a logistics issue here well what distribution of linux did you use to deploy that so along came this container technology that sits on top of a common os that gives me a container runtime in other words i don't care what your os is i'm going to give you a container run time that we all can adhere to and i can write my applications on top of it the cool thing about this it gets rid of that need of the operating system to run over applications because it's one of the age-old things a good friend of mine bill who i used to work with a long time ago i joke with him because bill was a developer very good developer actually great i would probably say but whenever bill would come into my room and i'm talking about infrastructure stuff i'd always joke with bill i said you know bill without my server you have no place to run your application into which bill would reply without my application you have no reason to run your server and so we talk about the chicken versus the egg what comes first and what this makes this nice it makes applications very efficient makes them cross-platform friendly makes them very portable makes them movable now if your brain when you hear the word container is thinking about a cargo shipping container in the ocean somewhere coming up the port with all the containers your brain is in the right place because that's what they're designed to be because i don't care what ship that container is the same thing with our containers in our applications i don't care as long as i have that platform i can move that container to wherever i want as long as that common platform is there for me i can run it containers become a very fast and efficient way to run code you think about that first scenario if i have to reboot the application i just have to reboot the app very fast and efficient where you have to reboot the os then reboot the app this is why we're using containers you know i always joke with some of the folks in the product group if we did not have azure or cloud technologies in our world today you would all be moving from your hyper-v or vmware farms into container technology you'd be doing this on-prem it's happening now the cool thing about azure is it supports container technology so we can run this application portability now another fun question if you ever use microsoft folks in these teams you can kind of ask this question i call it a debate generation generating question hey i'll never use containers i can just use the platform services and write natively there are benefits to writing containers inside of azure versus using platform as a service but it really depends on what that application is going to do and which choice you make because we do support both containers inside of azure as well as the kubernetes services so container instances inside of azure is basically a paths offering that allows to upload your containers and work with them inside the azure platform so we can put these systems inside of our container service so our container runtime essentially is azure container instances under the covers but then we have a thing called kubernetes now you think about our containers we have all these little boxes of containers on that cargo ship well what's the thing that moves them around it's a big crane right that sits on the dock and moves them around inside of it and who's controlling the crane most likely the captain of the ship is saying hey put this container here and they're balancing the workloads if you've ever watched the the show deadliest catch uh on tv they're trying to organize those containers and those those uh the the the crab cages to organize it there has to be done in a very logistical fashion kind of the same thing with our cargo ships that's what the kubernetes service does it's that orchestration for managing those containers now fun geek tip i learned from my friend chris henley kubernetes in greek you know what stands for in greek garrett yeah i have no idea matt it stands for captain in greek loosely translated by the way loosely translated from greek but kubernetes stands for captain you think about this and for your exams keep it straight the captain of the ship is kubernetes it's the orchestrator what is it orchestrating the containers for those application codes inside of it so kubernetes greek for the word captain learn something new every day some more services we have we have azure network services we have the ability inside of azure to create virtual networks we did that when we created our virtual machine and that virtual network is where everything lives everything has to have an ip address for communication we have load balancers load balancers are great because that's where your public ips are going to go if you have a web farm with three servers when somebody comes to your website how do you determine which server they go to well what if they all flood number one one number one is going to get over utilized the other two are not going to have any work a load balancer balances the load of that workload coming in from the internet to those different vms we also have vpn gateway and peering i'm going to talk about those in a moment but it's one of the key technologies we use under the covers on how we can connect our virtual networks but also more importantly how we can connect from on-prem into azure for hybrid networking so we're going to use vpn gateways or peering and i'm going to talk about those differences in just a moment we also have azure application gateway well what about our applications behind the environment where we don't necessarily need a load balancer for those virtual machines have app services and we want to make sure we balance those load that's where the gateway comes in the gateway also has a huge security advantage what is called a firewall layer 7 firewall security and what that is whenever we have data coming into the application we just let you come in hey your port 443 coming in well what happens is that the application gateway will inspect the traffic to make sure that information is valid traffic and not contain bad packets content delivery network i've i've mentioned this a couple times but i'll mention again it's how we move large amounts of content in azure from one region to other azure regions around the globe the best case study we have here is the olympics the olympics in rio actually leveraged the content delivery network and i believe they're going to leverage it for future olympics but what happens is when you record an image over here on one side how do i get that file over to your region that's closest to you as a consumer so you can watch an olympic event you know i oftentimes like the field the field and track events they're not always on tv when i can watch them while i just go to the website downloaded it's coming from a content delivery network it moves content on our networks on our background it leverages it a lot of services inside of azure for example the front door service uses the content delivery network when people come into our front door without letting them in inside of it so when we talk about network and connectivity options azure this is where we have to talk about a couple things that are important to our networking story first one is peering what is peering peering is connecting virtual networks together inside of azure and so if i have vnet1 over here and vnet2 over here by default virtual networks are isolation boundaries they don't talk to each other so if that's what you want you never do anything with them they're ready to go and you put all the resources in the different networks but what if i want vnet1 to talk to vnet2 i create what's called a peer relationship now bear in mind this is on our network so this is in our private network and that pier all it does is creates a pathway for azure to be able to talk vnet1 to vnet2 it just creates a roadway azure under the covers automakes automatically makes the routing table so this occurs fairly easily and it takes just minutes to set up a peer peering though does not encrypt traffic between virtual networks so inside of azure we can set up a vpn v-net connection which will set these two networks up and then we'll encrypt the traffic inside of it now folks once again remember where are you at you're inside of azure you're already on a private and safe and secure network unless you have an application that needs an additional layer of security you're not going to use vpn gateways you don't need an additional error now some of some customers that might be in some of the governmental data centers may need that for compliancy but most customers don't do not in other words use peering unless you absolutely need that encryption town when it's easier to set up it's fast it's very efficient but now let's talk about our on-prem environments for a moment how do i connect my on-prem systems to azure and there's three really big ways we can do this one's called a point-to-site and i want you to think as an administrator of the environment i have something on my laptop and i want my laptop to connect to a virtual network inside of our cloud i'll use what is called a point-to-site connection option in other words i load essentially a little vpn client on my laptop that i can log on to that vpn client and connect to that virtual network and do whatever i want inside the virtual network it's a point administrative point into an azure virtual network now if you want to connect your business inside of azure what you do is called a site to site vpn connection and what this does every business you have a public internet facing router it says on the edge of your network it's how your business can talk to the web and talk to other resources around the world what you do is at that level you can configure that router to talk to an azure virtual network and what's nice now you've basically made azure a branch office of your environment you've connected these two networks together and whatever resources i have on-prem here can then talk to the corresponding azure resources in the cloud just by going over the site-to-site connection now both point-to-site and site-to-site connections run over the public internet they're vpn so that traffic is encrypted from our points to the actual azure networks um that we have inside of there but they are going over the public internet now with site-to-site and point-to-site the default traffic speed is 100 megabits a second and with point-to-site that's the fastest you can go now it doesn't seem like a lot in reality it's not but when you think about we're just doing rdp and maintenance it's actually quite a bit of traffic with site to site you can actually go up to one gig you can actually purchase different skus to increase the bandwidth inside of there but if you don't want to go over the public internet how can you access azure we have a concept called expressroute and expressroute is a private dedicated connection that you have on-prem that will connect you directly into azure so you can access our resources and our data centers and by the way it's not just azure we're thinking in the azure world but once you have an express route connection for your business you could possibly leverage other services in our microsoft cloud environments things like dynamics 365 or office 365 are available for us that private connection is a dedicated line now folks express route can be expensive and can be cost prohibitive there is a price that you have to pay for that and you can go anywhere between one gig connection up to 10 gigs you can have it metered or unmetered and if you look at the calculator if you're doing an unmetered connection on our premium switch it's approximately 50 000 a month for that connection speed now it seems like a lot but depending on your business that might be a drop in the bucket to what you need to do why we have express route connections is when you need that high-speed dedicated channel into azure so we have that constant communication but it's a private network now you also have one other potential charge here you have to have an mpl circuit in other words you have to have a provider that drops that fiber into your business they're going to charge you generally a monthly fee for that fiber plus installation and configuration it's almost like when you buy a brand new house and you get internet access for your home you have to drop that information inside of it and hope they have fiber or something into your environment to work with it so we have express route connections which gives us private connections into azure so we have lots of connectivity options for us to use and leverage on how we connect at a real high level now folks i just got done talking about networking and just a little bit before moving to data networking in a lot of our courses is usually one day all by itself we spend eight hours just talking about networking so i'm just giving you the tip of the iceberg like we're going to talk about data here when we talk about data we have three main types of data we have structured data we have semi-structured data and we have unstructured data the most popular on this list by the way is unstructured data inside of azure we call unstructured data called blob data or binary large object now i'm actually rather disappointed when i learned that that blob was an acronym because in my brain i'm going to the 1970 horrors movie with a green blob running around trying to catch people but it really is just unstructured data most of the files we work with jpegs videos pdfs word documents excel spreadsheets email visio diagrams pretty much anything we put in sharepoint unstructured data but how do we use that well i'm going to talk about how we leverage it inside of azure inside our blob service in just a moment but we also have semi-structured data these are things like nosql where there is some structure to it so cosmos database would be structure semi-structured because it's a globally distributed nosql we'll talk more about that in a moment and then we have structured data these are our relational databases think sql server think oracle think all those different things where there's a schema and they work with it inside of azure we have these different categories of storage but how do we store them inside of azure now database services are done a little differently but where you're going to store most your data is in what is called a storage account and a storage account inside of azure spans two different categories we have infrastructure as a service is services and we have platforms as a service or path services on the is side of the house we have what is called disk storage remember i talked about premium storage and managed storage under the covers azure automatically creates a storage account that stores your vhd files now we have another version which is called the azure file service and this allows us to put an smb file share inside of the cloud technology server message block is a very common way we access it now some of you are going hey what's what's server message block if i were to tell you backslash backslash server name backslash share name that server message block and smb allows us to access those files in the cloud now exam tip 101 i don't even know what tip i'm probably like 15 by now folks if you see a question on your exam says you want to access storage and azure using the smb protocol the answer with 100 certainty is files it's the only one that will ever speak smb protocol everybody else can be accessed via apis but if you're smb files s p files garrett s p files very good so you would have gotten that question right exactly what we do inside the environment we also have platform as a service where we contain the other types of storage um we have containers for our container storage and our containers really are not for our container search for our blob storage we have page blobs block blobs and that's how we're going to use and leverage the information under the covers it's all about read and write accessibility and we'll talk about in a moment we also have a pen blobs for log files we're just going to append to the end of that environment we have tables for nosql data and then our applications need to talk to each other and we use cues for that application communication in other words they have to store their messages somewhere they use message cues for exams kind of know the real high level the different general ideas what we have inside of it but what i want to show you is how to actually create a storage account where all this stuff is created a storage account inside of azure is just a bucket on where we contain our resources what can be in a storage account uh can i have structured data yep can i have unstructured area yep can i have semi-surgery yep it's where we store everything it's just an account so i'm going to go through and step through the creation of the account to show you what it is and how to use it so let me hop back into my portal here and in my portal i'm just going to go into my storage accounts and i'm going to go ahead and add in a storage account here and give it a second to come up and first thing with pretty much everything you go here what subscription and what resource group content so i'm going to say azfun if i scroll down it's going to ask what is your storage account name now this name that you put here and i'm just going to call it fun storage one has to be globally unique which means in all of azure this name can never be used right so it has to be globally unique i give it a region i have the ability to choose premium if you choose premium it does one really big thing important to your replication it creates what is called locally redundant storage i'll talk more about that in a second because there's a big story here folks that you're going to need to know how to do not only for this exam but every exam moving forward you have to understand what we do under the covers for replication if i choose standard i can have my general account time now folks you very rarely will ever change this choice just ignore it this these this isn't the storage you're looking for right standard v2 if i click on the down arrow for this i have the general purpose or blob storage um depending on what region you're in we have file storage where you have dedicated storage remember the storage account is provisioned to store any type of data that you want to store inside of azure so i'm just going to choose v2 and then we get into access here just real quick and then i'm going to talk about application we have hot storage we assume with azure anything you put inside of azure you're going to want to use it that's hot storage so you pay a little bit for that you have cool storage which you can immediately access but we recommend anything in 30 days or older if it's never changed in 30 days move it into cool storage it costs a little less it's immediately accessible if there's latency in the terms of seconds to be able to access that file inside of azure now let's talk about the replication because locally redundant storage is the default you might be surprised to know that everything you store in azure there's actually three copies that are stored automatically for you one you only pay for the other two are for us for our fraud tolerance they're behind glass breaking case of emergency then we'll access one of those two files that are available to you but there's choices here if i click on the drop down notice i have a couple choices that are previewed i'll talk about those as well what we have is called zone redundant storage now if your brain just went hey what matt talked about this thing called availability zones that meant multiple data centers inside of a region you're in the right head space what happens now with zone redundant storage we get three copies of data but they're put in the different zones inside that region so now we have a higher availability for our storage if we go geo-redundant storage or grs we have a total of six copies of data three in the region a and garrett any guesses where those other three copies are uh in the peer region exactly right in the pair region that we have we have six copies of data now when you do geo-redundant storage you will double your storage cost because you'll pay for one copy in region a and another copy in region and whatever it's region pair region b you'll pay for that but you also pay for for the initial replication which does create egress traffic charges i mentioned that to you because if you're replicating for the first time if you choose grs you can have petabytes of data and you will your bill will reflect that it may not it's not really generally a large amount of data but just be prepared you do get charged for egress traffic charges the cool thing about that is that once that initial replication is done we only replicate the deltas between the data so we don't do full replication just what has ever changed so we'll generally see with customers like hey why is my egress traffic charge really high this month because you did that initial replication and after that it should drop back down with just regular usage but grs six copies of data three in the region a three in its region pair then we have a variation of uh grs it's called read access or ragrs what this is still the same six copies in region a and region b but that other copy of data up there is read accessible so other words people that are in that region or close to that region can use that data types of things of why you might do this may have log files up there maybe you have some analytics and databases you just want people to see it can't change it because you can only change it in the region we created but read access allows us to do that kind of change when you look at a cost structure lrs is the least expensive followed by the most expensive which would be ragrs and the different calculators will show you that we'll talk about the calculator in module four now the other two here are in preview technology matter of fact these previews from what i've seen in experience you can only use them when you're creating the storage account if you want to try the preview after that you have to recreate the storage account but the names tell you everything you need to know geo zone redundant storage when you do grs we just put it in different regions well if you do geo zone guess what it puts it in the different regions in the different zones our read access geo rezone redundant ra g zrs six copies of data once again different zones but those zones can be read accessible and so when we create the storage account we have the ability to do that so i can click on next networking which allows me to control how i access the storage do i want all networks to generally that's generally what you're going to do all networks are going to want to come into it but you can create private endpoints really not going to go into that but we can control if we know only a certain virtual network or a certain set of systems are going to access the storage account you can lock it down inside of azure advanced just control some of the advanced options do i want secure transfer in other words we store all of our data safe and secure at rest all the data is encrypted on our data centers it's all there rests automatically for you as a customer but what if you want to make sure you have secure transfers the data moving in transit you can enable this here and that require access we have soft delete for our blobs which allow us to control kind of a recycle bin at the blob level so if i delete a file i can bring it back very quickly and then we have specific things for azure files if you have a large amount of file shares or data lake storage if you have some things you might need some of those options and we also have previews for nfs to access storage as well here's our tags for our governance next review and create should pass validation i'm going to go ahead and create the vm and notice that as that's creating we have that wonderful download template that was there for us to use now this storage account what can be inside of here pretty much everything and i'm just going to give you a quick tour once the storage account is created so you can see all the different things that are available to you and why that name had to be globally unique uh for you to use in leverage hey matt a question question from one of the attendees so you mentioned that there was additional charges when we're replicating data if we're selecting geo-redundant storage versus local redundant storage but are there other times where there's additional charges other than just storing the data or is it just during that replication well so yeah so that replication causes egress traffic charges and it's a great question so ever asked an awesome question what happens is that we always charge for you guys traffic replication is one of those egress traffic charges well what if there's a public-facing website and i have my customers pulling data out of my customer website just created you guys traffic charges or if you export your virtual machines out of azure directly you have eager traffic so we we charge not only for the storage of the data but also the transactionally now with that said i don't want to alarm anybody because the prices normally are fairly minimal and nominal with this but we do have transactional charges we have storage cost charges that are going to be there the type of storage that you have premium versus standard matters that affects storage so it's not just about how much data you store and by the way we only charge you for what you're storing in the cloud we don't charge any more inside of it but there could be additional charges normally that transaction charges surprise people the first time they see their bill and sometimes in the tune of pennies and then if it's the first time they've replicated a petabyte of data sometimes it tunes a thousand so not always a pleasant conversation but i wanna make sure you're aware of those charges um it looks like our storage account has been created so i'm gonna go ahead and hop over to that resource and then that resource notice i have the ability here's my containers for my blob storage there's my file shares there's my tables and there's my cues all that information is available to me and you have inside the wizard all kinds of abilities to work with this and if i go into the blob service i can go on containers and create a container i'll do that in a second but why do that name have to be globally unique let me show you something here if i go into properties and i scroll down notice it has my primary blob service endpoint so endpoints are how we access data inside of azure programmatically so if i want to come into a system how do i work with it well if you look at the endpoints here and you look very closely notice it says fund storage one guess what that is that is my storage account name why does the name have to be unique because we're using it as an endpoint with a public url more importantly it's followed by blob.cor.windows.net blob service it uses fundstorage.one what's the file service file.cor.windows.net what's the q service q.cor.windows.net what's a tableservicetable.coor.windows.net that's why that name has to be globally unique so that when we're accessing it programmatically we have a name that's unique to that so let me go into containers real quick and let me just upload and create a blob so i go into containers let me go ahead and add in the container here we'll just call this uh we'll just call this uh well we'll call it um we'll call it hong kong just for giggles access level by default we have private which means people can't come in and take a look at that you have the ability to make it a read-only or you can make container access means they can see everything read and write in that data i'll leave it private for now and i'm going to click ok and all this is a container and all containers are ways that we can control our blob files inside of azure the cool thing about this is that once we create this caterer now it's just a matter of uploading a blob what is a blob it's simply a file so i'm going to go ahead and hop in to the blob file and let me upload a file here very quick to do and i'm just going to select a file let me go into my pictures directory here let me go into hong kong and i'm uploading a picture and i'll show you what this looks like in a moment i'm uploading a picture of a panoramic image of um microsoft's hong kong office uh where we actually have a we have a view of the of the bay it's actually pretty stellar i was uh blessed enough to go there with my good friend steven um and we got to work with it so it uploaded the file for me let me close that little wizard down and open the file here and i can take a look at that file available for me to use and leverage let me see if i can bring this file up go ahead and edit it and notice that this file now is uploaded and in that store so i picture i see a panoramic image of the hong kong office patio it's actually really nice to hang out with it was really hard to work there garrett because i had to go out and look at the the scenery every now and again but this is how we can upload and work with those files now notice i sent private access have you ever had to share something with somebody if i would have said container access or public access this file would have been immediately publicly accessible on all i would have had to have done is on my over tab is give somebody that url and it's not so i just want to show you what it looks like so i'm just going to open up a separate tab here all i would have to do is give somebody that url and they would be able to access that file it's a publicly accessible now i have my access lockdown so people can't look at it but that's how easy it is to create storage and use and leverage it and all blobs are just those binary unstructured files that we're going to store in azure so let me hop back in and let me cover off a lot of the other things that you're going to see inside of azure and a lot of the other solutions now i'm going to warn everybody here i'm going to go a little fast because there's a lot of stuff here but i'm going to give you the overview of things that we're going to need to do and know how to use and leverage inside of azure so inside of here let me go ahead and bring up my slides again and let's talk about some of the other things that we can store inside of azure specifically we have azure database services we have the ability inside of azure to store lots of databases we have a cosmos database server globally distributed it's a no sql database it's table type storage cosmos database when they say globally distribute it means it can run anywhere most of the modern video games that we run in the world today if you have if you have kids i'm my son mitchell he loves video games plays fortnite and destiny 2. almost almost a majority of those video games run some kind of cosmos database or postgres database on the back end for matchmaking for profile information stored we also have traditional sql database we have azure sql now this one's really cool azure sql database is a path service wait a second matt sql's a server it is inside of azure and this is one of the unique things one of the offerings that differentiate us from other cloud providers in other cloud providers if you want to run sql you have to spin up a virtual machine and run sql on top of it we can do that in azure too we can spin up a vm and run sql on top of it but we also have inside of azure azure sql database which now we don't have to worry about the server we can just write natively to a database in the cloud we also have a migration tool that allows you to move data from on-prem other cloud providers directly into our database services we have a database migration service to help move that data into our cloud now folks i will tell you moving data pretty easy to do but understand that most likely that data is associated with some kind of application depending on how that application is using data once you move into azure you might just have to change the endpoint reference of that application to go talk to that database that's now in a new location so those changes could be minimal although those changes could be rather robust as well we also have a marketplace inside of azure there's over 10 000 listings of different partners of ours uh microsoft that have made software to do and solve problems remember we talked about platform as a service where we can build solutions but you might want to go buy a solution what if i want to buy something i can use the marketplace to buy those solutions and just fyi all those images that we create for virtual machines all come out of the marketplace so that windows server image because i'm buying a brand new license comes out of the marketplace what other azure solutions we have we have iot internet of things there's a great little case study out there if you want to use bing and go search for it um do a search on azure and rhinoceroses now i know what you're thinking wait a second that's not the first word association you come on you know you don't think about azure and rhinoceroses when you do that there's actually a really good case study that uses internet of things for mach and with machine learning which we'll talk about in a moment there's an ecological park in southern africa they're trying to prevent poaching organized crime that are killing off the rhinoceros population they actually have a bunch of devices that are strung up in trees that are camera motion activated cameras that take pictures it takes those pictures and uploads them into azure and then azure takes machine learning and analyze them is that a is that a poacher is that a picture of a giraffe or wind loading it's a really neat case study but internet of things is used to leverage that and we have two services we have iot central and i i like to call this kind of the basic service where people are just trying to do proof of concepts it's a general uh general iot service that allows you to connect and monitor and manage iot assets it's generally a management kind of tool but when you want to really work with the devices like in the case of the camera traps you can use iot hub and this allows you to have bi-directional communication with those devices to upload inside of azure to work with to use and leverage inside of azure and so it's a managed service it's a communication hub so we can get those pictures from the camera clean those cameras off if we need to some really cool things inside of azure we also have the ability to handle handle big data inside of azure it was formally known as azure data warehouse it's now going to be known as azure synapse analytics but we have data warehouse which is all about parallel processing large amounts of data folks when you get to large amounts of data inside of azure what do you do and how do you manage and maintain it and really any large amounts of data you have to treat it differently you know imagine if you have a giant warehouse that has rows and rows and rows and rows of products and let's say you're the person responsible for making sure those orders get filled well what you can do well there's two ways you can approach the problem if it's by yourself you're going to run up and down each row until you find the product to put in the package to send out but that's not how you want to it's not very efficient and that's what most modern relational databases are that's essentially what you're doing just asking the question running up and down the rows but when you want to do massive parallel when you have large amounts of data really large warehouses you're going to have a lot of people that are going to running up and down the different roads to find those products that need to ship out and that's essentially what a data warehouse is or in our case synapse analytics we have hdinsight once again reaching into that data and pulling out information about what's going on finding out what's happening inside that data looking for seasonality looking for patterns we also have data lake analytics when you think about a data lake it's it's very similar to what a lake would look like if you have a large lake near you it's information at a massive level on how do i go in and look at that data how do i actually analyze it so if i had like for example lake erie and i wanted to find all the fish that were in lake erie how would i ask it a question well i'd use data lake analytics to ask it a question to find out what's inside there and analyze that population we also have azure artificial intelligence now folks believe it or not you use this you may not even know it if you're using any of the translating programs in the world today especially if you use bing translator or the teams translator or skype's translator you're using artificial intelligence and using machine learning behind the covers learning how to use speak and how you use language if you use powerpoint you actually have azure machine learning with design ideas and if anybody's ever used powerpoint recently you throw pictures on the slide like garrett and i those pictures look really good of our families we didn't actually make that organized we said design make it happen automatically for us it was using machine learning services under the covers for us now we have two versions of machine learning service so garrett i'd ask you a question i want to throw you under the bus are you a data scientist i am absolutely not a data scientist matt nor am i and most likely you're not either now there are two ways we can use this we have the azure machine learning service those are for our data scientists for people who really need to get in the math behind this they can develop track train make their own modules make their own models to work with it and then there's the other one machine learning studio notice the bottom line here garrett no need to write code all right that's us it's a really great way to build and test these solutions i would imagine although i don't know for certain with the rhinoceroses they probably mock something up in machine learning so just see if it could work and then they did the real work inside the machine learning service that we have for your exams know the differences between the two that we have no code in the studio learning services for our data center scientists and the mathematical engineers that we have a couple other things we have serverless computing inside of azure serverless computing we have three areas we can focus in that's azure functions how do i describe functions a function is normally an event that's triggered by something and it's one event comes in and one event comes out it'll create infrastructure under the covers for us automatically normally they're http triggered events they don't have to be but essentially hey i create something and spin up a website one point comes in one point comes out for us to do and leverage it we also have logic apps logic apps are another way that we can start an advantage now a point comes in but i need to make decision on that i actually need to make a decision is that a a picture of a poacher is that a picture of a of a rhinoceros or is that a picture of a wind moving when you need to make decisions on data that comes in you're going to use a logic app to go through that workflow that actual structure hey i need to do this that and the other then we also have event grid where we have a single point come in and we want multiple things it's just a routing service now think about this think about the poacher example for a moment they get a picture of a poacher what has to happen we most likely well that function will come in the picture came in there that function might have cleaned up that picture maybe cropped it maybe sent it along but then sends it off to a logic app that says or sends it off to machine learning service the machine learning service analyzes hey look that's a picture of a poacher sends it to a logic app the logic app looks on that makes a decision hey this is a poacher then it sends it to event grid an event grid says okay that's a picture of the poacher first event i'm gonna send it off to be stored and saved and secured so i can have capture that information second event i'm gonna send it down to the people that are trying to go catch the poachers to get in a helicopter to go find the poacher and save the rhinoceros possibly catch the poacher the point about these and they call serverless computing because under the covers there's machines that are running all of this information they work in conjunction depending on what you want to do i know in the rhinoceros scenario they do a lot of functions to go through that routing go through that process of making sure they try to catch a poacher some really cool stuff that's there we also have devops services built into azure devops services used to be the old visual studio team services and what that is is the ability to collaborate and work with code when you have a group of developers working together it's not too similar than uh dissimilar than people when they work together on a word document for a common proposal or something along the lines the difference is the type of material that they're working with with developers they're working with common code and so we have to treat that a little differently so we want that collaboration with developers we're going to use the devops services to give that where we can use the kanban boards get repositories or we can do some load testing we have some pipeline capabilities here we can really get a good look at how those developers work together we're going to use devops services we also have dev test labs another service for developers and what devtest labs allows us to do is actually go in and and give developers a basically a proof of concept creation environment where they can actually go create and work with things at a lower cost now they're locked down that comes with the caveat guess what we have to use those resources in a local fashion we have to use them in a controlled fashion not in a production environment we also have the azure app service this is probably the biggest thing from a development standpoint inside of azure word it develops developers live in azure they live in the app services and you know what kind of apps do i make well it depends on what they're trying to do but our web apps are there our mobile apps any other service that we're going to use it's designed to run on our platforms this is squarely in the platform as a service environment as a matter of fact a lot of our software as a service offerings in the marketplace they started as an app service so vendors simply came along i want to make something that does things then it's going to work inside the app service for use the last thing i want to talk about in this module is our management tools so i led off with the portal on how to create things inside of azure that's just one of a few tools that we can use and leverage on how we get things done and i'm going to give you a quick tour and wrap up module 2 here in just a moment so the azure management tools it starts with the structure remember the azure resource manager or arm for short and by the way our templates are commonly known as arm templates why because whenever you do anything whenever you create something inside of azure it goes through the resource manager to get that work done under the covers and the subscriptions so the first thing we have to do against arm is we have to authenticate into the arm prove who we are and then we can do our job and what are the tools we have we have the portal that's what i did to create the virtual machine the storage accounts that's what i went into to work with inside of it we also have the ability to leverage what is called azure powershell this will run on your local laptops and your clients it can be a windows system a linux system or a mac system to run those environments if it has mac you have to have the.net core but allows us on our local systems to tell azure to go do stuff manage stuff create things work with it we also have other tools we have the azure cli or the command line interface this runs on top of a windows linux or mac system on bash or on top of powershell it's another way we can work with azure to manage and maintain that we also have what is called the cloud shell the cloud shell is in the portal as a matter of fact i brought it up i didn't show it to you it was there for us to use in other words i don't have to have the stuff loaded locally on my laptop i can open azure and get to the cloud shell and i can open that up and run commands whether they're powershell or bash or i can use the cli we also have an application so if you go to your app stores um you can download the azure app for another mobile experience to work with it now folks the reason i show you this re regardless of what tool you're going to be able to get into and and i don't if you have a mac laptop a linux laptop or a windows laptop well guess what you can use any management tool any of them are open to games what if you have an android tablet well you can't load tools on it so you can't use azure powershell locally but you do have access to the portal which means you do have access to the cloud shell so pretty much everything we have we can access the cloud show or what if you have a phone there's an app now that app is generally a monitoring app but guess what the app also has cloud shell why do i tell you that because in the cloud shell guess what it's a browser environment with an editor that you can actually store and have a central repository for your scripts now let me show you uh the cloud shell real quick and then we'll hop out of module two so i'm gonna hop into my portal here real quick and i'm gonna hop in my home area now inside of here how do i get to my cloud shell it's up here this cute little icon i i know is the powershell icon and some people it's a square with i don't know a greater than sign and an underscore i don't know i always think like a duck sticking out its tongue um however you want to look i don't know there's lots of things you can use here for it it's this icon just know this is the cloud so i'm going to bring the cloud shell up and it's going to bring up my cloud shell um it brings a bash up which is my last one i went inside of it now i don't know anything about bash uh i know it stands for it stands for born again shell which is a linux environment but what i do know is inside of here how to bring up what is called the azure command line interface where i can interact with azure and i'm just going to type in the letters az in my shell and hit enter and it actually will bring up all the different commands now i also i always chuckle and get the scare i think this is a long lost art form the bit art like being able to type letters that are there but notice i have cli and it gives me the information of what i can do now how do i learn more about this so i just want to give you a little bit of information here so i'm going to learn more about this command called group group is how we manage resource groups with the cli and i'm just going to put a z group slash help and it's going to actually bring up that information for me it gives me the help well i need to know more about this well i can hit the up arrow i have command remember it's like we do with most command line tools that we have but i'm going to put an az group and i'm going to type in the word create that's one of the commands i want to create a group with the command line interface inside over here to enter and it shows me an example the different variables i can put inside of it folks the point i want to make is that when you're going to use cli every command begins with the letters az and depending what you want to work in how you can you find out more help dash dash help at the end or tick tick help at the end you can work with it now if you're wondering hey matt which tool do i want to use when i get into the azure environments really i recommend learning cli and for your exams you're going to want to know cli but you also want to learn azure power shell so to do that let me switch over to my powershell environment now folks not bragging i've done a lot of work with powershell i have a couple books on powershell a linda course and things like that but i don't tell you that for that because i actually like cli a little bit better and you're going to see why now powershell we still need because it's not cli is not quite fully full feature yet but let me go ahead and just clear my screen out and let me type in every cli command begins with what letters a-z so i'm just going to type in a z hit enter and notice i get the same bit art i get the same command structure so folks the reason i like cli i don't care if you have powershell or bash you can interact with azure at the same command syntax same exact command i typed in bash is the same exact command i type in powershell it's one of the huge advantages of learning uh the bash or learning the cli environment now last thing i want to show you here real quick is if you want to learn about azure inside of here if you want to learn more about azure first off what can you do um in any azure uh in any powershell i should say they want a little more power shell here type in git command and there'll be a test on this ever we got that okay those are all the power shell commands that i can run azure powershell commands i can use inside of it now unlike cli where i put the help at the end if you want to learn more about powershell a certain command you can type in get help and i know one of the commands that i could use to resize or work with a vm is called update azvm these are all called commandlets get help commandlets are in kind of that verb noun relationship get set start restart delete followed by a noun whatever you're trying to do whatever object you're trying to manipulate and so if i just say git help update azvm it actually has built-in help for me to use and leverage i can even have some switches like hey i want to have an example so i know what this looks like just type in examples and it gives me that command line interface folks i want you to understand the tools are there for the for this particular exam know the differences and just a little bit about the tools in real life learn how to automate it garrett talked about the importance of leveraging the different types of technologies for repeatability templates are one way learning how to create scripts and modify and work with these scripts becomes another way that we can be consistent and repeatable with azure so from that standpoint folks you really want to learn how to use these languages now if you're kind of like a free agent you never really used any in the past i'd recommend learning too learn the cli learn how to use the cli how to find help and then learn how to use powershell if you only want to learn this because you're never ever going to real life because you're going to take the exam learn powershell and learn cli you're going to see both of these examples in pretty much every exam you take from here on until forever with microsoft that's where we focus in that now i mentioned with the exams past az900 you might have labs that will give you tasks we don't care how you get the task done if you want to use the gui use a gui if you want to use azure powershell if you want to use cli you use whatever tool you're comfortable with so in our exams we don't really care which tool as long as you know how to do the task so with that that brings us to the end of module two where we talked about a lot of the core services once again an inch deep but a mile wide we started with virtual we started with the physical architectural availability zones and availability sets we focused on virtual machines networking and storage and then we spend time talking about all the other types of solutions that we can run in azure thank you for your time and your attendance today today we covered module one where we discussed cloud concepts and module two where we learned about the core azure services join us tomorrow where we will cover module 3 and discuss security privacy compliance and trust and then we'll finish the day out covering module 4 on azure pricing and support [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
