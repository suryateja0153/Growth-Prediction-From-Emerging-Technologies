 SFP, short for small form factor, is a compact, hot-pluggable transceiver which can realize electrical and optical signal conversion to extend original link distance. It's most commonly used in 1G network transmission over short and long distances based on different IEEE standards. For short distance transmission, there are 1000BASE-T and 1000BASE-SX SFP. The 1000BASE-T SFP is designed with an RJ-45 port. It supports a network distance limited to 100 meters when operating on a Cat5 cable. 1000BASE-SX SFP is a multimode SFP. “SX” means short-range. This transceiver works on 850nm wavelength over multimode, LC fiber cable reaching links of up to 550m. For long distance transmission, the 1000BASE-LX SFP supports a 10 km link operating on 1310nm wavelength over single mode duplex LC cables. What’s more, 1000BASE-EX and 1000BASE-ZX SFPs can achieve even further distances of 40km and 80km respectively, over single mode duplex LC cables. To save fiber, a BiDi SFP is a wise choice as it can achieve bidirectional transmission over single fiber. Keep in mind. BiDi SFPs should always be used in pairs with the same wavelength. Due to the demands for increased network capacity at the lower fiber cost, WDM technology has been applied allowing more data to be transmitted on one fiber when combining WDM transceivers with a WDM MUX. WDM transceivers include CWDM SFPs and DWDM SFPs. CWDM SFPs come in 18 wavelengths ranging from 1270nm to 1610nm and typically support a distance of up to 80 km. DWDM SFPs are used for DWDM networks of up to 45 wavelengths supporting a distance of up to 80 km or sometimes 200 km. FS.COM provides a full series of transceivers including 1G SFP, 10G SFP+, 40G QSFP+, and 100G QSFP28. We offer compatibility with brands such as Cisco, Juniper, Arista, HP, and more. All transceivers have been fully tested and pass though a strict quality control system. For more information about fiber optic transceivers please visit www.fs.com
