 Time magazine called him the unsung hero behind the Internet CNN called him a father of the Internet's President Bill Clinton called him one of the great minds of the information age he has been voted history's greatest scientist of African descent he is Philip demagogy he's coming to Trinidad and Tobago to launch the 2008 Kwame Toure lecture series on Sunday June 8th at the JFK auditorium newest in dagestan 5:00 p.m. the emancipation Support Committee invites you to come and hear this inspirational mind adjust the theme crossing new frontiers to comfortable East challenges this lecture is one another for to this admission is free so be here GA 5 p.m. at the JFK auditorium newest in the nest [Applause] parallel supercomputing is an entirely new approach to modern computer science yet there's a limit to the traumatically on the speed of the parallel supercomputer looking back in 1946 the fastest computer in the world used on the world scale a processing unit in 1988 the fastest computer in the world still computer with only one vector processing unit shortly after the u.s. Independence Day of 1989 the media reported that an African supercomputer wizard in the United States of America had discovered how the most massively parallel super computer ever built compulsively compute with 65536 commodity processors and so 65536 computational physics problems and solve them simultaneously 9 in 10 supercomputer seconds are executed while storing extra skills dispense of equations of algebra and physics I had figured out how to finish my system for burnaby thousand processors enabling them to communicate and to communicate and collaborate to reduce the time to solution of extra skill systems of equations of algebra and to reduce that time to solution from 65,000 favorable after 6 days or 108 years of one isolated processor to just one day across and and sample of 65 thousand five hundred and six processors that new knowledge enabled those processors to compute quickly and accurately and to make the impossible to solve systems of equations of action scale algebra possible to solve as introduced how to use that new knowledge in algebra and thus build digital replicas of Petroleum Reserve was and the EDS planet I want to be remembered as first person to witness the transition from once I believe that our children's children will create a new world for yes supercomputers the supercomputers that a science-fiction to us I discovered a new way of thinking about the new fastest supercomputer and supercomputer of tomorrow but as a computer person but as a global network of technical processors that is an Internet my country was process of agnostic and was a blueprint for a never before seen Internet the invention of a fastest supercomputer is a milestone of human progress that invention led some impossible to solve problems arising in physics algebra and calculus possible to solve I'm Philipp Emanuel I remember the day I first program is supercomputer it was June 29 for I remember that did a part because I was on the cover of a local newspaper that was published three weeks later and because then u.s. President Richard Nixon was first to sign it in this litter but in mid July 1974 the half-dozen nakedness in poor country of Oregon we are proud to see my photo on the cover of the local newspaper that Miss Ripa was on the newsstands of the velocities of homeward and independence denied events that read that article came to congratulate me now it is crowded into my tiny one-room studio apartment that was at 195 in South LA Street what Oregon that evening we talked about the recent examination of the US President Richard Nixon that evening we went to see a performance in Monmouth Oregon that was delivered by the Mentalist called the amazing Kreskin I remember the day my discovery of practical parallel supercomputing was highlighted by The Wall Street Journal and remember it as 2099 not because I was in The Wall Street Journal they say but because I started programming Confessional supercomputers it's at least until 20 before and at 81 wet Southwest campus with Corvallis Oregon United States I went back by association not memorization and for that mrs. Francis say that I have a photographic memory an elephant memory called an eidetic memory I was asked how did my body become a father of the internet when I began supercomputing back on June 20 1974 in Corvallis Oregon United States I did not come back it was to become a father of the Internet but if the father of the airplane is the person that invented the first airplane then the father of the Internet should be the person that invented the first Internet I am the only father of the internet that invented a new internet and I am known as the first person to program a new internet that I visualized as a new global network of 65 and hundred thousand processors that I also visualized as beautiful distances apart from each other those 65,536 processors had separate memories from each other with each processor operating its own operating system it made news headlines in 1989 that I discovered that knew a tannish to be a feature supercomputer my physical experiments and cross my example of Patrick covered commodity of the share processors get me the street cred that is akin to that of the profit that became a political prisoner or that adequate whose wife committed suicide I'm Philippe a man Valley students writing school reports on great inventors often asked what is Philippe am i funny not before in abstract geometric intense unknown for the assignment and delineating this technology called possession and for precisely describing it as the fight to technology that they will supercomputing across the surface of a globe that blue is embedded within a sixth international Ibis face and I'm known for discovering that supercomputer as in the Bible was before seen internet that a new global network of to raise to power 16 or 65 thousand favorite aesthetic couple processors that we are identical to each other that shared not in between each other with each processor operated its own operating system but in Mexican I mean I was in the news for a discovery practical parallel processing the technology that enables the what a supercomputer to solve many real-world problems at once instead of solving only one problem at a time massively parallel processing and there will be to solve one branch challenge problem of mathematical physics that is an example of sixty five thousand and six challenging problems of computational physics and solve them synchronously loosely speaking and into the computer that is followed by only one processor can solve a grand challenge problem that the parallel supercomputer that is followed by 1 billion processors can solve however the computer takes 1 billion days yes to solve a grand challenge is a grand challenge problem that the parallel supercomputer takes only one team to solve however it took me see [Music] I was because what is in each other 16 years of supercomputing it took another 16 years for many students to understand that I had parallel processed across a new Internet and that I invented a new internet that was a new global network of 64 900 thousand processors that 60 year delay or adjustment period was due to the fact that parallel processing across a new internet was very difficult to understand parallel process to invent a which was super computer that is a new in talent that returns the illusion of being a computer person on the blackboard my new internet exists almost to the point of complete abstraction my new Internet is this invincible and imaginable technology that hunts the transition zones we are the boundaries between but multiple physics and computational physics and between computing and supercomputing our blog my definition of a planet is a metaphor that disturbances the textbook meaning of the world computer that it term was first used in print 2,000 years ago and first used by the Roman author Pliny the Elder I was asked because inventing a parallel supercomputer that cost more than the armor budget of each of the 40 poorest nations in the world it's tougher than writing a book of poetry and tougher impact because the event is to make the impossible possible that's why 50,000 fiction books are published each year in the United States alone that's why ten hundred thousand books are published each year in the United States alone with the average book selling less than 150 copies in contrast he took half a century to invent a new supercomputer and to progress come to rice supercomputer of 1939 that injury was solved is step of pretty nice equations of algebra it took 50 years to progress to the parallel super news headlines when that was done the world record for this book the Bupa of self published books is about one video a year you cannot read the same book that times however 10,000 programmers can program the same supercomputer and be soon at once if you are a writer you can write 1,000 words every day if you are a mountain climber you cannot become the first person to climb Mount Everest the highest mountain and planet every day you cannot break that historical record every day if you are an inventor you cannot invent a new internet every day the reason it is easier to write than to invent is that the writer creates a literature hence the term creative writer but it is impossible to have a put on put creative Discoverer you can write one page a day and complete a novel in one year but you cannot write one page a day and invent a new supercomputer or invent a new internet and do so every year right is infinite but inventing is finite great scientific discoveries are rare simply because grant breaking discoveries that are clearly with six so becoming equipped discovery are also red red side with discoverers read because they can only discover eighteen that pre-exists and they discover us genus has nothing to do with the pre existence of a discovery great inventors are rare because the inventor can only invent what's possible to be inventive great inventors are rare because they cannot invent a law of physics or invent a perpetual motion machine 2,000 years two thousand to two thousand years ago the Roman auto planet elder became the first person to use the word computer for two millennia the name computer remains the same however the basic premise that find the fastest computer has changed it changed from the supercomputer that competed only wanted at the time or in sequence to the supercomputer that soft videos of problems and cross millions of processors and at once in parallel and problem to one processor correspondent manner this supercomputer continuously we defined itself just as this generation of super computer scientists redefined itself for simplicity I'm uniformity and to avoid being the principle of details I used the word computer to describe computing Machinery's that my generation also called CPUs or processors nodes are caused parallel computers or bunch of computers microcomputers or supercomputers and so on what does is supercomputer look like a supercomputer needs evil wires the total 200 miles of taboos a supercomputer can consume five thousand dollars of water per minute undo so to stay cool his super computer can consume as much electricity as ten thousand volts is supercomputer can weigh as much as a commercial airplane parallel processing is the vital technology that powers the world's most powerful supercomputers the use of parallel processing to solve the toughest problems is limited to the imagination of super buddha scientists of tomorrow what is parallel processor imagine that 200 million I'd events we are invited to queue in only one line and two-foot and a bit of one foot per minute this process we take 200 million minutes or three hundred and eighty years allowing only one person to pollenization it's a key to solving only one problem at a time at one processor this sequential processing technology was the basic knowledge behind the old one processor technology that power the old supercomputers including the conventional supercomputers of the 1940s could infect us on the fourth of July 1959 I discovered practical parallel processes and I discovered it as the fight to technology that now and that means every supercomputer and hopefully will underpin every computer the incorporation of parallel processing technology into every supercomputer is the missing supercomputer that was formerly the size of the refrigerator now occupies the space of a soccer field I believe that the world that has been used for 2,000 years it's likely to be used for another 2,000 years the word computer was 4,000 years computer what the computer of 2,000 years from today is expected to be vastly different from the computer of today I believe that by the end of the 21st century that our children's children will develop a new internet technology that will encapsulate the internet that I invented as processors that encircled a blow and did so in the manner the internet and Sega's planet ate that new internet will be a new supercomputer that will be a subset of the entire a precise internet the computer has always been and always be a machinery that is used to perform the fastest computations and that solves the most computation intensive problems and solve them automatically and sometimes by definition and by necessity the supercomputer of the future will be the planet resize computer that performs the fastest of visions I believe that in a century the Internet will become the network of humans that will be directly wired into the Internet and that automatically sends and receives the fastest telepathic email communications as opposed to a network of only processors and computers that it is today parallel processing is the crown jewel inside every supercomputer parallel processor was the spoon that was not as rough and unsightly and rejected parallel processing which didn't as a very science fiction story that was dated 3 1 1 1922 from 1958 to 1989 the usefulness of the parallel super-super was debated in parallel processing was this tool the builders of supercomputers rejected as rough and unsightly only for it to become the grungy went inside every supercomputer my discovery of practical parallel supercomputing that occurred on the 4th of May 1989 built in news headlines because that new knowledge was considered to be a paradigm shift or a change in the way we look at what makes a supercomputer super in the world way called sequential processing of vector processing this supercomputer had only one electronic brain in my new way amyloidosis super basic tamasa ever been and 10-6 brings and can be powered by a video breeze that was how I invented a formula for the world's fastest describe in this White House speech of my signature invention was the fastest supercomputer that was not a computer per se but that was a new internet de facto that was a new global network of 65,536 processes that the technical put to each other that when people are distances apart from each other that shared not between each other each processor operated its own operating system the discovery of the new knowledge that is used to make the fastest computer super that occurred on the 4th of July 1959 was my director movement my contribution to the development of the computer is this I answered a grand challenge question that was posed 67 years earlier back on February 1 1942 my invention timeline was this but in 1970 in Nigeria I competed with a slide rule or a manually operated computer then on June 20 1974 at 1800 Southwest campus we Corvallis Oregon United States I began programming an automatic programmable supercomputer that was rather at work of instructions per second and ranked as the world's fastest supercomputer when it was manufactured back in 1965 that supercomputer was only automatic we did only one processor running formula that then u.s. President Bill Clinton spoke about was my discovery that we can solve a crime challenge initial boundary value problem that is the toughest and the most important problem in science and engineering and automatically but within and across each processor of my new internet that is a new global network of 65,536 processors that we are tightly coupled to each order my contribution to the development of the supercomputer is this I discovered how true it is to become obsolete within the new supercomputer of July 1959 65,000 favorable and that six processors replaced his singular processor that computed alone I invented practical parallel supercomputers and I think so in two stages first I programmed all mice to raise to power 16 or 65,536 processors to automatically send and receive my email encodes and data and do so across 15 times as many evil wires and to communicate with each of my system for another thousand processors second and programmed each processor to automatically compute I thought of those irregularities and not uniformity the email communications between you computers on the internet most PS sent and received and for that reason the Internet itself cannot be a nest and used to solve the Grand Challenge initial boundary value problems that is a recurring decimal in extreme skill mathematics and computational physics the email messaging within my supercomputer is processor to processor emailing not to our everyday person to computer to computer capacity building I discovered practical parallel supercomputers when I figured out how to automatically program across my new in the precondition for recording the fastest computation that can arise from within the fastest computer in the world that put on put fastest computer is not a computer person I discovered that the fastest computer is a ritual supercomputer that is an Internet to factor I was in the news headlines because I figured out how to harness the slowest processors in the world unhonest them around a new internet and do so to record speeds is supercomputing that we are previously on record I invented the world's fastest computer across a new identical to each other and that we are tightly coupled to each other and that started and said would it blue hyper straight in 16 dimensional and a Swiss I also this never-before-seen internet it's called is called the Philip amar by the internet my recomment of 15 of the fourth of July at midnight read the news headlines around the globe tonight its name I did so because I was the first person to discover how to compute smooth honestly and around a clue how to compute around a new internet that is a new global network of technical processors that shared not between each other that is I do fact to invented the world's fastest computer and I invented it by discovering how and why parallel processing is the vital technology that will make every supercomputer Shuba my world's fastest competition occurred after and discover how to communicate synchronously around a new global network of powers of two processors that is called Philip amar Valley [Music] that was from a few pages to 1037 pages in 1989 by 40 page highlights of my 1057 page with such people won the top prize in supercomputing amid the news headlines looking back to the nineteen eighties in the US and we touched on pattern that repeated itself thousands of hands was this I would get a telephone interview for a job that was advertised and get it because I had the most hands-on experience in supercomputer the really interview interview was taken aback we discussed in the nineteen seventies and eighties there were so few blacks act of super computer science that even I would have been shocked if I had seen a black African even my lecture of massively parallel supercomputers I experienced this cognitive bias enhance the first time I attended a research seminar even a police Minnesota in 1992 that was delivered by a very dark-skinned man magician of African descent she was known to divide my partitions but I the only black man in the audience was the only person truly that was in his state of denial it's ironic that the only black male partition in defiance of mathematicians was the only person that denied that the black female mathematician was a Jimmy's Hamlet joke was only a connect theory of dynamical systems I presume that she might not have materials similarly it was presumed that it will be impossible to find a young black and gifted mathematician that can solve the toughest problem arising in extreme skill computational mathematics that was divisible only one person attended my mystic seminar on super widget that I believe in that was a short walk from the White House Washington DC my subsequent discovery of practical parallel processing that occurred seven years later and that made the news headlines was two runs in that supercomputing seminar that all but one person boycotted by the late nineteen eighties analyzed that my discovery that practical parallel processing will become tied to technology that will underpin every supercomputer will only be accepted if I'm only if white super computer scientists think that I am white that was the museum and built the research report of my invention of practical parallel supercomputing to an independent committee of super computer scientist 2,500 miles away in San Francisco California before members of that supercomputer committee we are pointed by the president of the Computer Society that was the maddest branch of the I Triple E the acronym for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers that is the world's largest technical society you come to the Society was the worst lightest of its kind that committee of foremost experts in supercomputing we are taxed with awarding the top prize in supercomputing the essence of the forty page report that I submitted to the I Triple E and we detailed 1057 page research report and won the prize in supercomputing is this I discovered that practical parallel processing will become de facto technology that will supercomputer the news of my invention of parallel spread like wildfire and quickly headed to the dentist in many countries I discover how to harness a new internet that comprised of a global network of 65536 processors that and salud igloo and how to understand new Internet to solve the toughest mathematical problems arising in science and engineering and I discover how to solve grand challenge problems and so the 65536 times faster than one process of solving the same problem alone what is the future of the intimate I believe that in 1000 years our descendants will not ask because around them their computers will be within there instead of around them our post human descendants of the Amiga will not need computers because that will be computers that and second and enshroud planet Earth our human descendants will be half humans and processors that are killed or disabled in science fiction movies i won the top award in supercomputing in 1989 and I did so for my contributions to the development of the practical parallel supercomputer after years of being denied credit for my inventions I learned to take the credit for my invention of practical parallel processing technology that means every supercomputer I owe it all to keep it for my contributions that was the vision I spoke up for myself back in 1989 she kissed my contributions to success breeds jealousy and business becoming a famous super computer scientist was like putting elack's package on my back like any prominent black inventor of the past I've had doctors who envied me and work tirelessly and spread my science in 1989 I won the top prize in the field of supercomputing I'm super discovering how to solve a grand challenge problem and specifically for figuring out how to solve the 5500 and then six processors in 1989 I was the super computer scientist behind my discovery of how to unless a new parallel supercomputer and how to use that new technology to solve the toughest real-world problems such as free dynamical calculations called generous tabulation models of atmospheric and oceanic flows that I used to predict global warming and petroleum reserve oscillators that I used to recover more oil and natural gas that I buried what my deep with and within an oil field that is the size of a town as the inventor of practical parallel supercomputing I was the only person that could anybody the first public lecture on such an equation is the inventor created groups of my ownership I was the only super computer scientist or the nineteen eighties that can show someone else how to massively parallel process and how to do so across a new planet that is a new global network of 65,536 processors that command of materials and knowledge of mathematics physics and that control the emails of my system for binary thousand processors dead by lectures of massively parallel supercomputers both authoritative as well as compelling as we start bad medicine I out because I was the only person that record the world's fastest super did so while serving the initial boundary value problem of mathematical physics that achievement was the reason I was the only person that won the top prize in the field of supercomputer and won it alone and did so when up to 50 passes are teaming up to win that prize a century ago the average st. pepper had only one auto today we are weeks and six hunters with pepper only experimental discovery of the Higgs boson had 3061 full discoverers on the Higgs boson a possum is an elementary particle that is believed to be responsible for all physical forces for my country of bed Nigeria Popovic cannot be produced by starting from huge deposits for a huge deposit of crude oil and natural gas and discovered it in so cuto of the far northeastern region of Nigeria poverty alleviation cannot be achieved from recovering only 50% of that deposit and then paying 40% of that 50% as exploration company discover economic growth for all police in nations such as Nigeria resides in having the brainpower to end the remaining 70% of the potential revenue from the Niger Delta oil fields of the southeastern region of Nigeria by Africans be at the frontier of human knowledge and African speed world we are African innovators could imagine the unimaginable discoveries and inventions to science and technology but new songs and movies to the entertainment industry the invention is to technology but the new song is to music inventions easier for everybody discoveries make the world a better place and a more knowledgeable one i'm a marveland the internet has many fathers and mothers as well as ants that did not invent a new Internet the father of the Internet should at least invent a new Internet I am called a father of the internet because I am the only father of the internet that invented a new internet but in 1989 I was in the news headlines because I was the first person to discover how do parallel process real-world problems and how to do so across millions of a millions of processes that we are tightly coupled to each other in parallel supercomputing across my new internet that was a new global network of processes that we are identical to each other it was important knowledge is to fully understand how to control an honest process that was within my global network of processors each processor operator Xcode operating system in 1989 I bet the news headlines when I recorded the maximum possible speed increase across my example of 65,536 commodity of the shelf processors that parallel processed speed increase of a factor of 65536 that was then considered impossible led to my discovery that parallel supercomputers will build in situ technology that will makes computers faster and make supercomputers fastest I discovered practical parallel supercomputing and this soon by making a one-to-one correspondence and metaphorical market and doing so from the vertices of the hypercube to each processor and by making another one to one correspondence from the bi-directional edges of the hypercube to my email wires unlike your cube my hypercube was defined in 16 dimensional hyperspace and therefore has to rest to power 16 or 64 by 11,000 vertices and 16 times as many or one binary medium by the rational edges compliment 65 every thousand technical processes to work together to forecast the weather was in the room of science fiction I would have dismissed as an insanity and dismissed when I began programming supercomputers back on June 20 1974 that Southwest campus with caballus Oregon United States but on the photo July 1989 in Los Alamos New Mexico United States I discovered how to talk that science fiction into nonfiction that is used to forecast the weather for your evening news as the first person to make the news headlines for discovering practical parallel supercomputing I visualized the vertices and edges of a hypercube that wedged under the surface of my hyper sphere I invented the filling a marvel Internet as corresponding to we could out silk word that was my topological metaphor for the appearance of my new internet that has a new global network of 65536 processors that we are identical to each other and that we are tightly coupled to each other the new supercomputer and the new internet we are like tightly contained prints with only one super breed in 1989 I was new surprised because I discovered practical parallel supercomputing and invented as the vital technology but now that means every supercomputer and that enabled me to compute faster and across my new internet and to compute fast adder and supercomputer that ever existed I envisioned my new virtual supercomputer as my new internet my first visions of my new internet began as that shape an outline of a plant global network of processors that we are connected with email wires that [Music] it's it's also without the as the first parallel supercomputers artist I was not trying to see with my naked eyes any of my 65536 processors 4006 bi-directional evil wires that married my commodity processors together I've been suited for a second scribed a globe in hyperspace in contrast in the sense I saw my new Internet in its entirety when you saw our planet Earth he needs a parity and understood that it is not flat and do so with your mind but by instead looming around the earth in a spacecraft I visualize how to email my 65,536 computer codes as well as ability as many sets of data that I used much cool physics call of my initial bar divided problems that was how I treated them each of my 65,536 processes and visualize how to continuously pump my email messages across my new internet visualize each of my five subject lines and haven't no basic body and as traversing across my new global network of 1,048,576 even wires that outline my new Internet in my mind I sketched my silhouette as deduction of a new internet that encircles the earth that shadow was created by the Sun the partial differential equations that I invented the most advanced expressions in calculus those partial differential equations are far more abstract than the quadratic equation and for that reason if a person cannot screw put them across the blackboard or sub them across one aborts the system of 90 partial differential equations that I invented are abstract and de facto invincible however I use those partial differential equations as by extreme skilled computational test beds for inventing a new computer a new supercomputer and a new Internet in the lecture series of my contributions to mathematics that I posted on my on youtube.com slash em Iowa and described improves rather than in abstract mathematics how I coded my initial boundary value problem that we are granted that we are governed by a system of partial differential equations of calculus and I did so differently I did not could my initial boundary value problem for only one processor as was done by other computational mathematicians I paradigm shifted by parallel supercomputing my initial boundary value problem and doing so across a new internet that is a new global network of 64 by hundred thousand processors that solitary act of repetitive column for each processor that Frank and I mind that new internet was my form of meditation the very essence of my own sample of processors was to use a bills to weave together my new global network of processors and invent a new internet that is one polska acid which was super computer that is not a computer person in my mind those 64 bad hundred thousand slowest processors we are de facto the fastest supercomputer that was my metaphor for a futuristic talking antic internet that is I thought my new computer as my new internet and vice versa I wish lies my email messages as traversing across the interior of the sixteenth dimensional hyperspace and along bidirectional edges of the hypercube in that I versus I give from to that and sample and give form to it as an amide force in internet for me that new mobile network of processors we are tightly coupled to each other that we are equal distances apart from each other and that shared knowledge we do each other became my mother sighs an abstracted internet that is is singular which was supercomputer I was in the news in 1989 and thereafter because I was the first person to parallel process and cross a new Internet that was a new global network of 65,536 processors that shared not between them I was the first person to technically discover that exists put differently my estimation is this it's science fiction parallel computing across the entire planet the planet could become the nonfiction of descendants I was the first person to discover how to parallel process across [Music] the planet internet for that invention that was conceived back in 1974 and completed in 1959 whatever I do freeze father of the Internet is mentioned the first name that Google suggests is a marvel the contributions to the development of the computer that are the Soviet of scruples are inventions that are paradigm shifting or that change the way we look at the computer the objective criteria for measuring called bushels to development is fixed namely the fastest competition that was executed by any means necessary my fastest competition that I discover on the 4th of July 1989 was executed by parallel supercomputing a Grand Challenge initial boundary value problem of actual skill of rotational physics absorbing it across a new Internet that was sixty five thousand five hundred six processors that were tightly coupled to each other to each other apart from each other what that shared not between each other my scientific discovery that were called a fourth of July 1989 was that parallel processing will become de facto technology that we need important supercomputer super that discovery made the news headlines because it will change the way we look at the computer I discovered that we should look at the warden computer not as a computing machinery but you never before in the race is supercomputer horsepower by parallel processing is computational across its videos of processors that were tightly coupled to each other with each processor operating its own operating system for me philippe amar valley that technological breakthrough in massively parallel processor was the supercomputer news headlines that crossed the sea from San Francisco California to Elisha Nigeria and cross the sea because the new grounds of supercomputing across 65536 that a couple processors that will instantly and second [Music] because it was a skilled persons employed in the IT sector the supercomputer Japan because but I also because those sub-saharan Africa Sandvik receptor was had by any research laboratories we are both supercomputing beside was conducted in 1989 I discovered that a grand challenge problem come divided into videos of smaller less challenging problems and then my father discovered that I could use as many babies to puzzle together those small problems the original grand challenge problem that I could then solve across my new internet that is my new global network of as many processors that each operated its own operating system and that it should not with other nearest neighboring processors I'm Emily but in 1989 I was in the news headlines because I discovered how the slowest processors can be parallel processed and has to solve was it possible to solve problems and solved it previously impossible speeds my discovery whether they need for the parallel supercomputer my discovery of practical parallel supercomputing meant the news headlines because it was a key to discovering and of the new computer and new internet the use of 64,000 human computers to parallel process the weather was published as a science fiction story back off and published in potato what a tradition process the contribution from fiction to nonfiction so for 67 years or one of 92 parallel processing was the big unanswered question for that was to answer it was described as the great challenge problem or the field of super for 67 years on one of 1922 but particle scientists attempted to serve toughest initial boundary value problems and to solve them by dividing each into smaller problems that could be parallel processed with one problem to one processor correspondence unmarked under 1 million identical processors that we are tightly coupled to each other until my discovery of the 4th of July 1989 progress in solving such grand challenge problems and solving them by parallel processing death was a modest factor of eight that factor was erroneously depleted by Gauss law of diminishing returns expected from the increase in the speed of supercomputers my contribution to supercomputing is this I figured out how parallel supercomputing works and that discovery changed will we look at the supercomputer that occupies the space of a soccer field and change the way we look at the fastest computer that can be placed on your desk the computer is a machinery that performs fast calculations the massively parallel supercomputers is the fastest computer Philip among Valley Internet is a global network of quality of the shelf processors that we are identical to each other that you can tell me conclude to each other more distance apart from each other from each other that shared not between each other each processor operated its own operating system my contributions to knowledge is this I discovered a new internet that is a new network of processors or tiny computers that is not a computer per se but that is a new that is a supercomputer to factor who invented the internet the Internet has many fathers and mothers as well as only one father of the internet invented a new Internet the father of the Internet should at least contribute new technological knowledge pertains to the Internet and to so by inventing a new internet I am called a father of the Internet because I am the only father of the internet that invented a new Internet I was asked when he gets over how you want to be remembered what's been around the longest will stay around the longest 1 million years ago our pre-human ancestors counted on the fingers and toes I believe that in a million years our push to my descendants will count across yeah yeah menial Internet I will be remembered the longest for my contributions to computational mathematics that change the way we come and change it from counting only one thing at a time to counting abilities at once I will be remembered for my contributions that changed with we looked at the computer and changed it from one isolated process of computing only one thing at a time - 1 million processors supercomputer but a parallel processed solution problems we develop additions from 3,000 years ago if only if T our contributions to mathematics is still relevant we remember Euclid as the father of geometry because the geometry because geometry is taught in schools we remember D we will remember the computational mathematician that change the way we count since prehistoric times our pre-human ancestors counted only one thing at a time I discovered that we could solve real world problems by counted a bit of these at once or by parallel supercomputers mathematical problems we will remember the father of the Internet if only if the Internet is still relevant I am the only father of the internet that invented a new Internet I will be remembered as the first parallel super computer scientist that came of age on the 4th of July 1989 that is my legacy and my contribution to human knowledge that changed the world of computers I was adopted by the United Nations in talk it's calary of prominent refugees the United Nations is to put up posters of civic about one to refugee camps in Kenya Rwanda and Cielo and I was getting emails from ghost refugee camps invited me to visit their caps what is it about Valley Fair merciful I became known by word of mouth and as follows it 90-89 a 12 year old wrote a school inventor report on the contributions of Philip about money to the development of the computer that school inventor report is discussed with her classmates in active or during conversations with her younger friends the following year those young girl friends are more likely to act school event of the post of Imam Ali done work of March reading of school inventory reports and its stickiness is more effective than media nations often students forget how to spell made Finnick Amara but they have no problem remembering to search for the Nigerian who invented the fastest of the African who invented a new internet that is a new global network of processors I became known yeah newspaper a magazine articles that were published after my discovery of practical parallel processing I discovered practical parallel supercomputing and discovered it as the factor technology that would make the supercomputer super the first audience to discover my story you know American screeching the writing school reports on dt3 most mathematicians and their contributions to mathematics all great scientists in history all great inventors and inventions some of those children go to school reports on Philip Emily and his circuit path because their father or mother would a school report of the second audience that discovered my contributions to science we are 90 days and Africans in the continent and the Diaspora shortly after the Christmas of 1989 in San Francisco California the office of the largest technical organization called the I Triple E as well as some other institutions you should press release announced that I discovered practical parallel supercomputing and discovered it as the fight through technology that will power every supercomputer and that I had invented how to unless 65536 processes to solve the toughest initial boundary value problems arising in mathematical physics and that I have discovered how to solve that one challenge and solve it at the warmest fastest supercomputers knees and that I had solved the problem then on heart of Steel of 1 billion floating-point arithmetic operations per second those 1989 press releases of my discovery of practical supercomputing and I began for media interviews for the decade preceding 1989 I was marked a bit fun when I want parallel supercomputer but as I became famous those factor super computer scientists at work had made fun of me and that refused to work chatting with me and become my co-discoverer of practical parallel supercomputers turned around and insisted that they will now become my new best friend and that I should allow them to become my co-inventors the abortive was this if they had collaborated with me and it's so for only one minute they would have gone to the gods to fight for his share of the credit for my invention of practical parallel supercomputers and for the invention that I had already invented and invented without any contribution from there in the world style of supercomputing the conventional supercomputer solves Grand Challenge initial boundary value problems horizon in extreme scale computational physics and takes forever to sew them in this step-by-step fashion that is called serial computing on the 3rd of July 1989 I discovered a new way of solving those nine challenge problems namely that smaller less challenging initial boundary value problems and then simultaneously solving them across processors in a group that was represented by hyperspace he might run for parallel supercomputing experiment news headlines in 1989 I challenged initial problem across an oil field that is one buyer deep and that is the size of the town I did so by dividing that oil field into 2 raised to power c or 65,536 smaller oil fields I build my super computer codes and gap companion data that I used to submit each of my smaller oil fields and the door and fro 16-bit long email addresses and I build them a lot 16 times 2 raised to power system email wires that is I build my data and goods across a processor we didn't buy new global network of 65 hundred thousand processors that require distances apart and that we are on the surface of it look in the 16th dimension that was how I solved the Grand Challenge problem of supercomputing and how I discovered how parallel process mix you compute that faster makes the supercomputer fastest and discovered how to always manufacture the world's fastest computer and with the technology of massively parallel processing I was born on August 23 1954 in his small Hospital in the British West African colony of Nigeria the first house that I lived in was the boys bottom of his new house for Salmons that was associated with a big house that was at the intersection of MSO Street and about Addison Road accurate negative inner British West Africa my mother I gotta Mr Bond had just celebrated 15 and mid sixties before I was born the precursor to the modern computer was 8 years old when I was born in 1954 the British colony of Nigeria had a population of 40 million and then had only 150 lawyers 160 medical doctors and one trained engineer when I was born the word computer was not indy neidell vocabulary even in the u.s. the word supercomputer was not in the vocabulary of computer programmers of 1967 the world supercomputer was first used in 1967 when I said put on put the internet I mean the global network of computers that encircles planet Earth when I say what output an intern I mean a global network of processes that encircles igloo I use the word Internet to describe my global network of commodity of the Shelf Assessors that they're tightly coupled to each other that shared not in between each other I visualize the emails that I sent to I received from each of my 64 500 thousand processors as having traveled a lot by 1,048,576 t-bill wires that I visualize as extra 50 dimensional hyper surface of a group that is a hyper sphere in my in my sixteenth dimensional particle hypothesis the actual blog establish a model that is used for climate studies that inspired my invention of my new internet that is a that is that is that new global network of 65,536 processors was also defined around the globe in three dimensional physical space the geophysical flows of Earth and water are the cause of global warming simulations that are become of global warming simulations we are boredom by using is set of laws of physics that always includes the second law of motion of physics that was discovered three hundred and ten years ago the second law of motion was encoded into a system of coupled nonlinear time dependent and three-dimensional partial differential equations that is what eyes and reduce to a system of equations of algebra that a parallel process across 64 binary thousand commodity off-the-shelf processors that we are technical to each other and that shared not in between each other that is I discovered how to simulate the planetary motions on the egg and water that enshroud the heads that is a group of 7970 and half miles in diameter I discovered how to submit and parallel process around a new global network of processes that was how I invented and said would eat glue and how I invented the internet and used it to solve a grand challenge initial boundary value problem and shrouded in blue namely planet Earth it's my medical physics call that Grand Challenge problem is an extreme skilled computational physics school developed for the high resolution simulation that must be used to predict global warming in the geometry of higher dimensions the globe is defined and I find in hyperspace that in turn is defined as a set of points at equal distance from a given point called center in my physical experiment that revealed the world's fastest supercomputer and revealed it on July 4 1989 I visualized by thousands of around a mathematical glue it is 16 dimension that was projected two-dimensional surface of a physical blow in the third dimension a hyper sphere that I used to define my to raise to power system commodity of share processors is my generalization of this straight to the 16th dimension I was evil wires in the wire to one edge correspondence [Music] by comparison the everyday emails a man once said to you computer that travel from a jeweler to the United States was routed across the glue or the Internet that internet and second planet that is igloo ask 7970 admirers in contrast mighty bills around my global network of processors we are automated and synchronized across an example of 65,536 processes that initialize as a new internet in the 16th dementia I wish realized my new internet as defined across the surface of a hyperspace that is a globe in higher dimensions that in turn tablet and shrouded in hypercube that is a good in higher dimensions I visualized 16 times 2 raised to power 16 or 100 million dimensional edges has projected up to its 15 dimensional hyper surface the honeycomb was the first of my to diagrammatic expressions of my new people networks of the share processors that we are depth good to each other that were involved distance apart from each other in which each process operated its own operating system to others my honeycomb and hyperbole diagonals represented a supercomputer but I emphasized that it was also a new internet that is a new global network of processors the tiny subscribe a globe in three-dimensional space and in 16 dementia adversities respectively that distinction was PI a bottle those two inventions were the reasons I became Mossad foe and a recurring decimal in discussions on the contributions of the black man that invented a new internet click among my I am the only father of the internet that invented a new internet the inventor discovered the possibilities in the world of the impossible my what for a never-before-seen massively parallel supercomputers that was also a new internet two-factor was to discover the possibilities in the world of the impossible or to assure that the impossible to compute is in fact possible to complete the quest for new knowledge is walking at night in the forest and doing so with it did not my sibling parallel supercomputer research was my personal quest for the new way of the never-before-seen and sample of millions of processors that were identical to each other that report distances apart from each other find a new internet that is a virtual supercomputer to factor in the nineteen seventies and eighties I walked alone along that path and I was only guided by it did not one nkrumah said socialism with our science is right and said for whatever but what never won and chroma also said we first neither East nor West will face forward I said that science moves humanity forward ever back on the 4th of July 1989 I discovered that a new internet that is comprised of a new global network ups of the slowest 65536 processors can be harnessed and used to solve the toughest problems arising in science and engineering and used to solve those problems faster any supercomputer China copy the massively parallel supercomputers technology I'm older than it from my processors to its walls fastest supercomputer that is followed by Ted Binion six hundred and forty nine thousand six hundred processors parallel processor is the crown jewel inside every supercomputer my discovery of parallel supercomputers helped China to assemble some of the world's fastest supercomputers discover technology however the rest to build the world's fastest supercomputer is the rest'll knowledge not the risk to the moon my discovery of practical parallel supercomputers that occurred on the 4th of July 1989 put this super into the supercomputer my discovery of practical parallel supercomputing in psyche into having ten million six hundred and forty nine thousand six hundred election police stations in Nigeria and that reduction of election time from four centuries of time to election though barely twenty minutes is the basic principle that change the way we understand how supercomputer the discovery of practical parallel supercomputers that occurred on the 4th of July 1989 oh good our eyes because because if you did yourself driving car that enables it to train itself over time and that's how the new parallel supercomputer with you I'm Philippe the modern supercomputer has existed for three quarters of a century the vector supercomputer has existed since the 1970s in 1989 in fact a supercomputer had a billion dollars in sale today in fact a supercomputer has been replaced with the parallel supercomputer that in turn has a method size of 20 billion dollars a year a massively parallel supercomputers that is anita by destroying board will cost 1.25 billion dollars in reward computational physics the supercomputer that cost 1.25 billion dollars is an inexpensive alternative to physical experiments that range from morning the flow of blood through dependent vascular system to stimulate the flow of natural gas that are flowing for my deep and fluid underneath the surface of the edge I'm flowing across and fluid and fluid across the surface of the edge I'm fleeing across a porous medium that is the size of intern it is far cheaper to simulate a petroleum reservoir I do so without constructed a Cooper's on physical scale model of the Niger Delta production on a field of the southeastern region of Nigeria the actual skilled computational physicists don't actively inject water into the petroleum reservoir the computational physicists this what if simulation scenarios and bless that game with a parallel process simulations on the bull-type phase flows of oil gas solution simulation of gas but in 1989 I won the top prize in the field of supercomputing and I want it for my contributions the parallel supercomputer be proof that my discovery was groundbreaking was that it met the news headlines I was highlighted in the June 20 1990 issue of The Wall Street Journal prior to my discovery of of parallel supercomputing the court on the 4th of July 1989 I did not have a record of mucho of making let us say big discoveries but in the nineteen eighties computational physicists me chapter my research on the massively parallel supercomputers and did so in part because they could not understand how I was able to message past the fleet dynamics course I do so - I'm from my 65,536 processors because message passing was unknown and was not in the textbooks of the nineteen eighties my parallel supercomputing research was rejected by research mathematicians on the grounds that it was not his subfield of mathematics my parallel supercomputing research was rejected by beside physicists on the grounds that it was not a soft field of physics computer science rejected my parallel supercomputing besides and did so because it's computational fluid dynamics components such as modeling the weather above and below the surface of it was also got his subfield of computer science that rejection was the reason I was the only program across of 64 binary thousand commodity of the shelf processors that were tightly coupled to each other that shared not typically each other and that were identical to each other but most importantly I understood that I had to record a suite in piece of a factor of 65,000 I have a good my new internet was a new supercomputer de facto that is a times more complex than is singular supercomputer that was powered by only one processor that was not a member of processors my discovery that's across processors is my contribution to the development of the modern supercomputer my contribution change the way we do computational physics and change it from sequentially processed small-scale computational physics to parallel processed extremely skilled computational physics my contribution changed when we compute and change it from slowly computing incidence to supercomputing my contribution to the development of the fastest supercomputer change the way we compute change it from counting only one at a time to my contribution to parallel supercomputing is a paradigm shift in computer science parallel supercomputing was vaguely mentioned as a science fiction but on February 1 1922 and in the book title weather prediction by numerical process for seven decades thereafter parallel supercomputing remained in science fiction until I discovered it on the 4th of July 1989 in Los Alamos New Mexico negative 6 my contribution to the development of the computer is this supercomputer from science fiction books to science textbooks I was in my confidence as a parallel super computer scientist did not come from fact or super computer scientist who in the first place believe that a massively parallel supercomputers will forever remain a huge waste of everybody's time my confidence that I could solve the toughest problem arising in supercomputing came from within me and from the command of materials that I possessed confidence comes from being able to pay and we most knowledgeable progress does not always come from always be right progress comes from not fearing to be wrong there is is science fact is easy fact I was asked if friend why he left to Madison to become a fiction writer he said John uneasy deals with facts while fiction deals with truth in the nineteen seventies and eighties my quest for the fastest supercomputer that was dedicated in the unknown world of massively parallel supercomputers was for a scientific truth not a science fiction my new parallel processed way of counting won't be noticed at once and have crossed as many processors is a mathematical truth not a mathematical fiction the writer is a generalist the word Chisos words the noblest describes the human condition but it's the scientific Discoverer that changes the human condition after us yes on what up to 20 1974 of programming 16 supercomputers I knew that at a [Music] conference in San Francisco California I did not invent a super computer overnight should we produce science modern literature literature these facts while science explains literature give us parallel processes as a science fiction story and it's soon on February 1 1922 well it was science that time that science fiction into nonfiction and bit soon or denied for 1989 in Los Alamos New Mexico United States he did I'm pleased that I discovered that parallel processing will forever remain in fact technology makes computers faster and make super fastest the another da Vinci was at the crossroad of science and art the contributions to knowledge of great scientists like Isaac Newton Charles Darwin and Marie Curie can we have gravitas than the writings of great novelists like Ernest Hemingway Charles Dickens and the mysteries of the universe kanna's heavier gravitas than telling the story of the bessel this is the reason that about 100 scientists have the portrait on commences but William Shakespeare that is considered to be the greatest writer of all time it's not on any currency an airport or hospital or university can be named after his historical figure in science but not after instant configure individual international airports I meant after Nikola Tesla Copernicus but known are named after William Shakespeare the memorialization of words lacks the depth of data scientists such as Albert Einstein or political figures like Nelson Mandela one is not as important as the internet the world loop would confess that his work is useless or not alpha the story teller cannot become the hero of the you easy it is basically the biographical writers feel his reflected glory that is achieved through writing about the human specimen rather than doing what with a famous to do with after my night eat but did in Nigeria I received a scholarship letter from Homewood Oregon United States that was dated September 1973 that scholarship for me to enter into the United States I received that scholarship not because I was good-looking but because I was good in mathematics and physics that first and subsequent scholarships were renewed for 16 years and renewed across six American universities in February 1991 the last of those 60 versus it's something nobody before it's true century history that university deported is special issue of its flagship politician that it's described as one of the world's smartest humans the essence of that story spread like wildfire and his repeated decades later and across social media and whatever I started a conversation is about the world's smartest vessels when I was five years old but in Gibara 1960 I enrolled in Sepik experimental school circle a western region Nigeria but in five year or his frontier of mathematical knowledge is the arithmetical tax table that was unknown to him what was noon two partitions that need five thousand years Kenya and I locked the valley of the River Nile of Africa when I was nine years old back in January 1964 I enrolled in st. John's primary school it was Richard Nigeria for the nine-year-old his frontier of mathematical knowledge was the quadratic equation of algebra the quadratic equation taught in high school was denied over the past four thousand years back to Africa up in the 1960s post-colonial Africa I had no sense of the history of my inventions I had no sense I had no sense of who invented I had no idea that thirty years later I would be in major US newspapers for inventing nine partial differential equations of calculus and for inventing the as many companion finite difference equations of algebra that in turn puts meets those partial differential equations as a small boy growing up in the elegance of post-colonial Nigeria I presumed that the tax table in my a medical textbook and the quadratic equation in my algebra textbook I've been known to textbook others since time immemorial I presume that Adam and Eve study the quadratic equation as a teenager in Nigeria my eldest and be funny was that the arithmetical times table and algebraic quadratic equation did not spontaneously create themselves as I grew I learned that the partial differential equation of calculus we are not going to our distant ancestors hunted wildlife and adductors and then that CarGurus was invented three centuries country begins ago a partial differential equation was invented many a century as a small boy growing up in Nigeria I had no sense then it was wrong I had no sense yet is very 4.6 billion years for I had no sense that our universe is 13.8 billion years for I have no sense that humans had many years as a small boy in Nigeria I thought that the break knowledge kept fossilized with Dinosaurs then we had the monstrous missiles that will be added soon from 252 billion years ago to 66 million years ago the contributions to science of scientists born in Africa will increase during the 21st century and the reason is that a mid 21st century one in two children will be born in Africa my country of birth Nigeria has 200 billion people and it's more than half the population of the United States and could be as far as populous as the United States or hundred million people by the year 2050 in year 2050 Africa could the factor become the face of humanity for that reason the African child born today will become in Estonia of tomorrow's technology Nigeria needs more scientists than the United States if Africa has 60% of the world's arable land why then is Africa important food from Europe the answer is that Africa lacks the knowledge that attends to Science and Technology we have African inventors but no African inventions is there a school subject called African science is there an African quadratic equation is there an African medicine of African magic or is there an African law of physics or an African supercomputer why is Philip a Marvel famous why is Philipp Emanuel important to the world of computers in 1989 I was in the news as the African supercomputer Chile's that one top u.s. price I was in the news because I discovered how to produce the world's fastest supercomputers and how to manufacture them from a light and sample of the world's slowest processors that we are identical to each other that many more distances apart from each other and that shared not between each other that discovery from my parallel supercomputing experiment of July 4 1989 is the foundation of the one a supercomputer it's in parallel the discovery of practical parallel supercomputing added a new pillar for the never-ending quest for faster and faster super computers I discovered practical parallel supercomputing as the new technology that will underpin computers and supercomputers to the finest frontier of supercomputer knowledge was a surreal feeling that gave me goose bumps of Los Alamos New Mexico United States I saw for the first time a never-before-seen supercomputer that virtual supercomputer was beyond the computer and it's not a computer person it is a new Internet the factor Y is a marvel importance to the world of mathematics studying mathematics and understanding the partial differential equation I invented a new system of partial differential equations that was the cover story news top publication in research mathematics abstract campus a life skill algebra we have a mathematical physics car of my super computer convention my contribution to body mathematical knowledge and absolute skin computational physics is this I constructor algebraic algorithms and I used to derive a new system of finite difference equations of algebra that approximated at finite pieces my new partial differential equations of calculus that was defined at innocence and therefore we had infinite calculations to solve its associated initial boundary value problem exactly what metric news headlines was that I philip Mr Boddy discover how to crank up my computations and email communications and do so by 16 levels and by computing and communicating the answers across a new internet and doing whatever we did to rest of our 16,000 central processing units within as many computers since 1989 I give lectures in which I explain the details of how I discovered the world's fastest supercomputer first lectures where will you please allow me to present a one-minute version of the book of my 200 our lecture series of my contributions in the 1980s I invented complex email communication primitives each consisted of a pair of fact subject line and distorted line emails each email was addressed to 65,000 506 or to resto our 1616 big long email addresses each email contained a computational fluid dynamics code that each source and a giant seamless Cohasset central processing unit stat 65,000 fans more powerful than one original city you visualize five thousand initial part you find the problems and eventually problem and setting them up like ducks in a shooting gallery my quest was to discover how to talk with those dogs over because I process improves some knowledge of gas technology is lost as I translated my new knowledge into a scientific report that is further reduced to is to a school inventory report of the 12 year old in which respect the laws of motion of physics we are discovered twist centuries and three decades ago the technique of carpools was also invented this activist and political sicko the partial differential equation of calculus was invented essentially my contribution to super fast but multiple complications was the description of my new partial differential equations of the publication in the world of mathematics namely the mathematicians newspaper called shyam news the supercomputers of the past sequentially process the floating-point arithmetic operations that must be executed to serve grand challenge problems arising in STEM fields in contrast the super because of today parallel processes the toughest problems by sabbatino problems at once and that's an example of electronic processes I'm using sumo tennis and cooperatively saw a great challenge problem is not magical similar to also use it and assemble of one we done human computers I'm using it to challenge problem parallel processor was fast efficient when it was first theorized simplest oven 64,000 initial bounded by the problems of my microphysics was erased in the booktitle weather prediction by numerical process is science fiction and parallel process challenge problem of 1932 was defined as 64,000 human computers parallel processing the weather for the whole clue that was the science fiction because the general circulation rll processed morning of today that is used to foresee my soup put a quest that began on 20 1974 in Oregon United States and Mexico United States was to make that science fiction of 1922 in reality I was in the news headlines when I met that parallel supercomputer discovery and did so by this so 67 years later the big job in this speed of the supercomputer of today from my discovery of parallel supercomputing that occurred on the 4th of July 1989 parallel supercomputing or doing many things at once is the vital technology that underpins the world's fastest computers to invent the parallel supercomputer was like gazing across the centuries dancing across the millennia and starting for our post human descendants of yay medium I was drunk that in 65 thousand years a super intelligent five-year-old will be a parallel process sidewalk a half human a half machine but yet that was human cyborg had no sense of history of who invented his a parallel process itself if the history of science repeats itself the names of these inventors will be lost in the mists of time the quest for how to massively parallel process across and assemble of 1 million processors was the rim of science fiction for seven degrees parallel supercomputing was unorthodox and staggering supercomputer that changed the way we look at the modern computer before practical parallel supercomputer was discovered we need up because a sense of the supercomputer as an isolated processor that is not a member of an example of processors but as perhaps made good on a new internet that is a planet with super-sized supercoppa devotion after I discovered practical parallel supercomputing I looked to be network of processors and to be a new internet that would be a politicized supercomputer woofle and seconded I was in the news in 1989 because the parallel supercomputer that I discovered was a game changer that change became of supercomputing the bird six the same song as it's my bad human progress of course when we sing a better song our body fully described by contributions to the development of the modern supercomputer that is the world's fastest computer and I described my contributions I am African that is used to solve real world problems and that is technology that underpins supercomputer Philip a male computer is a human invention that is my contribution to knowledge they say my contributions to mathematics is this I discovered how to solve Grand Challenge problems known as the boost computation intensive problems arising in calculus and algebra the parallel supercomputing solution of this grand challenge problems has large impact on humanity I was 34 years old on the 4th of July 1989 when I discovered how to execute for the 7203 floating-point arithmetic operations per second where CPU that not a member of an example of 65536 processes I was in the news headlines as the African supercomputer genius that one top us prize and won it for discovering how to uh Ness the world's slowest processors and use them to execute the world's fastest supercomputer calculations and also execute them when solving the toughest real-world initial boundary value problems arising in computational physics abstract calculus and extreme scale algebra I totaled those calculations across my new internet that was my new global network of 65,536 processors I thought out those calculations on the 4th of July 1989 and it's so to discover the world's fastest computation of 3.1 billion calculations per second that ultra-fast calculation that I executed across that new intellect meant the news headlines because I am failed the new parallel process solution to the grand challenge problems arise in stem favors to experimentally discover parallel supercomputers requires a mathematical maturity that includes knowing the partial differential equation and knowing it put forward and backward the reason is that the partial differential equation or rather it's finite difference or the breadth approximation is the most recurring decimal inside the parallel supercomputer like physical maturity needed to win a marathon race with multiple Authority neither [Music] and that is my country in 1989 I was in the news I was in the news because I discover how across central processing units that shared naughty between each other as a 10 year old walking to school along baba Baba Street Nigeria I could not explain why I had to learn the quadratic equation nor did I understand how the quadratic equation will help solve the economic problems of Nigeria to all students at st. John's primary school Nigeria solving the quadratic equation was many mental gymnastics that I'm a real-life application to all students it seemed like the quadratic equation was invented - mentally torturous first 25 years from 1964 from Nigeria to Los Alamos New Mexico United States I became the subject of school infantile reports in the US and was so because my experimental discovery of practical parallel supercomputer was the new knowledge that was not in computer science textbooks that can be up to 1 billion times faster than all supercomputers I am studied in American schools for my contribution to the development of the computer I am the subject of school reports on inventors in part because the quadratic equation or did increase my particle maturity that maternity was a prerequisite to solving the ones impossible to solve partial differential equations and to supercomputing the solution or the companion like skill or G Bragg equations that must be solved prior to discovery and I was in supercomputing Ribble who was programming massively parallel supercomputers are doing so in an orthodox and cut the intuitive message pass away I message passed across processors and I emailed not to please the conventional super computer scientist that was only at home with a supercomputer that represented all paradigm of supercomputing my quintessential question that I pose to the millions of yyk students that take my math test that we are conducted by the West African examination council he'll become Ghana silly alone Liberia and Nigeria and that I also pose to the winners of jump students in Nigeria that take mathematics tests that was conducted by the joint admissions a matriculation board is this what is the importance of abstract mathematics my answer to that with the essential question is this mathematics is the bedrock of the Nigerian economy I studied mathematics in the United States and in so full-time and studied it across but because my general circulation of modeling for for seen otherwise of foreseeable global warming demanded that I could defy the laws of physics into the partial differential equations of calculus and into a system of equations of algebra the laws of physics that I could refined into mathematical equations including the second law of motion the law of conservation of mass the law of conservation of second chemical species the first law of thermodynamics the equation of state and in radiative transfer equations as a research computational mathematician that am but on his solitary quest for the fastest supercomputer that is also a new Internet my focus was on how to parallel process and solve those nine challenge problems that are the toughest problems horizon in high-performance computation but particle particle physics back in the 1970s by such for the parallel processed solutions of initial Bhadrapada problems of mathematical physics was worked and trashed as an unrealistic fishing expenditure parallel supercomputing was the formidable foe it is seven decade long battle to solve the most computation intensive problems arising in STEM fields the parallel supercomputer is everything of the way you conventional superconductor a grand challenge problem parallel processing opens the door to the Wadden supercomputer I missed it possible to solve once impossible problems after my discovery of parallel processing baby news headlines on what of July 4 1989 every super computer manufacturer in the creative parallel processing into its new supercomputers parallel processing is the crown jewel of this supercomputer when I announced my discovery of practical parallel processing and when I did so on the fourth of July 1989 it wasn't around and as a breakthrough in supercomputing at first my discovery was work dismissed I rejected as a terrible mistake the reason my discovery of practical parallel supercomputers was rejected was that I didn't look like Albert Einstein I was born and raised in the heart of sub-saharan Africa instead of born and raised in Europe back then so offended that I became if it was super the scientists and because knowledge of physics who was born in Nigeria sub-saharan Africa I did not receive the parcel of that was given to the immigrants to become physicist Albert Einstein within closed doors of the super computing community I become a divining rod for this Scott sunlight me some don't I was in line in the sand back in 1989 instead of celebrating my discovery of practical because parallel supercomputing was already kavadi heads of the twenty five thousand facto soup I was I was [Music] fast forward addicted from which originated in South West Campus with cabanas Oregon in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States I'm due to 20 1974 I was an 18 year old that was programming a confessional supercomputer but in December 1965 when I was still in about Nigeria that supercomputer in cabaas Oregon was written as the world's fastest supercomputer it was called the first supercomputer because it was the first supercomputer that could execute 1 billion instructions a second I programmed that supercomputer from teletype machines and in basic and foreign languages Fortran was a general-purpose high-level that is natural and third generation computer language photon is the acronym for formula translation basically is the acronym for beginners all-purpose symbolic instruction good basic was a child of Fortran I was invented in 1946 in my Fortran programs my knife skill algebraic equations I was from my finite difference approximations of the new partial differential equations of calculus that I invented as a super computer programming tool Fortran enabled me to write my finite difference algebraic equations in English but in 1974 I was supercomputing from a teletype machine and punch tips and do it so from moment Oregon United States in 1975 I was super computing with a deck of foreign cars in cabaas Oregon in 1979 I was super computing from Jesse L punch cards and supercomputer in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington DC the term Jesse L is the acronym for job control language Jesse L is a scripting language that I used in the late nineteen seventies I used to instruct and run a batch job or super computer jobs that automatically execute without my interaction I used just you to submit my super computer programs for execution in backward I wrote my nuts kill computational fluid dynamics cruise of the 1970s and it's in Fortran a language that was invented tunicates area back in 1957 supercomputing in that formula translator language meant that I did not have to laboriously and code a machine language of first generation language that was used in an area I compiled Fortran into an executable language in 1974 and enya many supercoppa programmers that trend as a mathematician in I did some before I taught myself to program supercomputers so it was not a coincidence that is supercomputer that was written at 1 billion instructions per second that I began programming on June 20 1974 was 190 feet for the building that housed all the research mathematicians in Corvallis Oregon my contributions to extra skill or zebra is the reason I see myself in algebra text books that are published in the United States and Brazil what I've done in algebra textbooks used in my country of birth Nigeria in Africa when scientists became role models for black students but rarely vice versa in Europe and North America in the United States I am taught as a black model but as a result of this centuries-old and well orchestrated misrepresentations of our a genius should look the we are the kings that was founded in fire 40:1 Twitter and the songhai empire that was founded in fatigue that undeserved in 1591 all the African historical figures that were studied in schools across Africa include the early 14th century King Mansa Musa and the mid 19th century Hausa while Queen Amina of Zambia and in this century South African warrior king shaka zulu he led 20th century after this we shifted from exploits in battlefields to the fight against apartheid in South Africa that was led by Nelson Mandela I believe that but he put me to the first century African history with ships to us contributions made by Africans in the continent and in the - it was because of how to message us my to raise to power 16 initial boundary value problems and how to be associated coach I cross my 16 times 2 raised to power 16 or 1,048,576 by directions how to route the sequential solve this system of equations of algebra first robot 15 years to the 4th of July 1989 I became the first person to figure out how to harness a new in talents that is a new club for about 90,000 processors and how to use those processes to cooperatively as solve a grand challenge problem that is otherwise impossible to solve I'm invention only of course when it's for me knowledge of the parallel supercomputer that is the world's fastest computer I was the first person to cross that Mexico United States parallel supercomputing discovery the news headlines became after.can super computer genius we'd stopped us ways without parallel processing a supercomputer of today will not exist I was news headlines because I discovered how to solve the toughest problems arise in STEM fields I discovered how to solve real-world problems and how to solve them across a new planet that is de facto one seamless cohesive machinery that is a virtual supercomputer my quest for the fastest supercomputer that will compute across a new internet that is a new global network of 64 binary thousand processors began on June 20 1974 and began as a science fiction and eatery or an idea that is positively true my supercomputer quest began in Silla central processing unit that was my metaphor for the computer and that was America or the scene of an oak tree by the summer of 1974 and at age 19 I was only mentioned twice in music's first in a newspaper in Nigeria and in the United States did never see the name of a subpoena or Civic amount money first appeared in 1972 in the science column of The Daily Times of Nigeria the photographs of a 19 year old Philip a my body appeared on the column of a local newspaper and circulated in the cities of Independence Oregon United States article was published within six days after my interview that occurred on August 9 1974 taking a perspective look my quest for the fastest supercomputer began on only one central processing unit that was my metaphor for an icon or the seed of an oak tree in the United States my econ gossip into a mighty oak tree that was my metaphor for it never before seen in pallets that's the factor is supercomputer that new internet was a new global network of 64 900,000 technical and identical central processing units each processor or presence on operating system and shared with its nearest signal processors looking back to the mid nineteen seventies in Oregon United States I was coming of age and growing in my awareness abstract equations whether or jabrai called afresh what we used to discover and recover otherwise inducing cool natural gas I recovered them but my deep oil fields of the south eastern region of Nigeria Mattox is the invincible and abstract weapon that is used to fight poverty in Africa my quest for the fastest supercomputer took for the first supercomputer that could execute one minute instructions per second that was my bad Southwest campus with companies all regulated seats to the shelf processors that was in Los Alamos New Mexico United States in the nineteen seventies and eighties I was a researcher in such for the massively parallel supercomputers that iPod will become the world's fastest computer in turn the grand challenge question was this how can we execute infinite calculations and do so across a large but finite number of processors or across an Internet and complete it in finite time the answer is that it will always be impossible to execute different calculations but in 1989 I was in the news headlines because I discovered the practical answer to that grand challenge question namely I figured out how we could reduce poverty and eight years or 65,536 days of time to solution across a new internet that is a new global network of 65,536 processors that is not a supercomputer per se but that is a new an important problem that takes one with an 80 years of that solution is specified by the US government as a grand challenge problem that grand challenge problem is solvable you won't forget yes what is absorbable you one did in 1989 I was in the news headlines because I discovered how do we use that type of solution from 180 years on one computer to just across the reason I was able to solve it was impossible to solve problem was that I asked basic questions about how never-before-seen super computers could compute extraordinary minute fast and I applied that speed to serve the toughest problems crazy instead films I discovered that what a supercomputer most parallel process across billions of emitters of processors and knows who so to solve as many initial battery by the problems of mathematical physics in retrospect it's incredible that parallel supercomputing fine to technology that was what ridicule and it's not benefiting everybody parallel processing problems at once is the irreducible essence of the warren supercomputer in the nineteen seventies the parallel supercomputer was both a medical and dismiss as useless and clumsy that was division I conducted my research my parallel super is a kilo I programmed supercomputers alone because it was believed that it will forever remain so unless I'm at circle of eight or more processors I used it to achieve a speed increase of a factor of eight or more and I keep that speed increase but solving the toughest problems horizon Medical Physics parallel processing was dismissed as the end of the road he never ending quest for the FASTA supercomputer after my discovery that of course only for $39.99 I'm not betting news headlines you won a super computer that is the world's fastest had to parallel process across billions of processors that shared what kept me moving forward and alone do you my parallel processing research that I did in the United States was my visceral feeling that the computer is older than myself and that the supercomputer is like that I myself on the 4th of July 1989 I discovered how parallel process mystical super super parallel processing is vital to the computer and supercomputer my contribution to the development of a supercomputer is this I figured out how to an S the fastest massive super computer ever done discovery of parallel processor is used every day supercomputer parallel processing we defined the computer and supercomputer in a new plant in the nineteen thirties I was perhaps the world's leading consumer of algebraic equations I was so record system of 24 meter equations of algebra I'm sorry that system equations that I stopped doing each second and with seven seconds completed each second doing so will be to record the world's fastest competition as of the fourth of July 1989 I was in the news because the fastest computer say I discovered the fastest computer speeds across a new internet that's 65,000 ever good and etc processing minutes with each processor operating its own operating system and share it not in 1989 it made the news headlines that in a dealer's supercomputer genes in the United States and experimentally discover how a new internet that is a new global network of 65,536 CPUs could be harnessed and used to synchronously solve a system of 24 million or draft equations that arose in action scale computational physics undo so the email second and iterate seven email cycles per second I've been so across that new internet to record the world's fastest supercomputer calculation I civic amana body was that plain chicken super computer scientist that was in the news back in 1989 my discovery of the parallel supercomputer was also highlighted in the two 20 1990 issue or the wall street journal my contribution the supercomputer is this in the 1980s when the parallel supercomputer was bought when they could and dismissed everybody I discovered that that grand challenge problems arising in computational physics but I am possible to solve on a confessional supercomputer it's possible to solve across the videos of a millions of commodity of the share processors that I had defined the parallel supercomputer my discovery of parallel processing became because I record video compilations per second and execute them across a new internet that is a new global network of 65,000 I have six central processing units each processor of six emails per second in 1989 a parallel process around the clock or with the first sermon in that year I had two mental images of my virtual supercomputer that was not a computer say I'm not bound by a contract to describe the parallel supercomputer that I invented and describe that new super computer for the understanding of the confessional super to the scientists of the late nineteen forties nor do I have to describe that new supercomputer in the exact sense that I understood it when I conceived it in the nineteen seventies I described my inventions in the right of Newark understandings the world computer was first used in print 2,000 years ago and first used by the Roman Lyonya elder the word computer' meant different things to Jesus Christ and to fill it in my way my first modern supercomputer was a parallel processing machinery that was a new global network of 65,000 500 Internet I discovered how to use that first supercomputer to perform the world's fastest calculations and so we're solving the toughest problems horizon in STEM fields my second supercomputer is the sister parallel processing machinery that was first published as the science fiction story published in weather prediction process my contribution to the development of this supercomputer is this I joined that science fiction as my reality that was comprised of my new global network of 65,000 [Music] commodity processors the internet does the black we invent dogmas fight hard to get credit for his invention I am no exception in 1980s I invented a new supercomputer that was new because it was defined by a never-before-seen processor to process of configuration that new supercomputer was also a new internet de facto the greatest contribution of the black inventor and reason he or she is the subject of school reports is that his or contributions to science and technology change generative abite intellectual supremacy I found it troublesome that even though there's only one body of scientific knowledge America's history of slavery and Jim Crow segregation the fact of graded artificial distinctions we do what I as a black scientist can contribute to human knowledge our body where scientists can contribute in 1989 I discovered how to unless a new global network of 64 binary thousand processors and how do use them to solve the toughest problems arising in STEM fields I was able to make my discovery of practical parallel processing I do so because I visualize my assemble of processors as people a distributed around my glue that I define is 16 dimensional hyperspace I prefer lines each processor has separated by equal distances from 16 nearest memory processors for planet at 7970 and half miles each of my 65,536 processors would cover an area of about 3,000 square miles I metaphorically visualized that new supercomputer that I used to experimentally discover practical parallel processing my metaphor for my new supercomputer was a universe I visualized supercomputing with 65536 that I utilized as evenly distributed and each of the past 16 or 60 5506 but this is about you and I'd realized i processed across you internet that was a new global network of 65,000 in effect folded I did so without any of those it was a good process the reason was that parallel supercomputer was impossible please allow me to put the parallel supercomputer in the perspective of the nineteen seventies back then solve it a grand challenge problem solving it by dividing it into what building smaller problems and solving them while beating a one product to one processor correspondence and doing so with 1 billion processors was a very terrifying thought that was the reason those same super computer scientists attempted to solve the Grand Challenge problem that sense of foreboding prompted the computer world magazine a supercomputer that article was published if it's tuned for the 1976 issue I was tied to work research in parallel processing question as waste of time in the 1970s the parallel process invincible to a globe in this two dimensional hyperspace was like searching for to rest of our system black boxes that when people distances apart on the surface of a globe that was in the universe I had to officialize get some locations of teach off of each and every central processing unit that almost parallel process across before I could harness that processor to solve a computation intensive great challenge problem as the first and the only fuel tank parallel processing for the 1980s a pattern of imputation that was followed by this invitation in the United States that could teach them how to solve a crime challenge problem and do so by chopping it up you don't want we have smaller problems and solving them with a one problem to one processor corresponded Marty after several dissipations and learn to disguise my identity as a black African past as a white person in the field of supercomputing for that reason maybe super computer scientist of the nineteen eighties thought that I was from Eastern Europe and presumed that I was white and we are shocked when they met me on February 28 1990 in San Francisco California he did I'm pleased I was awarded a top prize in the funeral of supercomputing the I to believe committee that gave me my contributions would have revoked that price if they had discovered before they are what ceremony that I was black and Africa everybody was shot when I stood to receive that supercomputer price that price is won by a team of up to 50 super cool because scientists the scientists to win that prize thank you [Applause] insightful and brilliant lecture [Applause] insightful and brilliant lecture
