 hello viewers welcome to mindmajix your skill partner what is the one technology you want to master in this internet era i'm sure 6 out of 10 will offer ai yes you heard it right in today's world ai is playing a key role in automating every possible industry ai is the future is the chance of getting hired in ai job roles we are here with 40 interview questions that are asked in various interviews to assess candidates knowledge our experts have filtered thousands of interview questions and came up with few frequently asked questions before finding answers to the tricky interview questions please do like and subscribe to our youtube channel for successful interview guidance tutorials and trainings and now let's get started with our expert answers to the ai interview questions in this tutorial we are going to learn how to prepare for artificial intelligence integration so let's start with the question number one question number one what is the difference between ai artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning basically this type of question are coming in the starting of the interview like for the second question because these questions are having with the very basic level so first of all whenever you are trying to give this answer for this question so you are just basically start with the basic understanding about the ai ml and deep learning first of all you have to start look like artificial intelligence can be discovered around 1950s with the first invention is the turin test and that is developed by the alan turing that is a very important thing out there in an artificial intelligence team second is the machine learning machine learning first time explorer around the 1916 and the deep learning can be orientated around the 1970s artificial intelligence represents the simulated intelligence in machines whereas the machine learning is the practice of getting machines to make the decision without being programmed this first definition of the machine learning can be coming around 1916 by the arthur samy if i'm talking about the deep learning deep learning is the process of using artificial neural networks to solve this complex problem basically deep learning things is based upon the biological neuron ai its artificial intelligence is the subset of the data science where the machine learning is the subset of the artificial intelligence and the deep learning is the subset of the machine learning whereas ai ml and dl all are the subsets of the data science because data science are having like whole universe aim is to build the machine which make are capable of thinking like human whereas the machine learning aim is regarding to the make the machine learn through the data so they can solve the problem as compared to ai and machine learning deep learning are having aim it look like to build a neural network that automatically discover the patterns for a feature detection so that's how you can give the answer of the difference between the ai ml and deep learning also if the interview will ask to you regarding to like what is the ai and what is the deep learning also somewhere the question is regarding to look like what is the difference between ai and computer vision or ai versus natural language processing so you can consider ai or the natural language processing with the deep learning and the ai definition will look like similar question number two what is artificial intelligence and give an example of where ai is used to the on a daily basis so first of all for giving this answer you have to clear the idea about the artificial intelligence on a brief level because if you are just only given the definitions single definition of the artificial intelligence it's not look good so that's why you have to unexplain the artificial intelligence on a brief level so artificial intelligence is an area of computer science that emphasize the creation of the intelligent machine that works and react like human and the main definition of the artificial intelligence is the capability of a machine to imitate the intelligent human behavior so then what are the products you have to make based upon the artificial intelligence it look like the human response if i'm talking about the more about the artificial intelligence so artificial intelligence is depends upon the four factor that is the human thinking rationally thinking human acting and the rational acting so based upon this co-parameter artificial intelligence is morally dependent and last you have to provide one example so example is the google search engine one of the most popular artificial intelligence application is the google search engine if you are going with more depth so you can ask like if you open up your chrome browser and start the type something google immediately provide the solution recommend related to your question so the logic behind the search engine is the artificial intelligence if you want to move you want to give the more examples as compared to the google searching you can also assess look like ai uses a predictive analytics natural language processing and machine learning to recommend relevant searches to you these recommendations are based on the data that google collects about you and such as your search history your location etc and your age like name what are the things already available in your google chrome account so that will help do that does the google make use of ai to predict what you might be looking for question number three what are the different types of areas again this type of question are asking whenever uh the basic or the intermediate table of the artificial intelligence knowledge because this uh equation is normally depends upon the core ai principles okay so it's not look like it depends upon the machine learning or the deep learning of further technologies but this question are depends upon the most core ai principle basically here i mentioned the seven types of artificial intelligence first is the reactive machine ci limited memory ai theory of mind ai calculati artificial narrow intelligence artificial general intelligence artificial superhuman implements okay but i'm not just going like overview of this equation i will explain the whole logic behind this question like what is the reactive machine here so this reactive machine say based on the present action like what are the actions done in a present by the agent or robot so it can't not be use the previous experience to prompt the current decision and simultaneously update the memory for example second is the limited memory so what is the meaning of limited memory limited memory i used in a self-driving car they detect the movement of the vehicle around them constantly and add and add it to their memory so limited memory i is also working look like some type of feedback third is third one is the theory of mind ai the theory of mind ai advanced it look like an advanced ai that has the ability to understand the emotion of the people and also other things in the real world team fourth was the stealth aware ai self over ai that causes the human-like conceptness and the reactions such as machine have the ability to from the self-driven action first was the artificial narrow intelligence artificial neural intelligence is also called as uh is called to look like a general purpose artificial intelligence it is used in building virtual assistants like cerium and that is the product coming from the sixth one is the artificial general intelligence agi aj is also known as the strong ai okay because whenever we can talk about the different types of a basically that is the two type of ai is there strong a and b okay that question we can discuss uh later in the same series but first of all we have to consider over here what is the strong ai so strong ai as an example is the pylo robot that answers the question related to the and last one is the artificial superhuman intelligence aside asi that processes the ability to do everything that a human can do and more for example it is the alpha 2 which is the first humanoid asa roberto artificial superhuman employees that is related to that one so that's how you have to consider the seven different types of artificial intelligence and your two answers look like similarly to me question number four how is machine learning related to the artificial intelligence in a question number one we already seen about what are the difference between the artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning still if you want to give the answer of this one you are giving something little bit different to that answer artificial intelligence is a technique that enables machine to mimic human behavior whereas the machine learning is a subset of the artificial intelligence and also somewhere machine learning can play the role of the child of the artificial intelligence it is the science of getting computers to act by feeding them data and letting them learn a few weeks on their own without being explicitly programmed to do so you can also make a difference between their algorithm whenever you can work with the artificial intelligence so basically a star algorithm a algorithm as well as a dfs algorithm breadth for child for search algorithm also some type of agent will work like simple engine model basis and a work in artificial intelligence whenever we are talking about the machine learning so in a machine learning some type of linear regression technique classification technique a work over here similarly to the linear regression logistic regression digital random quality standard support transformation therefore machine learning is a technique of implementing of the articulation installation question number five what is pure learning again q learning is important question but the q learning is not related to the machine learning or the deep learning pure learning is related to the domain of the artificial intelligence with the business process whenever the people are solving the problem related to the artificial intelligence for business at the same time q learning is helpful the q learning is reinforcement learning algorithm in which an agent tries to learn the optimal policy from its past experience with the environment basically the queue learning is coming from the reinforcement learning reinforcement learning are coming from the machine learning but still the q learning is most probably helpful to find out the business problem so that's why you can also consider q learning as a business problem mainly the thing is related to that one the past experience of an agent are sequence of the state action and reverse so that's why in this diagram if you have seen l0 a0 r1 and s1 okay so that is represent the state action and the reward in the state diagram the agent a0 was in the state as 0 and on performing an action a0 which resulted in receiving the reward r1 and thus being updated to the state as well question number 6 what is deep learning deep learning imitates the way of your brain how it works and it learns from the experience and it uses the concept of the neural network to solve the complex problem if you can see this diagram so in a diagram there is layer as shown over here input layer hidden layer 1 hidden layer 2 and output layer basically we have to learn the concept regarding to the input layer hidden layer 1 and the output layer so let's talk about the input layer what is the input layer this layer receives all the inputs and forwards them to the hidden layer to hidden layer for the analysis so that's why input layer gives their output to the hidden layer and hidden layer will take the input from the input layer what is the hidden layer so in the hidden layer various computation are carried out and the result is transferred to the output layer there can be a n number of hidden layers are there and then that was depends upon the problem you are trying to solve that last layer is the output layer so output layer can taken the input from the hidden layer output so hidden layer output will represent the output layer input so you know output layer is responsible for transferring the information from the neural network to the outside world question number seven explain how deep learning works so for learning about this question i already provided here the two diagrams so with the help of the two diagrams you are getting we are getting the better idea regarding to this question deep learning is based on the basic unit of a brain that is called to brain cell or brain neuron that is inspired from a neuron an artificial neuron or a perception what is was a developed so that is also called as artificial neuron or an artificial neuron it comes from the biological neuron a biological neuron has dendrites which are used to receive the input if you can see the diagram of the neurons at the same time you are thinking about some blue outer lines okay so blue outer lens that is called as a dendrite in our biological thing similarly a perceptron received a multiple input applies various transformation and functions and provides an input just like how our brain contains a multiple connected neurons that is called as a neural network similarly that type of things we have to develop over here in a deep learning and that is called as artificial neural network we can also have a network of artificial neuron called with the help of the perceptron from a deep neural network an artificial neuron or perceptron model a neurons which has a set of the input each of which is assigned some specific weight and the neuron then compute some of the function on this weighted input and gives the out so that's how you can give the answer of the how deep learning work question number eight what are bayesian network so bayesian network is basically represented with the machine learning thing because in a machine learning there is a navy based theorem is already there so based upon that the basin theorem or the basic network will work a bayesian network is a statistical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies in the form of the directed iq graph on the occurrence of an event the bayesian network can be used to predict the likelihood that any one of the several possible known causes was the contributing the factor and that is the main contributing factor for example bayesian networks could be used to study the relationship between the basis and the symptoms and given the various symptoms the bayesian network is ideal for computing the probabilities of the presence of the various pieces so that's how bayesian network can many useful question number nine explain the attachment that is used to test the intelligence of a machine so this type of creation is also coming in another way look like what is the curing test because this this is the question and answer is the turing test but somewhere the interviewer will also ask you a question like that what do you understand about the turing test and what is the meaning of during case what is the turing test because during this is very important thing in artificial intelligence interview so basically i already telling you telling you to like steering this is coming from the 1950s from the allen during twilight during the person who have were developed during case so in artificial intelligence accuracy is a method of inquiry for determining the whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being so basically you have to provide the answer in very short and very clear format of this question question number 10 what are hyper parameters in this neural network again this type of question is coming related to the deep learning and basically the expression are not coming in a starting phase of the interview this type of question will coming at the end of the interview so this is very advanced level equation in the interview because the question is mainly mainly related to the hyper parameters and the deep neural network that's why hyperparameter are variables that defines the structure of the network for example variables such as the learning rate define how the network is trained basically learning rate and this type of things is related to the neural network as well as the learning rate or the cost function type of thing they are used to define the number of hidden layers that must be present in a network in your particular neural network and more hidden units can increase the accuracy of the network whereas a less number of the hidden unit or the hidden layer that will may cause a under fitting so that's why hyper parameter in the deep neural network that will create a good impact on that next question is equation number 11 explain the different algorithm used for a hyper parameter optimization again this type of question is coming in advanced level of the interview because that is basically related to the machine learning and deep learning both the things so that's why and again somewhere it is also related related to the advanced machine learning as well as so that's why here we have to talk about the grid search random search and basic optimization and then and after that we have to discuss about the what are the difference mainly different are coming from this query so first of all uh we have to talk about the grid touch grid search is the one type of the hyper parameter things are there and that's why data trains the network for every combination by using the two set of the hyper parameter learning rate and the number of players then it evaluates the model by using the cross validation technique as well as so once basically uh the model can go with the cross validation or the normal training and pasting splitting and then it will go with the core validation and once we are not getting some proper accuracy with the cross validation we are going with the grid second thing was the random search so it randomly samples the search space and the evaluation is that problem particularly probability distribution for example instead of taking all one or ten thousand samples randomly selected so 100 parameters can be checked and third one is the basis optimization so this includes the fine tuning the hyper parameter by enabling the automated model tuning the model used for the approximating the objective function is called the surrogate model and that is related to the some type of the gaussian process so basically uh when the which type of hyper parameter is best so whenever you are having some large data set so you can go with the random search but with the large data set you have something complex data set as well so you can go with the design optimization so that's how you can the answer of this question question number 12 what is the purpose of deep learning frameworks such as keras rancoflow and the pitoch so that's why here they are just want to know about like what you think about this type of models and packages so keras is an open source neural network library written in a python basically uh the new deep learning order machine learning mainly this type of technology nowadays basically popular with the python program so most probability packages are built in a python language so that's why it is designed to enable fast experimentation with the deep neutral network second thing is the tan software so tensorflow is an open source software library for data flow programming it is used for a machine learning application like neural network and that is developed by the google third one is the phyto phytos is an open source machine learning library for a python based on the torch and it is used for applications such as the natural language processing basically python is also used mainly used for the machine learning but uh basically whenever the people are making the model on a machine learning so they are using the keras flow as well as circuit learn the pythos is not popular for that but pytorch is mainly popular for the natural language processing question number 13 we have to find out the difference between the nlp and text mining nlp represent with the national language processing and the second thing was the text mining so first of all we have to find out what is the total aim about the text mining and the natural language processing and what is the total product related to that aim of the text mining is to extract the useful input from the structure or the unstructured text okay so whatever whatever the whatever the topic you are you are having some type of effort so based upon that after you have to find out some important words and based upon respect to text mining another thing we have to have in natural language processing so aim of the natural language processing is to understand what is the conveying of each basically the natural language processing is based upon the two things like natural language generation and natural language understanding so energy and nlu is the main thing regarding to the natural language processing text mining can be done using the text processing languages like call or statistical model whereas the nlp attributing the advanced machine learning model like its neural network or the artificial neural network and the what are the outcome is coming from the text mining is the frequency of word pattern correlation and over here in energy the outcome is related to the like semantic meaning of the text sentimental analysis grammatical structure so these are the outcome from the natural language processing question number 14 what are the different components of the nlp so in a previous question we are already talk about the like nlp is based upon the two things natural language understanding and natural language generation so let's talk about the dead body part so natural language understanding that includes the mapping input to the useful representation and second thing was the analyzing the different aspects of the language whenever in a natural language generation that is defensive uh that include the plating first is the text planning second is the sentence planning and third one is the text realization so that's how you have to uh ask about the like what are the different components of the energy you are not going in variables with the component of the energy don't forget these interviews related to the artificial intelligence it is not related to the nlp so that's why you are just giving the answer related to the other technology in terms of overview or you are not going in with that answer question number 15 explain the component of the expert system basically this expert system is related to again fourth principle of artificial intelligence so that's why you can go and go with the very brief type of these things like what is the meaning of the knowledge base what is the meaning of the important ending and user interface as well as okay so this is a very important question according to the core principle of artificial intelligence so what contains the knowledge bill so it contains the domain specific and high quality knowledge in terms of particularly domain like if i want to make a expert system in a medical things or medical domain have we have all the knowledge related to the patients or some type of symptoms related to the medical thing okay second is the inference ending so inference engine it acquires and manipulates the knowledge from the knowledge base and to arrive at the particular solution and the third one is the user interface so the user interface provides the interaction between the user and the expert system itself if the user will ask something question and that question answer we have to find out from the knowledge base and an informal sentence so that's how expert system can contain the knowledge based influence engine and user interface and based upon these three components they can final and they can make the final solution related to the particular problem question number 16 how is computer vision and ai is related again here the computer vision somewhere it depends upon the deep learning things because we have to add some faces spaces it will come throughout the deep line but again here the question is related to how is computer vision and ai is related so we have to just find out the normal difference between the computer vision and artificial intelligence computer vision is a field of the artificial intelligence and that is used to obtain the information from the images or the multi-dimensional data machine learning algorithms such as k-means algorithm used for image segmentation support vector machine is used for the image classification and so on in a machine learning there is many more algorithms are using for a particular purpose therefore particular in a computer vision will make the use of the artificial intelligence technologies to solve the complex problems such as object detection image processing and active tracking question number 17 which is better for image classification supervised learning is better although unsupervised learning better so here we have to justify that answer so in a supervised classification the image or mutual is fed and interpreted by the machine learning expert to create the future classes and in unsupervised classification the machine learning software creates the future classes based upon the image pixels therefore it is better to choose a supervised classification for image classification in terms of the accuracy because the supervised learning is based upon the label data and the unsupervised learning is based upon the unlabeled data so in a supervised learning the data will teach by someone but in unsupervised learning the data is not picked by someone question number 18 how is game theory and the artificial intelligences related and the context of the artificial intelligence and the deep learning system the game theory is essential to enable some of the key capabilities required in a multi-agent environment in which different ai programs to need to interact or complete compete in order to accomplish a goal in terms of the game theories related to the artificial intelligence question number 19 how can artificial intelligence be used in a detecting plot again this type of question is based upon the real world things okay so that's why you have to given the answer this type of question to be be careful because they they have to evaluate the things related to you like how you can detecting fraud in terms with the help of the artificial intelligence and what is your thinking regarding to the answer of this question so you can give the answer look like artificial intelligence is used in a fraud detection problem by implementing machine learning algorithms for detecting anomalies and studying hidden patterns in the data so that's why you have to go with the step five step first step that is the data collection so basically in a data collection is also you can look like a data exploration okay or the data extraction so at this stage uh data is either collected through a survey or web scrapping is performed and if you are trying to detect the credit card fraud then information about the customer is collected and this includes the transactional shopping personal details etc second step is the data cleaning so at this stage the redundant data must be removed and any inconsistencies or the missing values in the data they have to lead with the wrongful prediction so therefore such inconsistentness must be deal with these steps because this step is very important according to the find out the detecting rod third thing is related to the data exploration and the ana analysis so this is the most important step in the artificial intelligence or the machine learning process here you study the relationship between the various rates you have particular value for example if a person has a has spent an unusual sum of the money on a particular day and the chances of the broadened occurrence are very high such patterns must be detected and understood and understood at this stage of acceleration and the analysis fourth step that is represent the building a model that is depends upon the machine learning model so there are many machine learning algorithm that can be used for detecting prod one searches algorithm is the logistic regression which is a classification algorithm and it can be used to classify events into two classes namely product and non-product and last step that is called as a model evaluation so in this model evaluation you are basically test the efficiency of the machine learning model if there isn't room for improvement then parameter tuning is performed this improves the accuracy of the model whenever the detecting code you are going with the machine learning algorithm so you have to follow these type of steps but whenever you are going with the detecting code with the deep learning effort so the steps are changed because at the same time whenever you are solving these things with the help of the deep learning at the same time artificial neural network should be involved question number 20 what are intelligent agents so again this question is related to the basic and core of the artificial intelligence okay so it's not related to the machine learning or the deep learning that is basically cooperation related to the artificial intelligence concept because these type of things is related to the basics of ci so an intelligent agent is an autonomous entity that liberates sensors to understand a situation and make decision it can also use the actuators to perform both simple and complete tasks in the beginning of this thing it might not be so great at a performing task but it will improve over the time and the roomba vacuum cleaner is an excellent example of this normal agent or a simple based agent question number 21 what's the most popular programming languages used in ai so basically whenever we are working with the artificial intelligence you can also work with the python programming language as well as c plus plus java javascript as our language as well as but when we talk about the popular programming language so the open source module programming language python leads the ai industry because of its simplicity and predictable coding behavior its popularity can be attributed to open source libraries like macro clip numpy efficient frameworks such as cycle and practical version library like tensorflow and btc basically the numpy library are very useful with working with the python language but as well as it is work for the basic mathematics thing with the data sense or the artificial intelligence whereas scikit-learn are mainly used for the predicting machine learning model because that can help to make a machine learning model matplotlib libraries they're also cbone libraries that both library are very useful for to make a data visualization so every library have their own individual purposes there is there and also there is a chance that the interviewer might keep the conversation going and ask you for more examples related to language but you can also go with the java julia hospital and list as well as question number 22 what's the difference between strong ai and vk again this type of question is based upon the core concept related to the uh artificial intelligence so the difference between the two is just like the term sound and strong ai can successfully imitate human intelligence and is at the end of the core of the advanced robotics vki can only predict the specific characteristics that reassemble human intelligence eric and theory are the excellent so here i already provide something related to the strong ai and the vk so let's talk about the individual brain strong air in a strong air it can be applied widely extensive scope is there human level intelligence is good and as well as processes data by using the clustering and association as compared to that in a week here we are having electron series that type of product is already there but it can be great at performing some simple tasks using both supervisor and unsupervised learning because somewhere alexa varies this type of product or also go with some pitch data set and also the unlabeled and earnest data and the scope can be very minimal in terms of vki but strong air having some good scope is there so that's why it is very popular question number 23 how would you describe the machine learning to a non-technical person so ml is upgraded towards the pattern recognition a great example of this is your facebook newsfeed and netflix recommendation engine in this scenario machine learning algorithm observes the pattern and learn content when you deploy and machine learning program it will keep learning and improving within each attempt for example that if the interviewer pro browse to you to provide the more real world example you can list list look like you can make the list look like a amazon product recommendation thought detection search ranking spam detection and spell correction so that's how you can provide the answer this question question number 24 in your opinion how will artificial intelligence impact application development basically this type of question are more only asked about the related whenever you are giving the answer giving the interview for some software development company so this type of question is related to the industry because if they want to make some development or they need to develop some software or applications so they are asking you these type of questions so this is the very real question is that it is not related to the conceptually think of ai or ammo but yeah it means this is the real world thing so we have been actively following these spaces so you will know about all the ai operational and development things in the coming months you can also you can expect artificial intelligence to be more involved in how we build the application it has the potential to transform how we use and manage the infrastructure at a micro and macro level some say that the devops like development and operational will be replaced by what they are calling like artificial intelligence operations because it allows the developer to engage uh engage in accurate route calls the analysis by the combining big data machine learning artificial intelligence as well as computer visions and some data visualization change question number 25 what is collaborative filtering basically this type of question is related to the machine learning and the recommendation system concept collaborative filtering is the one type of the recommendation system so that's why collaborative filtering can be described as a process of finding patterns from the from available information to build the personalized recommendation you can find the collaborative tutoring in the action when you visit the website like amazon and imdb because somewhere some people are related to look like you they are watching some movies as well as they are watching some uh they are reading some books so they can give the reviews related to the books and videos and movies so based upon that similar users are also getting some notice notification you can also read this book or you can also watch this movie so that is called as a collaborative filtering question number 26 would you use the best normalization if so can you explain why so they want some brief answer related to this question batch normalization basically the normalizing is the main word is there normalization and standardization is both look like similar there is both are working in some ranges like zero to one or one two hundred so that's why batch normalization are related to the machine learning so the idea is here to standardize the data before sending to the another layer so this approach helps to reduce the impact of previous layers by keeping the mean and variance constant it also makes the layer independent of the each each and other to achieve the rapid conversion for example when we normalize the features from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 100 it helps to accelerate the learning cycle so that's why batch normalization is very important whenever you are working with the neural network things as well as in machine learning the standardization in normalizing is very required when you make it everything on a one range question number 27 when is it necessary to update an algorithm so you should update an algorithm when the underlying data source has been charged or the whenever there is a case of non-stationarity and the algorithm should be algorithm should also be updated when you want you when you want the model to evolve as a data stream throughout the infrastructure okay so again that is based upon some type of the concept or what are the domain is there so based upon that you can change the algorithm it's not uh look like if you if you find out these things then you can change the algorithm we have to also follow the structure of the algorithm question number 28 what would you do if data in a data set were missing or corrupted again that is this equation is mainly depends upon the data analysis of the data science because the equation is related to the data and how to handle the missing values also the equation is related to look like how you can handle the missing values how you can handle the blank value and how to clean the data so this type of question and the equation are giving the same answer whenever the data is missing or the corrupted here you either replace it or the another value or the drop those rows or columns together in part basically the pandas library is there so pandas library can do all type of things so in pandas both is null and drop any are handy tools to finding the missing values or the corrupted data and drop those values you can also use the field and if plan is the one type of function that can use for this one also is any drop energies all out of the function based upon the pandas library and that can help and that function are helpful to solve this type of problem so this method to fill the invalid values in placeholder for example 0 question number 29 do you have research experience in here again there is question mark question is there if you can give the answer yes so you have to give some uh proper answer and some good answer okay and if you have no any research experience you can easily ask to like know but if you had done some work like around one year or six months or one year so you can give the answer yes like you can give the answer look like at present a lot of work within the ai spaces research based and as a result many organizations will be digging into into your background to ascertain the what kind of the experience you have in this area and if you if you authored or co-authored research paper or have been supervised by the industry leaders or make sure to share that information like uh like particular who are the uh already done the job related to the artificial influence either or the data science side of the data science department head of the data science leader and this type of your content the person can done so take it a step further and have a summary of your research experience along with your research paper really to share with the interviewing channel so that will make an outfit then also you have some good knowledge regarding to your research as well because sometimes they are also asking you the question based upon whatever the research you had done question number 13 what is an a star algorithm search method basically again this type of question is related to the core principle of the artificial intelligence star is a computer algorithm that is extensively used for the purpose of the finding the path or traversing a graph in order to find the most optimal root of roots between the various points called the node so basically a sr algorithm are asking again this type of question asking in terms of the junior level of artificial intelligence interviews because related to the core concept of the ai and but basically in practical this uh nowadays this algorithm are not much used but again whenever you are going for junior junior ai engineer or the senior ai developer so they can ask this type of question and as a computer engineer you have to know about this question as well as group level question number 31 what is a bi-directional search algorithm again that is based upon the core principle of the artificial intelligence so in a bi-directional search algorithm the search begins in forward from the beginning state and it reversed from the objective so that is all always it works between the beginning state and the objective state and the search is made to identify a common state and the initial state is linked with the objective state in a reverse phase each curve is done just up to the half of the aggregated page that's why that is called as a bi-directional search algorithm it's not look like dirty in every integration you are getting like a star algorithm or the bi-directional search algorithm or the legal algorithm they are only asked about like one or two algorithms basic knowledge they want just only basic knowledge they don't want to like very brief knowledge or depth knowledge they just only want to the basic knowledge you can also stream the lightest type of the diagram that will also helpful for you question number 32 what is an attitude depending depth first search dfs algorithm so the repetitive search process of the level 1 and level 2 happens in this search and this search process should continue until the solution is found and nodes are generated until a single node is created and stack of the node is the saved because it depends upon the left first search like who will come the first that will go with the battery the question number 33 what is the uniform cost search algorithm the uniform cost search performs the storing sorting and increasing the cost of the path of a goal and it expands the least cost node it is identical to the bss like on first search and if each iteration has the same cost it investigates the ways in expanding the order of the cost again the uniform cost searches again very similarly to look like the best first first search okay so that is the again important things over here question number 34 explain the alpha beta to ring again alpha beta tuning is important that is not related to any type of the search methods or the basic algorithm but is again important related to the core principle of the artificial intelligence alpha beta pruning is a search algorithm and that tries to reduce the number of the nodes that is searched by the minimax algorithm so they can also find out the minimum thing and maximum thing so that's dependent on the minimum algorithm in the third tree it can be applied to the end number of depth to what are the final depth so that it depends on the end number of depth and can prune the entire substrate and the leaves so that's how that will work over here question number 35 what is the logic fuzzy logic is again depends upon the traditional area okay so that concept is related to the traditional odi and nowadays the further logic is not very popular or not any working in a real world application not much and there is very very old traditional artificial intelligence techniques as well so very less chances are there to come this type of question in an interview but i just want to only want to also go with the like basic according to uh in junior level engineering so that's why i just discussed this question that fuzzy logic is a subset of the artificial intelligence and it is the view of the encoding human learning for the artificial processing and it is the form of many valued logic and it will be present as the and then do is okay so it's related to related look like sometimes it will work in a forward condition and then it will work in a backward condition basically the fuzzy logic or the system that is here if you can see some diagram so that is depends upon the function so there is some triangular function is the square wave function is that a source function is there so that type of function will work in terms of the fuzzy logic or the physical system question number 36 what is partial order planning again not uh basically related to the machine learning or the date planning the core principle of the artificial implement a problem has to be solved in a sequential approach to attain the goal and the partial order or the po plan specifies all actions that need to be undertaken but specifies an order of the actions only when it was required if it was not required so you are not go with that particular action question number 37 what is f o p l again f it represents like first order programmable logic or the first order pretty predicated logic so that's why it is again based upon the logic things uh in terms of core pi principles so first order predicate logic is the collection of the form of systems where each statement is divided into the subject or the predicate and this predicate refers to only one subject and it can either modified or that defines the properties of the subject so it can the first order of predicate logic will be depends upon the some type of relation so for example we have some long word so regarding to that all long but we have to discuss about some type of small thing related together we have to create the logic between two two letters and then and at the two word and then and then we have to submit we have to add everything together and we are getting the first order practical logic question number 38 lists the different algorithm techniques in machine learning so that's the supervised learning is there all supervised learning time is supervised learning is there basically the popular thing is the supervised learning and supervised learning supervised learning has come with the linear regression or the logistic regression decision tree and random support vector motion this type of technique will come with the supervised learning when we talk about the unsupervised learning so we are getting the hierarchical clustering anomaly detections or k-means clustering so this type of thing will come with the unsupervised learning chemist learning reinforcement learning this type of thing is always correlated with the neural network so that's why it is also somewhere it's regarding to the deep learning is therefore first thing was the transactions and then learning to learn is there so that is also used for the based upon the machine learning question number 39 list the extraction technique used for a dimensionality reduction so this is very basic uh uh question is there so you just only provide the three name first is the independent component analysis second one is the principle component analysis and third one is the kernel based principle component analysis because yeah they are just only want to know like what are the list of extraction techniques okay so you want to just go with the very brief of this question you have to can you name three feature selection techniques in the machine learning so you have to just only provide the three basic features selection technique two over here you are not going with again very depth with this question so answer is the universe selection feature importance and third one is the correlation matrix with the heat map and if you want to go with the very depth on this question like you you also have to know some basic knowledge regarding to these thing like univariate selection feature importance and the correlation matrix with the heat map so that will helpful to you because somewhere they are also asking to like uh out of this see which feature you are more comfortable so you have to provide the one of the name and you have to describe as well as that name question number 41 what is cost function so again that is based upon the machine learning or the deep learning combined because the cost function is basically uh represent going with the variant decent techniques and there is multiple gradient different is there and also the ear learning is very important so you have to just only provide a simple idea related to the cost function a cost function is a scalar function that quantifies the error factor of the neural network lower the cost function better for the neural network for example while classifying the image in the m ac data set like amino acid number this dataset is there and the input image is the dg2 but the neural network is predicted it to be number three so that's how you can give the answer related to the like what is the corresponding do do not need to go with the very depth of this question because whenever they are just only ask like what is the thing so you have to definitely go with the beginner level of the answer you have to provide the beginner level of the answer so here the last question is the question number 42 list of the different activation function or the different neuron function it is again a very important question is that basically activation neurons or the activation function are mainly mainly using in the deep deep learning or the deep neural network or the artificial neural network basically the activation function are not working with the machine learning but basically whenever we are going with the logistic regression uh type of things with the machine learning so we are getting the sigmoid function or the softmax function but mainly the activation function are working with the deep learning things like binary threshold neuron function a linear function is where stochastic binary function is the sigmoid neuron it is also called as the sigmoid function 10 h function rayleigh function there is also many more functions like uh leaky relu function is there also the uh function is there on also where functionality so multiple uh activation functions are working in a neural network or the artificial intelligence topic that is very popular is that so that's how this is the total 42 questions for preparing the artificial interview question artificial intelligence integration so you can if once you can get the total idea regarding all the 42 uh question and answer so i hope uh you can clear your interview uh you know junior level of the artificial influence order if you can also prepare for the data science interview so you can also follow this type of question that is again helpful to you so thank [Music] you
