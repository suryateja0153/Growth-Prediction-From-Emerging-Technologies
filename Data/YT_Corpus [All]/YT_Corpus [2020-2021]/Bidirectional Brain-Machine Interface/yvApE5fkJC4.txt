 brain implants often referred to as neural implants are technological devices that connect directly to a biological subjects brain usually placed on the surface of the brain or attached to the brains cortex a common purpose of modern brain implants and the focus of much current research is establishing a biomechanical prosthesis circumventing areas in the brain that have become dysfunctional after a stroke or other head injuries this includes sensory substitution EEG envision other brain implants are used in animal experiments simply to record brain activity for scientific reasons some brain implants involve creating interfaces between neural systems and computer chips this work is part of a wider research field called brain computer interfaces brain computer interface research also includes technology such as eager raise that allow interface between mind and machine but do not require direct implantation of a device neural implants such as deep brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation are increasingly becoming routine for patients with Parkinson's disease and clinical depression respectively topic purpose brain implants electrically stimulate block or record or both record and stimulate simultaneously signals from single neurons or groups of neurons biological neural networks in the brain the blocking technique is called intra-abdominal vagal blocking this can only be done where the functional associations of these neurons are approximately known because of the complexity of neural processing and the lack of access to action potential related signals using neural imaging techniques the application of brain implants has been seriously limited until recent advances in neural physiology and computer processing power topic research and applications research and sensory substitution has made significant progress since 1970 especially envisioned due to the knowledge of the working of the visual system I implant often involving some brain implants or monitoring have been applied with demonstrated success for hearing cochlear implants are used to stimulate the auditory nerve directly the vestibulocochlear nerve is part of the peripheral nervous system but the interface is similar to that of true brain implants multiple projects have demonstrated success at recording from the brains of animals for long periods of time as early as 1976 researchers at the nih led by eduard Schmidt made action potential recordings of signals from rhesus monkey motor cortex is using a movable hatpin electrodes including recording from single neurons for over 30 days and consistent recordings for greater than 3 years from the best electrodes the hatpin electrodes were made of pure iridium and insulated with perylene materials that are currently used in the cyber kinetics implementation of the Utah array these same electrodes or derivations thereof using the same biocompatible electrode materials are currently used in visual prosthetics laboratories laboratories studying the neural basis of learning and motor prosthetics approaches other than the cyber kinetics probes other laboratory groups produce their own implants to provide unique capabilities not available from the commercial products breakthroughs include studies of the process of functional brain rewiring throughout the learning of a sensory discrimination control of physical devices by rat brains monkeys / robotic arms remote control of mechanical devices by monkeys and humans remote control over the movements of roaches electronic-based neuron transistors for leeches the first reported use of the Utah array in a human for bi-directional signaling currently a number of groups are conducting preliminary motor prosthetic implants in humans these studies are presently limited to several months by the longevity of the implant the array now forms the sensor component of the brain gate much research is also being done on the surface chemistry of neural implants and effort to design products which minimize all negative effects that an active implant can have on the brain and that the body can have on the function of the implant another type of neural implant that is being experimented on is prosthetic neuronal memory silicon chips which imitate the signal processing done by functioning neurons that allows people's brains to create long-term memories in 2016 scientists at the University of Illinois at urbana-champaign announced development of tiny brain sensors for used post-operative monitoring which melt away when they are no longer needed you topic military DARPA has announced its interest in developing cyborg insects to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupal stage the insects motion would be controlled from a micro electromechanical system MEMS and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives in gas similarly DARPA is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of sharks the Sharks unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives in 2006 researchers at Cornell University invented a new surgical procedure to implant-- artificial structures into insects during their metamorphic development the first insect cyborgs mods with integrated electronics in their thorax were demonstrated by the same researchers the initial success of the techniques has resulted in increased research in the creation of a program called hybrid insect MEMS hi MEMS its goal according to DARPA zmei crow systems technology office is to develop tightly coupled machine insect interfaces by placing micro mechanical systems inside the insect during the early stages of metamorphosis the use of neural implants has recently been attempted with success on cockroaches surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect which were remotely controlled by a human the results although sometimes different basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes DARPA is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas in 2009 at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers I Triple E micro electronic mechanical systems MEMS conference in Italy researchers demonstrated the first wireless flying beetle cyborg engineers at the University of California at Berkeley pioneered the design of a remote-controlled beetle funded by the DARPA hai MEMS program this was followed later that year by the demonstration of wireless control of a lift assisted moth cyborg eventually researchers plan to develop Hayami EMS for dragonflies bees rats and pigeons for the high MEMS cybernetic bug to be considered a success it must fly 100 meters 330 feet from a starting point guided via computer into a controlled landing within 5 meters 16 feet of a specific end point once landed the cybernetic bug must remain in place in 2015 it was reported that scientists from the perception and recognition neuro technologies laboratory at the southern Federal University in rostov-on-don suggested using rats with microchips planted in their brains to detect explosive devices in 2016 it was reported that American engineers are developing a system that would transform locusts into remote-controlled explosive detectors with electrodes in their brains beaming information about dangerous substances back to their operators topic rehabilitation neurostimulator x' have been in use since 1997 to ease the symptoms of such diseases as epilepsy Parkinson's disease dystonia and recently depression current brain implants are made from a variety of materials such as tungsten silicon platinum iridium or even stainless steel future brain implants may make use of more exotic materials such as nanoscale carbon fibers nanotubes and polycarbonate urethane topic historical research in 1870 Edouard hits again Gustav rich demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the brains of dogs could produce movements Robert bartholow showed the same to be true for humans in 1874 by the start of the 20th century fedor Krauser began to systematically map human brain areas using patients that had undergone brain surgery prominent research was conducted in the 1950s Robert G Heath experimented with aggressive mental patients aiming to influence his subjects moods through electrical stimulation yale university physiologist Jose Delgado demonstrated limited control of animal and human subjects behaviors using electronic stimulation he invented the stimulus eevr a transdermal stimulator a device implanted in the brain to transmit electrical impulses that modify basic behaviors such as aggression or sensations of pleasure Delgado was later to write a popular book on mind control called physical control of the mind where he stated the feasibility of remote control of activities in several species of animals has been demonstrated the ultimate objective of this research is to provide an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the directional control of animals and to provide practical systems suitable for human application in the 1950s the CIA also funded research into mind-control techniques through programs such as MK UL tra perhaps because he received funding for some research through the US Office of Naval Research it has been suggested but not proven that Delgado also received backing through the CIA he denied this claim in a 2005 article in Scientific American describing it only as a speculation by conspiracy theorists he stated that his research was only progressively scientifically motivated to understand how the brain works topic concerns and ethical considerations ethical questions raised include who are good candidates to receive neural implants and what are good and bad uses of neural implants whilst deep brain stimulation is increasingly becoming routine for patients with Parkinson's disease there may be some behavioral side-effects reports in the literature describe the possibility of apathy hallucinations compulsive gambling hypersexuality cognitive dysfunction and depression however these may be temporary and related to correct placement and calibration of the stimulator and so are potentially reversible some transhumanists such as Raymond Kurzweil and Kevin Warwick see brain implants as part of a next step for humans in progress and evolution whereas others especially bio conservatives view them as unnatural with humankind losing essential human qualities it raises controversy similar to other forms of human enhancement for instance it is argued that implants would technically change people into cybernetic organisms cyborgs it's also expected that all research will comply to the Declaration of Helsinki yet further the usual legal duties apply such as information to the person wearing implants and that the implants are voluntary with very few exceptions other concerns involve ulnar abilities of neural implants to cybercrime or intrusive surveillance as neural implants could be hacked misused or Mis designed Sajha states that ones private thoughts are important to protect and doesn't consider it a good idea to just charge the government or any company with protecting them Walter Glennon a neuro ethicist of the University of Calgary notes that there is a risk of the microchips being hacked by third parties and that this could interfere with the users intention to perform actions violate privacy by extracting information from the chip topic in fiction and philosophy brain implants are now part of modern culture but there were early philosophical references of relevance as far back as Rene Descartes in his 1641 meditations Descartes argued that it would be impossible to tell if all ones apparently real experiences were in fact being produced by an evil demon intent on deception a modern twist on Descartes argument as provided by the brain-in-a-vat thought experiment which imagines a brain sustained apart from its body in a vat of nutrients and hooked up to a computer which is capable of stimulating it in such a way as to produce the illusion that everything is normal popular science fiction discussing brain implants and mind-control became widespread in the 20th century often with a dystopian outlook literature in the 1970s delved into the topic including the terminal man by Michael Crichton where a man suffering from brain damage receives an experimental surgical brain implant designed to prevent seizures which he abuses by triggering for pleasure another example as Larry Niven science fiction writing of wire heads in his known space stories fear that the technology will be misused by the government and military as an early theme in the 1981 BBC serial the nightmare man the pilot of a hi-tech mini submarine is linked to his craft via a brain implant but becomes a savage killer after ripping out the implant perhaps the most influential novel exploring the world of brain implants was William Gibson's 1984 novel Neuromancer this was the first novel in a genre that came to be known as cyberpunk it follows a computer hacker through a world where mercenaries are augmented with brain implants to enhance strength vision memory etc Gibson coins the term matrix and introduces the concept of jacking in with head electrodes or direct implants he also explores possible entertainment applications of brain implant such as the sim stem simulated stimulation which is a device used to record and playback experiences another example of the alliance in which a society is controlled by implants Gibson's work led to an explosion in popular culture references to brain implants its influences are felt for example in the 1989 role-playing game shadow run which borrowed his term data jack to describe a brain computer interface the implants in Gibson's novels and short stories formed the template for the 1995 film Johnny mnemonic and later the Matrix trilogy Pulp Fiction with implants or brain implants include the novel series typers film spider-man 2 the TV series earth final conflict and numerous computer video games the gap cycle the gap into in Steven R Donaldson series of novels the use and misuse of zone implant technology is key to several plot lines ghost in the shell' anime and manga franchise cyber brain neural augmentation technology as the focus implants of powerful computers provide vastly increased memory capacity Total Recall as well as the ability to view his or her own memories on an external viewing device users can also initiate a telepathic conversation with other cyber brain users the downsides being cyber brain hacking malicious memory alteration and the deliberate distortion of subjective reality and experience in larry niven and jerry Parnell's oath of fealty 1981 an arcology with high surveillance and feudal like society is built by a private company due to riots around los angeles its systems are run by Milly an advanced computer system

better along with other enhancements the Deus Ex video game series addresses the nature and impact of human enhancement with regard to a wide variety of prosthesis and brain implants Deus Ex Human Revolution set in 2027 details the impact on society of human augmentation in the controversy it could generate several characters in the game have implanted neuro chip stew aid their professions or their whims examples are of a helicopter pilot with implanted chips to better pilot her aircraft and analyze flight paths velocity and spatial awareness as well as a hacker with a brain computer interface that allows direct access to computer networks and also to act as a human proxy to allow an individual in a remote location to control his actions the game raises the question of the downsides of this kind of augmentation as those who cannot afford the enhancements or object to getting them rapidly find themselves at a serious disadvantage against people with artificial enhancement of their abilities the specter of being forced to have mechanical or electronic enhancements just to get a job as explored as well the storyline addresses the effect of implant rejection by use of the fictional drug neuro posing which breaks down glial tissue and is also fiercely addictive leaving people who have augmentations little choice but to continue buying the drug from biotech corporations who control the price of it without the drug Augmented people experience rejection of implants crippling pain and possible death equals equals see also
