 ah um hello my name is Roger I'm a PG student Adam in the human lab and today I'm here presenting em her creating a novel tactile feedback by augmenting the body her to respond to magnetic field so I would like to start my talk about are we talking about the motivation the motivation behind this work is social touch social touch has a has a really powerful role in human development shaping social reward attachment cognitive communication and emotional regulation from infancy and throughout life the lack of social touch has been linked to different brain disorders such as autism however social doji's is a really complex system we sense we and we sense touch through through our skin okay basically we have two types of skin in one side hairy skin and the other one glamorous skin each of these skins is composed through like different neurons and mechanoreceptors and they are in charge to let us send an interact with environment these mechanoreceptors are located in the in different areas of the skin and basically react to different type of stimulus it could be stretching and vibrating etc in specific that is one type of mechanoreceptors that has been linked to social touch which are like see dear friends these ones are mainly located in the hair Pollak hair follicle and the best way to stimulate them is that about like 3 centimeters per second is where they produce more pleasant and and basically through a gentle stroke and have em as a deflection inspired and motivated by differences to the em presenting and hair were basically we amend the hair to make it magnetic so we can and we can target the mechanoreceptors attached to the hair follicle and hair relates to non-contact haptic interfaces in non-contact haptic interfaces which there are mainly like to two techniques one will be like acoustic bass ultra haptics is a good example and then the other one will be air base okay so basically the main difference is M here we target certain type of mekin receptors for a second I would like you to just blow in your forearm so if you blog you forum like really gentle you can okay you didn't feel you just feel air right okay now blowing your in in the in your hand in your palm you can also feel a perception right it is slightly different but you can feel a perception involved and trying to point is when for example in the case of air with we trigger a cocktail of mechanoreceptors which which basically we perceive in both in the Harry and the clubber skin in M her basically we just target the ones that are in the in the hair follicle so if we break the problem that we tried to solve in two sections with having one side what will be like her augmentation and the other one her stimulation so first of first of all the question is like how do we amend this hair the answer is pretty clear through cosmetics okay so we use cosmetics for beauty proposes we've been using them like right now for example and whirring like wax on my hair HCI community has explored cosmetics and cosmetics through the clear time to use it as a input interfaces as well as output interfaces there is also like certain work that that targets like her interfaces basically smaller located on the sculptor where we have like a touch the they enable like a capacitive interface and then also like some mm callosum attic and sorry like changing the color with the temperature as well as like shaping there's also some work about like a week that enables like communication however there is a problem when we talk about like this em cosmetics like this prismatic zone body interfaces and is the electronics the electronics are they need to be connected to the to the extremity so you can imagine if you have a hair how do you put some electronics or like a thermal threat attached to them it's impossible right so in M hair what we do is we rely in a type of cosmetics that we call magnetic cosmetics ok these are these ones are must our cosmetics that have a high concentration of ferromagnetic particles such as iron or at some case it could even it could even and have magnetic properties such as wearer Marc net like knio knio knio knio needy empower these cosmetics interact with magnetic field and basically they enable sensing and actuation and activating and interestingly we can find them already available off the shelf ok so I just collect like for examples of available magnetic cosmetics that are there which have like or type high concentration of ferromagnetic particles or even at some case like an active medium part particles so ultimately in M hair what we generate is a recipe using off-the-shelf cosmetics we in for example in the in the demo I am doing I'm just showing this this combination where basically we use a ferromagnetic mask that is normally used as exfoliant and we mix it with like M box gel as a courier with this we achieve like to have a really easy cosmetic with a having a safe properties the way that we apply it is through an eyelash brush to avoid to dodging with the skin yep so once we have this Harold minted now it's like how can we how can we stimulate it so this card now reacts the magnetic field in our case what we like for the study that we wanted to perform basically we we set up certain requirements on the magnetic field we wanted to have a precise magnetic field of about like one centimeter so we can move a magnetic field around we target that 3 centimeters per second we wanted to move this at 3 centimeters per second which is the which is the speed that has related to the CD efference then we wanted to have a surface capable to stimulate all the body all the forearm so about 20 to 30 centimeters and we didn't want this M actuator to touch the skin over her so we place it at about 25 millimeters in terms of like the magnetic strength if we compared with real and like known magnetic fields in one case we have like the magnetic L that is about 15 microteslas we will have like a magnetic and from the fridge that is our like 5 minute s less or we go to MRI machines is about 3 Tesla's for magnetic here based on our observations we we saw that with by applying 50 milli milli Tesla's we obtain about 1 degree of the formation for the hair so it's a quite strong magnetic field that the one that we need the main two techniques right now to stimulate eye to generate magnetic fields are through permanent magnets or electromagnets so in this case based on our requirements we decided to go with a with a permanent magnet the way the way that we achieve it is basically we mount this permanent magnet on a CNC machine and then we were able to stimulate it at the speed that we wanted and with a pretty high equation accuracy this is example yep so with this machine we perform a formative study with six participants with with the goal to understand the sensation that we were generating m-yeah in now in the presentation we'll be talking on a couple details in the paper you'll first you you'll find more so one of the things that we wanted to understand is like how this cumulative was this sensation so basically we perform like a subset of shapes in different locations and in different sizes through the body and on the body what will be the group a is like different locations B will be the sizes and C is like the shapes on the shapes the users were asked to draw by themselves so they didn't have any reference so we can observe some some degree of discriminative perception which which is honestly higher than what we expected however the interesting part is on the subjective description so the participants were also stimulated during one minute with this haptic sensation and we were as we asked them to provide like with five five with with words that describe their sensation from the six participants we got about twenty five twenty five words and these are a collection of themselves all of them reported the sensation to be windy as well as five of them Pleasant touch and then we have like some comments of like unique ticklish gentle etc so all these words according to the effective writing are associated with positive balance and slightly calm arousal so with this work we show the potential behind her augmentation and her stimulation we can observe I we can see our work opening two main areas of to for further exploration on one side there is the theoretical where basically upstream research could deeply understood further explore like what type of haptic sensation are we performing and if it what are the making of receptors that we are triggering as well as applied research to miniaturize this in order to enable interactions in the in the never interactions and application with this I I conclude my talk I also have a demo and you can come and like feel how it like evaluate how it feels thank you okay we have time for a bunch of questions all right well we wait I have a question so I was wondering did you do any experimentation with sort of fast attraction and repeal of the dude like more complex pattern that could be higher frequency to I don't know maybe invoke some other other sensations yeah so in in in this particular basically we didn't we didn't evaluate this part the main thing that we've already was the discriminative as well as the as the you noticed that this community as well as the subjective description yeah but it's a really good point something that we would like to do also in future work doing other questions so have one more so what about the safety and on one hand and on the other hand how do you clear this off yeah when you're done with your magnetic so these I mean this these cosmetics are basically like really easy to remove so just like water on the on the on the toilet just go away in terms of safety is a really good question is one of the main reasons why we decided to go with off-the-shelf cosmetics even though when we talk about like cosmetics most of them have em they have already like ferromagnetic particles like iron oxide so it's if yeah it's quite they are inside the safety concerns though main reason for example that we didn't evaluate them the rapidly changing frequencies because when you put the body the human body with a I'll turn magnetic field and is you need to have all certain regulations thank you [Applause]
