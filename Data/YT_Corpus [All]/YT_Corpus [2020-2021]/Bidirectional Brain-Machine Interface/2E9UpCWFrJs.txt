 hey guys today we will be discussing about a new technology known as neuralink so let's begin with the brain whacking journey on a serious note though we have decided to make this video in two parts so stay tuned for the next one [Music] neuro neurotechnology is any technology that has a fundamental influence on how people understand the brain and various aspects of consciousness thought and higher order activities in the brain it also includes technologies that are designed to improve and repair brain function and allow researchers and clinicians to visualize the brain now we come towards the topic for today neuralink corporation is an american neurotechnology company founded by elon musk have i mentioned before that this guy is a friggin genius and now you cannot deny this the company is developing implantable brain machine interfaces or abbreviated as bmis the company's headquarters are in san francisco if only i could kidnap elon musk and force him to put me on the team [Music] the objective for this corporation was to create a device which can cure all brain and spinal diseases by implanting it in the brain and adding special features with the device as per the vision is concerned the objective behind it is that as the brain and spine works like household electrical wiring therefore illness in it must be rectified by treating it by wiring network and using harmless devices if only they could find a way to make me smarter guess humans aren't that smart huh oh the irony now let's give a look upon the bmi well the brain machine interface or the bmi is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced a wired brain and an external device bmi differs from neuromodulation in the sense that it allows for bi-directional information flow bmi are often directed at researching mapping assisting augmenting or repairing human cognitive or sensory motor functions neuromodulation is the alteration of nerve activity through targeted delivery of a stimulus such as electrical stimulation or chemical agents to specific neurological sites in the body on august 28 musk and his team unveiled the latest update from the secretive firm neuralink with a demo featuring pigs yes yes pigs implanted with their brain chip links during the demo a screen showed the real time spikes of neurons firing in the brain of one pig gertrude astrid snuffed around her pen during the event there are lots of differences between the current techniques and the neural link which are according to the current medical research the neural computer setup is done by using air hammers and big boxes and wires which is both dangerous and infectious it even requires extra medical supervision and support even i require extra care but do you guys even care huh for information collection it just contains 100 channels per array or 8 to 16 channels per device still it doesn't work always and is insufficient to read and write high bandwidth information it even causes loss of about a cube size brain material can you imagine if this goes wrong while neurolink version 0.9 setup is done by a specialized robot directly into the skull within an hour of you getting into the hospital it is done without normal anesthesia and the patient gets discharged from hospital the same day after the implanting of the link has been done it fits in such a way that it doesn't seem to feel like anything is there neuralink is as small as the size of a big coin and has dimensions just 23 into eight millimeters patience is the key to success my darlings leaving the video on a cliffhanger so that your curiosity soars higher and higher see you next time and until then like comment and subscribe the channel [Music] you
