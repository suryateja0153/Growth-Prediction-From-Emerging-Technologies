 Uh-huh, Emil please Welcome everyone We're gonna close the doors but there's still some people coming in. My name is Ruby cost I'm associate director and CEO of the Zukerman mind brain And behavior Institute and it's really my pleasure to welcome you many of you again To this evening To the Stavros Niarchos foundation brain insight lecture So tonight's lecture series will be special we'll talk about data for good data science at Columbia and Columbia is very lucky to have recruited Professor Jeanette wing to be to head this data science effort across the university and I think we'll hear a lot a lot of us are fearful of what data science can be do but a lot of us are also in all of the new things that it allows from health to society to humanity and We're going to hear about this Let me see better Okay, I'll project so these wonderful lecture series is Only possible through the generosity of the Stavros Niarchos foundation and we have here two Representatives and I would like to ask you everyone to thank them with me for their generosity In addition to supporting these outreach and educational efforts with the lecture series There's a special part Which is this lecture series are transformed in actual lectures, then that are used by teachers to produce contents and so we also have teachers here of around the community and students and So it's really an incredible time at Columbia. We just Opened not so long ago this new building dedicated to understanding what goes on in the brain and of course We are also all passionate about the brain The brain is what makes us love and hate. It's what builds our personalities What makes us? decide What makes us sometimes be nervous about making introductions to our new the Science Institute? Director, but the the amazing thing if you think about it is we're at a unique age In a unique time in the history of humanity where It could be that many of the kids born today will have life expectancies of Well over a hundred years but no one wants to Have a life that doesn't Have a brain associated with it so we don't want to live longer but not remember who we are or What our relatives are or what we like and don't like so Understanding the brain is important to understanding ourselves. It's also important to build a better society Not only health-wise but in education now Today we're gonna hear from Professor wing about the mission of the data Science Institute and for society For Humanity in general and how it impacts technology, but also you hear we hear a lot about Artificial intelligence and you will hear a bit about how artificial intelligence interacts with intelligence And so the hope is that we can learn a lot from artificial intelligence that can help us Preserve the life we like for all this time and the hope is that this dialogue is bi-directional and also like some of our Researchers do use them brain inspired architectures to try to influence data science and artificial intelligence So it's really a pleasure to have Jeanette doing here. She Asked me not to be too long about introducing her but I need to say a few things. She's a truly impressive Scientist and person. She's a leader in the field She got her degree and PhD from MIT And then she went then to be in the leadership of the computer and information science and engineering at NSF then she was the head of the computer science department At Carnegie Mellon, I think twice and then She became the corporate vice president of Microsoft for four or five years and then we were lucky enough to Be able to attract her back to academia and to be the director here Jeannette wings research interests are in areas of trustworthy computing specification and verification concurrent and distributed systems programming languages software engineering and as you'll hear now more AI Networks and as the head of the Institute she brings a lot of experience at Columbia but most importantly a vision for the future and so Today, we're going to hear about that vision she is a member of the National Academy of Arts ins and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for advancement of science and she is and has been in many of the committees that are debating Everything that's going on. So when we fear what's going on? Is someone worried about this is someone debating the evolutions? Yes, and we have such a person so I'm gonna be in complete awe trying to listen to the vision of Jeanette and so Thank You Jeanette welcome and let's hear about data for good Thank you very much I Am honored to actually give this presentation tonight and thank you everyone for coming. I am going to talk about data for good data science at Columbia University and I thought I would start by giving you a bigger picture of the data lifecycle the data life cycle starts with Generating data and there are many sources of generating data We have large scientific instruments like large telescopes neutrino detectors in the South Pole the Large Hadron Collider all of those vary one of expensive in scientific instruments, they generate lots and lots of data, but The new kind of data that people are most interested in Today is the gent the the data that's generated by people the data that's generated by us and someone else is collecting all that data at us and making lots of money off of that data about us and that is part of the scary AI that people like to talk about but in any case people generate data Large instruments don't generate data, even the sensors and devices that are sprayed all around Civil infrastructure generates lots and lots of data. So there's lots of sources with data and that's just this first step After you generate all this data, you collect the data Now you don't always collect all the data you generate and then you go on to process it There's where usually there's compression encryption Data cleaning data wrangling all those steps that you have to do before you even think about storing the data Storing the data in some digital medium usually, but maybe tomorrow it'll be storing data on DNA storage So storing the data and you usually store the data in a way that you can retrieve the data quickly Later, and that's what data management is all about So when you look at how databases are architected a lot of data management goes into that Then there's analysis and this is what is making data science so exciting today Because data analysis includes machine learning data mining, I mean all those fancy techniques that people like to talk about today like deep learning and Reinforcement learning so that's data analysis. And when people talk about data science they sometimes just think about the data analysis, but I want you to think about data science more broadly and then After you analyze the data, you're usually spitting out some numbers So it's not good enough to give the end user a bunch of numbers You actually want to give them some kind of visualization of those numbers like a pie chart or a bar graph But it wasn't until I joined Columbia and I talked to my friends at the ilysm school and this is the journalism school We're sitting in that I came to appreciate the last stage Which I call interpretation but what the journalists call storytelling It's not enough to show pie charts and bar Graphs you actually have to explain to the end-user. What am I seeing? What am I supposed to be getting out of this visualization? So what do I talk about the data lifecycle? I really mean Everything from the very beginning generating the data all the way to the very end were a human being or maybe a bot has to take this interpret interpreted data and do something and Throughout this entire data lifecycle. I Care a lot about the privacy and ethical concerns of the generation collection Analysis and storytelling of all this data. It's one of the New areas in data science that I'm trying to promote in the data Science Institute So what is data science I want to give you a very succinct definition of data science data science is the study of Extracting value from data and the really two key words in this definition one is value and values chose chosen specifically so that it is subject to the interpretation of the end user so value to a scientist is Discovery new knowledge and that's why we have those large scientific instruments that cost a lot of money Collecting all that data because maybe we will find a neutrino but value to a business man or woman is Bottom line and that's why you have all these companies that collect data about us and make a lot of money and their value to a policy maker might be understanding sea level rise to know when should I Have my inhabitants start moving their houses from a from away from the coastline so policymakers can gain a lot of value from data as well and the second word that's important in this definition is Extracting so it takes a lot of work to get that value all that work in that data lifecycle. And so let's not forget that So I have a three-part mission statement for the data Science Institute at Columbia University the first is to advance the state-of-the-art in data science And this is about pushing the frontiers of basic research It's about advancing all the aspects of data of the data lifecycle. I showed you and it is about discovering new knowledge The second speaks to the full-fledged nature of Columbia University which is to transform all fields professions and sectors through the application of data science and indeed the entire University have Has really recognized the importance of data in their research and education many of the faculty and the chairs and the deans have come to me and said I Really need your help. I have this really interesting data set but I don't have any data science expertise so it's a good position to be in when you're in high demand and Finally ensure the responsible use of data to benefit society and to benefit society means using data to tackle those societal grand challenges like healthcare energy climate change social justice and ensure the responsible use of data is really Making sure that we pay attention to the privacy and ethical concerns as we collect data about people and as we analyze this data and tell people about Their behavior or use that data in other ways So to summarize my three-part mission statement, I like to use this three word tagline data for good So just remember that from my talk, just remember data good Columbia University okay data to do good and using data in a good manner We really are University wide as well as university level we have over 300 affiliated faculty from every single school on campus from architecture Arts and Sciences business dentistry engineering international and public affairs journalism law medicine nursing Public Health and Social Work And since I got here, I have also reached out to Barnard College and Teachers College. So we are truly university-wide and every Every school every college is its are they're all participating in the data Science Institute We have a robust industry affiliates program And in want any point in time we have about 25 companies who are industry affiliates industry affiliates have the benefit of working directly with our master students on a capstone product on a course they get to bring in real world data work with a team of students who actually light up their data and you can see we Represent some international companies. They're like Alibaba and Baidu and DeeDee And we have no way from Brazil So I want to go through a few stories Using my mission statement as my index Normally at this point I would tell you about some of the most advanced research that's happening on campus in terms of data science but I was warned that this is a very broad audience and So I thought in for this section of my talk rather than tell you about some fancy-schmancy Expectation-maximization Algorithm, I would actually share you what I think is the state-of-the-art in data science and Why is there so much interest in data science now and the short answer is AI artificial intelligence So the way I like to think of it is data science and artificial intelligence overlapped They're not one is not part of the other they overlap and what's in their intersection is Are many things but one key area that's in their intersection is a subfield called machine learning and It is because of big data that we are seeing the successes of AI and I'm going to get to one of the most profound successes in a second, so today's successes in AI are due to the large amounts of data that We are generating the scientific instruments are generating that we're all generating So what is AI anyway and I always like to go back to the founders of AI when they had a conference at Dartmouth in 1956 and that was really the founding of the field AI and I quote here from the proposal they sent to the government to get funding for that conference because in that proposal they basically say we are thinking about building a machine that can simulate the intelligence of humans and That basically defined what artificial intelligence has meant to be And very early on even at the Dartmouth conference These grandfather's of AI Recognized that the vision they had for building a machine that could simulate human intelligence Was too grandiose a goal and for those of you who follow the media and the literature in this that's Currently called a GI Artificial general intelligence, and we do not we're not close to that yet What the people in 1956? Realize is that humans are so intelligent that maybe what we could better do is break down human activity into separate tasks like speech and language and vision and motion Like walking and maybe we can make a human simulate that tasks like Vision and speech and so on So what spawned out of AI? Were all these subfields of computer vision and computer speech and machine translation and natural language processing and Robotics, all of those ended up being their own fields within artificial intelligence And they all went off their merry way So that is what AI is And now the question is can machines really learn human behavior? What we found was I'd say around 2000 late 90s early 2000s all these separate fields of AI Started using this technique called machine learning Like the computer vision people stopped trying to actually understand this semantics of an image, but just use the machine learning through machine learning at Understanding what was in the image and similarly with speech and natural language processing so on? so now all these separate fields of AI started using common technique and That's what really elevated progress in each of the separate fields and brought everyone together saying hey There's something going on here Maybe we can't actually think about building a machine that can be as intelligent as a human So how do machines learn? What can we really do today? So in the middle, I put this computational model. That's just the computer It could be an algorithm could be a piece of software or just piece of hardware But that's your computational model and if you feed it lots and lots of data say about people what this model can do is Make a recommendation like what movie would you like to watch? That's why you get certain recommendations from Netflix Whereas your neighbor might get different recommendations What kind of Picture what kind of object is in that picture? Is it a cat or is it a dog? That's a classification problem? Or it might make a prediction What are you going to type next? So there's some keyboards that actually predict the word you're typing or the next word. You're going to type That's all using machine learning and the idea is we build we train a model with lots and lots of data so that on a Single person we can make a recommendation We can Classify that person's preferences, or we can make a prediction about that person and that ends up personalizing these computational models So, that's me Okay So let me give you an example This is a very old example, but the example is suppose they have a lot of pictures some of them are easily, we could recognize as faces and others are not faces and The machine learning problem is to find the line that separates the faces from the non faces and Mathematically, that means find a function that Can distinguish between a face and a non face and if I just abstract this a little bit with dots blue dots and red dots I'm trying to find a separator between The red dots and the blue dots the faces and the non faces now in reality But the dots are not so well behaved. Oh And and the idea then is if I have a new dot that comes along and I have the separator. I will easily know Oh, it's a blue dot or a red dot in reality. The dots are not so well behaved they look a little jumbled up and My separators not a clean straight line and I might actually get some of the dots misclassified But in machine learning, that's okay It's good enough to have a function that basically does well enough It gives you an approximation with high probability. If you give me a new dot I can give you the right classification Now this is just red dots and blue dots in two dimensions in reality we have many dimensions say n dimensions as to what we're really learning trying to learn is a Hyperplane for n dimensions. So this gets really complicated when you can have hundreds or Thousands of features in any one object that you're looking to classify But we can do it. That's what's so amazing about current technology So in particular there was a huge breakthrough in 2012 not too long ago And it was a huge success in AI and it happens to be very Remotely related to neuroscience so relevant for today's lecture So what was the 2012 breakthrough a success in AI and how is it related to neuroscience? The answer is deep learning It's also goes under the name deep neural networks And let me explain how it all fits in So remember I told you already that data size and artificial intelligence Overlap and in the intersection is this general area of machine learning? well Inspired by how the brain is wired Deep neural networks are architected to be sort of like how the brain is wired and That is why I draw a dotted line for the neuroscience part of this Venn diagram Neural networks were inspired by the brain, but it's just a metaphor. So don't take it too seriously Although I continue to be astonished by the successes of deep learning and Where does it fit in? Well it fits right there in the middle. It's a kind of machine learning technique Inspired by the brain and This is such a profound achievement that just this year the three people who founded deep learning yoshua, bengio Geoff Hinton and Yann laocoön Won the 2019 ACM Turing award, which is con the Nobel Prize of computing So this is really quite a recognition to these three People and I wanted to just make a side remark that I knew geoff hinton When we were both at carnegie mellon together, I was a junior faculty and he was a bit more senior But I remember he used to talk about these neural networks Inspired by the brain and how you know, he was going to build a computer that was going to look like the brain and this is the back in the 80s and all of us kind of smiled We really thought well, you know, he people can work on whatever they want. That's the beauty of academia But he kept plugging at it And others came along after Oregon laocoön did a lot of his best work in deep learning When he was at Bell Labs, and yasha been geo worked with him there. And so these people are still doing great work and really True heroes to AI and machine learning and computer science so what how does a deep neural network look and how do you build this function that's supposed to Do some kind of classification or prediction. So let's suppose I want to build a classifier for cat images so the way you do this is You have to feed in a lot of images of cats and they're all labeled Cat Cat Cat Cat and you feed this into this architecture Which is really just layers of neurons. The black dots are neurons They're just notes, but they're called neurons and the Edges are like synapses, but really they're just edges and Um, the outputs from one layer are the inputs to the next and these nodes are actually computing sophisticated functions, they're nonlinear functions usually and What is traversing on the edges are weights? They're usually real value numbers. So at the very end After you feed in all these cotton ajiz, you have some numbers on all the edges such that if I feed in a new image that it hasn't seen before and It's a cat it will with high probability say it's a cat And I feed it a different image and With high probability we'll say it's not a cat So that is the bottom line of what deep neural networks are But what is so amazing, is that this one idea? Has shown applicability everywhere So this is just back to faces This shows you a kind of neural network that has a little more structure it Recognizes faces and I wanted to show you a little bit of the insides that you can see as you go further Towards the output layers. There's actually more information about the face that the network is learning So by key by this layer, you're actually seeing some features of the face And then by the end layer, you're actually recognizing faces And this is true of any neural network that you're training on somehow by magic As it goes through all these layers. It's learning more and more about the images you're feeding in and Neural networks are used not just your images, but it's used for speech and machine translation and all sorts of things so the Stanley art to summarize in terms of where we are in deep learning is that face recognition is basically a solved problem and I remember when I was at Microsoft In 2014. We were sitting around a dinner table in 2014. That was only five years ago We're sitting around a dinner table saying where do you think AI will be in five years and and we're and these are all AI experts and my boss who is a computer vision expert said, I think we're gonna solve face recognition in five years and We all looked at in saying wow, that's really a bold statement But it happened in less than five years from 2014 and so things moved really quickly Speech recognition, if anyone has an Alexa on their kitchen table, it's got deep neural networks in there recognizing your speech Machine translation so translating between two different languages deep neural networks are helping you do that so if you use Skype translator If you go to Google Translate every time you get a letter in a different language from a loved one You could just type that in that's deep learning behind the scenes all these vision systems that deep neural networks are good for they are in your self-driving cars and They are in your Tesla if you are happen to have a Tesla So this is real stuff now, it's not Experimental it's not in the lab it's in your home and I think what really? Moved The needle was when deep learning and reinforcement learning the combination of those two techniques Were used in the machine that beat the human goal player Not only did that Make a lot of press but I think that was a a nudge for China to really move big in AI So that's state of the art in terms of AI and medical imaging not just deep learning there are Many many startup companies in this space and there's still some research interesting research projects going on. I There's there's a contrast in depending on who you talk to There was a survey sent to many computer scientists recently from radiologists at Stanford and they wanted to know basically the survey Expressed an anxiety on their part on whether their jobs are going to be taken over by machines so they were asking us computer scientists, so there's some anxiety already in the medical community about whether With this AI computer visioning capability whether People like radiologists and so on I wouldn't say whether their jobs will be replaced But whether their jobs certainly will be enhanced by these techniques On the other hand. I have a friend who's a pathologist and she doesn't believe in any of this So you get these different reactions? Okay Transform all fields professions and sectors through the application of data science and here I'd like to breeze through a little bit and share with you some of the exciting research going on here at Columbia University in different fields whether they are using AI machine learning deep learning data science and so on this is this is beyond just deep learning It's really about how different fields are using data science. I will however start with Neural networks, and I will I deliberately chose this example because it intersects with neuroscience So this is really hot off the press March 2019 a paper that was presented by some colleagues of mine on neuroscience and deep learning and as you know there are two main ways in which we take images of the brain one is Through EEG s where we get very good temporal resolution of a few points on our brain And the other is fMRI scans where we get whole scans of our brain good spatial resolution and Their question is why can't we use both? To maybe get more information But before getting to that They wanted to see if they could build a model and they built what are called convolutional neural networks for One kind of data to see if it could predict the other kind of data and vice versa So they built two two convolutional neural networks One is a transcoder between EEG and fMRI data and the other the other way And got good results, but this was all on simulated data. It's it's a nice first step though Another example from the biology world this is nothing to do with deep learning just a lot of data Was understanding the tumor microbiome to combat cancer. So this group of authors Looked at the bacteria at the microbiome around Pancreatic tumor cancer cells and they discovered that the microbiome was counteracting the effect of the chemotherapy treatment Not very good like that makes her chemotherapy completely ineffective and they used the genetic sequencing of the microbiome the bacteria to discover this But they won one step further and they saw that if you injected the tumour cells with an antibiotic then the Antibiotic would counter act the effect of the microbiome therefore making the chemotherapy treatment effective So it's a good story in the end. This is all a nice However, oh, I'm mice so they still have a ways to go But it was already an interesting discovery Another science story comes from my colleagues in the Astronomy Department They as many astronomers look at lots and lots of images of the sky from those large Expensive telescopes and what they do is what they and others are trying to do is understand the Big Bang model And what they showed again interestingly using convolutional neural networks They showed that using these Convolutional neural networks. They were able to better Estimate the parameters of the Big Bang model than off-the-shelf traditional statistical techniques So this is one of these wow, that's great and then and then the question is Yeah, I wish we could really understand how deep learning really works But this is also this was first on simulation data and now they're going to do it on real data. I Mean some completely different sector I have colleagues in Financial engineering and in business who use machine learning and specifically in this case reinforcement learning In in this whole area called Robo advising So if you're lucky enough to be wealthy and you have a personal advisor You usually interact with your personal advisor every few months and over time your personal advisor learns your preferences You know, do you like to put all your money in the stock market? Or do you like to put all your money under your mattress? or somewhere in between And it but it takes time to learn Ones preferences and as the market changes, of course your preferences change What this group of people did is to automate that? using this technique called reinforcement learning to basically Automatically learn your preferences your your fur investment And they basically found through a very short number of iterations of the algorithm They could learn your preferences, you know in in minutes as opposed to months or years this work is so new that the authors are still looking for a Citibank or JP Morgan or a Chase to give them data so they can test out their techniques Now for something completely different We have what I like to think of as a very modern history Department History faculty who are well versed in machine learning And other kinds of AI and data science techniques in this particular case they use a technique called topic modeling - - as to scan all the Documents that they've accumulated and to look for interesting events. So this history department Matt Connolly in particular Has amassed the largest set of declassified documents So as you know, the United States government every year declassify its a set of documents and what they've done is that they snarf them all all Up and they put them in one repository in this particular example, they looked at Kable grams sent between diplomats in the 1970s and they looked at all the the contents of the table capable grands the - and the from the subject fields and they basically Did word analysis on the cable grams and topic modeling to discover what they would what they called? unusual events Thinking that an unusual event might align with a real historical event and sure enough They looked at all these cable grams in the 1970s and every black dot rep represents an unusual event So you'll recognize some of them the evacuation of Saigon the death amounts of tongue and so on So we have a lot of breadth of use of data science at Columbia now what I wanted to focus on is the last part of a mission statement, which is data for good responsible use of data and I'd like to talk about responsible use of data in terms of this five letter acronym I'm not too happy with this an acronym. That's more than three or four letters is not a good acronym But it lets me remember the things I need to talk about. So fairness accountability transparency and ethics These are the words that people you are you hear and read about a lot You've been reading a lot for instance in the news about Biased algorithms or should I more Accurately say biased data that's fed into algorithms Then then create biased models Accountability transparency ethics safety and reliability security and privacy that that's the one story I want to share with you and It has to it goes back to the computer vision system I mentioned before So as I mentioned these deep learning based computer vision systems are in Our cars are in your self-driving cars or your Tesla's And maybe some of more advanced luxury cars What this group of researchers did is they showed how you can take an image? That's classified in one way and just systematically Modify that image to make it get classified the wrong way. So what this image is is a rut boat turning a Curving to the left with a guardrail there and if you imagine driving the car you want your car to make sure that you veer to the left But by just darkening this image the car if the self-driving car will think Oh veered to the right and Then you hit the guardrail fall off the cliff and die and that's why they detect fatal flaws and they found thousands of such vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art vision systems based on deep learning So that's not good and That's why there's reason to be concerned The good news is that we have researchers who are trying to understand on Where things are going wrong? Or at least come up with tools and testing techniques To make sure that what systems are deployed or safer and more secure safer and more secure Okay, what about tackling societal Grand Challenges and here I really have You know great colleagues working on really hard problems So let me start with social justice we have a great collaboration between Faculty in the Social Work school and in our computer science department who have been studying They've been studying the tweets that Chicago gang members send each other and the idea is if you And it's the idea is this um, if you can understand through the tweets that people are sending each other that people are feeling Aggressive Then maybe that's a good time to intervene maybe us through social worker or law enforcement It turned out that this language in with which the Chicago gang members Talk to each other in tweets is its own language? There was no other language that looked like that. So we had a natural language processing expert in our computer science department come in and help Basically parse the language figure out a grammar for the language a lot of the Words are emoticons or images or Abbreviations and they basically did a parts of speech analysis of this gang language and They were able to build a classifier for these tweets that can determine whether the tweet is detecting is expressing a feeling of loss or a feeling of aggression How other Topic is climate science Of course Columbia University has the world's experts in climate science with the earth Institute and lamont-doherty And this particular project is a software project. That is providing an open source platform for Climate modelers to put their data their models their algorithms the results all on one platform So everyone can share their results. I Mean they're using this or ready to do prediction and hydrology meteorology and all sorts of other aspects of climate science one video I would like to play for you is a simulation of the ocean currents On our on earth This is really just a big data problem This is simulating two petabytes of data and it's predicted this year next by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC that we will have 100 petabytes of data ready to be simulated on our supercomputers Just to contrast my understanding is the human brain can store up to about 2.5 petabytes of data So we're talking about a hundred petabytes of data Coming fast and furious that our climate scientists are going to relish in needing to simulate My last story on Data to do good is in health care and big data. So Columbia University is the coordinating Center for this huge international project called Odyssey it stands for Observational health data Sciences and informatics its goal is to have 1 billion patient records currently it has 600 million patient records 600 millions to remember the population of the u.s. Is much less than 600 million the there 25 different countries over 80 Databases are accessed through this federated Project and I wanted to share with you a couple of results observational research results that they were able to tell By looking at just the data. So these are 600 million Electronic health records. So for those of you who are an IT, and I know at least one of you in the audience is this means These 25 countries these 80 clinics that are sharing their data with each other Had to agree on a standard and They did So that is when you can do that represents one of those 80 data sets in the Federated data set. I'm only for each of the Diseases here. I'm only just showing you three So for instance the topmost on hypertension C UMC is Columbia University Medical Center? So if you ever went to Columbia University Medical Center For hypertension you're in that data set And what they discovered is for? So the way to read this ring of circles is for any for the disease that you might be diagnosed with There's a line of treatment a line a series of drugs that you're given to treat you for that disease So they start you out with one drug. So let's Let's say that's the the inner circle the chartreuse color drug if that works then fine But if that doesn't work, they give you a second drug and that represents the second ring So that might be that's some drug that's represented by the color red if that works then fine If that doesn't work, they give you a third drug and so on and so forth so that's why you have Each H Radius in that circle is a single patient and you can see that some patients take maybe three or four drugs Before they get better So what they found is? For hypertension if you collapse and I'm not showing you the collapse here if you collapse All of the records that they use for this study and they use 250 million records for this They showed that this is around the world now They showed that One-fourth of the patients in that dataset are treated uniquely One force that is Amazing for hypertension. You would think there's kind of a standard treatment everyone gets it and it works so that was that was not something you'd do a clinical trial on and discover that you only discover by looking at the data and Then you start asking questions So, let me give you one more story about this since I went through all this trouble to tell you how to read these rings This is the diabetes column and For the most part all the rings a circle look like the the top two in other words that chartreuse drug Does a good job for most people? This one down below was the outlier and this one comes from a Japanese medical center and It turns out by looking at this the research researchers discovered that the Japanese are genetically disposed Against that chartreuse drug So that's why you can see it didn't work for Vidya the Japanese I had to take four or five other drugs or the doctors knew not to even prescribe it That was also discovered by looking at the data and Now they're trying to understand why and of course I asked my colleague George rip sak who is behind this study and the coordinator for Columbia I said, well, what about the Chinese and the And he said no that it was only for the Japanese. So this is really interesting I don't know why but that's for the medical scientists to figure out Okay. So now in my last few minutes I Try to relate to the neuroscience part of this lecture I wanted to just close with some speculation about the future what's ahead for data science AI and neuroscience and Ovules obviously part of my answer is that there are many opportunities in neuroscience using data science and AI That are yet to be explored at the same time there are many challenges in data science and AI that Continue to hold but what I thought would be interesting to explore Is this this? bilateral Relationship between neuroscience and AI so remember what I said that deep neural networks were inspired by the brain At the same time what has happened is of course Neuroscientists are using deep learning and other fancy Machine learning techniques to actually discover New science about the brain and that's wonderful So now maybe it's time for us to see Let's look at the human brain circuitry a little more in detail and add some of the complexity that the human brain really has to this simplified deep neural network And this is not my idea, but I think it's a great idea it Was written in an article just published and He proposes a few research questions with which I wanted to share with you First of all the neuron itself in my diagram. It's just a simple node. There's a function that it computes based on the input input Edges from the left on thee and it spits out some output on the right But neurons and the brain are much more complicated. They have differents They're different types. They have different structures Then maybe there's something that we should we could do to add some more complexity to our deep neural networks in terms of adding more complexity to our neurons That's one thing the other is the connectivity Again The deep neural networks are very Hierarchical they basically go from left to right in some Networks you see some loops on And those are recurrent neural networks but there's in in our brain connectivity is much richer and I'm more complicated than this kind of simple hierarchical connectivity and then there are deeper questions, like what aspects of biological circuitry are computationally essential that seems like a profound perhaps philosophical question, but as a computer scientist, I always like to think about Computational complexity and what problems can and cannot be solved by computers? And Then finally what are human learning tasks that elude dnns? and here I go back to you know AI and and its roots and you know that they Advanced artificial general intelligence the dream of building a machine that can be as intelligent as a human and I think about how Babies and children learn and how we we we don't know how they learn we can't We can't we can't even come close to building a machine that can learn as Well as much however Babies and children learn and so there's some things we can do really well they drive our cars But some things we still don't know understand and by the way babies do not need to be fed thousands and thousands of pictures Before they can learn what a cat is So there's still something we don't understand With that. Thank you very much So we have time for some questions, please use the microphone there I know there are high school students back there dying to ask me questions When I was an undergraduate here at the engineering school, I never heard any talk about ethics So when my son went to MIT and took course six I said to him Please look into ethics courses I'm surprised in this day and age especially in light of what's going on with Facebook and Some of the things that you mentioned that it's not a required course for every undergraduate student Can you tell us what Columbia has planned going forward? It's an excellent question and it concerns me as much as you and I'm glad you brought it up When I first got to Columbia I asked where where is the data ethics part of the data science master's program and it's part of the capstone course but I it to me was insufficient and That was before Facebook and Cambridge analytic and the Russian hacking of our elections. It was just me being Who I am But since then because now Zuckerberg had to testify in front of Congress and bla bla bla bla bla data, ethics has been Really come to the fore for data science and computer science The computer science department at Columbia does offer data ethics course and the engineering school does offer professional development Week a week or two where data ethic or ethics in engineering is covered but I think especially for data it's important to to kind of really Emphasize it more. I was just at a retreat with the computer science department, and we talked a lot about Not just making it a course that's optional, but how to inculcate ethics in the entire computer science curriculum So some of my colleagues just got a grant from the Mozilla Foundation To do exactly that so we have three faculty who have volunteered for their courses to be guinea pigs And we'll see how that goes. So there's action being taken Here at Columbia University in this space. Thank you Just as a follow-up to that question, I wonder if you'd address the imbuing of ethics and morality in the machines and I use as an example the self-driving car and maybe Try it example Which I'm a journalist I've covered car tech and so I've been discussing with people and certain interviews on occasion The idea that the car will have to decide Whether it hits a bus and kills the passengers or swerves and kills a kid on a bicycle. Can you address that? Yes, this is commonly known in the ethics community as the trolley car problem So this is an old ethical question where the trolley car Switch operator has to decide there are two tracks that the trolley car is coming down There's two tracks on one track. There's one Man tied down and the other track there's like three boys tied down And this switch men has to make the decision. Do I kill this one person on these three people and in in ethics? This is its. You don't actually have to solve this problem You you just philosophize about it. But now it's it's a real problem and it's a real problem because some Algorithm or some piece of software is going to have to make that decision And one may want to get to my answer in a second, but I wanted to say that The DSi has a seed grants Awards program and we gave a secret award last year To a project that is looking at how to negotiate both human driven cars with autonomous cars on the road at the same time And they specifically wanted to address the ethical issues So they brought in a faculty member from the law school to help them think about the ethical issues He has since really grabbed onto that one down to this problem and just published a law review article on The kinds of questions you're asking There's a very cold way to think about How this problem may eventually get solved and that is you do a calculation Which means someone is weighing something against something else and then there are external entities like Insurance companies and lawyers and and whatnot regulators to Police and monitor the situation I Don't have any answer to the trolley car problem But I think it's tip of the iceberg speaking of MIT MIT put out a little Tester ethics On this very problem I had I don't know 20 30 different scenarios of the trolley car problem do and you're supposed to answer that or that and you can see it's very uncomfortable after the five cent first buy scenarios So I I I don't know how the car companies right now are thinking about it. I Don't know What? What decisions that are making but it's a good question because it's not rhetorical anymore So my context my question is based on the fact that I I entered a competition here at Columbia Which was titled the yeast use of blockchain in clinical trial recruitment and trial management with addressing the feasibility of a cryptocurrency to Help increase that what are your views on collecting data in the healthcare industry in particular like clinical trials and clinical management? Which could expand the side-effects to individuals which could include like suicidal behavior harm to others or create other side effects How do you think data should be used in the healthcare system? specifically that and what ethical and moral aspects should people consider when implementing like blockchain in Certain sectors because there's also different things to consider like change like the exchange of information between different Hospitals and like you gave the example of like the different hospitals and how much information the patient can know themselves About the internal data that's getting exchanged. Um okay, let me You ask a lot of questions in that statement let me Let me answer a couple of them So so I guess oh Sorry So I guess the first one would be how should people consider Exchanging data in between systems in particular the healthcare system with consideration to their okay. Let me ask that question they answer that question, so I actually do research in privacy and Believe it or not. There are what I call privacy preserving technologies that have mathematically provable guarantees that can allow two entities to share data in a manner where Both entities can benefit from the pooled data and neither entity can see the others The techniques are based on cryptography Not the blockchain stuff Some of these techniques have been around since 1982 These were seemingly theoretical techniques But now they have come into practice They are being used to solve point solutions for point problems And they scale for the point solutions I'm thinking about specifically techniques like secure multi-party computation for any of those who might know about that a more recent technique that was invented by or Solved it was a problem that was outstanding and solved by Craig country in 2009 in His PhD thesis he's now at IBM Is a different crypto Cryptographic based technique called hum morphic encryption and this is where you can store data on one site and some other person or some other site can Actually perform computations on the encrypted value of the data and neither the host The host of this data can never see your query or the results of the query so that's Homomorphic encryption it is also being used for Point Problems with point solutions and and finally, there's a technique called Differential privacy which has gotten the news recently because census 2020 is Talking about using it This is not a cryptographic based technique. It's more statistical in nature Where you're adding noise to the output before you actually give the final result to the end user what I'm really trying to say is that there are technologies that can come to play to light up the scenarios you're talking about to ensure the privacy of the data sets that say hospitals have Data about patients so that gives me a little hope that You know the but what you're concerned about can be addressed from a technological point of view There are these already a lot of regulation that keeps hospitals clinics Researchers in check in the healthcare space and That's really a good thing. The first person who asked me a question was really remarking that Unlike in Medicine law journalism and business we're Trained as a professional with ethics in mind unlike those fields in engineering and science and now data science We haven't made it a requirement So I think that's where the emphasis has to happen at the same time. I speak to the Dean the public health school she Oversees the biostatistics department Columbia University and she's recognizing this the new ethical issues Being raised because of the collection of data about people in ways that people may not even know about So I think you're you're raising a very good question and we are still in the midst of solving it What are your views on? using data collection and different Systems like blockchain technology to collect patient information for clinical trials and clinical management. Do you have any ethical? Insights about that. I think I think more generally I'm not sure blotchiness complete is Relevant to your question at all. It's just a technology So I think it's a red herring and your question I think the question is what are my views on collecting health data about people and The general rule of thumb is that if people who volunteered their data? For usually for the good of science or for the good of research. I Think that's great If people are not opting in or giving their data for the good of science or our research Then I think there's a question of why are you collecting this data? What are you going to use it for? Thank you. I Pose that question because say some network included insurance companies and America doesn't have universal healthcare so depending if insurance company has had access to their blockchain technology, like the the patient files blockchain technology, you can't really tamper with it and it's encrypted so it would probably Influence how certain patients are insured depending on if insurance companies had access to that technology and data So that was just my concern about ethical ethical perspectives But thank you Hi I wanted to know on that Odyssey database How did so many institutions or how did how do you or whoever organized that or in with so many? institutions medical organizations to participate in that You would have to ask my colleague George rib sack I think it's pretty amazing it is which is why I wanted to share this pretty amazing Columbia story with you George rib sack is the the chair the bio medical informatics department at the Columbia University Medical Center And he you know, I think he has daily, but certainly weekly phone calls with the 80 participating Organizations and they just are on top of things. It takes very coordinated effort But people see value out of that. I'm at IBM and I'm just yeah, I was yeah curious as that hell I'd be happy to link you two together. I don't know would IBM want to contribute? I don't know, but my calculus. Thank you This is asking you to speculate do you think they will ever come a time in areas like Medicine climate science and so on that there will be enough data to be able to talk about Not probabilities but certainties In other words, can you get beyond spec? Can you get beyond informed speculation? I I I Suspect not Because if you think about nature I mean, this is Snell's not being not speculative but being philosophical If I think about nature Nature is unpredictable There's inherent randomness and We were always going to have to deal with uncertainty If you think about human beings so many of my friends who are in robotics Tear their hair out because They there's those poor little robots have to interact in a completely unpredictable Environment like a human being will step in its way and That's what makes building robots so difficult and that's all even in a controlled environment. You can never You can never know what's going to happen. And so that's Indian controlled environment and then you think about mother nature and She's maybe deliberately unpredictable That's precisely why I asked the question But wouldn't you isn't better to have life is non-deterministic rather than deterministic yes well, we're any other philosophical note I Just wanted to thank Janette for this absolutely fabulous lecture I hope this stimulates your brains again We thank the Stavros Niarchos foundation for the amazing support for making this possible and if you want to get engaged with Supporting neuroscience or supporting data science at Columbia. Please talk to us I hope to see you at our next event in the fall. Thank you so much. Good evening
