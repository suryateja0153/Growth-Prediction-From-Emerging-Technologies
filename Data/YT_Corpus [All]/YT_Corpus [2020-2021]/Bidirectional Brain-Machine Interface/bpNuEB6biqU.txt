 those who use nicotine during adolescence, independent of whether they continue to use nicotine or tobacco products later on in life that adolescent exposure can actually produce or predispose these individuals to later on depressive and anxiety like phenotypes so it's almost like the tobacco industry lie oh you wouldn't see it like that no of course not hello and welcome to another episode of first-person science thoroughly exploring neuroscience research articles featuring first-hand perspectives and narratives from the authors themselves by introducing a new way to discover and engage with neuroscience based research we are breaking down barriers to science communication to encourage collaboration and discussion with scientists and the public alike my name is dr. Paul Shepard I'll be your host this week and I'm chatting with somebody that if you listen to the podcast or if you watch the podcast you might be familiar with you might be confused why he's not the one talking right now I'm talking to Roger Hudson Roger how you doing - that really well Paul thanks so much for being on the show today and having me on I mean you invited yourself on - that's fine Rogers the PhD candidate at Western University here in London Ontario I say here because I'm also here he's a Vanier scholar and a frequent host of this very program I guess this is a good point to mention that obviously I know Roger but full disclosure Roger and I actually know each other from when we were at university of guelph yeah it was a while back goes back probably five or six years now right when you were doing your PhD yeah I bet I was a TA when I first met you I was a TA in neurochemical basis of behavior that's right yeah one of my favorite classes got me all prepared for actually understanding the literature and got me to where we are today the first time I met you Roger you came into office hours to try to get more marks on a midterm you know what that but that just that just speaks to your character you're the kind of person who wants to know where you went wrong and to fix it for the next time all right so it's actually it's actually a good thing I appreciate you framing it like that so Rogers joining us today as he has a paper that's he published ahead of print in the journal addiction biology for those unfamiliar a number of journals will put out papers in an online format ahead of the official publication so it's being peer-reviewed it's accepted for publication they have essentially a finalized version it just hasn't made its way into a correct volume or issue at this point so Roger before we get to your paper can you give us a sort of a bird's eye view of what your research overall is about here at Western I particularly look at the interaction between THC and CBD and how they produce psychosis versus anti-psychotic effects in different brain regions however for this project we're actually looking at how adolescent nicotine exposure can induce long-term depressive and anxiety like phenotypes or behaviors and this is somewhat of a controversial area there has been a lot of propaganda put out by the tobacco companies claiming that tobacco can actually cure melancholia or depression okay but more recent research when you're actually looking at large-scale thousands and thousands of individuals within these epidemiological studies those who use nicotine during adolescents independent of whether they continue to use nicotine or tobacco products later on in life that an adolescent exposure can actually produce or predispose these individuals to later on depressive and anxiety like phenotypes so it's almost like the tobacco industry lied oh you wouldn't see it like that no of course not yeah that's really interesting so they they were claiming for a number of years that it's having the complete opposite effect of essentially what it is absolutely and to their point or not not really to their point because they made these claims decades before any research but legitimate research was actually established on the subject but there is a fair amount of research to show that nicotine is a stimulant drug it enhances concentration in motivation and it can actually avert some of these depressive or anxiety like profiles at the particular doses at a very acute level that we're not talking about long-term exposure here and certainly not during adolescence but under particular circumstances nicotine can be an enhancing drug so your new paper is titled add illicit whoo adolescent nicotine induces depressive and angiogenesis through earth one two and a KT GSK three pathways and neuronal dysregulation in the nucleus accumbens it's a title both full for sure yeah can you you've started doing that but could give us the the gist of what the papers about yeah so like we were just talking about we know that mood and anxiety disorders represent a factor for me gatinha use and simultaneously the use of nicotine containing raw is predictive of depression or anxious symptomatology it was long thought to be a case of chicken or the egg which one causes what however nicotine dependence itself is a substance use disorder that typically developed during adolescence which we all know is a critical period for brain development and here we can see that again from the human studies that have been done that adolescent exposure so during those teenage years or pre teenage years if you're being exposed to nicotine before the brain is fully developed you're at greater risk for depression and anxiety disorders later in life this study in particular that we conducted is an extension off of a previous paper published from our laboratory that focused on what happens behaviorally at the adolescent versus adulthood level when you're exposed to nicotine and we see that these effects are specifically isolated to when you're exposed to nicotine during adolescence when you're exposed long-term nicotine is during adulthood we do not see any of these depressive or anxiety like profiles okay so it seems to be sort of this very vulnerable stage and adolescence absolutely yes and then as an extension of that paper that was published in cerebral cortex a few years ago we looked at the exact molecular signaling pathways that are mediating the depressive versus anxiety-like effects specifically and we find that to a certain extent the irk signaling pathway is what regulates more of the anxiety-like profiles whereas the GS k3 pathway as you spoke to earlier is more related to those depressive life profiles although there is a large extent of overlap between the two systems given how ubiquitous they are throughout the brain and through the brain area that we're looking at the nucleus accumbens okay so all right we mentioned you're interested in the nucleus accumbens I know it I'm not an addiction researcher but I know it to be involved in a number of addiction and motivation related behaviors why were you particularly interested for this study in the nucleus accumbens the the study that we actually base this one off the the initial study from our lab that looked at the adolescent versus adulthood exposure they specifically looked at different molecular signaling pathways as well as the actual neuronal activity profiles we use electrophysiology in the in a different brain region the prefrontal cortex which we know is also it's a part of the frontal lobe it's very much involved in that executive functioning planning and has been very much implicated in depression and anxiety and several other psychiatric disorders the nucleus accumbens shell which is the sub region of the nucleus accumbens but we specifically focused on here in our study it's critically involved in goal directed and motivated behaviors and acts as a neural nexus point for linking top-down executive functions and bottom-up affective responses so we specifically looked at this brain region because it's been unexplored within this context and we know that it's involved in these depression and anxiety like profiles so to be able to link certain molecular signaling Cascades to these later on disorders or the phenotypes that represent these disorders in animals is a very big step forward to being able to treat these disorders but design preventatives and treatments for those who are experiencing this currently sure absolutely in this paper and coming from the previous paper you delve into some of the molecular mechanisms particularly focusing on cell signaling Cascades so I guess one question is what are cell signaling Cascades or pathways and I mean from the title we know which you're looking at but which ones are you looking at and why so we actually assess a large spectrum of different cell signaling Cascades the Purkinje is key three pathways ended up being the ones that were significantly linked to some of these depressive and anxiety-like phenotypes like we were just discussing the reason that we were looking at these cell signaling pathways is because in the past conventionally typically any drug that's designed to treat neuropsychiatric disorders name it antidepressants anti-anxiety medications they're typically designed to act on a specific receptor subtype so for example the most ubiquitous antidepressants would be selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs and these act on the reuptake transporter of these serotonin neurons to you know enhance the amount of serotonin that's in the synapse and that's available to act on these receptors thing is these drugs aren't very selective for the disorders that they're trying to treat if you take a drug through your mouth it's gonna dissolve into your body eventually it's gonna reach your brain but there's these serotonin receptors first of all not only in your brain but all throughout your body which causes many of these side effects that we see when individuals begin taking these medications by understanding how the molecular signaling Cascades are functioning in these disorders and how they actually fit into this whole puzzle is that the receptors they will say a serotonin receptor when it's activated it's actually going to send a signal into the cell to allow the cell to talk to each other to say okay well this receptor was activated let's start this process to try up regulate this protein these molecular signaling Cascades are able to be a little bit more selective yeah and I personally have done some work with RNA KT in the past and they're in a lot of different regions and they do a lot of different things but there are good targets for a lot of things because they are because they are involved in so many things but they are also very specific to region method of activation etc etc absolutely they up regulate and down regulate in different ways and in responses to different experiences all throughout different regions of the brain and so we can manipulate this on a brain region specific level in order to hopefully achieve the effects that we're trying to get to absolutely so with this study in the study that you previously did you do see this marked difference between adolescent and adult exposure and I guess that's particularly relevant now with there seems to be almost a shift towards younger ages for first exposure to nicotine now right yeah and it seems to be it's a great point it kind of reverses the trends that we were seeing for decades we were seeing a reduction in tobacco use and nicotine use especially in these younger age groups that were being more heavily educated and exposed to the idea and the hypothesis that has turned out to be very very true that tobacco is dangerous and it's not very good for your health however we're now seeing this resurgence of nicotine use especially among younger age groups than we've ever seen it before in our deaf country's we're seeing individuals in middle school in elementary schools that are using nicotine based products these electronic vapes the eve Apes the jewels yeah this is a huge public health risk not only because we don't know exactly the effects of this vaporized nicotine if it actually is exponentially healthier than actual cigarettes smoking has some are claiming it is but the health risks in that domain are still to be determined yeah but besides that altogether we have this increased risks of depression and anxiety that are associated with adolescent exposure nicotine so this is a huge problem that I think needs to be addressed big time yeah and I know that the the comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders with nicotine addiction is particularly hard or has been particularly hard to pin causality on because the sort of the the nail in the coffin is that you can't run a perfect experiment with nicotine exposure because you can't expose or with with the human population because you can't have randomized groups where oh you're gonna give you guys nicotine and you none because that's not ethical so it's really from what I've got from what you're saying is that your paper was really trying to pin down sort of some molecular and causal effects of this adolescent nicotine exposure to the later life mood and anxiety issues absolutely awesome so let's get into it I guess some a couple of things that we should talk about before we get to a lot of the experimental stuff are what are your subjects and you did some surgeries on them let's get that stuff covered and then we can get into the the more experimental minute manipulation yeah so we expose these these males Sprague Dawley rats to the nicotine administered over three time points throughout the day so as they're not getting all of the nicotine at once but this is equivalent to about a pack a day for during adolescence after that 10-day period we leave them in their home cages for another couple of weeks to allow them to grow up into adulthood and ten days before we're about to start our behavioral experiments we'll insert little cannula or essentially little tubes into the nucleus accumbens shell the brain region that were interested in looking at within this study and we put them in there in order to administer the drugs through these cannula so that the drugs are able to access that exact area of the brain without accessing any other regions and the drugs that were actually administering our cells signaling cascade inhibitors so by specifically administering these pharmacological inhibitor drugs into the nucleus accumbens we chose a reverse translational approach to investigate possible overlapping features of these two models and I think it's a really powerful approach because it allows us to assess from from what we know from the human population bring it back into our rats understand the mechanisms that are responsible for these depression like symptoms or anxiety like symptoms and then with that information bring it back to the human population hopefully being able to develop some treatments preventative measures for individuals that have already been exposed to nicotine during adolescence and they have no choice in the matter now or for those that may be vulnerable in the future so how did you give these rats rats nicotine did you give them like little rat sized cigarettes or little little rat vapes right so no we actually administered it through injection ah it's a little bit different of our supply so in the pharmacokinetics of the drug typically when somebody's inhaling it they're gonna get the nicotine into their system a little bit quicker the effects are not as immediate but the overall amount of nicotine that enters the system is identical your nicotine exposure with the adolescent group you aged them I gave them the surgery so you could have the direct localized manipulations and the nucleus accumbens ciao and then what sort of assets did you do behavioral yeah so first it's important to point out some of the molecular results which we all right obtained after running some of these behavioral experiments we took a subset of our animals and took the nucleus come into shell from the brain in order to assay four different molecular signaling cascades we assayed for several molecular signaling Cascades initially and we only show here the irk akt GSK 3 and dopamine d1 and d2 receptor expression okay because they are the most relevant for the story that we were showing here but essentially here in Figure one going through the panels a through D we can see that nicotine exposure strongly increases phosphorylation of accumbens earth-1 - without affecting total work expression levels and this is important because it allows us to say that independent of the total level of protein are of oak protein within this brain area that the activation of the irk itself is at a much higher level after adolescent nicotine exposure and this is 30 days following adolescent nicotine exposure this is a persistent effect very similarly we see a up regulation of the phosphorylation observed within the akt signaling pathway and we also see an increase in the phosphorylation within the GS k3 pathway lastly we also assessed dopamine receptor expression within the accumbens and the reason we looked at is because down regulation of within humans that's known as the ventral striatum but it's a functional homologous brain region as the nucleus accumbens but we see here that the ventral Strayed I mean humans d1 and d2 receptor expression is largely reduced in major depressive disorder and depression related disorders and here we kind of observe a selective effect on the d1 receptor expression within the accumbens similar to what we previously found in the PFC with the cerebral cortex to think that I keep mentioning before and this could be indicative of a compensatory mechanism to possibly account for the hyperactive dopamine state that we see in the VTA that was shown in the previous paper I think it bears mentioning with this figure that when you're looking at it phospho work is activated Eric mmm-hmm these molecules get phosphorylated and then they sort of they sort of pass the baton to the next molecule they get phosphorylated then they phosphorylate the next protein where absolutely total arc is your total amount of protein yes they're part of the same pathway and it's it's very it's complicated those pathways are there's something else I'm sure you've looked at number of the different diet again worked with them before so I know you've you've probably seen a number of the diagram so it's like oh how they're involved in Alzheimer's and it's signaling one way and then you look at another disorder and it's signaling another way absolutely you know and all of these different images or figures illustrations they're made by the research group for their particular context or for the story that they're telling so of course it's going to work in multiple different ways and it will depending on the context but here yet in general a KT will signal into GSK three and it's not very surprising that we see an increase in both the phosphorylation of both of them given that they're so well connected that diversity of damn stream signaling is also a strength of this as a potential therapeutic target yes absolutely great point what do you what about knee adult exposed animals yes so like I was saying in order to assess what relatively how adolescent versus adulthood nicotine exposure modulates these pathways we wanted to also assess what the cell signaling Cascades looked like in these adulthood exposed animals so again 30 days after their initial exposure to nicotine we take these adulthood exposed animals who are now even later into adulthood and we see and we analyze all the same pathways the ERK ache 18 GSK 3 and dopamine d1 d2 receptor expression and we see that there are no significant effects across the board although there are trends toward the same direction in a couple of these assays such as the the earth and the dopamine receptor assay as well there seems to be a trend towards reduction but nothing that actually stands out as significant at all okay so what you're showing is in the adolescent exposed animals the cell signaling cascades that are modulated with nicotine exposure and dopamine receptor levels so how does that play out in terms of behavior yeah we used a 30 minute open field test to assess psychomotor functioning adolescent nicotine exposure produces a substantial reduction in their overall distance moved or their local motor activity which is indicative of a psychomotor slowing effect very similar to what we see in patients with depression in humans and importantly neither the administration of the irk akt orgy is k3 inhibitors into the accumbens were able to attenuate this effect showing that none of our molecular signaling cascade inhibitors or are pharmacological inhibitors were able to prevent the psychomotor retardation that was caused by adolescent nicotine exposure however looking into a different measure of locomotor activity here we're using data from the initial five minutes of the test where we're able to assess the animals time spent in the center of the compartment the square locomotor activity chamber these rats are prey species so they typically like to spend more time along the sides of the chamber and when they spend a greater amount of time in the center or a lesser amount of time in the center goes both ways we can say that's either yes that's a in anxiety like a fact or an anti-anxiety like effect and we see here that relative to vehicle treated animals nicotine exposed rats spend a significantly lesser amount of time in the center relative to vehicle but when we co administer the GSK three inhibitor immediately prior to testing we see a significant reversal of this adolescent nicotine effect we see these animals now spend a normal amount of time or relative to vehicle treated animals very similar so these animals are returned back to baseline its selectively reversed by GSK three inhibition okay interesting and I guess it bears mentioning that depression is not one disorder it is a myriad of symptoms plano so you could have these different effects caused by different cellular molecular mechanisms potentially which is sort of what you're seeing here yeah a hundred percent I mean if you look at the diagnostic criteria for depression you can be eating too much eating too little sleeping too much sleeping too little there's bi-directional effects on these symptoms in many circumstances so the fact that some depression tests can go in both ways that it can be interpreted both as an increase or a decrease in the sensitivity to the reward versus depressive lake effect it kind of speaks directly to your point as well so you said that the sucrose test is kind of debated what it measures and then you also did forced swim test which also has some of those but you've done multiple tests to you know back yourself up what were your uh for swim tests or it's a swim it's a forced swim test right how you did yep it's a forced swim test classic forced swim test conducted in our rats and it's a good point to mention that these tests are heavily debated I mean there are some of the most well used well utilized tests throughout all of the rodent literature when studying depression anxiety and all these different things so of course they have a lot of proponents for them and there's tons of studies many of the antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs that we administer to humans are based off of the results that we see in these tests that they're the antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication was able to reverse these depressive like phenotypes that we see in these tests however the actual behavioral relevance or their the interpretation of how the behaviors actually generalize to depression in and of itself or anxiety in and of itself that can definitely be debated I think I think you said something import there that these are depressive like phenotypes these are not rats with depression these are rats that are showing behaviors that we associate with depression I don't think there's ever been a rat that's ever been diagnosed with depression per se but yeah exactly great point great so what was your what you find in the for swim test yeah so really quickly just gonna go over the the biggest point here the percentage time immobile so these animals if they're the theory goes if they spend a greater amount of time immobile than they've in a sense given up and by giving up that's indicative of depression they're they're barely moving they're just doing what they need to survive essentially or to you know to keep above the water and keep breathing we're not gonna let them drown or anything like that this is this is an aversive test the animals because rats typically don't like to like rats can swim very very well but they like to do so at their own comfort they don't like to be put into a barrel of water and being forced to mean to swim this is not a test that's dangerous to them what so I just want to point that out on that note though we see a reduction in or sorry an increase in these animals time spent in mobile so these actually they take a lesser amount of time into the test to start becoming in mobile and throughout the entirety of the test they actually spend a greater amount of time being in mobile in general then these vehicle treated animals and across the board we see very similar effects unable to be reversed by anything except for the Kirk inhibitors so they spend they go back to a normal amount of time spin swimming so despite the controversies surrounding the interpretation of the results in this test we do know that drugs with antidepressant properties typically reduce time spent in mobiles with the increase the animals activity in this task meaning if these antidepressants work in humans and they're causing this increase in time spent moving in this test we should interpret it as an anti-depressive like effect although like we were saying this is heavily debated awesome yeah you have a lot of sub graphs that go up some graphs that go down I understand the increased decreased difficulty there no but this this essentially shows that after adolescent exposure nicotine that we see a variety of depressive like effects and anxiety like effects and that selectively depending on the behavioral profile that we're looking at either the GS k3 pathway or the irk signaling pathway are specifically responsible for the anxiety or depressive like behaviors that we're observing here so in addition to the behavioral and the molecular assays you also did some you also looked at the neuronal firing in the nucleus accumbens show yeah yeah absolutely so we won't be able to tie some of the actual events that are occurring within the brain to our behaviors so that we can more concretely say that yes this pathway is involved in this function or this pathway is what mediates this depression like effect within our animals and then importantly within a subset of our animals we used in vivo electrophysiological recordings to assess spiny neuron activity rates and asila Tory magnitudes within the nucleus accumbens shell it's it's in many cases it's very difficult to administer a drug into the same brain the same area of the brain that you're trying to record from because by measuring a neuron using an electrode in the same region or in very close proximity to where the drug is being administered the drug dispersing to the region the liquid just the volume in general well more than likely move brain tissue in such a way that you now lose the recording that you actually had initially within the brain so in order to avoid that we administered the drug scaling up the doses of these permit collage achill inhibitors but we administered them directly into the ventricles of the brain which are house housing cerebral spinal fluid and when the drug reaches there it's able to disperse throughout the entirety of the brain so in short adolescent nicotine exposure significantly increases the spontaneous activity rates of medium spiny neurons within the nucleus accumbens shell and importantly neither the Burke or GSK three inhibitors were able to prevent this hyperactivity in contrast though we see a sharp reduction in the phasic bursting events and this is interesting because a decrease in d1 medium spiny neuron linked activity so medium spiny neurons that Express d1 receptors primarily when they are reduced or the bursting is reduced in these neurons has been shown to produce depressive like effects while on the other hand d2 receptor links medium spiny neurons when they increase their activity this is linked to the behavioral resiliency to depressive like phenotypes so when the increase is so essentially it can be interpreted as a decrease in bursting activity is indicative of depression an increase in bursting is actually indicative of resiliency to depression and regardless of how you look at it here we have a reduction in our phase of bursting activity of this medium spiny neurons were not able to actually say if their d1 or d2 linked our analysis does not provide that information with that kind of depth however it's very easy to say that in general across the board there's a reduction in the overall bursting activity within these neurons showing again that this is indicative of a depressive Lake phenotype so and also when you take it together with reduced accumbens d1 receptor expression that we showed earlier within the accumbens given that meeting spiny neurons bursting events tend to put a brake on VT dopamine neuronal activity rates through GABAergic projections these inhibitory disinhibitory and inhibitory GABAergic projections this could indicate that the decrease in medium spiny neurons actually accentuating or facilitating the VT Deline hyperactivity rates as previously described in the literature and because GS k3 inhibition but not in addition was able to bring these bursting rates back up to normal we can actually say the GS k3 signaling pathway is specifically involved in the depressive lake phenotypes whereas the irk signaling pathway is specifically involved in the anxiety-like phenotypes okay so you sort of see different effects of the two pathways here yes yes all right so sir Roger take us home what's the what's your take-home message and then we'll get into sort of some of the significance of it I think it's important to recognize that sure a lot of your friends might be using nicotine at early ages but before your brain is fully developed it's is it really worth risking the rest of your life for a certain you know for certain experiences and if I were to be talking more I guess to the scientific public it would be more a case of let's try and progress these findings into discovering some preventive measures that we can take to either prevent the molecular changes that will occur into the long term future following adolescent exposure nicotine and also to advance the development of treatments for individuals who are currently exposed to nicotine or I've currently been under that whole protocol they were exposed to nicotine as a child or during adolescence and later on in life they're experiencing these disorders but we also know that this effect may not be limited to to the generation in which the person experiences the nicotine intake so we know that how do you see this maternal grandmother Nikki okay it's actually related to autism later on multiple generations down the line fascinating there's many unknowns here that are still to be discovered from adolescent drug use that can extend not just to yourself but to your offspring potentially even to your offsprings offspring and potentially even further so we need to take these into account yeah I would think I would think a lot of that would be epigenetic effects but who knows I guess that's still being explored so yeah it sort of goes into you like you're your f2 offspring yeah it's a very similar case that what's been shown with out of Yasmin herds group Mount Sinai but cannabis exposure during adolescence progressing into at least f2 she's now shown no one's actually looked any further than that so and alcohol as well this is a very much emerging research topic as as is epigenetics more generally and I think we'll be seeing a lot of very surprising findings in the next little while fascinating awesome well Roger thank you
