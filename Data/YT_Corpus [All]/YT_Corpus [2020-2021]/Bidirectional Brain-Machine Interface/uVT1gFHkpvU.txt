 [Music] welcome everybody thank you so much for joining us this evening we've got a great science hub planned for us so good evening i'm nancy coddington i'm the director of science content at wskg public media and i'm also one of the co-founders of science pub bing along with two other dynamic ladies and christine hello i'm christine keysworth excuse me i'm a freelance writer i've been in the binghamton area for two years and this is a really special science pub because our guest speaker tonight dr carrie peterson is the one who introduced me to science pub in virginia and i liked it so much i wanted to bring it here and thanks to nancy and julie we've managed to do that um our other co-founder is julie weisberg she is communications director at family planning of south central new york and she's working late tonight so she can't join us but thanks goes out to her as always thank you and with us tonight we have dr carrie peterson joining us from virginia and so one of the great things about having these events virtually versus in person is that we do get to bring in guest speakers that are not from around this area so thank you so much for joining us dr peterson yeah thanks for having me my pleasure and while we're waiting for people to continue signing on everybody's probably just grabbing their links and getting signed into zoom or maybe they are grabbing their drinks we'll just give them a couple more seconds before we get started but the weather's finally turned nice and chewy here in upstate new york quite we had our first snow in richmond yesterday oh you did yeah it's already gone yeah okay now you want so 15 i remember that science pub we went to first i was really interested in it because it was about scientific failure i don't remember that one very well yeah it was all about how all scientists have all sorts of failures and that stuff doesn't get talked about as much and how to what we should do about the fact that we have all this knowledge and failure that doesn't get published yeah it's still a problem yeah well the one i remember most was about um cadavers yeah that one was good too how that whole science came about people donating their bodies to science fascinating those sound like really good ones yeah i agree um we had a comment from daryl that you do learn a lot from your failures i think yeah science is that's one of the great things about science is you do learn so much from things that don't work as much as the things that do work right [Music] endless array of topics exactly well we've got to watch that play out right over the last several months with the coronavirus and searching for that vaccination you know it's been interesting watching people the public respond to how science actually works yeah so the first vaccine in the uk yesterday right or today fda approval uh in the uk they've already started right right yeah yeah and the importance of modeling so i did a lot of modeling in my work all fields of science do um and so it was fun to see everybody jumping to models right away to see how this was going to play out and how models can be wildly different from each other that's very true very useful as well very true and i think we see that a lot right with uh curology and oh yeah they do a pretty good job honestly they yes they do yes they do okay so we are going to go ahead and get started thank you again so much for joining us this evening we are recording this webinar so that we can share it with those who weren't able to make it this evening uh but tonight we are going to learn how evolving science of brain stimulation from the use of ancient eels and catfish to treat pain to the high-tech implants being tested in spinal cord injury patients dr peterson's lab is working on several of these and where you're going to learn what the future of rehabilitation and healing may hold dr peterson is the director of the rehabilitation engineering to advance ability laboratory the real lab at virginia commonwealth university and dr peterson has expertise in musculoskeletal biomechanics and neuro rehabilitation she oversees research research designed to help patients with positive stroke hemiparesis and spinal cord injury so welcome dr peterson thank you so much for being here with us this evening yeah thanks for having me and just to confirm i'm now successfully sharing my screen yes you are okay fantastic yeah so thanks for the introduction um i'm at vcu here down in richmond virginia and i direct the rehabilitation engineering to advanceability lab and our acronym is the real lab and i thought it was clever because vcu's logo motto is to make it real so some people like it some people don't um anyway uh let's advance the slime okay so my research areas i have two primary areas one is in neuroplasticity and neuromodulation under that realm we evaluate things like spinal reflexes we're interested in motor relearning after a neurologic injury and we also use brain stimulation which is primarily what i'm going to talk about today i also do some research in the area of musculoskeletal biomechanics under that realm i've studied walking mechanics in various populations and also the dynamics of upper limb activities the human populations that we investigate are spinal cord injury stroke and we also study non-impaired individuals as control subjects so what i'm going to talk about today is brain stimulation as promised and advertised um applications of that and also spinal cord injury rehabilitation because that is the primary focus of my research right now uh so just to start with a little history of brain stimulation because it's pretty interesting i think uh the earliest known forms of brain stimulation was live fish so that was used by the ancient greeks and romans they observed that now catfish and electric rays could be used to treat body conditions for example headaches and other disorders so this figure on the left is a catfish and we have got an electric ray and apparently they would apply the rays to foot conditions and the catfish to head ailments and they didn't quite know at that time that electrical activity was happening they were just like this seems to work let's do it i will say that's also a lot of science today um understanding mechanisms is harder than recognizing that something was working so after the greeks and romans galvani came along and in 1791 he discovered that electric electricity does flow through nerves so that was a major finding and then in the 1860s during war times physicians found out accidentally by irritating exposed brains on the battlefield that that resulted in twitches on the opposite side of the body and hopefully you're aware that 80 of our neural fibers cross over at the level of our necks which is why this side of the brain controls your opposite side of the body so they realize that accidentally and then in the 1900s we had some real researchers um who worked on anesthetized monkeys to outline the motor homunculus so if you don't recall the motor homunculus essentially it's a brain map it reflects the density and size and distribution of neurons that are devoted to controlling our muscles in the body so this figure here the brain we're looking at the motor cortex motor equals muscle coordination and it's very organized in terms of the neurons and then the muscles that they ultimately descend the spinal cord and reach out to innervate and so looking at this brain map the face and the hand are really large in size because we have a lot of neurons devoted to controlling those parts of our body and they're also very superficial um whereas we don't have as many neurons controlling our toes and you know that intuitively too because you can do really fine motor control stuff with your hands and then luckily we don't have to do well we've adapted to not design things to do things with our toes because we don't have a spine uh motor control of our toes and you'll also want to remember this too because the this brain map helps us realize what areas of the brain we should focus on in stimulating the brain all right so we've got the motor cortex and then okay and we also know electrical activity is involved with creating muscle contractions um and then the first form of brain stimulation in the modern area was electro convulsion therapy which is essentially a procedure which uses small electrical currents that are passed through the brain to intentionally trigger a brief seizure and that was designed to treat major depressive disorders and bipolar disorders and then it kind of got a bad rap in the 70s per public perception but today it's back but done better um performed under anesthesia and it's still done um the main limitation of this technique is skin and scalp resistance which actually is what causes pain so non-invasive brain stimulation but the limitation of it's painful so transcranial magnetic stimulation is what i'll primarily talk about today um that's major invest advancement over electro convulsion therapy is that it's a non-painful more focal form of brain stimulation the history behind well i'll refer to it a lot as tms because it's kind of i don't really like saying transcranial magnetic stimulation over and over so refer it's commonly referred to as tms um so some researchers in the 50s were fooling around with magnets and frogs and that's where a lot of science starts um and then it wasn't until 1985 that barker and his colleagues developed the first transcranial magnetic stimulator that could be applied to humans and today there's many forms and different applications of tms and i'll be talking about some of those but this is our the picture of the dudes and the first tms device so how does tms work well it works through electromagnetic induction if we have any physics teachers high school physics teachers in this class um potentially you recall faraday's law not important for the context of this class but um or this talk but essentially when you have an electric current that passes through a wire for example a coil it creates a magnetic field and then when we have an object that conducts electricity for example the brain our brain conducts electricity if that object passes through a magnetic field then we get an electrical current that's created in the object for example the brain so tms is inducing a magnetic field that generates an electrical current in the brain so that's how it works and what's in the brain well it's essentially a bunch of neurons that generate and transmit electricity so highly excitable and then other than neurons we have supporting cells in the brain that help the neurons function so these are very beautiful images that we can now get of the brain this is a technique called diffusion tensor imaging where we can use mri methods to look at the diffusion of water molecules that can tell us about the neuroanatomy of neurons in the brain so just a little background on how we can get these nice lovely brain images so neurons so they are pretty complex i think you probably know that as a reminder of neurons there's many and they send electrical signals down their axons but then they communicate with other neurons through chemical interactions so we've got neurotransmitters that get released that then tell the next neuron to either keep that signal going or not it's really a all-or-nothing principle it's actually what we call it the all-or-nothing principle of the action potential so we've got a bunch of neurons in the brain doing all this electrochemical action and now it's time for quick check in terms of how many neurons we think there are in the brain so we've got a poll question ready so the question for you is how many neurons are in the brain on average so your choices just watch the poll for everybody so i don't know if you can see that dr peterson i can see it okay yeah so you know your options because you're reading the screen but 50 million 86 billion 90 trillion but there's also the option of unknown because we can't measure it very well almost everybody's voted oh wow and we've got an unequal distribution i like that i just want yeah essentially the feedback is a lot i can end this and share our results thank you all right so the winner is the correct answer good job y'all do i hit stop share results i can do that yeah okay and then we've got several votes though for 90 trillion also a good guess and unknown so the true answer is 86 billion for the longest time it was estimated at 100 billion which turned out to be a really good estimate but we do now have staining techniques and also the diffusion tensor imaging that i just noted where we can do a better job of counting neurons and luckily scientists are smart enough no one's actually counted all the neurons in a brain yet thank goodness i don't think we need to know the answer that badly but that what they do is count in a small section of the brain and then extrapolate out so we can more or less measure that now progress at work okay in terms of brain stimulation technology i've already talked about tms i'll be talking about tms a little more but we do have widespread use of other types of technologies as well so an invasive form is deep brain stimulation that involves a procedure a surgical procedure where electrodes are actually implanted in certain brain areas and then those electrodes generate electrical pulses that control abnormal brain activity probably the most widespread application for that is for to treat parkinson's disease or essential tremor so we now have pretty great technology for implanting electrodes right on the brain and controlling that through a neuron stimulator that's implanted in the body just like a pacemaker would be so deep brain stimulation is our most common invasive type of brain stimulation non-invasive brain stimulation is gaining in popularity for obvious reasons and it's also a lot easier to get research subjects to come participate in a non-invasive brain stimulation protocol the two most popular are tms which i you're familiar with now and then also transcranial direct current stimulation so that is shown here in this picture it's it involves direct electrical currents to stimulate specific parts of the brain so rather than indirect through a magnetic field it's actually applying low um frequency currents to the brain and we can even deliver that in home-based therapy these days too so that's a major advantage of tdcs it's less focal and less potent than tms but the main advantage is that it can it's easier to administer tms is still more or less living in the clinical and research world so far okay um did i miss a slide no um one thing i want to point out is that we are able to modulate the brain we can either increase excitability or decrease excitability of neural output through brain stimulation so you can imagine there's a wide range of applications um i focus on the motor cortex sometimes the sensory cortex in terms of touch perception but you can apply these approaches to any area of the brain that needs modulating so tms was actually developed for depression um so let's do another question so you brain stimulation again is a technology where we want to modulate neural activity and now i want to hear from you what you think is not a current application of brain stimulation technology so we've got again not so choices are athletic motor training gender identity modulation pediatric movement disorders musical training or cognitive enhancement again i'm looking for what is not actually a use currently for brain stimulation technology we got the votes coming in coming in just to remind you that your vote is anonymous so even if you don't know go ahead and put your go ahead and put an answer up there and i think we're almost everybody voted so i'm going to end the poll and share our results there we go there's also no penalty for wrong answers it's just supposed to make this more engaging and i think thank you for participating in the polls so good job y'all you got the answer again thankfully the correct answer is gender identity um modulation identify okay so i gotta type on my slide here i did recently and preparing for this talk learned that it has been applied for changing sexual orientation but to date has not and hopefully never will be applied to modulate gender identity anyway but yes that's the correct answer it has been used for athletic motor training pediatric movement disorders musical training and also cognitive enhancement okay so tms applications it's been fda approved for treatment of major depression that was in 20 or 2008 and then it's also been approved for pain and certain migraines recently more recently it is approved for use as an investigational device for research which is how labs like mine can operate so tms applied to the motor cortex can be used for motor training this is a picture here of tms in my lab for example were this was a study where we were assessing modulation of cortical motor accelebility so you can use it as a rehab tool or as a tool just to learn about how the nervous system adapts after a spinal cord injury so one advantage of tms applied to the motor cortex is we actually get a quantifiable output so if you're targeting depression yes there's definitely clinical questionnaires to gauge whether the therapy is working um but as a scientist i like numbers so the number that we're interested in when we use tms is this motor book potential so when we hold the coil over over a person's head and we deliver a pulse that induces neurons to fire and then we have a sensor located on the muscle for example if we were targeting the tibialis interior here muscle on the front of your calf we would have a little what we call an emg sensor electromyography that captures that net signal that arrives at the muscle in response to the tms that we just applied and so we use that emg signal and look at it that's all we do and that's called the motor of a potential and we just want to know how is that size changed in response to you know different therapies or different conditions so it's actually pretty awesome in that we've got direct feedback of the stimulus that we just applied again a benefit of applying tms to the motor cortex over other areas of the brain where the feedback isn't as clear dr peterson we have some questions can i interject with some of those yeah go for it i'm so how does cognitive enhancement work oh not my specialty but the fact that we can stimulate the brain and say you want to focus on like maybe somebody has trouble with motor planning you can target that area of the brain deliver repetitive stimulation and observe whether it was useful or not also for example another benefit of tdcs right the non-invasive form that's pretty simple to deliver you can have you can determine whether it's working by having somebody perform some sort of cognitive task i don't know maybe do a puzzle um and then have them do that again while they're receiving stimulation and see if there's any change in output hopefully that answers your question i've never myself studied brain stimulation in the context of cognitive enhancement but essentially it's the same across the board as you're trying to either increase or decrease activity in a brain area and see if that results in a change in performance so can it be used for um musical training well yeah that would be the same idea so the musical areas of your brain if you stimulate that during you know like in this picture that i found whoops i want to go back right so tdcs delivered during musical training there's studies that have reported improvements but i would say a lot of it's so preliminary in our understanding that for every study that you find where there's improvements there tends to be a study that says oh we found no change so more or less i would say for tdcs in general this is the very easy to apply um the jury's still out as to how effective it is we do know it can modulate activity to some degree but whether those changes are significant and long lasting is like a whole field of research from what we're trying to figure out okay great i have a couple more questions um so i think this is hopping back a couple slides but do you know what they gleaned from the frogs and magnets they gleaned that you could that was just preliminary testing of magnetic fields and if you just change the magnetic field can that stimulate a neuron so as with a lot of science we do we use animal models to test our theory first so before i'm gonna hold this coil over a human brain and change magnetic field and see what happens i think i'll try it on a frog first that's the idea and sorry and um so we still do that though like there's cutting edge research happening primarily in rats and cats because we can unfortunately use those animals and i don't do animal research but i definitely benefit from animal research because that informs the research that i do on human subjects so we're going to segue from that too is this used on kids it is yeah so for the longest time it wasn't because nobody wanted to be that researcher to try it um but i believe now so kids unfortunately have neurological disorders too and in the research world i know that um i think they go as low as h5 currently so yes tms for pediatric movement disorders is is a thing the one i think though so the only weird condition that hasn't been tested because nobody wants to go there but there's no reason to believe that it's unsafe is pregnant women um i guess there's not a large degree of pregnant women with neurological disorders that would benefit so that's part of the reason it hasn't been studied but strangely on all our safety measures we have to agree that we're not going to use this on pregnant women more or less because just it's never been done someday somebody will do a study and it will probably be the results will be it's safe but not been done yet all right any other questions before i yes this is great um how effective is this for parkinson's very effective um so that's a bad answer um again not my expertise but the fact that it's been so widely used indicates to me that it's very effective i've see i mean i teach a rehabilitation engineering class and i like to show students a lot of videos and it's some i have i'm recalling the specific one where they have the device off versus on and essentially the person is stuck they have like freezing of gate so the individual will be stuck like not able to initiate walking at all then they turn the device on and the person can walk so ideally i had a backup slide with that video but that is not prepared so yeah um deep brain stimulation is effective enough that it's fda approved and routinely done great thank you we have more questions but i think we should keep moving on because we can ask them as we go okay okay so here we are we're talking about tms and then so since the days of tms being discovered there's obviously been a lot of advancements this figure on the left shows what we call neuro-navigated tms so rather than somebody holding the coil we can now have robots that hold the coil the robots are connected to a computer that has an mri image of the person so it can actually use detailed information about that specific person's brain and use the robot arm to place the coil exactly where the stimulation should be applied so that is about as fancy as it gets in terms of tms devices currently um there's been a whole field of coil design of course in the middle of the screen i have a figure that's articulating what closed-looped brain stimulation is closed loop means that you're delivering stimulation in response to the current brain state so what i've described so far is just you hold a coil you deliver stimulation that's just like one way there's one input and you get an output but the efficiency or efficacy of brain stimulation depends on the current brain state that's something we've learned over time through research so we can now use brain recordings which can be done with eeg non-invasively you have electrical recordings from the brain and then you use that information to know when to trigger the tms so that's what closed-loop brain tms is and then i've got this picture here of a rat with the tms coil as a thank you to all the rats who have been involved in tms advancements basically anything we do in humans is first tested on rats and for example this this rat they've got those wires coming out from the rat are sensors that are put on forearm muscles so this study was looking at targeting the motor cortex in a rat and observing how that signal was delivered to uh flexor muscles in the forearms all right so in summary about tms it can be used to both measure cortical motor excitability which is excitability of the motor cortex to the muscle and we can also use it in a repetitive form to manipulate or change the excitability of that pathway so next i'm going to talk about applications to spinal cord injury but we'll first have a reminder of the spinal cord so the the unique nature of the spinal cord is that it's also highly organized and this figure shows the innervation of muscles at different levels of the spinal cord so looking at the top the cervical spinal cord i mean it's organized in a very intuitive manner where at the cervical level those neurons then project to um your arm muscles and then as you go lower in the spinal cord that's where chest muscles abdominal muscles are innervated and then the lumbar region those nerves control leg muscles okay so that's a reminder of how our spinal cord is organized which is important for understanding then the deficits that are lost after an injury so after a cervical spinal cord injury let's say you had an injury at the c6 level that means that all the functions listed below are are lost or impaired depending on whether it was a complete injury or perhaps you had an incomplete injury but unfortunately that's how spinal cord injury works so the spinal cord let's do another question to gauge our knowledge of the spinal cord this is a true or false statement true or false the spinal cord can initiate movements by itself without the brain and remember you are voting anonymous so yes just go ahead and vote i like that we get representation on all the answers i like this is really split yeah this is a tight one it's kind of like the election we just had okay oh man well i'm glad i asked i wasn't i wasn't quite sure how much people knew about the spinal cord um all right 50 50 split this is very entertaining to me um i mean i studied the spinal cord so i happen to know the answer but i suspected that people wouldn't know for sure and that i guess i was right uh the answer is true so we have reflexes which means a reflex is a situation where your muscle or nerve it just you get a stimulus say i get a stimulus on my hand or my reflex is where that stimulus travels through my nerves to my spinal cord and then just goes right back to act that's what a reflex is so that happens without the brain knowing about it the brain finds out about 100 milliseconds later it's like oh um yes so the spinal cord can initiate movements by itself without the brain being involved it's much faster because it doesn't have to involve the brain the brain and also there's a whole field of research about training the spinal cord um after neurological injury we can train the brain and so there's a field that's focused on can we train the spinal cord the short answer so far to that is we are very successful in training rat spines but that has not translated very well to human spines but it's a whole field of research all right so back to spinal cord injury uh we saw the spinal cord a cervical spinal cord injury is at the top level and unfortunately that results in tetraplegia so that's impaired function in all four limbs hence tetra or quadriplegia there's two terms for the same thing and unfortunately that's the most frequent level of injury and it results in impaired function of the upper limb in addition to um complete paralysis below the level of injury but the upper limbs are really important for self-care tasks especially when you're in a wheelchair so it's the most desired outcome of rehabilitation to improve upper lung function that is primarily the focus of my current work um the options right now for improving upper lung function after cervical spinal cord injury are kind of divided into two areas so clinically and also in the home physical therapy can happen in those spaces there's assisted devices and also upper limb reconstruction which is i should have changed that to surgery that's a fancy way of saying surgeries that you where you can actually transfer either a muscle or a nerve to do a new function so those are options in the clinic at home and then the lab so research labs are where we're exploring kind of fancier new technologies like what we refer to as neuro technologies like brain computer interfaces where there's communication between somebody's brain and and then using with the spinal cord injury there's changes in the brain's function but the problem isn't the brain the problem is the transmission of that signal so brain computer interfaces are meant to capture the brain's intent and then perhaps use some sort of robot or some prosthetic to perform that function um also lab based research is neuromodulation which is just a huge that involves stimulating at various levels of the nervous system and brain stimulation is one example of that so in my lab i'm finally getting to the part where i'll talk a little bit about the type of research we've got going on right now we evaluate surgical outcomes so these surgeries that transfer muscles um there's multiple surgeries that can be done and we've done some work where we actually compare the surgeries to see for example how much elbow strength is um restored so this picture here is we've got this like fancy we call it a elbow moment transducer that can measure strength um quantitatively versus in the clinic they actually just have a person a highly trained professional great but we wanted to do a more sensitive comparison so we we used an actual force sensor what else do we have going on so i also collaborate with the biomagnetics lab here at vcu they happen to be in mechanical engineering i met this guy who designs tms coils that was a good find um and so we've got a project now where we're using imaging data where we can get information about actual neurons in the brain import that into computational models and model the effect of tms which has hopefully you can understand how models are very useful because you can do things to a model that you can't do to a human subject that's a major advantage and you can also do things a lot faster if we only could learn by bringing people into our lab and holding a coil over their heads research would be very slow but we can model things we can model stimulus parameters a huge variety of things and learn a lot more from a model so that's something we do but we do also apply what we've learned and see does that actually translate to humans so we do use repetitive tms paradigms that's a picture in my lab you might be wondering what that person is watching that person is watching a nature video because we try and control for cognitive cognition um while we're delivering the therapy and so somebody did a study where they found that nature videos were the had the lowest impact on like excitement levels so basically all tms studies now use nature beauty videos to just like control cognition and keep the person awake um so another application that we're exploring in my lab is pairing neuromodulation with actual physical therapy so what this looks like is we deliver tms for about 20 30 minutes immediately after that the person participates in therapy where they're ideally in this heightened cortical state and then we see does that improve motor function so that's the types of studies that we're running right now another study that we are starting in february we got funding for this over the summer um i've got a collaborator who's really interested in virtual reality interventions which is perfect for me so my friend xena she's the she's a professor in physical medicine and rehab she developed this vr intervention for individuals with spinal cord injury and so far that they've they found that there's no improvements over conventional therapy so she's trying to you know you can adapt the virtual world and make it better but also there's evidence to suggest that brain stimulation before the intervention improves outcomes so that's primarily been shown in stroke patients so we are now applying this to individuals with spinal cord injury we are seeing whether that increases touch perception and for this we're using tdcs because we are delivering this to people's homes so the advantage is they don't have to come in clearly to the clinic and receive the therapy they're more likely to do it at home it's more it's a more long-term solution and also you know there are situations where you have to stay home that's something we've all learned this year so um that's another project and then neuro navigation is very expensive so we've come up with ways of um delivering low-cost neural navigation so just more like basic motion tracking that can be done with like a microsoft connect um in a much cheaper form of tracking the tms coil in space relative to you know the uh hundred thousand dollar systems that exist okay this is great timing is working out i've got one more question hopefully you'll participate the last question is which species recover best after an equivalent spinal cord injury by this i'm referring to if you have a monkey if you have a rat and a human let's say they all have a c6 level injury that's complete a complete injury which species is going to recover the best after that spinal cord injury this is a tricky question i don't really know why i would think you would know the answer i would probably even ask my grad students and they may or may not hopefully they know the answer yeah this is one where i was going hmm i can't wait to see what the answer is yeah yeah okay get your last vote in there if you haven't voted already it's just fun to participate all right thank you participation we're gonna go ahead and end the poll and share our results awesome okay so of my questions you guys got three correct um this one yes rat is correct um sadly we don't know exactly why that is yet but what we've learned is we've there's been a lot of research where spinal cord injuries are induced in rats because you can really control the injury and then observe what happens and rats rat nerves sprout and regenerate a great deal and brain stimulation like further enhances that so if you only went by the rat literature you would think that spinal cord injury is like just a minor problem these days but unfortunately what we've learned especially over the last 20 years is that human neurons don't regenerate nearly as well and that's um that's a major challenge in our field is that we've learned a lot from rats but oh crap that doesn't translate to humans so good job you all knew that um so yeah that was my last question and i felt like a good message to end on after talking about the sp um the nervous system is to be safe uh wear a helmet wear a seatbelt unfortunately vehicle crashes are the number one cause of spinal cord injuries and just wear a mask so with that i just wanted to thanks thank everybody for listening and thank my research team and my collaborators and i'm happy to take any questions that you have okay we've got lots of good questions um so do you know why with the rats why the rats seem to be a little more resilient there well yeah that's one thing we're trying to figure out we have observed that rats can regenerate nerves way beyond the capacity of humans um i mean they they're smaller they've got less nerves to regenerate that could be a factor but i would say the best answer in the field yet is we don't know but we would sure wish humans could regenerate nerves as well um one thing i was thinking about this week as i was watching uh what was that my octopus teacher if you is that a documentary everybody seen now okay well the just of it is at one point the octopuses loses an entire arm and the arm grows back and that was just a reminder of species are wildly different and other species are way better at regenerating themselves than we are right so that's we are good at some things but we are not good about at regenerating our bodies we got to work on this humans let's do it well that's a good rally call come on questions that we'd like to dive into um and before we do though i do want to address uh carol had asked if there will be recording yes this will be that we are recording this and um we do do a small edit and put some closed caption on it so then it goes out probably by the end of the week or early next week um so please do ask your questions in the chat we are going to get to them i'm going to jump onto a little backlog we have um can you talk about what is tdcs okay so tdcs is um basically you've got electrodes on on the head and they're connected to a stimulation device where you directly apply electrical currents and so that current passes from one electrode to the other and in doing so you are able to generate an electric current near the neurons and so it's best suited it's not as focal or as able to stimulate as deep as other techniques but it can be useful in some applications okay thank you and how focused can you make magnetic fields yeah um so step and how focal is an ongoing question right now we use these what we call double cone coils and they can go about five centimeters deep pretty focally and within about we can target with accuracy of about one millimeter and in terms of like what gets stimulated the truth is that everything gets stimulated a little bit but with coil design we can at least target the hot spot to for example a a finger muscle we can target specific arm muscles when it comes to the leg just based on the design of the motor cortex it's a lot trickier to target specific muscles in the leg so definitely some design challenges out there if you're into designing magnetic coils which is going to take us right down to why is it that legs but not arms can become paralyzed but not vice versa okay so let's go back i'm still sharing my screen so we're going to look at the spinal cord again so motor control starts with the brain in terms of volitional motor control so involuntary is a reflex but things that we mean and intend to do start with our brain so if you've got an injury at the top that means the brain generates a signal and it's going to stop once it reaches the injury and so in that case everything below that level is not getting that electrical signal so but i think that is a good question because you might be thinking okay so you can't get voluntary brain input but can you still get the reflex input and the answer is yes because that's still an intact neural system below the level of injury it's just not getting the information from the brain like it normally would so hopefully that answers the question [Music] thank you so if nerves are severed such as in zone six flexor tendon injury would tms be helpful well that's exactly what we're trying to find out um there's in there's evidence to suggest that it is helpful because it can do two things it can help train what we refer to as residual pathways so it can enhance pathways that are still intact and there's also evidence to suggest that it can improve the function of pathways that are impaired to some degree so i can't give you a yes or no answer i can say that's exactly what research is trying to um we're trying to answer that um the answer is going to be tricky it's going to be something to the flavor of well it depends on your age it depends on your exact injury depends on what type of training that you received in the acute stage so there's differences between acute and chronic spinal cord injury so the answer is not yes or no but potentially that's so unsatisfying but that's what research is is trying to learn more about um neurological disorders so we can better design rehabilitation so do these stimulation techniques have any use for spine damage due to arthritis right so yes the more minimal this the injury seems to be um more responsive to brain stimulation therapies so in other words brain stimulation isn't going to in fact we've kind we've stopped testing this in people with complete injuries because we've learned there's no way you're gonna if it's a complete severed injury we can't bypass that um but if it's a minimally damaged pathway that's where it seems to work the best so you know talking about that staying right on that threat um can this study phantom live experiences yes so phantom limb pain is an application in modulating um sensory pathways certainly [Music] do you have any recommendations for sciatic nerve sometimes the nerve and legs go numb i i'm not i'm not gonna no i don't okay how does all of this relate to a lie detector testing oh man oh geez i that is not a question i'm prepared for honestly i don't even know how lie detectors work that what do they do does anybody know how a lie detector works well it's probably let's see i don't know enough about lie detectors to answer this i'll make a note basically a good follow-up maybe we can post that on our um our science public facebook page yeah i do have i do have a feeling that lie detectors can be improved by our advances in technology in terms of recording and changing brain signals but okay that's a whole nother talk maybe that's for a future one and rachel mentions yeah they measure part of your heart rate and compare it to a baseline but yeah they're also eventually measuring other things right comparing that to a baseline yeah okay so put that on our list well how do lie detectors work um can this be used to stimulate spinal cord to bypass the brain oh so now i like this question so tran spinal stimulation is when you you can either apply a change in magnetic field directly to the spinal cord with the same principle as holding it over the head so you can generate electrocurrents in the spinal cord which would also generate um you know excite we have neurons that live in the spinal cord too so definitely that's an exciting field of research right now is applying stimulation directly to the spinal cord that can be done invasively or non-invasively so i'm actually working on a study at the va hospital right now with dr gorgie where we're implanting um stimulators in the spinal cord itself not us but the neurosurgeons um and they undergo exoskeleton walking therapy in combination with stimuli delivered right to the spinal cord through implants and seeing if that improves walking ability so i should have talked about that and we're comparing that to a group that's receiving the non-invasive um spinal cord stimulation so yes that's a great question certainly how successful is tms for depression what are your thoughts about rapid tms and depression and anxiety okay well i'm going to rely on the fda because what the fda does and as they look at the data to say is this approach better than conventional therapy and the fact that it was fda approved means that there's data to suggest this treats depression well above the risks of the treatment so and it's also quite extensively used so it's kind of similar to my question about i tbs in parkinson's dc user it's widely used and it's fda approved so that means it's very effective they wanted to prove it if it wasn't thank you um is anyone doing this tms hand flexor tendon injury research around berkeley california seven-year-olds um well where is that in california the answer is likely yes um if it's near a major city the answer is yes research is so widespread for any major public university there's somebody there doing tms research okay how often are invasive brain stimulation operations performed and what are they treating this is invasive brain stimulation yes i don't know the prevalence numbers um the primary treatments are for parkinson's disease essential tremor um it has to they're most effective for neurological disorders that have trouble initiating movements so movement is so complicated that the motor cortex isn't the only thing controlling it there's also the pre-mortar cortex there's specific areas of the brain that are deeper that can control balance and also like initiating and planning movement so that's why we have to use deep brain stimulation and implant directly on those neurons that we can't reach with other methods so preval i don't know the prevalence but those are the treatments thank you um what would be a huge home run in your career research research or academic life something you'd love to see in your in your lifetime oh done by me or somebody else okay um that's a great question for me i mean it's kind of hard to i don't want to answer this for myself because as a research it's really like a team effort um you want the whole field to progress essentially you're just doing your little piece of the puzzle and nothing i i don't know we see small improvements and that has a huge um impact on somebody's life um especially in tetraplegia right they're not asking for full function of everything they just want to use their arms better so for me i do like seeing individual improvement and positive outcomes of something that i've helped develop so i get yeah that's my answer for myself and in the field of let's say spinal cord injury rehabilitation i think that if we could figure out how to grow or regenerate neurons that be fantastic um they're the most the closest we are are groups in switzerland where they they basically do multimodal rehabilitation where they're combining like chemical interfaces stimulation techniques and also physical therapy so basically multimodal approaches are looking like what we have to have which is why myself and other types of researchers know we have to combine our therapy with something else it's not just a standalone like oh just stimulate your brain no that's got to be combined with some other therapy so the evidence that we can regenerate nerves would be a home run for um the field of spinal cord injury for sure that would be huge possibilities would be humans we can do it in rats but it'd be a nice field to do in humans do you rest have more dna is that what it is no i need to learn more about this why there's probably some review paper that goes into it in detail um yeah this is great if you have any last questions pop those into the q a order to the chat um we do have a question if slides will be available yeah i can share my slides with you all and you can do with it what you will thank you and there will be a recording of this that will get sent out and is available on wskg you can watch it on your smart tv or you can watch it online or on youtube and as people are thinking about their last thoughts if they have another question go ahead and sign up for our new science pub which is january 12th it's next year already which is exciting news to put 2020 to bed but you know not much is really going to change in january i'm sorry you're the better of that however we are going to have a great science club on january 12th at 7 p.m the link is in the chat and it is going to be on the art of science which is really cool um you think about all of the scientific information that shared with you but this is going to be talking about how you actually take some of that data and put it into either an infograph or in a way that's easy to understand and we have doctors orson and bolt that will be sharing their information on that so it's going to be a really a really exciting science club so please rsvp and i want to thank dr kerry peterson thank you so much for your time and expertise tonight this was really fascinating really enjoyed learning about free stimulation yeah thank you i had a good time as well and thank you christine keiswer julie weisberg i'd like to thank wskg public media and thank you so much for attending tonight's science pub and if you liked what you heard tonight please make sure that you like our facebook page science pub bing for future events and science updates and you can also find us on wskg as well so thank you so much for joining us this evening and we hope you have a great holiday season and the end of 2020. thank you everyone good night [Music] you
