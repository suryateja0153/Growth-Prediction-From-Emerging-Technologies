 hey guys nakazi here welcome back in today's video i'm going to talk about the cloud this is where everything is happening infrastructure as a service platform as a service software as a service if these terms are new to you or if you're not familiar with them have no fear in today's video i'm gonna go deep into this topic and i'm gonna talk about the history and the evolution of what led to the cloud without further ado let's jump right into it i'm super pumped let's go let's jump right into it here are the topics i plan on covering today first what is a data center second private public and hybrid cloud and finally is versus pass versus sas let's roll so let's first talk about what a data center is here's a wikipedia definition a data center is a building or dedicated space within a building or a group of buildings used to house computer systems and associated components such as telecommunications and storage systems it might as well be a bunch of mumbo jumbo if you don't have a lot of experience with data centers or if you don't know anything about data centers so let me tell you a story of bob bob is an entrepreneur and in particular he opens up a coffee shop he starts selling a ton of coffee to the point that he has to now hire a bunch of people to run his coffee shop a couple of things bob needs to think about he needs to be able to run credit cards so he needs a point of sale system he needs to be able to pay his employees so he needs a payroll system and finally he needs to be able to see all the inventory at the shop so he can manage things efficiently to do that bob needs to get different type of servers a pos or point of sale server inventory management server and an accounting server that's three physical servers all together this could be considered the most basic form of data center now what happens next is interesting now bob needs to have a duplicate of each server because what if the one server that he had for running pos dies well his pos system is going to be down and that is not acceptable right he needs to be able to charge his customers because bob is crushing it a lot of people are buying coffee so he needs to have redundant servers to avoid going out of business frankly speaking but that adds to the cost now five years later bob has six stores here's what that means he needs six servers per store times six stores that's 36 servers well that's a lot of physical servers bob's id hardware cost goes up his maintenance cost goes up and bob has to wait for months for hardware delivery and that is pretty crazy and that is making bob very unhappy however lucky for bob he can now get virtual servers because virtualization just became a reality and this is year 2000. what ends up happening in this new architecture he can run three virtual machines on a single physical server so he no longer has to get a server per application instead he can run different vms or virtual machines on a single server per store that means instead of having six servers he can now have two physical servers for redundancy and that significantly reduces the hardware footprint and saves bob a ton of money in the process and now bob is a happy camper again 10 years later bob now operates one of the largest chains in the country with over 1 000 stores growing fast by the day well at this point bob is so successful that mostly he chills at the beach however he gets a call from his cto now check this out guys bob is so successful that he actually has a chief technology officer that's pretty cool and the cto suggests to bob that he needs to get rid of all the physical servers and move everything to the cloud and in this new architecture he suggests that we migrate all the workloads to the cloud we have redundant sd-wan design we got to get rid of all the physical servers and this will save us millions of dollars over the years and let's turn all the capital expenditure into operating expense well this all sounds really amazing and sexy but bob is a little confused with all these different buzzwords so bob asks his cto to educate him on the topic of cloud let's do that there are two things you need to understand to understand the cloud first cloud service models so to explain this first off we start off with on-site where we manage everything right so that's our server networking storage everything is being handled by us the next level up is is or infrastructure as a service where all the red elements everything operating system down is managed by a third-party service provider and everything above the os we manage and some of the big providers that are considered giants in the is space are amazon web services microsoft azure and google cloud platform and the target audience for this type of cloud connectivity is system administrators next level to that is pass or platform as a service here you can see that everything runtime below all the way to the networking stack is managed by a service provider and we only worry about the data in the applications to give you a couple examples github google application engine and force.com are all past platforms and the target audience for pass platforms happens to be developers software engineers and finally this is the ultimate nirvana sas or software as a service where everything is being managed by a service provider and some of the examples are gmail yahoo mail facebook or o365 zoom instagram and the list goes on and on where everything is all packaged up and you as a consumer use it that's a target audience for sas pretty much everybody can use sas and now let's shift our attention to the cloud deployment models there are three different models you need to understand first model is a private cloud here we have our servers our switches our firewalls routers all that good stuff that's a private cloud which basically means a data center that's our own data center that's a fancy term for our own on-prem stuff public cloud is where it gets interesting this is where companies like amazon web services microsoft azure and google cloud come into play where we start to rent servers from these guys so we no longer have to worry about space power cooling messing around with the hardware or any of the cables or anything all that stuff is managed by these providers we have to choose one or we can choose multiple it just depends what we need but the bottom line is that at the end of the day cloud is somebody else's computer the fundamentals of computing don't go away just because we happen to be in a cloud all that stuff is still there but we don't manage and touch any of the physical stuff we only deal with the logical and virtual components that sit in these public cloud providers and the final category is a hybrid cloud where we have a mix of some on-prem stuff and some stuff that gets moved into the cloud a lot of customers find themselves in the hybrid cloud realm because depending on how old their applications are if they have a lot of legacy applications that they cannot move into the cloud because of different type of dependencies then they have to maintain some application footprint on their physical servers or virtual servers within their own data center and then the rest of the workloads that are based on the newer application architecture could easily be shifted to the cloud and this way they can maintain different elements of their infrastructure another example could be the website so for example a store like target could maintain its local database and all the application that it uses for pharmacy and everything else for point of sales and accounting on-prem but then their website they could move that into the cloud because you know during thanksgiving and holidays when they experience spikes they don't have to purchase expensive hardware that just sits there instead they can leverage the power of the cloud and scale up or down depending on the demand that is the power of cloud and that wraps up today's video hope you enjoyed today's video if you did give me a thumbs up hit subscribe and i'll see you in the next video
