 good morning and welcome to our Pearson BTech apprenticeship safe transition webinar for the engineering and manufacturing sector my name is Brandi Leonard I am the sector manager for engineering and manufacturing and I'll be guiding you through this presentation today so the purpose for today is to provide you with some information and tools and assistance to allow you to have plan for your transition from sales apprenticeships to new apprenticeship standards from August 2020 now for those of you who have been around apprenticeships for a while you will know that say apprenticeships have been scheduled for withdrawal from July 2020 for the last number of years new apprenticeship standards were developed from 2014 onwards and we are finally switching off seis as of this July so what we have is a number of mentorship frameworks that are currently existing for framework for framework delivery and these are the ones that will be impacted in the safe switch off now all of these frameworks listed are currently offered by Center or are there now known ingenuity so these are the ones that you'll need to be aware of there may be other frameworks offered by other sector skills councils for example the National Skills Academy for food and drink manufacturing but I've not listed those here so we have composites at level two and three engineering and manufacture which are the main bulk of our apprenticeship frameworks level two three and four and we have our improving operational performance at level two which is our PEO PMO and bi T and our of operations and quality improvement level three framework which is bi t at level 3 so all of these will be switched off as of the 31st of July we haven't had confirmation as to when the certification ending will be but it's likely to be a minimum of two years so we're looking at probably July 2022 as a minimum in terms of outstanding learners being certificated on this if you have any questions about certification end days for the frameworks then please do contact sentro ingenuity or apprenticeship certificate England as well he should be able to find some further assistance what we have provided in the handouts are a couple of documents to help you understand what's being switched off and our recommendations for alternative standards so these can be seen in the engineering safety standards January 2020 document and the engineering Sasa standards qualifications document now the first document shows you at a high level the framework the framework pathway and our suggested framework standard replacement this isn't a guarantee obviously you would need to look at the details of each apprenticeship standard to see if it is a suitable standard for you I would also say that standards tend to be written quite high level so it may not appear immediately obvious that that's a direct replacement for the existing framework pathway but please do look at the new skills knowledge new behaviors and the duties that someone will do as part of that apprenticeship and it may become apparent that that is the correct equivalent for you the safety standards qualifications document has the same level of detail but also outlines the qualifications that will link to the frameworks and then the qualifications that are linked to the standards in some engineering and manufacturing qualification standards there are mandated qualifications and then there are others where there are no mandated qualifications but where it's recommended that you may consider a qualification to help support either your on-the-job training or you're off the job training so the landscape post July it's an interesting landscape like I said there will be no safe frameworks although you will have your legacy learners that started potentially last September just coming to the app coming to the end or partway through their programs but all new starts from the 1st of August 2020 will have to be on a new apprenticeship standard so what does this mean to you so in engineering and manufacturing we have 172 apprenticeship standards listed so this is the largest number across all apprenticeship sectors we've been developing standards since November 2014 when the Richards review took place and employee groups have been very busy since that time creating new apprenticeship standards so at the moment we have 122 standards approved for delivery again the largest number apprenticeship standards available from level 2 to level 7 there are 22 standards in development so this is where the apprenticeship standard and/or the apprenticeship assessment plan has been approved there are 11 standards where the proposal has been accepted so this is where the Institute for apprenticeships and Technical Education have accepted that apprenticeship standard needs to be designed now our 10 apprenticeship standards have been withdrawn that's either withdrawn by the Institute or by the employer groups for a variety of reasons and there have been seven standards that have been retired which is slightly different to withdrawn of those seven standards six became the engineering technician standards our number of standards that were created in 2014 and 2015 were emerged together in March 2016 to create a super standard otherwise known as the engineering technician standard the standard has 13 occupations within it at level 3 so again look at that standard if you're not sure it could be the occupation is within that span that standard now within these standards there like I said earlier there are a number of either mandated or recommended qualifications at Pierce and offer a number of the mandated qualifications within the knowledge area and we also offer additional qualifications that may be considered well there are no mandated qualifications listed so for apprenticeship standards there are currently 26 level 2 standards available 48 level 3 standards 16 level 4 5 at level 5 17 at level 6 and 10 at level 7 so we do offer knowledge qualifications to support a number of the level 2 a number of the level 3 and the level 4 standards where it is mandated our hate NCH undies can also be used within level 4 and 5 standards but also as a top up option within the level 6 standard in many of the level 6 standards there is a mandated degree program however that can be attained in a number of different ways either with an h NC topic approach hn c hn d top approach or straight degree approach so as part of this as well we also have endpoint assessment a person at the moment currently only supports endpoint assessment for one of the level 7 standards which is level 7 systems engineer' if there are any other levels levels and standards that you wish you think the person should be able to support from an endpoint assessment perspective please do speak to your business development manager or your curriculum development manager or add it in the chat function within this webinar as engineering and manufacturing have been around from a standards perspective and since 2015 when the first apprenticeship starts were registered the Institute for apprenticeships and Technical Education are now carrying out route reviews so initially was that an apprenticeship stand would only be valid for three years and then it would have to be reviewed the Institute obviously were bought him within that three-year period and that that process was was temporarily halted they've now decided to do a wider scale route review and they're identified 59 engineering standards which are currently being reviewed by the Institute so they had a consultation which closed on the 5th of February so at the moment they are collating those responses to that consultation on those 59 standards and there are number of popular engineering standards on their engineering technician being one of them and they will feed back to the respective employer groups in the summer to autumn of this year based on that summary of feedback is it's unlikely that the employee groups will be able to make any amendments to the standards that will impact learners starting this September so it is likely that starts new standards and new requirements for new standards are likely to be and from September 2021 at the earliest there are a number of changes that the employer groups know that they need to make to the standards in order to continue to make them fit for purpose so what we have is a slide here on what the standards actually are so if you aren't aware of new standards these are an employer led apprenticeship development which have a specific occupation and include knowledge skills and behaviors that an individual is going to need to demonstrate in order to be occupationally competent qualifications alone no longer define occupational companies or the completion of qualifications no longer define occupational competence so this list this outlines what an employer an employee or an apprentice needs to know do and how to behave in order to be occupation comfortable with a specific occupation so employers creates a standard which is a bit like a job description and then they create an assessment plan which is how a candidate needs to be assessed to be deemed occupationally competent and that is carried out by an independent endpoint assessment so this is an assessment as carried out by an independent body to the employer and training provider of that apprenticeship and it usually looks at two different types of assessment methodologies as a minimum that is carried out at the end of their apprenticeship to deem them occupationally competent so how can we support you on these on our website we have an apprenticeship section where you can see the link to apprenticeship standards this will list all of the apprenticeship standards that Pearson are currently supporting and the offer in which we're supporting either on program or endpoint assessment this includes mandated or recommended qualifications prepare preparation and support for endpoint assessment links to any online or digital learning support that we may have for on program as well within the handouts you will see that I have added in an additional handout this lists the hundred and twenty two standards that are available in engineering and manufacturing and outlines pace and support offer for both on program and endpoint assessment so where there are Monday tikona fication they will contain the mandated qualification with a link to the specification page on our website where is recommended you will see that it says recommended in the link to the specification page and where we offer endpoint assessment you will see the link to the endpoint assessment page on our website so for further support and questions you need to contact either your business development manager or your curriculum development manager depending on whether you're a private training provider or an Fe College we've also listed here the telephone numbers for the customer services teams and also the email addresses so I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you very much for listening and if you want to attend any face-to-face or support events please take a look at our training from Pearson page where you will find more information thank you
