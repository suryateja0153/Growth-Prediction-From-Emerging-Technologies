 [Music] my name is chris trollo i'm a senior manager within deloitte touch and i lead our google cloud cyber security efforts for businesses that that are driving the continued movement into the cloud it's important that cyber security gets involved early and in addition to understanding the opportunities that the cloud presents it's also important i should say to understand the change in risk responsibilities and governance around creating new capabilities or even managing existing ones by embracing the cloud-native security capabilities that the hyperscalers provide and incorporating that into a security reference architecture that's how organizations can leverage the true power of the cloud and some of the benefits would be around the concepts of implementing a true zero trust security model or secure access service edge or or sassy architecture and and for those looking to truly make the leap and adopt to a next-gen approach this is something that they can consider taking advantage of now most organizations have a multi-cloud environment and there are solutions that integrate and scale across the multi-cloud so we think about things like anthos for hybrid cloud development or beyondcorp for platforms that enable xero trust security concepts by having a true framework to operate across multiple security domains such as identity and access management data security network infrastructure security application security and threat monitoring it really helps organizations better prepare to prevent detect and respond to cyber threats in a modernized environment and organizations that think about these domains and their footprint in the cloud that again there are native capabilities to tap into and leverage within your existing environment things like how organizations are shifting from traditional perimeter based defense in depth type architectures i think castle and moat to more elegant and holistic approaches like zero trust and if we take beyond corp for example as a zero trust model it could really help reduce the attack surface and implement more secure controls but also at the same time optimize end user experience it also provides organizations a framework and a platform that institutes a set of capabilities to start to bring security closer to the application and the data that people are accessing the data collection and the analysis challenge continues to grow as well for security practitioners and the need to collect growing amounts of data is ever more important so organizations are starting to look to next-gen tools such as chronicle for example to enhance their visibility that helps them collect all of the security telemetry in their environment and and really supplement the human ability to look for the small outliers that might typically go unnoticed
