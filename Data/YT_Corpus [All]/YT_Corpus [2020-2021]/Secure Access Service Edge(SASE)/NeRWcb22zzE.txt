 from the cube studios in palo alto in boston connecting with thought leaders all around the world this is a cube conversation hello everyone welcome to the cube conversation here from our palo alto studios i'm john furrier host of thecube we're here with our remote crew getting all the interviews getting all the stories that matter during this time we're all sheltering in place during the covent crisis we've got a great returning guest john madison evp of products and chief marketing officer fortinet john great to see you uh looking good with the home studio there getting used to it yeah indeed great to be here again john thanks for coming i really appreciate it we're hearing a lot about sassy which is yeah secure access network edge obviously zero trust network access uh what does that all mean now these days what is this sassy well there's definitely a lot of hype around the word sassy which is the security of the edge for us actually it confirms a strategy that we've had since the beginning of the company and two important concepts one is the coming together of networking and security we could refer to it as security driven networking and we've been doing it using asics and appliances for a long time we're now going to expand it to cloud as well so that's one concept again bringing together networking and security or converging them in a way and then the second concept is more around a platform approach so if you look at the definition of sasi it includes sd-wan it includes web gateway as a service zero trust casby uh waff etc and so bringing those together in a platform approach we refer to as the fabric so we're actually really happy about those two concepts coming together uh maybe the name itself could be could be different but definitely the concepts and the technologies play really well to our strategy yeah it's sassy s-a-s-e not two-ways it's not like sas software's a service where everyone knows it's cloud yeah i i tried using the full name but i reverted back to sassy again short and sassy keep it short and sweet um okay well this is a super important relevant topic for multiple reasons one is covet has kind of accelerated the future for everybody and you know we've been kind of riffing on twitter and throughout the industry and i've been calling it the big iot experiment because the unforecasted disruption of covet has forced everyone to work at home so the notion of work changes workplace is now home workforce the people how their interaction with the networks workloads workflows all changing new expectations new experiences this is the real deal and the edge is where the action is that's the big new obvious architectural highlight here yeah so we talked last time i think we were just beginning this work from home element but um we're still here and i think what it says is that and what is force is that enterprises and customers need to look at their edges and they're increasing so we always the one edge was a new one over the last two years as we introduced sd-wan they had a data center edge they had an endpoint edge now you have a home edge and so you've got to apply uh security there's a cloud edge as well you've got to apply security to these edges and the key is the flexibility to apply the security you want and you need against those edges and so we're seeing some customers right now look at setting up mini enterprise networks to protect that home age again in that in the homes of their executives or develop and we reported with the news you guys had a couple months ago around just that such been a feeding frenzy for hackers and bad actors to go after the home environment um as well as the i.t guys who are working from home you know the cloud consumption's shifted as well you're seeing the cloud players doing extremely well because now you have more cloud you have more vulnerabilities at the edge with the home this is changing completely increasing the the attacks yeah the attack vectors you know predominantly still actually you know a lot of phishing but then if you're on the network that attack vector is very important so for us and you know we did an acquisition last week of opaque networks because that gave us an additional consumption model and different additional uh form factor so if somebody's going from the home straight into the cloud or the peering off branching off an sd-wan connection straight into the cloud we can now apply that cloud edge security through our sassy capabilities so again the ability to have security at all these edges has become very important going forward so for us now we've got appliances we've got virtual machines we've got cloud delivery and this is becoming very important to customers i'm not saying and customers are not saying they're going to go to just cloud only going forward they're going to be hybrid and so having those options is very important you mentioned opaque networks we reported that acquisition congratulations what does that mean for fortinet and where does that technology fit in you mentioned software can you just take a minute to explain the acquisition impact of fortinet and where does the tech fit well as i said we've been driving a lot of this conversion sassy convergence through our appliances but it sometimes makes sense to put that security closer to the cloud appearing points or wherever and so opaque we really like their model of building out these hyper hearing stations and making sure they got high speed security there as well as edges and so we bring we're going to bring that inside our environment uh update it to include some of our technology but it gives us now great flexibility of applying that security at the sd-wan edge the data center edge and now the cloud edge our longer term roadmaps will integrate orchestration capabilities it also includes a zero trust network access capability as well so really when we looked at our of sassy framework we had most of things in place this now adds firewall as a service as well as zero trust network access giving us the most complete sassy framework in the marketplace what is the security component work at home you mentioned earlier there's more networks and companies are looking to kind of up level the capabilities can you give an example and take us through what that looks like and what companies are thinking about because it's not just here's some extra money for your home bandwidth you're people are working there so it's got to be industrial strength edge now it's not just um you know temporary and their kids are home too so you got they're gaming they're watching netflix people are zooming in and doing web x's all day long it's a work environment it can be as simple as putting a zero trust network access you know agent on there and and doing some security locally and then going back to a proxy you know we believe actually that it can be even better than that that can apply midi enterprise security in your house through uh next-gen firewall give high availability through sd-wan uh then you know expand out the secure access and switching and endpoints and we can do that today i think what's going to be key going forward is as you're dealing as it teams have to deal with more of a consumer approach remotely in the homes we're going to simplify the way things get set up such that you can easily separate out maybe home usage from corporate enterprise usage so that will be something we'll be working on over the next 18 months i mean just provisioning the hardware okay here you go plug it in it should be plug and play this is kind of back to the future of where sas is going i mean the old days with plug and play with the technology now you take that concept it has to be auto configured you have to provision pretty quickly what's the future of sassy in your mind yeah and so if you think about you know coming back to the home usage then people have dumbed down those routers and the security is very simplistic because so we people can just plug and play if you need to be a bit more sophisticated uh you're going to need to put some tools in place we believe long term that the sassy model once you've got the platforms in place once you've got sd-wan in place your casby your sassy xero trust and long term you're going to need an orchestration system that's more ai driven so we've done a lot of work on ai around security and making sure we can see things very quickly but the long-term goal i think will be around ai ops ai network ops where the system and the big data systems are looking across your network across these different components to see where there may be an issue maybe there's a certain link that's gone down across a certain isp we need to bring that back up maybe there's a certain qrs to an application in the cloud somewhere so we need to change the on-ramp uh so once everything's in place and you have that console and policy engine that can look across everything then we need to get smarter by looking at the data and the logs etc and applying some of that ai technology you know john we've been following fortinet as you know for many many years and watching the evolution of you guys as a company and also as the industry the new waves are coming in a lot of the stuff you're doing with the fabric and now the secure driven networking has been kind of on the playbook so i want to get your thoughts before we get into those topics and define them and kind of unpack them but generally customers are looking at a slew of vendors out there and you have ten or two approaches you have a platform approach and then you have the word application or fully full stack or sas or something and there's there's trade-offs between the two and how should customers understand the difference because there's different value propositions for each platform's more enabling out of the box sas or point solution can solve this particular thing but it may not have that breadth how should customers think about a platform approach or fabric and and how should they think about the value and how to engage with that long term yeah i'm definitely seeing more customers look towards a platform going forward they just can't manage all the different point solutions and you have to train an individual on that product you have a separate management console you have to integrate it and so more and more i'm finding customers wanting to converge which is the basis of sassy consolidate applications onto a platform or security applications what's important though for that platform is that the consumption model is flexible enough to be an appliance to be a virtual machine and to be cloud delivery because as customers networks move and their orchestration systems move into different more cloud or they've got their ip enabling their factories for example then they need that security to be flexible so yes you need to a platform is the way forward but two things one is you need a flexible consumption model for it you know appliance virtual machine and cloud and also that platform needs to be very open it needs to have connectors into the main orchestration systems it needs to allow people to build api and automation so yes you need a platform but it needs to be open and it needs to be flexible great great insight there and that's exactly what the marketing especially the cloud the kind of scale second follow-up question of that is how do you tell the difference between a tool camouflage as a platform so i have a tool i want to sell you a tool but no it's a platform so a lot of people are peddling tools and seeing their platforms how do you know the difference well to me a platform has much greater scope across the attack surface first of all they attack vectors whether that be email or application the network the endpoint so a platform's not just of a specific attack vector it can go across the complete uh surface and then also a platform uh is when it's organically built allows those products to communicate so then you can build automation across it it's very hard to build automation across two or three different vendors they have different eyes different scripts so being able to build that automation and then of course on top of that to have a single view single visibility capability as well as long term apply that ai ops across it and so platform is very very different from some of the tools i've seen in the marketplace i want to get to your reaction to a comment that your ceo said about security driven networking and underscores what we've been saying for years blah blah blah goes on in this era of hyper connectivity and expanding networks with the network edge stretching across the entire digital infrastructure networking and security have to be kind of be there they're converging as you mentioned describe how you view hyper connectivity and expanding networks and how the edge stretches across the digital infrastructure what's what does that look like can you share your vision of that when you think about networking if you go back 20 years when you have these 10 megabits second connections really networking and routing and switching they haven't really changed that much over the last eight you know 20 years they've just got a lot faster we've gone to now to 400 gigabits per second but the basic functionality is the same and so it's allowed them to go a lot faster um security is very different you know started off with firewalling and vpn and then next-gen firewall ssl inspection all these functionalities ips have been added making a lot harder for it to keep up in the network and so one of the fundamental principles of security driven networking is bringing these two things together but accelerating them either using asics and now cloud through our acquisition uh to allow those to run in a converged format and that's very important as i said there's now more you can look at it two ways you can i say the perimeter's expanded because it used to be a very narrow perimeter at the data center across these areas all the edges have formed as well these new edges sitting at the ot environment sitting at the want edge sitting at the home edges they talked about sitting at the cloud edge and so the ability to apply that security in very high performance very high quality security not just a small sampling of security a full enterprise stack at those edges it's going to be critical going forward and the flexibility to apply in different ways is going to be very important i think the convergence piece is totally relevant and obviously consolidating into a platform's great key point there um while i got you here i would like you i'd like you to define what is security driven networking and what does it mean to be security driven so define security driven networking and give an example of what it means yeah and so i think it's i think the one edge was one of the best examples of it i mean actually before that next gen file was where you brought firewalling and then content inspection together but i think the latest one is definitely the one edge or secure sd-wan where you had a networking function which was to get the users to the right applications so they got this application now steering that goes out through there well you also want to apply security to that because security into the wam you've also got to protect the land and so the ability to run a security stack there whether it be ips or application control is very important so getting all those networking functions working at high speed getting all the security functions working at high speed is the kind of the genesis of security driven networking and you can apply it there we can also apply it in other places of the edge in the cloud now or home it's a very very important concept uh to be able to run networking and security together at high speeds everyone has their own kind of weird definition of sassy depending if you're building your own or different analyst firms i noticed you guys have a different take on this even gartner has a different view on this how do you guys diff differ from that that definition and what should people be aware of when they hear that what is the right definition yeah you know it's unfortunate i mean i i think ghana does some good work there and that they define it and you know come up with sassy but this is like acronym soup and you know i want a bit of next-gen firewall on my sassy it's just it's just so many different terms it confuses the customer and what makes it more confusing is that vendors look at their portfolio and go oh sassy's a hot topic i've got a sassy as well and really it should be very clear what the definition from gartner is it is bringing together security and networking now their definition is that they you should do that in the cloud which we agree with as well but it can't only be in the cloud the reason it's in the cloud is because not many people have got the ability to run on an appliance very fast so we believe our difference there is that you should be able to write it on an appliance virtual machine and cloud and then the second kind of difference is that they've defined the components of sassy as being sd-wan casby firewalls or servers xero trust we also think that the lan edge is very important so we would add into that definition the secure access of wi-fi and ethernet switching as well and so we try and point out you know the definition and we also point out where we differ and i think that's fair so the customer can make a good decision i think it is fair and i think one of the things i've been saying for years and i love gardner i love the guys over there and gals i just don't think that their business model is real time as much but they end up kind of getting it right down the road but you brought up a good point again i've been saying this for years cloud changes gartner's model because this if you have quadrants it implies silos it implies categories and one of the best things about cloud is it does horizontally scale so some of the best vendors actually have multiple capabilities that might fall on different quadrants that may or may not be judged on a criteria that meets what cloud's doing so for instance asics you mentioned right that's in there too you got cloud and asics is that well they've got two different categories you add the edge in there if you do all three really great as an integrated converge and consolidated platform you're technically awesome but you might not fit in the quadrant yes it's a really good point i have this conversation with them all the time in that traditionally enterprises have had networking teams and security teams and they've been in silos or they've had a networking team that just does switching or just this routing or just this sd-wan i have a security team that does web gateway and they like to separate them all into different components when you look inside those 90 quadrants they're all different people's the same vendor the different products and what we like to do is bring it all together in a single operating system a single appliance or cloud a virtual machine sometimes it's not quite doesn't quite fit the model but in the end you're trying to do the same you know and covet 19 one of the real realities that everyone's dealing with is it does expose everything and it exposed and again it's been a disruption unforecasted but it's not like an outage or a flood or a hurricane it happened and it's happening it really puts the pressure on looking at the network it's looking at how you can have continuous operations how are you working with your people and workloads workforces and apps you got to have it all there and if you're not digitally enabled you're going to be on the wrong side of history this is what companies are facing every day and they got to come back and double down on the right project so every cxo i talk about that's the number one challenge i need to come out of the pandemic with a growth strategy and an architecture that's going to allow me to take advantage of the new realities hey it's really good for people working home that's cool some people are going to continue to do that maybe that's normal maybe that's a new tactic and it's going to vary by industry as well so if i'm a you know retail outlet i absolutely need 100 uptime for those retail hours because people are holding online and they're driving open things so it has changed the dynamics it's for me working at home i have to be up all the time and so the the ability to do really good high quality networking high availability high q of s with this integrated security across the different edges is super critical going forward i was talking with a network friend of mine again we were having a few zoom cocktails and do a little social networking uh online and we're like and we've we've mentioned this before in the cube but we keep coming back to the when is the new lan and meaning that it's in the old days land was everything everything local area network and you were inside the data center everything was great on premises when is the new lan so if you think about it that way you go okay way on edge i got a now a land at home you've got an sd-wan in your house of course you work for fortinet so it's a little bit beneficial for you your your your geek there but this is the new normal where it's all one network it's not just a wan link it's a system can you react to that what's your take on that when is the new land kind of riff first of all first of all i can't be too geeky he goes on the cmo as well so let's not talk about the geekiness um but um it's just it just makes us keep saying it's it's it's making sure that wherever you may be you know you're doing less traveling these days but that may come back at some point or whether you're at a branch office or a campus environment or wherever applications and they're moving around in different clouds in different areas in terms of consumption and workloads wherever that's happening you'll be able to be flexible in applying that security to the different edges lane edge one edge home edge data center edge and so the ability to do that while providing high speed and connectivity is very important and then again as you go forward and you implement that platform approach so not just the point product now three or four products working together uh i've being able to apply that policy orchestration and ai ops uh is going to make sure that they get that user in the end it's all about the user experience do i have a high quality of experience whatever application i'm using that's the key measurement in the end you know one observation i would have if you look back at the whole virtualization trend going back to the early days of vmware that kind of enabled amazon on kind of having a large scale kind of infrastructure hyper convergence really kind of collapsed everything together and and now you're seeing things with amazon like outposts you're seeing you know these on-premises devices which is basically one cloud operations kind of highlights what you're saying here i want to get your thoughts on this because the combination of asics with cloud it's not a bug it's a feature for you guys that's a value proposition and it's kind of consistent with some of the big players like aws when you look at what they're doing and apprenticeships for instance what they're putting in the servers having that combination of horsepower asics with cloud is a guiding principle of the future architecture can you share your thoughts because obviously you guys are are announcing that and have that feature yeah well another reason why we like the opaque acquisition is they were at their major peering pubs into the the different cloud service providers they were using hardware and that hardware we we can run hardware and with our a6 almost 50 100 times faster than equipment cpu so i've got a a firewall application i've got an appliance there i may need a hundred virtual machines and cpus they're running the same thing so again we're coming back to that definition of security-driven networking in our minds it can be asic it can be virtual machine and it can be cloud now imagine if we can take the best benefits of asic and combine that with cloud that's a great model going forward again given that flexibility so when people think cloud something has to run on something it doesn't run in fresh air so you know the big cloud vendors are putting in some asics to accelerate some of the ai stuff and we're going to use the same thing in some of our major what we call 40 sassy you know our naming methodology is 40 whatever it does going forward to provide us that performance and high availability now yes you're always going to need some flexibility of virtual machines in certain areas but we think the combination of both it gives us a great advantage yeah and there's definitely evidence that i mean there's kind of two schools of thought on hardware are you a box mover you know commodity general purpose or are you using the hardware in a system architecture acceleration has been a huge advantage whether i've seen companies doing accelerated kubernetes processing you know for clusters and some you know i see gpus are out there it's it's it's how you use the hardware yeah that's the really the key again back to the architecture it's okay so wrapping up if you if you believe that and you look at the fabric that you guys are having out there and as it evolves what's that what's the next level for foreign how do you see this going forward you got security driven networking you got the fabric what's next what are you guys working on on the product side i know you're public you can't reveal any future earnings but give us a taste of kind of the the direction on the roadmap i think you know we've got now all the all the kind of component the underlying components of the platform in terms of the ability to apply appliances or deliver it by appliances or virtual machine or cloud we've got a very broad portfolio from endpoint uh all the way into to the cloud and the network so all those things are in place obviously you always need some features here and there as you go forward an sd-wan and next-gen firewall etc um but i think the long-term i think uh goal for us then is to again to apply a bit more intelligence uh both from a security perspective and from a network perspective such that we can predict things we can automatically change things we can build automation and react to things much more quickly so i think the building blocks are in place now i think it's the ability to provide a bit more smart across it which of course takes big data and a very specific application programming and i think definitely our customers are asking us about that and we'll work very closely with our customers to build out that to make sure it meets their needs going forward well it's great to see the platform continue to grow and and fill in a holistic view of the of the landscape from edge to throughout the enterprise so great strategy and thanks for the update john madison evp of products and cmo for john great great to have you on thanks for coming on thanks jim okay this is the cube conversation here in palo alto studios i'm john furrier your host
