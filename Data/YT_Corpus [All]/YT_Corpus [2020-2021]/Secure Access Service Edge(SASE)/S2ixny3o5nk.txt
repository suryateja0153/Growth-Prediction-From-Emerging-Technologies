 [Music] welcome to network security everything you need to know about protecting your remote work experience as well as enabling your digital uh workloads my name is shane o'donovan and i lead our network security and product management team as well as our azure front door a cloud cdn these are indeed crazy times and unprecedented in so many ways no one in my mind could have predicted this year that we've had and it has been especially challenging in the area of network security from the amount of attacks that we've experienced on our network um during the march to june we saw a 50 spike in ddos attacks we saw increased variance in in phishing and in the different types of bots that were trying to break into workloads we saw organizations really struggle with how do they bring new applications to market especially in the government and healthcare systems we heard from our retailers where they they talked about their online sites now having uh you know a black friday every day um that equivalent of traffic load um and then we also heard from customers who are really struggling to support that transition to remote work and when they hit vpn scalability issues if they were still using an on-premise vpn solution um and for our services in particular within azure it's been at least 90 percent growth in the overall consumption of them everything across vpn azure front door azure firewall every one of them has uh really usage has has just taken a new dimension of growth this i would say like the best way to describe covert at least from our perspective is it really was an accelerator um for us on on a set and a set of key trends that were already underway the first one was how was an organization what the internet edge actually looked like and how many of them are now really moving to using the the cloud as their internet edge that's the first sort of thing that we saw the other thing that we saw is that custom that customers are really trying to get the user to application to be more internet first when all the users left the corporate network there really was no corporate network anymore and where and and as we look at applications the design and how you make them available it's really we want to think about an internet first strategy however you do want the internet is a is a it's a little bit of a wild west and so you have to also be thinking about well not everything not every part of your application should be on the internet and so there it's all about in the back end it's all about how do you use private connectivity it gives you another layer of defense in addition to additional mechanisms that you can use to protect the workload and then the third kind of major um thing that customers when they move to the cloud they really aren't just looking for a cheaper place to run their workload they're looking for transformation that gives their developers more agility that gives them more flexibility that they can be more adaptive and so they really are embracing sort of how do i get infrastructure as cloud because every one of our services is api driven it really allows them to use new devops and incorporate cic pipelines as part of their overall cycle of making changes and they can just move faster and so we're seeing that same model and approach in network security something that you never thought about if you were on premises and so really we're looking this kind of this this flat open network going from that flat open trusted network to really a software-defined model and using zero trust principles and just a reminder for everyone um who isn't already a familiar because it has become quite an industry-wide model is that those three core principles are really about really about verify explicitly all access requests and use a least privileged model and then always assume that a breach may be possible so how do you prevent that latter and movement in your network so speaking of security models you may ask yourself well tell me a little bit more about what does zero trust for networking actually mean and it really is quite simple it's really going from this flat open network to a fully fully segmented network all you know even you can go to instead of having three to ten perimeters you really can go to thousands and again that infrastructure as code and that software defined networking model really supports that that model to go as deep as you need to go to protect your workloads the second kind of key thing is how do you really beef up your your track protection capabilities i think in in sort of this old world you were using a lot of static filtering and you had years of history of of these rules that you you you're not sure anymore were they working why are they there but really going to more of an ml driven and you and behavior-driven rule creation and so it's really looking at trap protection from a new lens and then the third major thing is really how do you approach encryption and it's not just about you know the user to app which you say hey i'm using ssl you're encrypted it's really not it's like the layers of encryption that you have in the infrastructure in your back end how do you really make sure that if there's any breach at any layer that you can make sure that there's very little um damage they can do or very little that they can exfiltrate so that's really really about the xero truss model i really like another model and gartner last year published this really interesting and paper it's it's you know the future of network security it's all in the cloud and it has a kind of a catchy name um it's called the secure access service edge our sassy um and really that's looking at this sort of convergence of both the network connectivity model and the network security model and and how you how those come together so that you can um be more secure and be more agile and these models really fit very very well into our approach at microsoft and enabling uh you to be more secure so let me dig in a little bit more tell you a little bit more about there's kind of five hero scenarios for azure networking all up the first one is about how do you set up that secure foundation so that you can build those apps and the second one is really about how do you enable remote work at scale and what are the different services that we provide to enable you to have a great remote experience and then the third one is what about your apps how do you deliver them and then there's a set of services around how you connect up your infrastructure and then the fifth one is really about the 5g and edge computing and how you build new types of apps so today i'm just going to focus in on the three the network infrastructure remote work at scale and app delivery and this is all using the foundation of all these services we have one of the largest global networks and that's an underpinning to everything that we do here so let's dig right in and the first one up is um is remote work at scale so all of our services in azure are very composable and and then we integrate them with specific services or we integrate them natively within the service so i want to just talk about the first three or a little bit about how do you do connectivity so you've got a vpn and that there's two modes to vpn how do you connect remote users um to your networks but also and then there's another capability which is how do you connect your networks together and we support bulk modes and i would say every azure customer uses vpn for one or more of these capabilities the second service which is really think about it as a dev orientated services it's really how do you do seamless rdp and ssh into your resources without having to give that resource a public ip and that's our azure bastion service and then the third service is virtual wang and this really is an integration service and it does have some core routing capabilities as well to enable that a full mesh network but it really is a united united framework of how you bring networking and security and the global network all together in one integrated way um and then we have a set of security services then um azure firewall which is all about how do you create and enforce you know traffic rules that work across subscription or a virtual network and then the firewall manager which is really how do you do central global policy um at scale and how do you have a global global policy and a local policy and how do you consolidate your routing as well and configuration and so the two of these sets of service kind of really enabled that sassy edge that i i spoke about so i want to just give you a couple of quick highlights on um a little bit into vpn gateway and tell you what's new so first of all um one of the approaches that we've taken in vpn is very platform oriented open open protocols and so we support ikev2 openvpn which is the only truly open source ssl library available and sstp and so really any client that supports ip2 which they all do or openvpn will work with our solution and this is a high-scale vpn solution and it's got fully um azure ad integrated and that's completely new everything from single sign-on to multi-factor all to conditional access and we also even though we work with all these third-party clients we do provide our own native client um for windows and we also provide a client for mac os which is now in preview so the next service i want to tell you a little bit about is is bastion and again my goal here is not to go in depth on the service but just to pique your interest and there'll be um other um sessions where you can learn a little deeper so the key new thing with azure bastion is now it originally it used to be constrained to the v-net um to a the specific v-neck now it works with it supports in-appearing so you can just deploy one bastion gateway and it will work with all your peered v-nets and in addition it will also work with on-premise resources so really phenomenal improvements in bastion then the third one that i want to talk about this is a very simple integration that we've done which is with virtual desktop and azure firewall there's two parts to windows virtual desktop that you need to think about when you're protecting there's one part which is in order to use the service the customer sets up the vms in their own subscription and so and then there's then of course once the users start connecting to the service that that is all done through those uh vms that were deployed so when we look at this integration it really is about that those vms to the service that we've locked down and it's super easy for you to be able to control the traffic flows and protect that part of it and with the integration with firewall manager you could also um also deploy firewall and third-party security to help protect the user traffic so that's just a little bit about those services so the next service i want to just talk about is um azure virtual wan and uh and firewall manager together this is perhaps um the most complex to speak to in in this brief webinar but the idea here is that it is an open platform of connectivity and security so if you look at the diagram you can see that we can connect to anything and including aws and gcp um your branch offices through st1 your data centers whether true express route or vpn and your end user so we give you this really nice model where you can bring all your traffic together into this hub and then we've native security integrated into the hub and we've also got third party security integrated so what's nice and new here is we've now um both checkpoint and ibos are in in public preview and hopefully soon going to ge with their integration and we've also opened up the hub so that now the sd1 providers can even add additional mechanisms to optimize the flow within the hub so lots of great capabilities here so with that i'm going to hand it over to gopi he's going to do a quick demo of the integration between vpn virtual one and azure firewall thank you senet my name is gopi krishna kanan i'm a principal product manager in the azure firewall team so i'm going to demo the secure virtual hub combining azure firewall with vpn client access before i start my demo i want to share a slide on what you are going to be seeing today here is a view of the demo setup the van hub has been secured using both azure firewall and z-scaler azure firewall will filter east-west traffic this includes all traffic between v-nets and venus and branch offices and client access z-scaler will secure all internet traffic notice that the hub has two servers to the left of the image we will now demonstrate remote user access to these servers via the azure firewall and internet breakout for the remote user via z-scaler we start by visiting the firewall manager which provides a centralized experience for managing all your firewall deployments notice that the hub has both azure firewall and z-scaler firewall is used for private traffic filtering and z-scaler for internet breakout next we will download the vpn configuration this is required for setting up vpn client access to the hub the vpn client supports native azure active directory authentication with single sign-on conditional access and multi-factor authentication thus enabling a zero trust access model now launch vpn connect client and connect to the hub we will run ipconfig to verify the hub provided ip address next we will ping the servers connected to the hub and verify that we are able to access the azure resources thanks to the allow rules configured in the firewall now for the sake of this demo we will remove one of the servers from the firewall allow rule this will automatically block access to the server from remote client access or any other vns connected to the hub notice the ping failure on the right this is because it has been blocked by the azure firewall default deny room we are now verified private traffic filtering via azure firewall next let's verify internet traffic breaker by a z-scaler we browse to show my ip notice the ip displayed is z-scaler ip this means all internet traffic has been secured using z-scaler you can also visit the z-scaler portal to set up internet policy and review traffic to the internet z-scaler provides detailed information of the traffic to the internet you can also sort and search the logs for interesting traffic patterns this completes our demo now back to you seanette all right thank you gold p that was really really great i love how we saw the client um seamlessly connecting um into azure and and also being able to connect to the internet through a third party so that's great so let me tell you a little bit about the secure foundation now and this really is it's really super important that there's kind of two main use cases that customers are really trying to do the first one is really about how do you do network segmentation and and the virtual network is the center point here um this is where this is the place where you put all your your resources um and you would with a lot of sdn controls you can then have multiple v-nets you can create a central v-net if you so choose and peer them together and so that the v-net is kind of that foundational and network segmentation control and then on the in in the v-neck there's sort of two additional controls that are very useful one is the network security groups and that they think of that as your your your your endpoint kind of firewall or in node firewall that works on the v-net or within the v-net and then the second very useful control is private link which is your ability to take a pass service and then attach it to the virtual network so you can access that pass service privately you can access it from on-premise or you can access that and you can really take that past service off the internet for your specific resource and then firewall is also incredibly useful here as you go to segment because firewall works across v-nets multiple units and across subscriptions and it also can be um sort of a filtering node um with for all traffic whether it's your egress out to the internet and it can block and it works on on higher layers as well so not alone is it layer three layer four but also uh layer seven control so then as you look at sort of your track protection capability if you have a public ip that you're exposing to internet we highly recommend that you enable ddos protection on it it rddos will then tune it to your specific application workload and you may also want to look at um using firewall here as you wanna govern that flow um as well and that's just again to give you that overall track protection so when you put these three together you know that the segmentation and the track protection and then the underlying foundation capability we have for encryption that really sets you up well for zero trust networking so i want to tell you a little bit about what's new um we have now got 36 services that are private link enabled and every new service coming out of azure now will support private um private link and i hope soon to also talk to you about all services all services and azure have a plan for when they will support private link and and uh we hope in the not too distant future you will see all services in azure supporting private link a lot of new capabilities came to azure firewall sql um was a big one being able to force tunnel to on-premise was also a big one and some nice things in in preview right now like all ports protocols and gns proxy and on the ddos front we really amped up um the amount of uh protection you have and so now we have the capacity to um protect about up to about 45 terabit attack which is huge given the largest known attack is about 1.7 today so we hope that is enough and will continue to advance here so let me just dig in a little bit and tell you a little bit more about app delivery this is another area that's super important into your digital experiences how you protect those web applications um how do you scale them how do you optimize them how do you keep them highly keep them reliable so swedish services here uh waffling a foundational one and where you block common vulnerabilities like sql injection or or bots i didn't know this but half of the traffic on the internet is bots and really just uh this should be the age of the rise of the bots and uh it's sort of interesting too that they're not all bad bots but a lot of them are and the when you look at your waffle it's very tied to your delivery mechanism and so we have kind of two groups of delivery mechanisms available for customer the first one is azure front door this service is really tuned for your internet workloads office 365 linkedin every one of our internal services uses front door um to both accelerate it and then they apply the what policies to protect it and this runs at the edge of our um of our network in the 170 pops worldwide and it really accelerates and protects the workload with the wac policies we also have a regional low balancer and that also can be configured as an ingress controller for aks so the combination of actually azure front door and app gateway really make a really excellent ampere as you think about those few those um modern apps and those containerized workloads and ddos again can be layered here um in the case of azure front door it's natively integrated and will offer native protection out of the box and then likewise firewall is often um is also used here to protect um outbound traffic flows from the uh app and some of the inbound flows so a couple of things on what's new with really key was the supporting aks natively um as well as the sentinel integration and uh we continue to have features we've brought a number of features then to the regional laugh and has now got that support and we've also added a waf on our cdn infrastructure as well so just wanna maybe one of the key things you may not necessarily think about azure front door or cdn as as a protection capability but they really are because when we saw um during this covet situations you know keeping your your your website and and property up and running is a big deal and how do you get that high scale and how do you give the optimal experience to use it no matter where they come from and so really that is about our azure front door new capability here was the introduction of the rules engine giving you a lot of control over kind of if this if the if the client looks like this i want you to do this um a lot of those fine brain controls and also the aks ingress controller for app gateway was also very key here so this is just a view of all of the services together how they are kind of layered and and really our mindset here is kind of a defensive app model where you can use that you know you start with the foundation which is our software-defined network controls then you peel that with your network security controls your connectivity controls and then that you can also augment with partners so key takeaways here um just a set of things i want you to consider you know explore vpn and bastion for remote users definitely segment your network um with v-nets and network security groups really take a defense adapt and strategy and embrace that internet first with a private backend and enable waff and um on all your web workloads and then explore azure as your internet edge with virtual one and firewall manager um there's a lot more sessions where you can learn more about um network security i wanted to list this here and i encourage you to attend all of them and also i want to just highlight in the in the next slide the all up and azure networking sessions that you may also want to attend which will give you more information on connectivity and uh and 5g um and even go uh more deep into satellite connectivity and also the all of what's new in azure networking i would highly recommend you read as well well that's it today um everyone and thank you very much for watching
