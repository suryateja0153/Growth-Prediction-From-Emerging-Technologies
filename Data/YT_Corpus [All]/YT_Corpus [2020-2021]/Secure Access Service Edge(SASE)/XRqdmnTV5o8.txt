 from around the globe it's thecube with digital coverage of vmworld 2020 brought to you by vmware and its ecosystem partners hello and welcome back to the cube virtual 2020 coverage of vmware vmworld 2020 virtual i'm john furrier host of thecube joined with dave vellante we've got a great guest carol carpenter who's the chief marketing officer of vmware cube alumni moved from google cloud to vmware carol great to see you and thanks for coming on thecube for vmworld 2020 virtual coverage thank you yeah thank you both for having me here delighted to be here so we've i've talked to you many times before but you're very in the cloud native space you know the market pretty well i got to ask you what attracted you to come to vmware what was the what was the reason now you're heading up marketing for vmware what was the driving force well a few things you know number one i've always had a passion for this space i i love the cloud i was involved in an early stage company prior to google cloud that really had the promise of helping people get enterprises get to the cloud faster um and when i you know look around and i look at which kind of which companies are shaping the future of technology vmware is certainly one of those companies um second reason goes without saying the people in the culture incredible leadership and empowerment all throughout vmware where and it's it's quite exceptional and the third is i i really think customers are on a really tough journey um and having been at a hyperscaler having worked at places where you know companies are in a more traditional legacy environment it makes it made me realize like this is a tough journey and i think vmware is uniquely positioned to help enterprises with what is a complex journey and it's a multi-cloud world i'm sure you know that our customers know it and how do you make all these disparate systems and tools work together to deliver the business results i believe vmware is uniquely positioned to deliver it's interesting vmware is going to a whole other level we've been commenting on our analysis segments around the business performance obviously and the moves they've made over the years this is our 11th vm world cube started 10 years 11 years ago we've been seeing the moves so great technology moves product moves business performance the relationship with the clouds is all in place but then covet hits okay and then all that gets accelerated even further because you've got you know companies that have to use this downtime to re-modernize and some people get a tailwind with modern application opportunities so it's interesting time to be you know on this trajectory with vmware and the clouds what's your thoughts because you joined yeah for sure um you know it's been an incredibly challenging time i think for everyone and i hope everyone who's watching and listening is safe um that you know we talk about decades of progress being made in two weeks and i guess that's the silver lining if there is one which is this ultimate work remote work from home that we've enabled and the work anywhere it's been completely liberating in so many ways um you know it's an area where i look at there's how do we lead our teams and how do we maintain relationships with customers which obviously requires a different type of interaction a different type of outreach and and then there's what are the solutions at scale and you know i'm i'm pleased to say like there were absolute big lifts in certain areas of our business particularly around you know remote work and our digital workspace solutions you know really enabling companies to get thousands of workers up and running quickly that combined with our security solutions and our sd-wan solution to really enable all of these remote homes to become thousands of remote offices so there's all that which is incredibly positive and at the same time you know i have to tell you i i joke but i still haven't figured out where the bathroom is you know three three plus months so that you know we we i miss the human connection i miss being able to just see people and give people a hug now and then when you want to so i mean vmware carol it's amazing company you mentioned the culture before i mean it really started as a workstation virtualization company right and then so many challenges you know end user computing you guys do an acquisition bringing sanjay poonen all of a sudden you're the leader there cloud you know fumbled a little bit and all of a sudden the cloud strategy kicking in all cylinders we see that you know growing like crazy the networking piece the storage piece you mentioned security which is a amazing opportunity containers are going to kill kill vmware well i guess guess what we're embracing them it seems like culturally vmware just has this attitude of if there's a wave you know we're going to ride it we're going to embrace it and figure out how to deliver value to our customers what's your thinking on that yeah i mean it's such a vmware is such an innovative company and that is another reason that attracted me and this ability to look at what customers need like this is an incredibly we are an incredibly customer-centric company listening to customers understanding their needs and providing a bridge to where they need to go while also providing them the resiliency and and needs they have today that is what thrills me and i think we have such an incredible opportunity to continue to drive that future innovation while also being that bridge um i i have to tell you you know i've known vmware for a long time and what appealed to me is this broader portfolio and this opportunity to actually tell a broader business value story to be able to actually tell that story about not just digital transformation but business transformation so that's what that's that's the journey we're on and it's it's happening it's real i mean you look at all the customers whether it's you know jp morgan chase to um a non-profit like feeding america to you know large companies like nike it's really incredible the impact and value we can bring and i feel that my job and the marketing team's job is i tell them like they're all these diamonds in the backyard it's just some of them are a little dirty and some are they're just not fully revealed and it's our job to go and you know dust them off and and tell the story to help customers and prospects understand the value we can bring that's a so how should we be thinking how should we be thinking about that that that business value transformation business transformation you you know you certainly when you think of an applications company it there's you can easily connect the dots but how should we be thinking about vmware in that value chain are you an enabler for that that transformation can you provide some color there yeah let me give you some specific examples like look at um um so the addition of tonzu to the portfolio is what enables us to have these discussions that let's face it the only reason people need or want infrastructure is because they want to deploy an application they want to write an application they want to move an application and tanzu which is our container-based kubernetes-based uh orchestration solution and lots more to it that's what how it is in simple terms that gives us this ability to work with companies lines of business as well as developers around real business transformation so two quick examples um one i can't say the name quite yet but um i think very large pharmaceutical company who wants to launch and have a mobile app to help patients people who are taking covid19 tests get the results understand their results ask questions about their results and have one place to go that's really powerful and to be able to develop an app that is scale you know built for scale built for enterprise built to be resilient when patients are trying to get information um in four weeks i mean that's pretty that's quite incredible another example is you know a what very large e-commerce company that you know you mentioned covet and some of the challenges we know retail has certainly been kind of a a tale of two cities right some companies with lots of lyft and others with real struggle in the physical world but anyway large retailer who had to within weeks flipped to curbside pickup um being able to look for customers being able to look at inventory on demand those kinds of capabilities required a wholesale rewrite of many of their e-commerce applications again that's a place where we can go in and we can talk to them about that and by the way as you know the challenge is it's one thing to write and deploy an app and then it's another to actually run it at scale which then requires the networking scalability and flexibility it requires the virtual storage it requires all the other elements that we bring to the table so i think that is the that's kind of the landing spot but it's not the ending spot when we talk to customers carol talk about the challenge of vmworld 2020 this year it's not in person it's it's one of them it's an industry event it's been one every year it's a place where there's deep community deep technical demos deep discussions a lot of face-to-face hallway conversations that's not happening it's virtual um you came right in the middle of all this you guys pulled it together um got a lot you got keynote sessions and thanks for including thecube we really appreciate that as well but you have all this content how did you handle that and and how's that going and share some uh color on what it took to pull it off and what's your expectation yeah so you know yes vmworld is considered the gold standard when it comes to industry events i mean what from the outside in this is the canonical i.t event and so i feel really you know honored that this franchise is now in in my hands and i have an incredible team of people who obviously have been working on it for from prior to my joining so i just feel honored to be part of it um this is going to be the world's largest vmworld and on the one hand miss the energy in the room is seeing people everything you talked about the serendipitous interactions at the food line or coffee bar um but going virtual has so many benefits some of the things we were talking about earlier the ability to reach many many more people this event is going to be five to six times larger than our physical event and uh that's not even including the vmworld that we're running in in asia in china and the other thing that makes me super happy is that over 65 of our registrants and of the attendees here are actually first-time vmworld attendees so this ability to broaden our tent and make it easier i mean let's face it you know being able to fly whether it was vegas or you know san francisco was originally planned stay in these expensive hotels and take that time it was it's a big ask so by going virtual we actually have expanded our audience tremendously um the other thing i am really excited about is we have 800 plus content sessions we are following the sun we have live q a after every session we have really the best mobile app for any events so i encourage you to take a look at that which does enable the chat the interaction as well as you know path funding through the many channels we have of content it's it's it's look we're learning and um i'd love to follow up with you later to hear what you've learned because i know you've also been doing a lot virtually i think the world is going to move to something that's more hybrid some combination of virtual and small group you know in person some glocal event of some sort um but this one i'm super excited about we we really have seen high engagement and i just think um well i look forward to hearing everyone's feedback i mean i think one of the things that we've been hearing is is that i can now go to the vm world i can participate now virtually it's it's kind of i would call first generation reminds me of the web early days but you're right i think it's going to open up the eyes to a bigger community access a bigger pool of data a bigger pool of interactions and community and when they do come back face to face people will be able to fly and meet people they met online so we think this is going to be a real trend where it's like the roi of this virtual space is tremendous you can do demos you can just serve yourselves you can consume a demo but then meet people face to face and by the way we have you know a tremendous number of fun activities hopefully you've taken part in some of them everything from puppy therapy to magic shows to yoga to um you know john legend performing so i i i agree i think the level of personalization and ability to self-serve is going to be out of this world so yeah this is the best place for your event just some key things that we can share with the audience cloud city has over 60 solution demos there's a vmworld challenge that's fun there's also an x as the expert section where you got joe betta and ragu and other luminaries there to ask the questions that's the top talent in the company all online and of course and you get the cto innovation keynote with greg lavender so you know you're bringing the big guns out on display uh and it's it's free access it's awesome congratulations we're looking forward to seeing what the data looks like after so what's the story line for you if you had to summarize out the vmworld 2020 this year um what's coming out from the data what are you hearing as the key themes obviously the tagline you know uh you know about possible together digital foundation unpredictable world but what are you hearing uh in the virtual hallways well a few things but i'd say the top takeaway is that vmware has spread its wings has embraced more of the different uh it audiences and is is driving business transformation for companies in new and um pretty unique ways yeah and then obviously like slew of announcements new partnerships new capabilities everything around multi-cloud we have as you know every single cloud provider is a partner on the security front intrinsic security built in throughout the entire stack the the other part that i i think is super exciting are these partnerships we're announcing everything from what we're doing with nvidia to make ai more accessible for enterprises in production to what we're doing around sassy secure access service edge being able to provide a holistic secure distributed environment so that every worker no matter where they are every endpoint every remote office can be fully secured you know in vmware's it's the gold standard of of of the ecosystem and vmworld of course they're all in the showcase and it was hard fought i mean it took a long time to get there and you know the challenges of building that and now you mentioned nvidia you see all these new new tailwinds coming in and and and i've seen companies launch at vmworld and so you know that ecosystem is as i say it's very difficult to build but then becomes a huge asset because this just gives you so much leverage as an organization your companies your partners your customers thank you dave yeah we're super excited and i should say that like the partner in the ecosystem here is unparalleled and our challenge is how do we provide and you know this like how do we provide the strategic vision and that practitioner level content so we're gonna you know that's what we're committed to is making sure that our practitioners get everything they need in every every area of expertise as well as making sure we're conveying our business story carol thanks so much for coming on i really appreciate the insight one final question for you as we get through this crisis soon hybrid comes back and for events certainly but as the cmo the the next gen story you now have a chief customer officer we interviewed him as well vmware's going the next level what's your goals what are you trying to accomplish and you got a lot of things going on certainly a big story to tell a lot of ingredients to to kind of cook a great great story here what's your goals uh cmo for the next year you know my goal is to help drive the business transformation and um you've heard it from submit you've heard it from others at this point but really you know the company is going we are going through a dramatic transformation from being you know a licensed on-prem company to being a multi-cloud modern sas company so my goal is to support that and that means modernizing the way we do marketing which you know you say what does that mean it means customer focus customer life cycle marketing it means agility being able to actually use data to drive how we interact with customers and users so that they have those great experiences and they continue to use the product and drive adoption and growth and the other part of it is um b2b marketing as you may or may not have noticed is incredibly boring and dull and i know i'm guilty of this too we get caught up in a lot of the jargon and the language and i'm on a mission that we are going to do great b2b marketing that helps customers understand what we do and where we express the value simply clearly and in a differentiated way that's awesome yeah why should the consumer guys have all the fun right right well and that's part of being by the way a sas or subscription company is it everything we do needs to be consumer simple at scale and with the secure ability and the reliability of what an enterprise needs well i got to tell you that the irony of all this virtualization of the world with covid virtual events i think one of the big surprises we're going to be looking back at is how much it's opened up to more audiences and new ways of modernizing and taking advantage of that certainly with content and community you guys are well positioned congratulations for a great event thank you for coming on and sharing your insights and we'll keep in touch we'll try to we'll try to make it exciting it's thecube thank you carol appreciate it thank you awesome thank you dave thank you john i'm john furrier with dave vellante cube coverage of vmworld 2020 virtual this is the virtual cube we have now virtual sets everywhere all around the world it's global thanks for watching [Music] you
