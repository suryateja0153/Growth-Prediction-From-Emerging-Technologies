 [Music] hello and welcome to the cube Studios in Palo Alto California for another cube conversation where we go in-depth with thought leaders driving innovation across the tech industry I'm your host Peter Burris every Enterprise is responding to the opportunities of cloud with significant changes in people process how they think about technology how they're going to align technology overall with their business and with their business strategies now those changes are affecting virtually every aspect of business but especially every aspect of technology especially security so what does it mean to envision a world in which significant new classes of services are being provided through cloud mechanisms and modes but you retain an infant in fact even enhance the quality of security that your enterprise can utilize to have that conversation we're joined today by a great guest Amit Sinha is the president and CTO at Z scaler Amit welcome back to the cube Thank You Peter it's a pleasure to be here so before we get into it what's new with descaler well at Z scaler our mission is to make the internet and cloud a secure place for businesses and as I engage with our global 2000 customers and prospects they are going through some of the digital transformation challenges that you just alluded to specifically for security what is happening is that they had a lot of applications that were sitting in a data center or in their headquarters and that center of gravity is now moving to the cloud they've probably adopted office 365 and box and Salesforce and these applications have moved out now in addition their users are everywhere they are accessing those services not just from offices but also from their mobile devices at home so if your users have left the building in your applications are no sitting in your data center that begs that question where should the security stack be you know it cannot be your legacy security appliances that sat in your DMZ and your IT closets so that's the challenge that that we see out there and descaler is helping these large global organizations transform their security and network for a more mobile in a cloud first world and a distributed world so let me make sure I got this right so basically because like I think I totally agree with you but right just to test it that as you were that many regarded the cloud as a centralization strategy today what we're really see happening is we're seeing Enterprise is more distribute their data more distribute their processing but they have not updated how they think about security so the presumption is yeah we're going to put more processing data out closer to the action but we're gonna backhaul a whole bunch of stuff back to our security model and what I hear you saying is no you need to push those security services out to where the data is out to where the process out to where the user is I got that right you have nailed it right think of it this way if I'm a large global 2000 organization I might have thousands of branches all of those branches traditionally have used a hub-and-spoke Network model I might have a branch here in Palo Alto but my headquarters is in New York so now I have an MPLS circuit connecting this branch to New York if my exchange server and applications and s AP systems were all there then that hub-and-spoke model made sense I'm in this office I connect to those applications and all my security stack is also there but fast forward to today all of those applications are moving and they're not just in one cloud you know you might have adopted salesforce.com for CRM you might have adopted workday you might have adopted office 365 so these are SAS services now if I'm sitting here in Palo Alto and if I have to access my email it makes absolutely no sense for me to VPN back to New York only to exit to the internet right there what users want is a fast nimble user experience without security coming in the way what organizations want is no compromise in their security stack so what you really need is a security stack that follows the user wherever they are and the data and the data so my data by you know Microsoft is a front door service here in Redwood City and if you are a user here and trying to access that I should be able to go straight with my entire security stack right next to it Gartner is calling sassy these days well let's get into that in a second but it almost sounds as though what you're suggesting is that the enterprise needs to look at security as a service itself a hundred percent if your users are everywhere and if your applications are in the cloud your security better be delivered as a consistent as a service right next to where the users are and hopefully co-located in the same data centers where the applications are present so the only way to develop to have a pervasive security model is to have it delivered in the cloud which is what descaler has been doing from day one now a little spoiler alert for everybody z scalers been talking about this for 10 plus years right so where are we today in the marketplace starting to recognize and acknowledge this transformation in the basic security architecture and and and platform that we're going through so I'm very excited to see that the market is really adopting what Z scalar has been talking about for over a decade in fact recently Gartner released a paper titled Sassy's it stands for secure access service edge and there are I believe four principal tenants of sassy the first one of course is that compute and security services have to be right at the edge and we talked about that it made it makes sense where the services where they say you can't backhaul traffic to your data center or you can't backhaul traffic to Google's central data center somewhere you need to have compute capabilities with things like SSL interception and all the security services running right at the edge connecting users to applications in the shortest path right so that's sort of principle number one of sass the second principle that Gartner talks about which again you know has been fundamental to Z scalers DNA is to keep your your devices and your branch offices light don't shove too much complexity from a security perspective on the on the user devices and your branches keep it simple or were the people running those user devices absolutely in the brain yeah so you know keep your branch offices like a light router that forwards traffic to to the cloud where the heavy lifting is done the third principle they talk about is you know to deliver modern security you need to have a proxy based architecture and essentially what a proxy architecture allows you to do is is to look at content right gone are the days where you could just say you know stop a website called evil.com and allow a website good complex it's it's not like that anymore you have to look at content you know you might get malware from a Google Drive link you can't block Google now right so looking at SSL encrypted content is needed and firewalls just can't do it you have to have a proxy architecture that can decrypt SSL connections look at content you know provide malware services provide policy based access control services etc and that's you know that's kind of a third principle and finally what Gartner talks about is you know Sasi has to be cloud native it has to be you know sort of born and bred in the cloud a true multi-tenant cloud first architecture you can't take sort of legacy security appliances and shove it in you know third party infrastructure like AWS and GCP and deliver a cloud service in the example I use often is you know just because you had a great blu-ray player or a DVD player in your home theater you can't take a hundred thousand of these and shove it into AWS and become a Netflix you really need to build that service from the ground up you know in a multi-tenant fashion and that's what we've done for security as a service through the cloud so we are now the market seems to be kind of converging on some of the principles that these cars been talking about for quite some time when we think about 2020 how do you anticipate enterprises are going to respond as a consequence of this convergence in acknowledging that the value proposition and the need are starting to come together absolutely and I think the you know we see the momentum picking up in the market we have lots of conversations with CIOs who are going through this digital transformation journey you know transformation is hard you know there's a immune response in big organizations to change not much has changed from a security and network architecture perspective in the last two decades but we're seeing more and more of that in fact over 400 of global 2000 organizations are a hundred percent deployed on Z scalar and so you know that momentum is picking up and and we see a lot of traction with with with other prospects who are beginning to see the light as we say it well as you start to imagine the relationship between security and data one of things that I find interesting in as many respects the cloud especially as it becomes more distributed is becoming better better acknowledged almost as a network of services right as opposed to where AWS as a data center here and that makes it a cloud data center it really is this network of services we're going to happen from a lot of different places big cloud service providers your own enterprise art neurs providing services to you how does the relationship between Z scalar and kind of an openness we're gonna come together so that you can provide services from an for an enterprise to the enterprise's partners customers and others that the enterprise needs to work with it's a great question Peter and and I think one of the most important things I tell our customers and prospects is that if you look at a cloud delivered security architecture it better better embrace some of the Sassi principles one of the first things we did when we built the Z scaler platform was to distribute it across 150 data centers and why did we do that we did that because when a user is going to destinations they need to be able to access any destination the destination could be an azure could be on AWS could be Salesforce so by definition it has to be carrier neutral it has to be cloud neutral I can't build a service that is designed for all Internet traffic in a GCP or AWS right so how did we do that we went and looked at what are the world's best colocation facilities that provide maximum connectivity options in any given region so you know in North America we might be in an Equinix facility and we might use Tier one is P is like GT T and zal that provide excellent connectivity to our customers and the destinations they want to visit when you go to China there's no GCP there right so you know we work with China Unicom and China Telecom when we are in India we might work with an air tail or a city when we are in Australia we might be working with Telstra so we work with you know world-class tier 1 ISPs in best data centers that provide maximum connectivity options we invested heavily in internet exchange connectivity why because once you come to Z scalar you saw the physics problem by building the data center close to you the next thing is you want to quickly go to your application you don't want security to be in the way of application access so with the internet exchange connectivity we have peered in a settlement free way over bgp with Microsoft with Akamai with Apple with Yahoo right so we can quickly get you to the content while delivering the full security stack right so we had to really take no shortcuts you know back to your point of the world is is very diverse and you cannot operate in a walled garden of one provider anymore and if you really build a cloud platform that is that is embracing some of the Sassi principles we talked about you have to do it the hard way by building this one data center at a time well you don't want your you don't want your service to fall down because you didn't put the partnerships in place and harder than em as much as you've hardened some of the other traffic so as we think about kind of where this goes what do you envision Z scalars kind of big customer story is going to be in 2020 and Beyond it's it's obviously it's the service is going to be everywhere change where you think about security but how for example is the relationship between the definition of the edge and the definition of the secure service going to co-evolved are people going to think about the edge differently as they start to think more in terms of a secure edge or where the data resides and the secure data what do you think let's let's start off with five years and and go back way back well five years from now hopefully everyone is on a 5g phone you know with blazing fast internet connections on devices that you love your applications are everywhere so now think of it from an IT perspective you know my span of control is becoming thinner and thinner right my users are on devices that I barely control my network is the internet that I really don't control my applications have moved to the cloud or you know either hosted in third-party infrastructure or run as a SAS application which I really don't control now in this world how do I provide security how do I provide user experience imagine if you are the CIO and your job is to make all of this work where will you start right so those are some of the big problems that we are helping our customers wait so actually questions here's where I was going with the question I would start with if I can't control all these things I'm going to apply my notion of security and say I am going to control that which is within my security boundary not at a perimeter level not at a device level but at a service level absolutely and that's really the crux of the Z scalar platform service are we built this zero trust architecture our goal is to allow users to come to Z scaler and Z scaler becomes the policy engine that is securely connecting them to all the cloud services that they want to go to now in addition we also allow the same users to connect to internal applications that might have required a traditional VPN now think of it this way Peter when you connect to Google today do you VPN to Google's network to access Gmail No why should you have to VPN to access an internal application I mean you get a link on your mobile phone you click on it it didn't work because it required a separate form of network access so it's Z scalar Internet access and Z scalar private access we are delivering a a beautiful service that works across 150 data centers users connect to the service and the service becomes a policy engine that is securely connecting you to the destinations that you want now in addition you asked about what's going to happen in a you know in a couple of years the same service can be extended for partners I'm a business I have you know hundreds of partners who want to connect to me why should I allow legacy VPN access or private circuits that expose me I don't even know who's on the other end of the line right they come onto my network and you hear about you know the target breaches because some HVAC contractor had unrestricted access you hear about you know the air bus breach because another contractor had access so how do we build a true zero trust cloud platform that is securely allowing users whether it's your employees to connect to named applications that they should or your partners that need access to certain applications without putting them on the network or decoupling application access from network access and there's one final important linchpin in this whole thing remember we talked about how powerless organizations feel in this distributed model now imagine you know your job is to also ensure that people are having a good user experience how will you do that right and what Z scalar is trying to do now is we've been very successful in providing the secure and policy-based connectivity and our customers are asking us hey you're sitting in between all of this you know you have visibility into what's happening on the on the user's device clearly you're sitting in the middle in the cloud and you see what's happening on the left-hand side and what is happening on the right-hand side you know you have the cloud effect you can see if there's a problem going on with you know Microsoft's network in the China region right correlate all of that information and give me proactive intelligence around user experience and that's what we launched recently at zenith live we call it Z scalar digital experience so overall the goal of the platform is to securely connect users and entities that to mamed applications with zero trust principles we never want security and user experience to be orthogonal requirements that has traditionally been the case and we want to you know provide great user experience and visibility to to our customers who've started adopting this platform that's a great story it's a great story so once again I want to thank you very much for coming in that's Amit Singh ha who's the president CTO at Z scalar focusing a lot in the R&D types of things as these killers doing thanks again for being on the cube it's my pleasure Peter always enjoy talking to you and thanks for joining us for another cube conversation on Peterborough's see you next time [Music]
