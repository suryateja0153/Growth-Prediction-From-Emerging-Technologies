 The edge is being redefined. Your workforce can access your data in the cloud, from anywhere, on any type of device, within a few taps. And with your workforce, we're not just talking about full-time employees anymore. With the rise of contract workers and third-party outsourcing, there's a constant flow of specialists available for anything you need. And they're often connected to your business through the cloud, for communicating and working through projects. With all these constant connections, the benefits are obvious. But what can go wrong? Apart from that... As perimeters disappear, the way data is stored, accessed and used is evolving. And legacy network and enterprise security measures are becoming as outdated as file cabinets. How do you manage who can, or should, have access to what data, in what setting, from what device? How do you protect your data as the nature of cyber attacks evolves and expands? How do you handle scenarios like employees accessing risky content or shadow IT? And how do you address all these problems without holding your workers back or slowing them down?
