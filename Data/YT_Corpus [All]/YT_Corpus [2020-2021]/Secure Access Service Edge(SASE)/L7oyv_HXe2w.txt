 [Music] hey my name is Ryan Floyd welcome to my youtube channel ask a VC I manage director and founder of storm ventures and we invest in b2b enterprise SAS the whole purpose of this channel is to be able to give you the entrepreneur some advice as if I was on your board or an investor in your company I've had the fortune of being able to work with hundreds of companies over the last twenty years and I'm here to basically try and share some of that learning back back with you look building a business is really tough so I hope this series of videos can just help you just a little bit on your own journey okay so today we're gonna talk about what is SAS and what are subscriptions I've gotten a few comments about the jargon and some of the things that I talk about in the videos and so I want to take this opportunity maybe to just take it up a level and talk about really the basics of what is SAS and subscriptions because I think it's important for anyone that's in technology whether you're investing in private companies you're building a private company or looking at public companies to really understand what is SAS because a lot of people throw that jargon around so here I am I'm gonna try and break it down for you and make it very simple so why why should you care about the software as a service well here--here's why software as a service now that it's delivered via browser makes it so much easier to develop great code the reason is the world we lived in before these awesome fiber optic connections and mobile phones that were the equivalent of computers in your pocket people actually had to install software locally it was what was called the client-server age and time and actually before that we were dealing with mainframes and maybe in another video I'll go back in the history of how computers and software has evolved but from that client-server period people actually had to go and install soft on a local area network and make things work and they were tightly coupled which meant if you are a software developer and you had a new feature that you wanted to introduce you couldn't just simply release it into production and have everyone consume it you actually had to convince the customer to upgrade the software on premise and you had no control over that because the customer actually controlled when they're going to upgrade their servers as a result it made it much more difficult much more difficult to get up grades and what added more complexity to this is often there were other dependencies in that Network too maybe there is a database dependency so your code ran on a server but it had the dependency on a database that had its own upgrade cycle that you couldn't control for when Oracle or someone else was gonna make releases and maybe the network had a dependency when they were gonna upgrade routers or they're gonna change out storage all these things were often outside of your control which just dramatically constrained the ability of software developers to build great code and so that for me one of the amazing things about sass and why it has pushed us so fast so far in terms of software is that it's really enabled developers to get great code in the hands of their customers okay so there's a second thing outside of agile development there's another very important thing about sass that makes it so exciting for us as investors and it should make you excited as an entrepreneur and an investor in tech and that is that sass dramatically increases the market size why do I say that well if you think about it just basically if you have to install software or locally you have to go through all this hassle of doing that there's a limited number of customers that are going to be able to go through that process to to make that work to expend the energy the cost the technical chops to do it now a sass you can deliver it to anyone and what's more is you can charge them over the web you don't have to visit a single customer anymore you don't have to mail them a cd-rom you don't have to go out and visit them you can make it so easy to consume that all of a sudden now so many more organizations can get value out of your product and because it's cheaper to get your product your software to your customer base you don't need to charge as much in order for those customers to use it so as a result the market is just massive for these software companies that it just wasn't simply the case before my favorite example is CRM it used to be that CRM was really only a product which stands for customer relationship management it's the product that Salesforce is well known for it used to be the only really large companies took advantage of CRM but today virtually every single business of virtually any single size uses CRM because you can buy it at any price point that's right for your business so so I would be remiss if I didn't mention some of the costs associated with sass there's no free lunch it's sometimes hard for you to remember because the the Pro is just so dramatically outweigh the cons with sass but let me just mention a few the first one in the big one that most people cite is that if you're running software outside your organization as in the case with sass and it's not running locally you're not in control of that application and more importantly the data anymore you're relying on a third-party provider that's running your software some their software some in the cloud that has your data you're relying on them to be secure and to protect that asset which is yours now when you run it internally in your own enterprise you are in control of your own security and that gave a lot of people the sense that they were more secure I think it's largely proven to be false that companies are more secure when they run internally that there's just as many security breaches internally and I probably argue you're more secure running in a public cloud environment with the right security controls then you are internally but that is a legitimate concern that people have raised in the past so I'd say there's one other big condo SAS and that's network connectivity we take it for granted today that we're connected all the time as we're rolling out now starting rollout of 5g networks we have amazing connectivity with Wi-Fi just about everywhere we go but there are some situations where we don't have connectivity I think like maybe you're on an airplane and you don't want to pay for the low-speed Wi-Fi on a flight well in that case a lot of the applications that you're used to using just simply are not going to work now there's workarounds to this you can use most mail applications work offline and so forth but most SAS applications are not going to work offline and that is a downside for those that don't have connectivity okay so now let's talk about subscriptions we talked about SAS and now let's talk about subscriptions they are not the same thing and a lot of people conflate two two so subscription simply means that you're selling a product and it could be SAS on a subscription basis just like you by the New York Times or you buy a gym membership there's really no different to it and it's a business model so the way I think about it is SAS is a technology right it's an application delivered over the web to you via browser versus enterprise software client server those are all technology delineations versus subscription which is really a business model and the two are different now lots of it is true that a lot of SAS companies also have a subscription model and there's a lot of excitement which I share around SAS subscription businesses but the two are not exactly the same so let me break down now a little bit about subscriptions so most companies that are in SAS will charge either on a monthly or an annual or sometimes they'll sign a multi-year deal for a subscription to their SAS product because remember if you're not installing it on Prem as you did in the old days you basically can consume it on an annual basis or even on a monthly basis and if you decide you don't want it anymore you can terminate your subscription it's really one of the beautiful things about SAS and if you've seen my churn videos you know one of the things that really focus on is delivering value so one of the things with the subscription value a business model is now that you're really focused on delivering value to the customer instead of selling them a bill of goods you're not selling them a used car now and now walking away you're actually having to continue to deliver value day-in day-out month after month year after year in order to get your customers to continue to pay this is why it's called as a service and it's a subscription and it's very important when you get back to the thinking about how do you really build value over time because it's that subscription model it forces the whole organization to really think about building value and as I've said before like in the turn video the important part of that is that now if you're focused around that you're going to be continue to build value of that customer over time okay now there's a lot I'll make one last point there's a lot of different subscription models even within SAS you have kind of the iconic software companies like Salesforce that in a lot of ways really pioneered the whole concept of SAS to come you today like Twilio that really paper use that you could are you are absolutely SAS companies but maybe not really a subscription model because it's paper use but nevertheless a fantastic business you could also take a look at other companies like let's say peloton which is in the process right now going public that calls himself a subscription business and true it is a subscription business much like just your Jemison subscription but you know in a case like peloton 20% or so of their revenues is actually tied a subscription versus the hardware you know at margins that are you know 40 plus percent and so it's a very different business than if you looked at Salesforce that's not to say peloton doesn't have a great business I'm not here to judge judge that and just my point is that it's different than Salesforce or Twilio and so my point is when you look at these software businesses and you think about it for yourself there's no right or wrong answer but the important thing is to really understand what the definitions of these businesses are and to not lump them all together because that's where you'll get into trouble so I hope that was helpful I hope that gave a little bit of clarity to what SAS and subscriptions are and clear up a some of the jargon our I really appreciate you watching my channel ask a VC please subscribe leave me some comments tag someone in the comments that you think this would be relevant for leave me some ideas about what you'd like to hear more about and I look forward to the next one thanks
