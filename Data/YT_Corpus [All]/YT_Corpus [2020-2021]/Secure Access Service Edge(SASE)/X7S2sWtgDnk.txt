 hello and thanks for joining my session on the cloud security threat or opportunity uh spoiler alert as you'll find out in the session it's actually both uh so my name is john roarick i'm a security and compliance specialist at microsoft canada um and we're seeing you know an unprecedented economic uncertainty and shift in the world nowadays um so a lot of organizations have constrained the resources as they as they navigate all the new business challenges and virtually overnight companies have seen they need to accelerate their digital transformation uh so this is going to ensure that you know their their users and workers are able to to uh you know remain productive and be able to respond to their customers expectations and technology and business models overall um have been evolving and the way people work has changed so you know we no longer expect to access you know the myriad of corporate resources and applications that we need to solely from the office or from company owned devices um you know nowadays we're seeing folks that are are you know doing their work on personal devices mobile phones laptops tablets etc um and as a result of this security teams you know they're really um you know kind of stretched in in terms of being able to keep up with all these changes and and certainly you know maybe because of that the costs of data breaches and and regulatory you know mishaps are definitely increasing the first thing i'm going to talk about is uh threats in the cloud so as companies are moving to this new way of working and moving to the cloud what type of threats do they see so along with all the opportunity and increased productivity that the cloud you know brings it's also going to bring a multitude of threats from data breaches to malicious insiders there's a lot of different stuff out there to be concerned about we're also seeing that as as companies are moving to the cloud the the responsibility for security really shifts to this sort of shared model that we're going to talk about a little bit later and i'm going to expand on that and then finally we're seeing an evolution in the attack kill chain so attacks are being orchestrated in the cloud bad guys are using you know these capabilities that are supposed to work for us they're kind of using those against us so you know once an attacker has compromised an environment they try and figure out how they can stay there and escalate privileges by moving laterally across the organization and some examples of the attacks that we see in cloud environments could be things like password spray attacks malicious code being executed from the cloud you know microsoft being a mail provider we're seeing a lot of times attackers will set up exchange forwarding rules to exfiltrate data out of the organization uh internal phishing so you know once they fish one person they're able to compromise credentials they'll try and use that account to you know maybe move up higher and get get uh a manager's credentials or something like that to be able to uh hopefully aim for privilege escalation um exchange onedrive x filtration so you know as as folks are using cloud applications uh and by the way i want to state that you know while i work for microsoft i'm really talking about this as a overall cloud lens so whether you're on microsoft or google or whichever cloud provider you're using you know a lot of these concepts are going to remain the same but what we're seeing is that a lot of folks are using these you know these storage mediums and things like exchange online and onedrive to try and exfiltrate data outside of the organization exchange reconnaissance so you know searching the exchange organization and and uh even attacking the supply chain so you know trying to uh trying to get malicious code onto onto machines before they're even shipped to the customer and then finally malicious oauth apps so you know applications that are going to take uh certain permissions that are users going to grant and then abuse those and abuse those rights and so how does the security challenge change so a lot of a lot of businesses a lot of organizations now are are leveraging these cloud service providers and and really the the way that we secure our environments has has changed a lot since you know the days of of yore um so if you look at sort of what the what the environment looks like now you know we have um it's a lot more difficult to defend against these cyber attacks so how do we think about our assets you know what must we defend again against and this is extremely different from five or ten years ago so i t organizations now finding themselves responsible for protecting a cross or criss-crossing web of technology that they may not own these can include things like uh user-owned mobile devices that are used to access corporate data systems and devices used by your partners and customers to access your information and and there's over seven billion internet connected devices in the world and that's not even including laptops and mobile devices so you have multiple points of vulnerability for your overall estate and this complexity is really creating additional compliance challenges as well you know it's critical that you understand what you have what's sensitive what needs to be kept for how long and that's in addition to securing everything across your heterogeneous environments these advances all change the game when it comes to security you no longer have the luxury of you know drawing a perimeter around your organization and assuming that everything within that is going to be kept safe and so taking together all of the trends that we've outlined they're representing a shared challenge to i.t security um and you know according to forrester they're saying that the future of cyber security is in the cloud and you see this actually from a lot of these analysts uh and a lot of these uh these organizations that are that are talking about cloud security and or even security trends um so you know you look at something like gartner who's uh recently popularized the term sassy the secure access service edge um and and really what they're saying is that you know the days of going and saying okay well what are what are the you know the best things in the mat in the gartner magic quadrant you know putting those and bolting them onto your to your environment and calling it a day um that's that's not as effective as we as we thought it was right so so being able to have sort of an integrated um you know solution that's built in the cloud is really the way that security is going and this is you know this is unlocking a whole new generation of securities so things like zero trust um you know where you're basically treating uh every access attempt as it's coming from a an unsecured network um so this is a world where where people are your new perimeter where the identity is is really the front door that's where we want to protect and your data is hosted in the cloud so you need to remove the you know the implicit uh uh assumption that uh to to uh verification so this means that you know we verify the user's location we verify the role that they play in the organization the health of their device the network they're coming from the classification of the data we do all that before that we even allow them to access you know our data or services so if we look at you know doing risk assessments you know now that we've moved to the cloud there's a lot of big differences there's a lot of new opportunities for security i don't know how many times that i've had uh discussions with security teams at some of our large uh enterprise customers um you know where where i've gotten scoffed at when i've implied that you know moving to the cloud is gonna provide a higher uh higher degree of security than your own data center um i i think there's a lot less scoffing at that now there's a lot of people are starting to to realize that you know cloud solution providers are often in a better uh position in to be able to provide this type of security but we're seeing things like you know the shared responsibility model this is a you know huge uh piece of the security puzzle when we're moving to the cloud um you know uh cloud providers need to be transparent about your data and how they're using it and where they're storing it you know some some instances we may need to have a very specific requirements about where we're storing data what local regulations we have to adhere to uh and and you know we always have to respect the privacy of users and and uh and customers and the data that they that they trust us with whether you know as cloud solutions providers um but you know as i said the the opportunity for better security that is certainly there so being able to protect uh data being able to have uh you know not only cloud-based but cloud-powered security tools is really going to change the game in the way that we the way that we approach security uh with data in the cloud so one important thing to know here is that cloud security is a partnership so regardless of whether the cloud solutions provider is going to be microsoft or google or amazon aws you know regardless of who that is you know cloud services are built on a foundation of trust and security you need to be able to trust your cloud solutions provider you need to be able to work with them and they need to provide you the controls and capabilities to protect your data and applications uh and then of course you know on your end of things you have to own the data and the identities and be responsible for protecting them um so you know working with customers who have had data breaches and said you know how did we how did this happen you know we put our data in the cloud you know supposed to be secure you know you sold us this this uh uh technology and now we're wondering why we're breached and it's well you wonder why you know admin accounts are not having uh not being protected with multi-factor authentication um you know insecure uh you hear all the time about data breaches of insecure uh storage in the cloud things like s3 buckets without any kind of security around them so there is a certain degree of uh configuration on the on the enterprise side on the organization side of you know control that you have to put in place in order to protect your resources and so if we look at security in the cloud enabled world we get this shared responsibility model and i'm sure you've you've heard of this before you know your organization's responsibility for security is really based on the type of cloud service you select so whether you know if you're all on prem then naturally it's it's all going to be you know the the organization's responsibility to secure everything from you know the physical data center to identity and access management to data governance and rights management um as we start to shift to uh you know infrastructure as a service or platform as a service and software as a service and we get new capabilities um you know we're also offloading some of that responsibility to our cloud providers so no longer do we have to worry about the physical data center we don't have to worry about protecting the network or the host you know you may have to worry about things like patching the operating system if you're you know in an is uh uh scenario but more often than not um as you're moving to to these services the cloud solutions provider is going to take care of this um that doesn't mean you're completely off the hook you know things like uh accounts and access management securing identities securing uh your client endpoints and data governance and writing management are always going to remain uh something that the organization needs to protect and so this brings us to the question you know can cloud solution providers really do better at security than your own organization uh and so that you know again to give an example um i i work for microsoft so obviously i'm gonna talk about this from a microsoft lens but this really you know it can often be thought of the same regardless of whether we're talking about microsoft or aws or gcp or or you know whatever cloud platform you're leveraging is that these are massive companies and so if you look at microsoft for example we spend over a billion dollars a year on security research and development every single year that's just on security nothing else and and you know that's that's pretty huge um so when we provide cloud services you know we're providing a commitment to our customers that there's going to be security there's going to be privacy and control we're going to remain compliant with regulatory standards we're going to be transparent about the way we handle your data and we're going to provide a reliability service right so you're going to have a reliable service that you know you you have a service level agreement for and you're going to expect that service to be available and so the way this translate is you know cloud service solutions provider they should be keeping your data secure your data should be private it should be under your control um you know you should expect that your data is going to be managed in accordance with whatever laws are in your region um and you know probably one of the most important ones is you should know what the cloud solution provider is doing with your data how are they using it who has access to it and of course having you know enterprise grade uptime for for these cloud services is also a very important so if we look at microsoft when we look at the way that we provide security for our cloud services you know um this is this is pretty broad and it's a multi-layered sort of defense in depth way of of approaching things you know everything from physical physical security of the data center um you know perimeters and fences and bollards and things like that that are protecting your data center strong authentication having a geographic redundancy um you know you can expect us to take a a you know very very good approach to isolating networks and you know protecting domains and and partitioning those and keeping your data separate from other customers um your content on you know storage is going to be encrypted um you know we have to have disaster recovery capabilities and in many cases it's going to be a geo redundancy um application you know when we're developing applications that that you're using to get your work done and to do your business um you know we follow a secure development lifecycle we have a the microsoft security research center we have bug bounty programs to um you know allow researchers to try and find vulnerabilities in our software and then we're going to pay them a bunch of money to disclose those to us so we can get them patched um in access you know we're talking about access so even microsoft you know as much as we give our customers the ability to provide multi-factor authentication um we also do that internally at microsoft just in time access and customer locks blocks so this is really about you know if you ever do need support from your cloud solution provider they shouldn't have standing access to your data right so if they ever need to do some work in your cloud instance you should expect that that's going to be you know just in time access to whatever data they need it should go through some form of approval process and in some cases that's going to be an approval process that you as the organization is going to have a say and control over looking at the physical or sorry the operational security of our data centers right so you can expect a high degree of physical security with 24-hour monitoring and multi-factor authentication you know there's going to be administrative background checks um as i mentioned zero standing access to data you know your data is always going to want to be encrypted and it's important to run testing too right so red red team blue team exercises penetration testing adherence to regulatory standards is often going to include that those types of exercises but it's important to have them included in the protection of your data product development is going to be using that security development life cycle and as i mentioned the bug bounty programs which are which are hugely important um and so so microsoft data centers are pretty interesting so just to get access you know even to the building or the structure you know in my role at microsoft i don't even know the actual location of my local local data center um i know the city i know that being in canada we have data centers in toronto and quebec city but if you ask me to point them on a map uh i'm probably gonna point to the to the wrong object because i don't actually know the location of those and so if i do for whatever reason need to travel to a data center um not only do i you know have to have a background check just to work for microsoft but i would have another background check to be able to have access to said data center and you know we do system checks and things like that if i needed to bring any kind of system into that building the physical perimeter of that building is going to have you know things like fences bollards front entrance gates you know a single defined access points naturally we're going to have cctv video coverage there's likely going to be ongoing roaming security patrols and then once you get into the building there's also additional authentication that's needed so i would have to provide two-factor authentication there'd be biometrics there's not going to be any kind of building signage you won't see something that says microsoft data center you know naturally within that building there's going to be on ongoing roaming patrols uh cctv video coverage and we're going to verify you know single person entry through things like man traps and turn styles so and of course we have 24x7 security operations um most people you know can't even uh you know if you do get into a microsoft data center that chances are that's as far as you're going to be able to get is just within the building if we're talking about the folks that actually need to have physical access to the server environment you can see that the the uh level of protection and level of security there uh is even stronger right so we you know we we very closely vet uh employees and contractors that need to to go there you know you're not able to identify locations of customer data um you know if we need to dispose of hardware and things like that you know we're shredding hard drives things like that you know there's going to be ongoing uh security patrols and and video uh coverage of the entire uh of the entire place so um you know a lot of this is really to adhere to um you know not only to give our customers the assurance that they're going to have you know that their data is going to be in a secure facility but in many instances it's to adhere to uh compliance regulations and so if you look at a lot of these cloud solutions providers you know well your data center you might have to adhere to something like uh canada privacy laws or or you know maybe if you're in health care you have the you know the the healthcare industry uh compliance certification that you'd have to adhere to and if you look at the way microsoft does business we actually have all of these uh compliance certifications so um you know if you want to find out is there uh you know an audit report for iso 27001 um that's available to you you can download that you can read through the audits that are happening on an annual basis for any of these um compliance certifications that microsoft receives um and you know likely the same thing is going to be the case for other cloud solutions providers as well i'm sure google and aws and all the various cloud solution providers are going to have their own you know compliance certifications and audits and reports that you can that you can read on and another big thing about the way that cloud solution providers provide security is they often have telemetry and signals that they can leverage you know to be able to build their security services and this is probably one of the biggest parts um at least from microsoft's perspective um that differentiates us in the in the security space is you know when we're creating security solutions we're not just you know coding them and uh releasing them and customers buy them and use them there's a lot more that goes in uh on the back end of this so we're actually you know building these solutions to leverage just trillions of signals of telemetry behind the scenes so if you think about what microsoft does on a daily basis and you know you can also think what your cloud cloud solution provider might do on a daily basis in terms of their other services you know we're indexing web pages we're scanning emails for malware we're scanning uh windows devices and updating windows devices um we're dealing with billions of monthly authentication to consumer accounts and enterprise accounts you know we have our own digital crimes unit that's actually shutting down botnets and you know stopping child exploitation online and things like that we also partner with a lot of different organizations security organizations as part of the microsoft intelligence security alliance different researchers and law enforcement organizations across the globe and we're sharing threat data across those organizations and building that into everything that we do and if you think about you know organizations that are that are leveraging uh our services you know 90 of fortune 500 um you can imagine just the sheer wealth of data that uh an organization or cloud solutions provider like microsoft is is is having uh to be able to analyze and build in that threat intelligence and signal within to our security products and so when you move to for example the microsoft cloud and again you know i can't say for certain what uh what some of the other cloud solutions providers are out there doing but i would hazard to guess that a lot of them have um you know similar types of solutions that are going to be able to secure your cloud environments on top of your basic uh controls of you know things like patching your operating systems and um you know ensuring uh you have the the correct rights assigned to the right people um so you know identity and access management is a huge one you know if we look at the identity being um sort of the the uh control plane and uh you know the front door to to accessing services and data um you know having things like single sign-on is hugely important um being able to evaluate each authentication when it happens to achieve some some level of zero trust um providing multi-factor authentication for those uh those access attempts and authentication attempts and then looking at the device and when we look at the device we get into things like threat protection so being able to have an endpoint detection response platform or we're analyzing those threats and you can you know providing uh forensic tools to to see uh you know what may have happened on on uh various endpoints across your organization uh forensic tools you know if we provide an email service or you know as as microsoft does having uh capabilities to stop phishing um and stop uh you know malware or you know nefarious or malicious links or attachments from being able to be sent to your users having a cloud-based seam or or source for your security you know incident event management orchestration protecting you against denial of service attacks um application control you know one of the big ones as we move to the cloud is cloud access security brokers this is a huge uh market now that that organizations are as they're adopting these services you want to make sure that uh you know we're providing uh you know some some insight discovery into what applications your users are using um you know what kind of data they're putting up there um and being able to uh you know sanction and unsanction uh certain applications that might be across the environment stop people from from accessing applications that can put your data at risk um and then finally you know when we deal with the data as we think about that uh you know the shared responsibility model providing you with the tools to be able to look at the data that you have uh figure out you know which type of data might be sensitive um does it need to be classified and protected can you can apply a label to that that says confidential are we going to apply policy to that that prevents it from being you know maybe uploaded to a consumer cloud service or or printed from the device or or shared to a usb or put in a cloud service that we haven't sanctioned or being sent to a user who's maybe not authorized to to view that information so providing you with all the tools to uh you know label and protect and classify and encrypt all of that sensitive data is a huge uh piece of the security management uh platform that that you're gonna need to have access to and then finally defense in depth right so um you know being able to put a security on the client endpoints you know endpoint protection antivirus whatever you have there um you know that's going to be that's going to be important but we need to go further than that and so when we have defense in depth that's really the concept of you know applying security controls at multiple layers within the stack right so if our adversaries are trying to um you know access your data and you know now that the the way that uh uh the infrastructure has changed where we're using cloud services we might not be uh signing in from uh you know from uh a computer on the corporate network or inside the data center or or sorry inside the corporate office especially now um you know we need to look at defending multiple different layers so you know we have our servers that are going to you know maybe manage our active directory or what other services in the organization we need to make sure that they're protected um we have to do you know some level of uh privileged identity management um you know maybe we're going to have a mobile mobile device management tool on the server as well um penetration testing and endpoint security are hugely important as well for server security and then we get to the network level so you know having a proper firewall in place having an email gateway that's going to check for you know malicious emails that are coming in naturally having you know intrusion detection intrusion prevention systems are going to be important being able to analyze malware being able to look at uh you know hunt for maybe we're gonna hunt for um you know things like advanced persistent threats that are in the organizations or potential um you know exploitation of zero-day attacks and things like that um so being able to have the capability to hunt for these types of vulnerabilities is also very important and then finally when we're dealing with that data you know whether we're sending that data to the cloud or we're storing it on a server somewhere you know we need to ensure that we have a level of data loss prevention in place access control is going to be important we need to you know ensure that there's encryption uh and really that the uh you know only the the users that are meant to access certain data uh are gonna have access to that data um and then outside of that you know it's it's important to test your defenses so being able to do red team blue team exercises penetration testing things like that um you know we we need to ensure that if we're partnering with other organizations and we're collaborating with those organizations can we ensure the level of security when they're authenticating you know do we have to provide mfa for our partners and things like that providing single sign-on for cloud applications and again analyzing uh each authentication request uh to ensure that it's coming from from who it says it is and then you know one of the biggest things is multi-factor authentication are we going to provide that uh additional layer of authentication um as users are trying to access any of these applications and services and quite often that's gonna you know that's gonna thwart a lot of attacks we're seeing that most of the um attacks if you look at the verizon data breach investigation report that comes out every year uh you'll see that most of those attacks are really based on identity so whether it's for fishing for credentials and stealing them um or or however credentials are being stolen uh it all starts with with credentials right so um credentials that are either insecure um or being compromised and that's really how our adversaries are are attacking most of the time and so if we just do something simple like implement multi-factor authentication um you know we're going to thwart the good majority 99.9 of those attacks uh and so that's important and so you know in summary uh i i you know i do want to say that well moving to the cloud you know might seem uh scary it might seem something like uh that's going to open up you know to all kinds of different new threats and pose a huge risk to your organization you know more often than not your cloud solution provider is going to provide you with the tools um to be able to do security better to be able to provide a higher degree of security uh than you ever may have been able to before um and so you know as you as you're doing this digital transformation you're moving to the cloud your users are coming and they're working remotely and um you know you're able to accomplish so much more outside outside of your normal office it's important to make sure that that you know a your your cloud solution provider is providing you a high degree of security and that the tools available to you that are often cloud-based and cloud-powered are implemented effectively in order to provide that degree of security so thank you very much for joining me today um feel free to connect with me on linkedin if you have other questions uh and also feel free to swing by the microsoft virtual booth and we'll have experts there that can talk about things like identity and access management and compliance and other things so thank you very much and enjoy the rest of gosek you
