 from around the globe it's thecube with digital coverage of vmworld 2020 brought to you by vmware and its ecosystem partners hello everyone welcome back to thecube's virtual coverage of vmworld 2020 virtual it's thecube virtual not there in person this year because of covet i'm john furrier your host of the cube we've also got dave vellante stu miniman all the cube folks covering of course with vmware and vmworld 2020 we've got two great guests here to talk about the future of the workforce solutions and the impact of network security and partnerships tom gill a senior vice president and general manager of networking and the security business unit at vmware and panetta minocho who's the evp of business development and corporate development at zscaler two great companies uh all doing extremely well as customers are dealing with covid and the realities of this market and putting plans in place for coming out with a growth strategy gentlemen thank you for joining me today yeah john thanks for having us thanks for having us john tom i want to start with you obviously the partnership with zscaler is the discussion of this topic but you guys do have some hard news around the future of workforce solutions uh what's the hard news and how does that relate to all this yeah we sure do john so um you know networks were built in a very different time networks were built when work was a place that you came now work is a thing that you do oftentimes you do from your living room or your den as i am and so it really calls into question some of the fundamental principles of how we build and deploy networks in the old model we would set up something like a branch office and we would backhaul traffic using a dedicated circuit like an mpls circuit back haul it to one of a handful of locations that we call the dmz or email and those are locations where you would stitch together a security ensemble made out of dedicated hardware appliances firewalls web proxies ips systems and the like and that model served us well as an industry for many decades three i'd say 30 years all of a sudden the whole notion of the workspace has changed and changed dramatically we're all living through that and experiencing it firsthand and so the original model of backhauling traffic to some point in you know persipine new jersey so that you can run it through some magic black box that model doesn't apply anymore and so at vmware we have a new vision for how we can take the security the reliability the performance that you get when you're on the corporate network and extend it into people's homes and this is in line with what industries are calling sassy or secure access services edge and so the news that we're announcing is we have a complete sassy solution that involves zero trust access it involves firewall ids ips capability advanced security services and then importantly a very strong partnership with zscaler and we can walk through how that works but it's really driven by this new shape of the workplace put it talk about the the partnership with vmware we've been following zscaler for a long time what a great success story great technology team great business model growth in your marketplace congratulations on all your success as you guys continue to grow the world has spun in this disruption kind of world we're in now you guys are well poised for that talk about your partnership with vmware here great uh thanks john and thank you tom for that uh with a quick overview you know just to play out this idea we started over over a decade ago the basic idea was you know the users are pretty much everywhere and the applications are moving to the cloud and so back to tom's uh comment you know we had these networks where you were backhauling maybe i'll just give a very simple analogy the cio of nestle you know when he first deployed z scaler you know and and realized a tremendous amount of cost savings better security but then more importantly the employees of nestle actually started blogging that the internet had gotten faster and when the cio came to a customer advisory board meeting he made a very simple analogy imagine having to get out to the internet through four major international airports worldwide all right so you couldn't directly traverse from point a to point b but you had to transit through these four it would be very inefficient uh it would really slow you down and more often than not you'll be complaining that was the old network architecture and what we have chosen to do here from a security standpoint at zscaler is make that security closer to the end user now we pride ourselves from a security standpoint and we certainly need networking to also adapt to that and that's where we have found our partnership with vmware to be particularly uh strategic we started partnering with vmware actually prior to them acquiring vettel cloud which is the software defined when a networking provider just primarily because they were a cloud-based networking player and this idea of locally breaking out to the internet getting out to the end destination as quickly as possible is something that they did quite seamlessly and so we we started this journey this partnership with them a few years ago and today at vmworld we are enhancing that expanding the partnership not only from a product standpoint but then more importantly we are leaning in from a sales go to market customer support standpoint yeah that's a great point i've been saying this on thecube for a while with the joke was the wan is the new land i mean we used to have the old days remember oh campus connecting networks drive to the airport as you mentioned a great analogy there by the way it has to be better people are working at home you got technically a land unsecured at home you know working at home people are realizing this these core services have to change it's not just connect to the internet the old way it's everywhere it's networking everywhere this is the reality of the kinds of intranet things that used to go on where it was kind of cool and secure you know you got a perimeter everything was working great but you mentioned it why drive to the airport to four airports for the world that's a great analogy tom this points to the future ready concept access anywhere services that are needed for the security and more importantly the user experience i don't want to slow down to go faster i want to i want to i want to make it i want to make a good experience happen that's a thought yeah yeah well i mean i think we're all living through this new world where we're working from home and sometimes the user experience is less than perfect in fact in this broadcast you may see stuttering and breakup of the video and um you know that's that's a problem that i think needs to be solved and it's a problem that we're able to solve with virtualization so the idea behind virtualization by putting a layer of software on top of a physical asset you can make it easier to manage that asset you can make that asset more efficient we certainly did that with servers it was really obvious now we're doing it to the network itself so what this means is we have some customers um we have one customer that is in the healthcare industry like during the height of the crisis all of their doctors and researchers had to work from home and yet they needed to use video communication tools like we're doing here and they needed a consistently good end user experience and so we were able to ship these customers more than 8 000 boxes over the course of two weeks into people's homes so think of a little tiny device about the size of a set-top box it shows up in your house and all of a sudden your zoom or your web accessions just work no more stuttering no more breaking up because we're able to manage the network and virtualize prioritize traffic and deliver a consistently good end user experience so managing the quality of service is a foundational capability and we have unique ways to do that with virtualization that i think never existed before the second step is i want to make sure not only that it's a good user experience but my security all of those controls that used to live in black boxes that those are applied this is where our partnership with descaler is so important so z-scaler has the same philosophy that we do of like let's put this stuff in many points of presence around the world i think you know you're in like 100 or so points of presence so we weren't 150. and so whatever an end user is you just find that nearest point of presence connect and make the shortest route possible to deliver good quality end user experience and also consistent world-class security it's imagine what the future network is going to look like it's interesting first of all we'll sign up for the cube virtual we need that video latency it challenges but we're you know but we shouldn't have to be video engineers to manage the packets on the round trip the software i mean you know webex zoom they build their entire application to manage these kinds of intellectual property challenges so that brings up the complexity of applications so you know people are going to have all these new complexities and how do you integrate it all yeah you know obviously zoom and web access companies are you know this is core to what they do the challenge is you got to control both ends of the wire and and so so with with our network virtualization we actually control the wire itself right we can make the wire behave in a way we can prioritize traffic so that your zoom goes ahead of xbox live or netflix you do things like traffic shaping which are are techniques that are actually well understood but difficult to deploy in a physical world in a virtual world to deploy these techniques constantly adapting and changing to make sure that end user experience is smooth and easy and that's really pretty impactful what's your reaction all this because you know if i'm a customer you know you know i'm like what's in it for me guys the integration with zscaler vmware uh what's in it for me because i got now multi-clouds in the horizon i'm dealing with multiple clouds today i got complexity in applications themselves and i want to create the nirvana that you laid out which is access anywhere high speed so i might not have the expertise in house what do i do what's in it for me take me through the value proposition absolutely so you know tom touched on it you know the idea of bringing security as close to the end user as possible if you step back for a minute and you start to think about security usually security and user experience are uh are contradictory usually if you add more security you lose use of experience and vice versa that's sort of what z-scale has sought to go solve and so you know over a decade ago you know when we started to build the architecture it was built with a few core principles in mind right the idea of being completely distributed today we are in over 200 uh points of presence worldwide and that gives us a pretty good footprint to be as close to the end user we absolutely could not uh compromise on security so this idea that if you have a finite appliance maybe the appliance has a you know a limited amount of uh cpu or horsepower and so i will tweak the security uh so that i can get more performance not the case with how we went about uh you know offering security all security services run all the time right so without any compromise to the end user and then finally you know when it comes to the actual security itself our architecture is based on something called a proxy and usually again if you start to think about a proxy in security words people don't think in a very favorable manner they usually think it slows things down it adds latency it breaks applications and again i go back to you know the foundational elements of z-scaler when we started this journey it was with this idea that we're going to build this proxy from the ground up very high performance microsecond-like latency something that you would not see in the market anywhere with this partnership now right seamless integration between vmware and z-scaler you are now able to set up these tunnels instantly automatically so go back to tom's example 8 000 set-top boxes like devices said sent out to this healthcare institution right you can automatically set up tunnels such that the the traffic is pointing to zscaler there's failover capabilities so any and all of that has been instrumented in in software the end customer sets that up you know can automate that templates all across those 8000 devices you now have security at the same time with user experience faster way to go adapt to business needs agility you know being able to keep up and lower your costs because you're substantially reducing the mpls footprint so there's a whole bunch of disparate uh you know advantages that an enterprise gets but the biggest one of amongst them in my mind is just being able to address the business needs i mean how many cios today with covet are starting to realize my network is not adapting to this new normal right and so that's where this partnership between vmware and z scalar comes in it's very timely everyone's like they want more about their network and that's like you know everyone's banging on the table great great point there thanks for taking that great explanation i want to just follow up with you if you if you don't mind compare that what you just said in terms of the value of z scalar with this partnership versus the old way because you what you just laid out was you know dynamic provisioning setting up connections having software automate things compare what it was like before because remember i mean people who have been around the industry know the pain in the butt that it's been and human error compare what what the old way was like and now with this experience can you just just absolutely i'll let tom talk about you know things on the network side you know where you might have had a a a large behemoth like a cisco box where you try to tweak some policy and the entire box would fall over or something along those lines from a security standpoint usually when you had a a box you know you know folks would call it a youtube inbox a god box with you know as much security as you could push into a finite amount of appliance a unified threat management function usually what would end up happening the old way was you know you would you would you would have some basic security capabilities maybe it was uh it's that traditional dmz that tom uh uh alluded to you know there's a firewall there's an ips there's some web proxy capabilities and and that's that was the that was the journey that a customer had you know so they would replicate this box in all those various locations or in the case of nestle before z-scaler they had those dmz's in four locations around the world right and the moment security security keeps changing right the threat landscape keeps adopting i mean today within the z scalar cloud we provide over 125 000 updates every day right that's how dynamic security is and so because the threat keeps changing usually one of the things that vendors would try and do is add more security to that existing appliance right so you're trying to make sure that a customer bought an appliance and they need to make sure that they recoup the full investment uh let's add a little more security to it let's add a little more security to it so that i can keep up with the latest threats well the problem with that is when you have a finite amount of horsepower within an appliance the performance starts to drop and so usually that was the trade-off that enterprises were making with the security now being in the cloud right and this idea that you in a way you sort of have infinite compute uh you are now decoupling security from those uh those branch devices that tom just alluded to i mean that 8 000 boxes right one of the key points of a sassy framework that tom alluded to is a very lightweight branch and that's the piece that's the north star that i think both vmware and z-scale have had right that that low-end and not not low-end but a very thin branch and let the heavy lifting whether it's on the qos side from a networking standpoint whether it's security um you know as it relates to z-scale let that heavy lifting be done in the cloud yeah and of course there's a lot a lot of moving parts so it's it might be lower and lightweight but it's more functionality that's what the cloud does i get that point and by the way anyone in the dmz knows that as you add more stuff in there get more you know cooks in the kitchen nothing good comes from that um tom i want to get your thoughts for your audience out there and your customers and your prospects what does the z-scale partnership mean for them well like i said it's a it's an opportunity to think differently about how we build and deploy enterprise networks this is a dramatic change um most of us have been familiar with the old model where you had a spoon it was referring to those big heavy boxes the vpn concentrators and at the same time most of us have been employees of those companies and we've had the you know sort of less than stellar experience of turning the vpn on and all of a sudden the internet goes slow and that's that's not what we want to achieve and so so having the ability to use a distributed architecture it's being forced upon us you everyone is distributed whether they like they like it or not right and so having a distributed architecture where i can put security and quality of service network controls closer to the end user is really really critical and and i think just as as punit was saying they started um with this idea of pushing security close to the end user we started with velocloud with the idea of virtualizing the network in lots of uh physical places so retail locations so you've got thousands of stores around the world you need to deliver video and audio services into those stores with a very high quality so we were designed to have a very light uh entry point and a light entry point can just be pure software it can be a small box um the advantage of a small box is it's so turnkey it's designed that a totally unskilled operator can use this retail people right a store manager um gets a little box in the mail you plug it in you know snap two ethernet cables into it and it just works and again now put it referred to this this is part of our value proposition is you plug this thing in as an end user all you know is the internet just got faster you don't know you don't have to configure proxy settings what's my ip range like that so many of us are feeling it now when you have you know sub-optimal network connections so being able to deliver a a quality end-user experience you know kovit has accelerated a lot of a lot of opportunities also exposes the scabs and and you know things that can laying around and some sub-optimal projects i mean and everyone's going to be doubling down on things that are working and probably you know putting on the back burner or killing projects that don't make sense so um this is a great opportunity and i think forces things right into you guys wheel houses so i appreciate you taking the time the last minute that we have left tom and pony if you don't mind i'd love to get your thoughts real quick on what's next after cloud obviously cloud brings up all these benefits you're talking about um what do you guys see as what's next after cloud tom we'll start with you i i think that the you know the range of services that will deliver in this format is not at all limited to traditional dmz services so think api gateways uh think about core infrastructure offerings like dns pretty much everything that we used in the network can actually now be delivered as a service in software more efficiently than standing up boxes and racking stacking yourselves and so our view is that that covet has killed the appliance once and for all and that's broadly that's not just at the at the edge that's in the core of the data center things like load balancers they're all moving to software we scale out scale out infrastructure software running on x86 and uh and so i think that a change of that magnitude will still take a while to roll out but uh it's happening covid kill deployment that's the headline right there i love that pune after cloud what's next well you know i'd say this job very similar to what uh tom just mentioned i think we're in the early innings you know when we would talk to our customers about transforming the network and adapting to this new normal you know we had some early adopters but there was still a fair number of people that were skeptical and that loved their appliances covert has changed a lot of that and so we have seen a general acceleration of the business the market is moving uh in our direction and we feel that with this partnership you have two market leaders coming together right vmware on the networking side on the cloud networking side on the data center z-scaler as it relates to cloud security user-based security this idea that we are a zero trust exchange that allows users to connect to applications to the internet in a safe manner and at scale that's the beauty of you know this this uh this uh partnership that we have brought together and we are hopeful that customers will embrace it with confidence and i'm mindful that we're in the early innings great points gentlemen awesome stuff great insights and i think the cloud native integration shows that people in the ecosystem is evolving to be cloud native to have these kinds of integrations these value points physical virtualization tom great point i mean we're not in face to face but we're here virtually um the cube is going to be virtual it's software defined operations uh the world has changed and i think everyone is now seeing it thanks for this insight and congratulations tom on the news putin thank congratulations on the partnership with vmware uh sounds like it's great for customers looking forward to digging in thanks for your time appreciate it okay that's thecube coverage here we're in palo alto california we're in the bay area but this is vmworld virtual we're not in person but we're virtual i'm john furrier your host for coverage of vmworld 2020. thanks for watching you
