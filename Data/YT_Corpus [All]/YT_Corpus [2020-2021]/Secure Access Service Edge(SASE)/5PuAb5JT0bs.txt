 from around the globe it's thecube with digital coverage of vmworld 2020 brought to you by vmware and its ecosystem partners welcome back i'm stu miniman and this is thecube's coverage of vmworld 2020 hard to believe our 11th year covering the event of course the first year it is a global virtual event so happy to welcome to the program we're going to be talking about uh some of the multi-cloud networking so first from equinix i have bill long he's the senior vice president of product management and joining him the founder of velo cloud sanjay upal he's the senior vice president general manager of course fellow cloud now part of vmware bill and sanjay thanks thank you so much for joining us happy to be here all right so bill we had sanjay on the program last year it hard to believe you know sanjay and i were talking it's been over two years since the the acquisition of velocloud of course sd-wan uh has been real growth uh equinix has gone through you know some changes you have an acquisition i want to talk about a little bit later but since we're at vmworld bill want to start with that partnership of course ever i think most people know equinix you've got data centers around the globe you've got direct connects into the big public clouds and obviously a long partnership with vmware so bring us up to date yeah so obviously with our data centers there's tons of virtual machines running running in our data centers today but um as we you know it equinix is a bit special because our specialty is is the place where networks connect to each other um so as people are moving more to a distributed hybrid multi-cloud type of architecture especially even with the work from home with kovid um they wanted to be able to get their infrastructure deployed out further closer to their users i mean previously to do that they had to actually physically deploy hardware um so the exciting sort of evolution the partnership with vmware is what we're doing with velocloud where you can actually deploy uh the sd-wan infrastructure um on a on a virtualized basis spin up um spin up the the velocloud infrastructure and have your sd-wan solution without actually having to ship physical equipment um so what it's doing for our customers it's allowing them to to really move to that distributed hybrid multi-cloud architecture um with without a lot of the the requirements that were previous previously there for shipping and appliance installing the appliance wiring it up um so we've sort of pre-deployed all of that and made the buying experience much more fluid which was super fortuitous timing given sort of the environment that we're all in today where you can't just hop on a plane and and and put it you know ship a ship and appliance somewhere and install it so it's a it's a it's a long-term relationship and we're super thrilled to have them on the network edge platform today so it can be enabled virtually not just physically yeah so sanjay uh you know i want to follow up on what bill was just talking about there of course being acquired by vmware being a software solution makes a lot of sense and that vision that we've had for for sdn for nfv was i want to get rid of the physical appliances we want to make it much easier uh to be able to deliver those services so you know love to hear a little bit especially here in 2020 uh the the architecture of your service just makes it easy to deploy easy to help customers do what they need to do yes you and uh and bill and it's all about the simplicity and automation this whole thing about software defined wan or sd-wan came about because customers found it really difficult to have stacks of these physical appliances that they had to deploy at every endpoint in their network and then in a hub and spoke model where the hubs were there to deploy another set of appliances so the software defined part of this right from the get go for velocloud now at vmware was to make this really be simple and automated and how do you get simplicity and automation well you take most of the complexity out and the way that we took the complexity out was to collapse all of that hardware at the end point and make it one very simple easy to deploy appliance and then the other end which is the one that bill was just talking about for the co-located entities where we had our software defined when gateways you know there was physical infrastructure that was required and equinix has been a partner right from 2013 to get those gateways deployed at the st points of presence the great thing now and you've heard the announcements at vmworld the great thing now is that you don't have to deploy all that hardware at the hub endpoints all you do is use equinix's network edge you get our sd-wan gateways deploy them as software and now you can also scale it out and get your sassy or secure access service edge deployed in exactly the same way bill there's often just discussion of hybrid and multi-cloud and sometimes it's a little hard to wrap our brains around what customers are doing i know when i tour a data center like one of yours it really you know you can understand what's happening but what i'm curious about is you know in some of your data centers connecting between clouds could just be i'm connecting a cable over a couple of rows or i've got an interconnect to aws to azure or the like does sd-wan fit into those environments where uh we're connecting close is you know where where does and you know maybe there's some areas that sd-wan doesn't fit in because we know sd-wan has been really that interconnected fabric helping customers do their multi-cloud i'm just curious in your world uh kind of kind of the parameters yeah i think as sanji did a great job of describing the hub and spoke where you have the hub that might be like a branch office location where you want to bring that traffic into the to the uh the spoke would be the end officer and the hub you want to bring that hub in and then that traffic might want to go out to a cloud as you were talking about in that the use case you just described but what's important is you want that hub to be the place where the most isps internet service providers are such that you're aggregating that traffic efficiently locally and then you want to make sure you're getting that traffic over to a cloud as efficiently as possible so luckily equinix you know locations what's so special about those is not just it's not just a data center it's who's in the data centers um that are with you so in the locations where we have the velo cloud gateway and and the network edge solution they're all located together so you have it's a local place where the isp networks terminate so you can originate that traffic from a home office worker or any kind of branch office location you can then get it into the to the velocloud edge instance and then out to the cloud and most of the time those cloud edge nodes are actually actually physically in an equinix data center so if you're looking for a solution has has the least amount of hops can have the least amount of of latency highest performance fewest amounts of points of failure it's really a very efficient architecture to be there and of course um with with less sort of networks to traverse it's also uh pretty cost effective as well yeah absolutely you know as as bill pointed out uh sd-wan you know really solves two problems so it is it used to start off as a branch office solution but it's the the name doesn't convert anything that is specific only to branch offices when you get to multi-cloud and you have in information that needs to go let's say from one of the public cloud providers amazon to another one azure equinix is a perfect location to do that because both those cloud providers and others meet at equinix and then also the network providers meet at equinix now we are the software layer that directs the traffic and that steers it between cloud providers from branches to cloud providers from remote users to cloud providers and that equinix is the perfect meeting point we are that sd-wan software layer that's kind of like the traffic cop that steers the traffic around wonderful well bill uh chande was talking earlier about uh the secure access service edge uh sassy i i keep having to go through my head it's not a self-addressed stamped envelope anymore um but uh bill help us understand you know what equinix uh you know how welcome x helps uh deliver this uh environment uh we know you've got a great footprint uh and not only the cloud partnerships but uh really locations that help us get to the you know the customer's edge yeah you know it's very similar to what we were talking about earlier if you're looking for an efficient way to basically originate traffic closest to the user such as the highest performance being you know the fact that we're in in over 200 data centers spread out around the world means that we can be local to where the actual traffic wants to be so and we're connected to all the isps that are local so you bring that traffic in and then you can provide a security perimeter around that today like what the edge instance and what the velocloud solution has but then also when you want to connect that out to the rest of your infrastructure whether that's one of the you know 10 000 enterprise customers that happens to live within equinix today or if you need to connect to your mpls provider that's all there as well so it really acts as that hub for bringing in to be able to efficiently originate that that traffic um into one of these sassy platforms and then and then you know do the types of things that sanjay was talking about with the software layer on top to be able to secure it and really up do you know do special routing with the traffic such that it has the highest performance and is more secure so making sure that it's distributed efficient you know aggregation of local traffic but then also having the option to be able to connect out to whoever you want to connect out um some of the some of the ways that that we've seen that evolve um you know sanjo talk about the it works not only for branch offices but from work from home users as well um the fact that people were local in our data center and as traffic we saw earlier this year as much as a 40 increase in some locations in traffic in order to scale that it was a matter of just setting up a couple cross connects um instead of having to all you know to procure you know multiple 100 gig circuits from a network service provider so having all of those pieces co-resident in a single location really helps unlock the potential of the sassy architecture sanjay what one of the items that caught everybody's attention in the keynote is is project monterey you know we went uh the the cloud native with uh project pacific last year now really going deep with monterey for for ai and edge um there's some similarities between the branch technology that you said we started with with velocloud um does sd-wan fit into this monterey discussion when we talk about edge and then bill i i expect this is somewhere where packet fits in so definitely want to hear your commentary on it too yeah absolutely i think the bigger picture here is traffic comes from all these locations so whether it is remote users branch office users campus users it those are the entry points into the network then they come and they meet at the meeting point the one of the best meeting points is equinix and then at that meeting point you can analyze the traffic obviously you want to keep privacy and security in mind you can add additional security services as you go which is the whole idea behind sassy if you're going to aggregate this traffic and bring it to those meeting points the meeting points are the perfect places to add the additional security whether it is web-based security or it is firewall security you add that there and then the traffic goes on to its final destination as bill was talking about and that final destination may be a cloud provider it may be through another carrier you know an mpls provider or it may be just back to the enterprises data center now the whole idea here is as you collect the traffic you can also analyze parts of it again keeping privacy in mind and this is where ai comes in because you can have specific algorithms go in and figure out when something goes wrong in the network how to recognize that and how to self heal so self-healing is one of those areas that we are working on but the infrastructure that we are putting in place between equinix and us is a necessary building block to be able to get to that self-healing uh you know end state that we're all looking forward to great bill on the edge piece am i right that this is something that packet's going to help with absolutely so i mentioned earlier where the the model forever the value of equinix has been that sanjay was highlighting you know the ability to connect to the ecosystems you want to care about but but as i mentioned it it previously required you know even if you want to have vms you still have physical servers that those vms had to be on and that was um you know sort of a barrier to people adopting uh the hybrid multi-cloud architecture so what we've done with the acquisition of packet is we're basically pre-deploying infrastructure that you can then load with whatever vms you want on top of that such that you can use a sassy type of architecture to originate and secure your traffic and then then connect that directly um into a set of pre-pre-deployed um infrastructure at equinix but to be very clear what we're trying to do is we're still sort of the place that you put your workloads but instead of having to ship physical equipment we're just pre-deploying the infrastructure for you so our goal is to really have infrastructure at software speed but we still will continue to stop really at the at the software layer so what that the packet acquisition was really about was removing one of those barriers of having to physically deploy equipment such that people can um you know deploy their infrastructure much much more quickly and without those uh without the constraints and and time and capex requirements of actually having to to deploy physical equipment yeah yeah definitely and that's why you know i'd heard quite a bit about packet uh at the amazon shows the the last couple of years so uh exciting and see it seems like a solid fit not only for equinix but uh to expand the vmware partnership uh bill i'm wondering you know long partnership uh any specific customer examples that you might be able to share even if it's anonymized as to you know how sd-wan is really helping uh helping customers along with their business challenges yeah we've got a couple great proofs of concept coming along uh right now there's a manufacturing company that we're we're working with um who needs to be able to localize traffic from one of their their um both their their headquarters and a couple of their factories and so they're looking to be able to to aggregate that traffic locally and then connect it to their to their infrastructure that's actually physically in equinix um so this is a this is a ga solution we've got a couple of great proofs of concepts going and this is it's ready to scale wonderful uh sanjay i want to give you and bill final words final takeaways you want people to have uh regarding the partnership and vmware 2020 yeah sure so you know we've been partners like i said since 2013 and we really value this relationship it started off by us saying right in the beginning the cloud is the network that was our mantra right from the get go now the cloud being the network one of the perfect meeting places for the cloud was equinix and we so we located our sd-wan gateways there it did require hardware infrastructure to be put in but of course people would much rather have have a beer or drink a latte instead of rolling out hardware and so bill came along and said hey i have this perfectly you know good thing called network edge doesn't require to put all your hardware in you can get your sd-wan software deployed and so we made that gateway into a virtual edge on the context of a specific enterprise and now literally at the click of a button you can deploy your virtual edges at equinix locations don't have to roll out any specific hardware and from that meeting point you can get to any cloud provider you know many of the mpls providers and then get access in low latency latency is now the criteria everybody's looking at and so between what bill is doing and what we are doing here we're solving that enterprises problem reducing their latency getting all their entry points at this meeting place so thank you bill thank you sanji i think you you summed it up really well i think assange highlighted the value has been there for a long time of of what it means to have a great sd-wan solution in the right place i mean i think now with what we've done together uh making that available on a point-and-click we really have the easy button um and so i know from you know customer conversations that i've had i get requested for bellow cloud um being available on network edge now that it's there i'm i'm confident there's going to be a lot of unlock now that we have the easy button so um i think it's a it's a great combination of a value made easy um and i think the partnership's just going to get stronger from here well definitely lowering the latency to be able to delay the to play those solutions faster is what customers need uh sanjay bill thank you so much for joining us congrats on the on the progress and look forward to hearing more in the future thanks stu thanks bill stay with us for more coverage from vmworld 2020. i'm stu miniman and thank you for watching thecube [Music] you
