 live from San Francisco it's the cube covering RSA Conference 2019 brought to you by four Scout hey welcome back everybody Jeffrey here with the cube we're at the RSA North American conference at Moscone they finally finished the remodel we're excited to be here when the four Scout booths and and our next guest is here he's Scott Stevens the SVP global systems engineering for Palo Alto Networks how're you doing I'm doing well how you doing good so first impressions of the show I mean this it always amazes me when we come to RSA we go to a lot of shows but just the size and the scale and the buzz and and and the activity here is second to none it's incredibly crowded I've been trying to walk the halls here is a bit of a mess so yes plus nobody can find their way through the new Moscone well they're connected differently now so it's pretty confusing okay all right so let's jump into it and I look over your shoulder I see zero trust I see zero trust everybody's about zero trust we had chase on from Forrester last year was talking about zero trust nope you guys are talking about zero trust what is exactly is zero trust and how should people be thinking about zero trust yeah it's kind of it's become buzzword bingo along the way hasn't it right it has yeah so yeah we've been working with Forrester for about six years now looking at zero trust architectures the way I think the fundamental way you look at zero trust is it's a it's an architectural approach to how do you secure your network focused on what's most important and so you focus on the data that's most that's key to your business and you build your security framework from the data out and so there's all kinds of buzzword bingo we can play about what zero trust means but what it allows us to do is to create the right segmentation strategy starting in the data center of the cloud and moving back towards those accessing the data and how do you segment and control that traffic because fundamentally what we're dealing with in security is two basic problems that we have - there's many problems but two big problems we have to do first is credential based attacks and so do we have somebody with stolen credentials in the network stealing our data or do we have an insider who has credentials but they're malicious they're actually stealing content from the company the second big problem is software based attacks malware exploits scripts right and and so how do we segment the network where we can enforce user behavior and we can watch for malicious software so we can prevent both of those occurrences through one architectural framework and I think zero Trust gives us that template building block absent of the buzzword on how we build out those networks because everybody's enterprise network is a little bit different right so it really goes back to kind of roles and access and those types of things because the first one you describe a credential one if it's to somebody in there that they have every right to be there but they're doing behavior that's not necessarily what you expect them to do what you want them to do is it's a typical right so it's a kind of identity and and rights management or is is this a different approach or yeah the more sophisticated approach or how's it been different before no that's a great question and we have to build those things together so you know on the Palo Alto Networks side what we do is we do enforcement layer seven enforcement based on identity so based on who the user is and what their rights are we are able to control what they allowed access to or what they're not allowed access to and of course if you've got a malicious insider or somebody that's logged in with stolen credentials we can prevent them from doing what they're not allowed to do and you know working here with for scout we've done a lot of really good integration with them on that identity mapping constructs so how do they help us understand all the identities and and all the devices in the network so we can then map that to that user posture and control at layer seven what they're allowed to do or not allowed to do right and then on the micro segmentation its you know it's always a you know how far do you segment you can segment to one that doesn't really do much good around it's just one so so what are some of the things people should think about in their segmentation strategy well again I think you you need to start with what's most important and so if I take a cloud or a data center clouds and data centers as a starting point or generally the same well and how we segment is actually the same and so we have this sometimes we think that clouds are are more difficult to secure than data centers are the same basically we've got north-south traffic that east-west traffic how do we how do we inspect and how do we how do we segment that but if you start with what's most important and work your way you know if you tell somebody that you need a microsecond at their network they're gonna be done in 14 years all right so how do we focus on what's the most important critical data to their business and if we stratify their data sets and their applications that access that data and then move down we may have 50% of the applications in their cloud or data center that we don't micro segment at all because they're not critical to the business they're right they're useful to the employees but if something goes wrong they're no big deal we're going back to the business right and so micro segmentation isn't just a conversation of where we have to do things but it's a conversation contextually in terms of what's relevant and where is it important ready that and then where do we you know where do you do a much less robust job you always have to have inspection and visibility but there are parts of your network where you're gonna be somewhat passive about it this part sorry network are gonna be very aggressive multi-factor authentication tight user identity mapping you know all of the different aspects right how do we watch for malware how do we watch for exploits sure so I'm doing that segmentation on the value of the data set because there's some obvious ones that jump to the top of the of the list but I'm just curious if customers get into a situation where they really haven't thought about it once you get ten steps down the list from the top ones or you know if you do a force priority yep and then the other thing I just think is really interesting the time we live today is that a lot of the hackers are not necessarily motivated by personal information or trying to suck a little bit of money out of your bank account but other types of data that they want to use for other types of actions like we saw in the election and some of these other right you know kind of I want to say softer kind of softer uses of softer data for different types of activity than the traditional ransomware or malware and how does that map acted well I didn't necessarily think that was an important piece of data but you know kind of you know that's a shifting landscape in that part is a certainly yeah you need that you need to take a look at what's most important and you can stratify into a couple tiers so you're gonna have the top ten applications and data sets that are critical to the business and we know if something happens there we have to publicly announce okay there that you're gonna do a really nice segmentation strategy and implement a full zero trust where we're controlling user access doing full our inspection everything there you're gonna have a second tier of data which kind of gets into your soft target conversation where maybe we're a little less robust with some of the the user segmentation and the application controls but we're as aggressively robust on the malware and software based threats and frankly being able to inspect and control find malware find commander control find exploits in going in or out of those parts of the network that is very simple to do and zero trust helps us to find where are those locations on the data center cloud side but also throughout the enterprise and where should we have those sensors that are enforcing that behavior right just traffic exploding right everything's connected billions of billions of devices etc etc we don't need to go through the numbers if it's big so clearly automation is more and more important as we go forward a lot of buzz about machine learning and artificial intelligence applying it but the bad guys have it and and the good guys have it a lot of interesting kind of subtopics in terms of training models on how do you train models and the other right type of data but as you kind of sit where you're sitting and net-net is just a lot more traffic going through the network whether it's good bad or otherwise how do you guys kind of look at automation how are you you know kind of looking forward for using artificial intelligence and some of these newer techniques to help just basically get through get through the mass if you will so I think there's there's two ways to think about artificial intelligence machine learning big data analytics good ones now we read another buzzword bingo right now but the first is if we're looking at how are we dealing with malware in finding undone malware in blocking it we've been doing that for years and so the platform we have uses big data analytics and machine learning in the cloud to process and find all of the unknown malware make it known and be able to block it so we find twenty to thirty thousand brand new pieces of malware every day and within five minutes of nine to thirty thousand every day all right so analyzing millions and millions of files every day to figure out which ones are malicious and once we know within five minutes we're updating the security posture for all of our connected security devices globally so whether it's endpoint software or it's our inline next gen firewalls we're updating all of our all of our signatures so that the unknown is now known and the known can be blocked and that's whether you know we're watching the block the malware coming in or the command-and-control its using via DNS and URL to communicate and start whatever it's gonna do and you mentioned crypto lockers and there's all kinds of things that can happen and so that's one vector of using mla i nml to prevent the ability for these attacks to succeed now the other the other side of it i think you were alluding to a little bit more is how do we then take some of the knowledge and the lessons we've learned for what we've been doing now for many years in discovering malware and apply that same AI nml locally to that customer so that they can they can detect very creative attacks very evasive attacks or that insider threat that employee who's behaving inappropriately but quietly and so we've we've announced over the last week what we call the cortex XDR set of offerings that involves allowing the customer to build an aggregated data lake which uses the zero trust framework which tells us how to segment also put sensors and all the places of the network both network sensors an endpoint as we look at how do you secure the endpoint as well as how do you secure the net on the network links and using those together we're able to stitch those logs together in a data like that machine learning can now be applied to on a customer by customer basis to find maybe somebody was able to evade because they're very creative or that insider threat again who isn't breaking security rules but they're being evasive we can now find them through machine learning right and the the cool thing about zero trust is the prevention architecture that we needed for zero trust becomes the sensor architecture for this machine learning engine you get dual purpose use out of the architecture of zero trust to solve both the in-line prevention and their response architecture that you need right it's a long answer it's like I know crazy space I mean it's just it's just faster I mean the numbers in the mass of just throughput in this in this area is just fascinating yes and so we're here in the for Scout booth and they've got a you know unique take on on all the objects and everything is connected to the networks we've heard from people earlier today is 50 60 70 % more things connected than they ever even than they ever even thought most of them not malicious but just people plug it in at various remote offices and this and that so yeah well IOT well to the next buzzword bingo right go what hit them all so just you know so how are you guys working with with for Scott how do the two solutions work together to get a one plus one makes three and you know as we were talking a little bit about before getting that concept of what are all these connected devices what is the device itself and then who are the users attached to those devices for Scott has that insight right so we don't do I always look at that is identity assertion device where identity assertion so how do we define what they are and who they are what we do then is in working with for scout we take that knowledge that they have and that turns into identity and device enforcement and that's how we enforce those postures so that I know employee a isn't allowed to the intellectual property data sense employee B is well in the old world of security you just have a rule for how do you get to that in in what we do now with layer C with user based and application controls I can on a user by user basis determine what they're allowed to do are not allowed to do for scout gives us that insight so that we are able to enforce they they handle making sure they know exactly who it is we enforce it properly right and in for the devices right because you basically assigned almost like an identity and a role to a to a device exactly and then you don't end up with this weird spaghetti network topology where okay we have to put all of our OT devices on these 14 VLANs and we're gonna extend them all across our enterprise and not all that goes away natural acts right all right so it's gotta give you the last word before we sign off you know kind of as we look forward to 2019 and I can't believe it's March already what are some of your priorities what are you working on what you know what's the rest of the year look like for you I think get back to buzzword bingo we're spending a lot of time right now looking at how do we help our customers with that generating that data Lake so they can so they can help figure out what's happening within their infrastructure and as you you pivot from the security posture which of course is where we're always going to pay attention and you help them think about operationalizing that and how do we help the the sec ops or the sock figure out what's going on in their network the data they're dealing with is massive and so they're looking at haystacks and haystacks and hay stacks right and part of the goal of what we're trying to do is help them burn down those haystacks and hand them needles because in the end all they care about is the needles the hay is getting in the way and so there's a lot of work that we're doing around machine learning around optimizing workloads and automation so that we can reduce that complexity we've been doing it for the last ten years for network security how do we take the complexity of all the things we used to do separate and simplify them and automate so we've automated the feedback loops for network security for the next-gen firewall we've simplified what you can do on the endpoint fridge for for traps and how we protect that we've done with the integrations with for scat we're simplifying how you map that identity back and forth and I think for the rest of the year it's really about simplifying operations and helping quickly determine when something is wrong in the network so you can fix it fast right before you're dealing with an extra tration problem not 150 days or whatever the about four hours what if we try better yeah better more better all right Scott well thanks for for sharing the inside thanks for your talk go burn some haystacks p scott i'm jeff you're watching the cube we're at RSA 2019 in San Francisco thanks for watching we'll be right back [Music]
