 night football they dismantled the New England Patriots and then 24 hours later they got the first playoff game in 29 years here as the Royals take the field on a great night for baseball here in Kansas City the batting order is brought to you by Budweiser Coco Crisp leaves it off to the a's followed by Sam Fuld and left Josh Donaldson the big bat hitting third and Brandon Moss is between up hitter as Cal said Josh Brett expand hot he's in the five hole than it's Jett Lowry Stephen Vogt plays first Geovany Soto is behind the plate and Eric's Sogard is the second baseman only two right-handed hitters going up against the right-hander James Shields tonight James Shields 32 years old his career record is a hundred and fourteen and ninety his postseason mark more important seven career starts at 2 and 4 for the 4.9 ADRA let's take a look at that Kansas City defense their iron man yeah here's the guys with the gloves Mortensen left the Gold Glove winner canes and center peyote's in right moving to the infield we have Escobar and Infante up the middle Mike Moustakas and the Gold Glove winner Eric Hosmer at first base behind the plate we have Salvador Perez and on the mound big game James here's the umpiring crew for this American League wild card game Bill Miller calls the balls and strikes the crew chief is Jerry Davis at first and I Sonja at second Bill welke at third and of course being a playoff game you add umpires down the lines James boy in his seventh year patrolling the left-field line and Todd Tichenor down the right-field line there is a plane flying overhead during batting practice said it's been worth the wait and this is not unlike what we encountered a year ago when we did the wild card game in the National League side in Pittsburgh and that place was off the charts same story here at the K Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City now I don't know if everyone will agree that was worth the wait but I'll tell you this crowd is as loud as it was in Pittsburgh James Shields has the best changeup in right-handed changeup in baseball just has a great motion you'll see a lot of that pitch tonight Coco Crisp leaves it off Chevrolet pitch tracks and the Arsenal for James Shields and as Ron said watched that change so as the fastball 60% of the time that's down low and the count even a ball and a strike after seeing big game James pitch all these years I'd say that percentages were a little higher on that changeup because when he gets in trouble that's the pitch he goes to missed inside and if you made any indication in the difference between regular season baseball and post season baseball is the war with every pitch [Applause] you know you spend your entire six months 162 games trying to be the best you can be over that time and then you get here every pitch counts every hip counts every ball counts every decision by a manager counts the intensity is way up I remember as an infielder you get ready you know every single pitch obviously during the season but it's not nearly as exhausting as you do in the playoffs it's like you're ready to move left or right in this is your intense my imagine game time couldn't come soon enough I wanted to wait through the day for this for this to happen the hardest part was the nerves had build-up before the game starts once you get out there once you get the first round ball once you get into the game then it becomes the same payoff pitch to the age leadoff hitter slapped into left-field and Coco Crisp is on with a single [Applause] a lot of these Tigers as you see this high fastball from shields got into a 3-2 count that's what this Oakland A's team does best and did best over the first four months of the season they will work the starting pitcher get deep into the pitch count Chris has 19 stolen bases in 24 tribes much has been said about the lack of offense when Cespedes got traded that big presence but there's still a good offensive team and they started to get it going in the month of September last two weeks in particularly Sam Fuld the number two hitter took a strike oh and one Bob Melvin said he was in the lineup he thought of Adam Dunn and all that power but expansive out hit field here in Kansas City you need to defense a fold they gotta assume it's gonna be a tight one run game and defense could be the difference in the game Mike Gallego the third-base coach one of the best offensive infielders you ever saw during his time this is probably the last place Sam Fuld thought he would be earlier this season he began the year with the A's but only played seven games [Applause] and say he checked his swing that's bill welke down at third so he began the year with Oakland and then blamed off waivers by the Minnesota Twins and then traded at the deadline back to Oakland and he finds himself in the playoffs yeah pitchers perspective you think he went right Ronnie always hitters for secular perspective I think he kind of held up he didn't really make an attempt and break his wrist even though the bat is out there around home plate I still don't think that's really the indication that he swung at it he held up we got a two on one count Bob Melvin said they probably wouldn't steal a lot but they might hit and run even though he thinks it's only about a 30% success rate with the hit and run crisp with the lead at first and full goes the opposite way Alex Gordon back and makes the play boarding the converted third baseman his lung three gold gloves as an outfielder and made that one looking as he has he had to go back no generally speaking if a guy can has a really good changeup he likes to pitch to guys that can hit the ball out of the ballpark so they're gonna start the bat earlier and the change-up can fool them if you get hitters that are content with taking and hitting the ball the opposite field that changeup becomes less effective outfield defense at Kansas City will play a big part in this game Cain and Gordon can go get it now here's Josh Donaldson leads the A's and hits home runs and runs batted in swings at the first pitch and fouls it away Owen Warren this little man generates just about as much bat speed as anyone in the game he's playing with a banged up left knee that he fell on but at this time of year Bob Melvin ran down his list of guys hurt on his team seemed like the whole roster everybody had something at this point it's safe to assume that everybody does have something at this point but I tell you what the playoffs the change in weather a little bit although we're not experiencing it here and the adrenaline push really takes all the pain shields jumps ahead no balls and two strikes sometimes you get ahead of hit or two and you say advantage pitcher both those swings Donaldson was on both of those pitches shields the 14 game-winner the livers vo2 [Applause] Marez kept it in front one and two buck showalter said about Salvador Perez he said behind the plate he's like a big pillow nothing ever gets away from him he just forms that big body of his and gets down and just smothers the baseball and keeps it in front of him the interesting a changeup artist normally likes to throw two one three two floated to change ups and different counts but big James his changeup is a strikeout pitch took two shots at it right there as well [Applause] he's got that power changeup he came from Tampa Bay Alex Cobb has it over there with the Tampa Bay Rays Johan Santana and his day that changeup that can put a hitter away righty or Lefty first strikeout for shields in the second out of the inning and that was his changeup he tried to get him to chasing the dirt on it got to account in two and two and came right back it with it tripled up on it so righty on righty Cal three chains ups in a row how many times do you see that very very rarely change in speed Thomasin's bat hand off the bat chrisp still at first here's the cleanup hitter Brandon Moss he takes his strike going on Moss would appear to be the guy most affected in the Oakland lineup by the trade of un tiss Cespedes his power numbers dropped tremendously after the trade and this balls well hit to right and you can forget about it he adds to the power numbers there into the seats over the bullpen and it's to nothing [Applause] [Music] Brandon Moss just his farm one since the trade of Yoenis Cespedes and that's one of those change ups that just stay right over the middle of the plate and he got all of it looked like they were starting to pitch him in the cutter and then try to come back with a changeup I'm never a big believer and change ups the first time through the lineup cuz what are you changing off of nothing get from one cutter inside straight to the change-up maybe a little too hard mas took care of it that's very true it a hitter then has to first respect the fastball and if he's just looking for the baseball sometimes the change-up will be perceived as a fastball tape measure shot by Brandon Moss and here is Josh Reddick I think with big James though those sort of rules go out the window because his changeup is exceptional heretics got good numbers career against shields 318 with three home runs yes that will put a smile on your face your first day be post in 2014 that's Rennicks bomb earlier this year got two up in the same game went up there looking for a fastball the very next time in the first mission deposited that one out as well 2 to 2 left lower than right there in his tracks but the Oakland A's the last team to clinch a playoff spot the push to score in this game here in the 1st and a useful Brandon boss faux pas jump out to nothing Royals coming to bat here's their batting order brought to you by Budweiser Alcides Escobar in the leadoff spot with nori Aoki second Lorenzo Cain the speedy center fielder hits third and Eric Hosmer in the cleanup spot then it's Billy Butler Alex Gordon that team's leader in home runs and RBIs Salvador Perez the catcher Omar Infante Oh as a career-high and RBIs this year in the third baseman is Mike Moustakas and Jon Lester's on the hill what I forgot to mention about the pitchers both Lester and shields is that they are auditioning for big dollars as free agents if you want a number one pitcher this year maybe his best this year a lot of losses but a great er a lots of innings like he always has and quickly he's ahead of Escobar no balls and two strikes Ned Yost late in the season swapped the number one and two guys in the order pokey had been the leadoff hitter predominantly this year but then he he put Escobar there and it really sparked the Kansas City offense and so here in the wild-card game it's Escobar who leads off Lester's 252 starts in his major league career 116 wins 67 losses but only 2 and 3 at this ballpark this is a team that swings out of the strike zone a lot you don't have to throw strikes on your head we entered inside escobar wouldn't fight two balls and two strikes the thing about Lester also after that the trade deadline deal was made his first start was against the Kansas City Royals and he beat him still to to is that follow the way he had beaten them with the Red Sox in July wins in Oakland and then beat him again later in August at Kansas City we mentioned earlier they've only beat him two times during the regular season both wins by Jon Lester on the ground up the middle the delegate Jed Lowrie and Escobar is armed just a cutter outside hit hard up the middle to play a tough play probably has to be ruled a hit to see them off the heel of the glove [Applause] and that had to take an angle to that ball that it could throw out a speedy runner and that's the advantage of having speed is that you have to make that play but if you word I sense it is rural to hit and here's how okie punt and took it on one he's so interesting Ned Yost told us before the game if Escobar gets on the Okies bunting I wouldn't think he would bump with a to old deficit but maybe still gonna play his cards the way he thinks he should Escobar at first probably Kansas City's best baserunner and he's stolen 31 out of 37 [Applause] quickly behind in the county's jalapeno ballsy to strikes you'll see a lot of swings up there that are little unorthodox from time to time whatever it takes from a Hokie to get on occasionally that batting stance and swings seems like he he's swinging in or through the strike zone but he gets it done Lester stepped off and a little bluff over there toward first he usually does not throw to first does not have a great move but is very quick to the plate [Applause] you might have thought when this one game came up that Derek Norris would be that would be the catcher for the Oakland A's swings a good bat but has trouble throwing runners out Soto has been much better in that department and thus gets the start against the speedy Royals on the ground a second so guard with the high flip but they get the out [Applause] then I Sonia is the second base umpire he took a long look at it and then made the call so they get the force but how Oki reaches on the fielder's choice well it's interesting about that place so guard isn't for his defense the high toss may be a little nerves nice play by Lowery but in the vicinity I guess of second base there with the force I think he got his toe on the dip base though here's the center fielder Lorenzo Cain 8th in the American League with a 301 average another guy who can really run Cal you say the distinction needs to be made here are you trying to turn the DoublePlay or are you trying to get the force out many times you have to make that decision as a shortstop that one because the throw was off you got to make sure you get your toe in the bag and drag that to get the force out to keep the beginning from happening in the air to right-field Josh Reddick threw down Soto being in the game as the catcher has thrown out 50% of the runners and his good strong arm but there's not really that many attempts I don't think there was any attempts from the Kansas City Royals when they had were facing Jon Lester this year so it almost seems that if it's Jon Lester on the mound and there are no attempts why do you need somebody that could throw remember Lester had this great success with Oakland this year with one catcher Derek Norris he had great success in the postseason last year with one catcher David Ross there is a value to learning now he came over to Oakland they all had to learn him really quickly so who's to say that Soto can't learn him just as quickly but there is some little concern right now that he hasn't caught him before doesn't know how he thinks doesn't know what pitches he wants to throw to and maybe doesn't know how the ball actually comes up there and cuts era Kozma waiting on a one oh there goes ah okey here's the throw to second no chance I hope he actually over slipped the bag just to touch but the throw was offline and there was no chance for Lowrey to apply a tag well you know all of their stolen-base people on this team he did go past the bag he's been thrown out eight times so he's doesn't have a great percentage but he went on first move and he guessed right so a runner in scoring position for the Royals with two down and Lester delivers a 200 was about two and then time was called at the very last instant it's obvious that they're gonna use their threat of speed and getting off the base to disrupt some of the timing from Jon Lester well Geovany Soto was arguing with home plate umpire Miller saying hey that's way too late you're gonna hurt my picture you call time that late away three and oh this offense is predicated on making things happen and Ned Yost is gonna make sure that he doesn't bury his plan even though down to nothing in the first inning you still got to play your game so let him swing three you know he's going to get a fastball let him be aggressive four pitch walk there at first and second interesting to see so go out talking to Lester what can you tell Lester about pitching in the postseason that he doesn't know because it's time to relax is Lefty how much of this is the first time he is not part Lester and are you totally on the same page well sometimes you're not in the same page it could be as simple as watching the catcher give those of the multitude of signs with a guy on segment sometimes it takes them longer than the catcher you work with normally it's little things like that that can change your tempo he is a tempo pitcher was one of the most popular guys we're in the Kansas City uniform it's Billy Butler always up high tea balls and no strikes and a plate jumping a little bit for Lester here in the first Lester pitching on five days rest that's an X today you never know for a lot of pitchers even the great ones a little strong in that first inning sixth grade balls since retiring pain on the fly ball to right just because it's six straight balls doesn't mean should take here he does tape strike call and putler didn't think much of it did not like that call by Bill Miller what do you think Cal it's a to old cutter so it's got a little movement it's right on the edge [Applause] and inside again and missed three and one I know for all good hitters when they're facing good pitches what pitch is close they say don't help him he doesn't need any help because it that's exactly what we do say hitters pitch with two on and two out - let's face it that's going to score a run and it's going to put runners on the corners with two down Kansas City on the door it's obvious that he's coming back inside again this time Butler is looking for it put a good swing on a hit line drive maybe lucky it's just a single well that's why Sam told us in there one great hitting by Butler being ready for that pitch in fold is so quick he's able to keep that ball in play keep but would first keep the force at second here's Alex Gordon [Applause] Royals leader in home runs with 19 RBIs with 74 it's a 2-1 game and all 20 ones have come with two out just another example of Royals baseball they planned behind a lock this year they still stated their game I hope you faked the bunt and his first pitch that he saw in the post he stole a base to set up scoring the run Alex Gordon the number one of those homegrown products and there his Billy Butler caught between first and second now Hosmer edging away at third and now they're gonna throw to the plate and husba is out Billy Butler wandered off first and it resulted in the third out Butler Knox in Iran and then cost some cosmic no chance it's two to one it's Chevy truck month time when truck guys can depend on great offers on the 2014 North American Truck of the Year Chevy Silverado top of the second Chet Lowery leads it off open leading to one bizarre ending to the bottom of the first inning for the Kansas City Royals as Billy Butler was picked off and caught between first and second now here's what do you make of this well I don't think there was a play on because neither Hosmer or Butler can run I think Butler's talking to Kunz saying hey if they're playing behind me should I steal so they still will you never looked at Lester Lester just stepped off and they made the play the simplest of plays that maybe work in high school certainly not supposed to work at this level and the put out was made at the plate and he saw rusty Kuntz the first base coach and Billy Butler everybody trying to explain exactly what happened well you definitely don't do something that you don't do normally normally in the regular season in the playoffs but there are times when a 1st and 3rd left-handed play will work I stole my first base in the big leagues on a left-handed play of home comes against John Matlack when he takes his eye off of you you start to run at third and then he runs over there at first put on a play where you're just trying to get the run down you better have some really fast guys that you bet you're gonna be able to do that at the big league level where you can execute and steal a run but that wasn't the right situation just to get in a run-down and then try to score around a lob luli took the bat out of the hands of your leading home run hitter an RBI guy and Alex Gordon with runners at first and third he was your MVP of the season we showed the graphic and what he hits with two outs and runners in scoring position everything he does and font they hitting him on the head like well you're gonna have a hard time Billy Butler explaining that at the coffee shop tomorrow I think the logical explanation is that if you're gonna play behind him he doesn't throw over here let's just get a running lead and go but again asking him to do that when he hasn't done that you know and during the course of the season that's a risk two balls two strikes the dread Lowry you know it's early not a lot of pitches have been thrown that inside fastball to lefties that Shields usually just excels at he has not gotten one call or not made one pitch inside yet three to look out those line drives foul that you hope everybody's paying attention down there both pitchers have hit 95 Bernie I know how you like the ninety it's not me it's you you those likes to see that 95 flash up there on the board you look at their control and the type of pitches they throw you forget they still have a 95 Kozma made a nice grab and shields made a nice catch that first one down fourth member of our crew is Matt Winer who's got the best seat in the house Matt what you got that's a pretty good one here on the Royals suite where they are hanging on every pitch including George Brett who's signed with this organization two years after it was born and he's been here every ever since as a Hall of Fame player as a pivotal piece of that 85 championship team as an executive as a coach etc you've been a part of this rebuilding process as well how gratifying is this scene tonight it's pretty special for a town to wait 29 years and when I first signed with the Royals and 71 and then we made the playoffs and my well I came up in 73 74 bigging my first year you make the playoffs seven out of ten years you think it's gonna happen all the time and it hasn't happened since 85 so very happy for Dayton Moore very happy for Ned Yost and the rest of the coaching staff and especially all the players down and down on the field because they've really worked their tails off and and developed into a really good ballclub when in this development process did you think you had a team that could reach this level I think last year in the second half of the season the way they played they were always kind of just you know they had a tough time getting to 500 for a long time and and once they got over 500 they got on a pretty good streak and all of a sudden last year at the end of the season I'm saying you know these guys aren't that far away and it was a good experience for them last year to to play exciting you know pennant contending baseball they're in it till the last week of the season and unfortunately Detroit beat us and we lost out in the wild card but I think last year was the first year I really saw the these guys I thought these guys were ready to play and the organization took a calculated risk in trading prospects to bring back James Shields between the innings the winds and his presence in the clubhouse what is he meant for the last two years well you can ask Danny Duffy and Ventura about that he's mentored those guys and don't forget that Wade Davis and that deal also who had the most incredible year as a reliever I've ever seen I think he's given up four extra-base hits all year er a oh one just been the eighth-inning specialist of all time but James and Wade brought over a looseness a confidence about about them and it's really rubbed off on the young guys by the way our bosses will be very happy to hear that George spends many of his afternoons watching what Network TBS baby because it's yes because it's it's very funny Gurley there you go there you have it tried to let lead him right into it there you have it of such probe such moments promos are made Thank You George they can Matt a Stephen Vogt draws the one out walk and here's Geovany Soto [Applause] in two close plays now that have gone against the Royals on the check swing let's think going against the Royals but a play that's been asked the first baseman once third bit third-base umpire once both against the Royals strike one and one Soto started the year with the Texas Rangers played 10 games and then was sold to the A's near the end of August it 262 didn't hit a home run knocked in 8 runs but it's his work behind the plate caught 9 out of 17 runners attempting to steal that got him the start tonight he was fee when it's 1 & 2 sotto is active behind the plate gets down low in 1d it also has a little bump in his bat too back in 2008 soda was the whitney of the year in the National League with the Chicago Cubs he really thought he was going to be a fixture for those Cubs for years to come he had a tough year the tougher next couple of years [Applause] vote with a lead at first that's strike three looked like a fastball away subtle thought it was down our pitch Trax had it down also Bill Miller rang him up to down and that definitely was down on the strike zone here's the number nine hitter Eric's Sogard swings at the first pitch and fouls it right back many everyday players anymore you see wearing the glasses during a game you become kind of his that's who he is trademark right voted first with virtually no lead load is one of those guys that's suffering from a banged up ankle and toe [Applause] I was outside and it's one at one [Applause] Bob Melvin saying look it's not how you got here it's that you did get here and it's a fresh start one ball and two strikes a 10 and 16 September for the Oakland Athletics and it was touch and go down the stretch because Seattle after losing five in a row got high and Oakland able to hold them off Sonny gray came up big on the last day of the season and here they are shields were the one to [Applause] most pitchers are horses to be a lotta innings pitch you deep in the ball games but both of them are getting up with a pitch count here early on in this game Nolan said Lester is 125 to 130 I would say the same except for the great bullpen of Kansas City for shields fouled into the myth of Salvador Perez second strikeout of the inning herded the game for shields we go to the bottom half of the second [Music] where will you be the next time history is made be there for all the action in 2015 go to mlb.com / season tickets to reserve your seat today Alex Gordon leading off here in the bottom half of the second he was at the plate when the Billy Butler episode happened in the bottom half of the first inning which resulted in their a Kozma being thrown out at the plate still trying to absorb that up here a no two count is account where you take a chance on doing something because that the facts are that not a good chance to get a hit off Lester the count is owing to fly ball left field and Sam Fuld makes the play for the first out take a quick trip to Atlanta and check in with Casey Stern case [Applause] [Applause] I can see our Yale man Ron darling analyzing what you just gave us and look on his face right now is his blank as mine it was the first state inducted into the nation that's why they would be the first state to talk about the Royals and the eight there you go somehow I knew sorry case you would have to answer ball in a strike to Salvador Perez Jon Lester and you get into the statistic of quality starts [Applause] that's a couple of miles high right behind short and yet Lowry squeezes it two up and two down go six innings we allow three earned runs or less credited with a quality start Jon Lester made eleven starts for the A's 11 quality starts the quality start is an interesting stat because if you take it all the way out over nine innings you have an ER a of 4.50 Jon Lester would not be happy with an ER a of four and a half he's a two and a half kind of guy did the the number about a quality start does show though there is some consistency there that every time he's out there he's going six you know he's giving up a little bit of damage not a lot but mixed in with quality starts or a shutout here and there and eighth inning is a shutout ball it seems like if you look at that and say you know what he's gonna keep you in a game it was a foregone conclusion years ago that if you logged a lot innings you had a lot of quality starts they wouldn't keep in there if they weren't doing the job interesting to see a shift put on with Omar Infante well I always think of as a guy who sprays the ball all over the ballpark second baseman so guard almost behind the base to the pull side is Lowery [Applause] the o2 and he literally goes down swinging three up three down we head to the third [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we moved to the top half of the third and in the bottom half of the third pretty good chance you're going to see a different battery for the Oakland A's let's take a look at tonight's forecast are presented by voya financial seventy five percent chance the A's will win when they score first fifty-seven and 19 in the regular season Coco Crisp leads it off here in the third and the reason we say that is between innings we could look in the dugout and see that Geovany Soto had taken the gear off and was talking to the trainer walked out of the dugout and you saw Derek Norris saddle up beside Jon Lester so here was Soto and accompanied by Nick paparesta the Oakland trainer and there's no horse who's got the gear on no history one whatever it takes to get loose there's that change again and crisp way out in front a ball and two strikes at the time a train changing catchers and a postseason game might benefit the starting pitcher Lester first single to left his first time came around to score in front of Brandon moss on the two-run bomb just reached out with one hand and slapped into first those 3-1 in the books and it looked like Shields for a second might have gotten it by crisp at the bag let's go now to Matt Winer Matt Barney Giovanni Soto who is brought in for defensive purposes to start this game is done for the night he has injured the left thumb of course that's his catching hand he did it on the tag at home plate I spoke to him a few moments ago he said he heard something pop asked him if it broke and he said I don't know but I can't receive the ball well I thank you very much Matt so Derek Norris will get the call in the bottom half of the third inning that finger will blow up I've had that myself is called the gamekeepers thumb it's where your thumb is bent back and the pain is pretty bad so trying to catch that cutter for the rest of the game it's not going to happen for Geovany Soto two balls and no strikes to say I'm full gamekeepers gamekeepers thumb yeah I don't know why it's called that you know what's interesting about today's game because of the replay that's a game where it almost would have been a phantom tag where I want to just caught you on the hip maybe but now when we want to make sure that you apply the tag he really caught him right in the midsection it took that complete blow from Hosmer Jonny Gomes finds himself in the postseason again watching on his full pops it up behind the plate because Perez have a play oh he doesn't missed it by a row Perez has been one of their Venezuelan warriors this season he played in a hundred and forty six games that's better than the record Darrell Porter held at 145 never misses an inning it seems also their shortstop from Venezuela Alcides Escobar played 162 games this season and the guy sitting in between us Cal Ripken didn't bat an eye when that stat was mentioned poor gripes softly and it will fall in front of ioki for a one-out single third hit allowed by James Shields as he works here in the third for Ned Yost this also a first first time he's managed a postseason game and has been nothing but confident going in thinking that these Royals with the way they've picked up offensively to go with their great starting and relief pitching could be poised for a deep run but there's Josh Donaldson who singles to left there at first and second big game James so far has not been on and I'm not going to say that because it's third inning he's giving up a couple of runs he's only given up four hits but the swings from the AES hitters have been locked on so far two shields he is not as they say in the baseball parlance it's not really fooling anybody so far and he certainly did not fool Brandon Moss in the first I know downer into the seats in right over the Oakland bullpen and has been fighting with his control got into some hitters counts you're right the swings have been really strong foul balls have been good swings some of the outs have been hard outs runners lead from first and second one out here in the third and Moss at the plate line drive slide down by Hosmer he throws to second to complete the DoublePlay we've had bad base swimming on the Kansas City side and now Sam Ford gets bailed off second on the soft line drive to Hosmer we head to the bottom of the third [Applause] tonight's 2014 American League wildcard is presented by Budweiser thanks for tuning in here on TBS we move to the bottom half of the third inning in a 2-1 game Jon Lester in the A's on top Mike Moustakas the number 9 hitter takes a strike leading off here in the third and you see the shift here this is where most of the balls that mr. Hosmer hits go to Tom Moustakas up at the plate and he spoils the ship goes the other way wide turn at first with sam full hustle that one in leadoff single here in the third for Kansas City Dale Swain since he became the hitting coach and late-may has been trying to get Moustakas to go to left field more he says yes you've got power to hit 20 the 30 home runs but instead of hitting just a barely over 200 hit the ball to left field perfect display there it's also a classic case as the infield can play him to pull but the outfield did not plan the ball Sam made a nice play over there but he was playing him more true that way the outfield was not shifted so he had 74 hits this year from Center to right field and only 22 big one there here's Alcides Escobar Donaldson in on the grass at third and they lay it down Donelson makes the play goods the runner over into scoring position with one down [Applause] as we talked about in the top half of the inning Derek Norris replacing Geovany Soto behind the plate for Oakley [Applause] Escobar with a sacrifice bunt puts Moustakas and second for nori Aoki that was one of those bunts that was kind of sacrifice bunt but also take a chance on getting a hit you don't want to give up a run but you also want to advance in the second so didn't you didn't give it away too early wanted it just a little too hard for hit time called Big Bob Melvin right now hands out and like come on Bill Miller you kidding me let's go that's two times now from the best pitchers in the game and he's halfway and throwing the baseball and two timeouts stockist was dancing off the bag at second now he asked for time and it is granted with Westar basically into the line we gotta believe that that strategic though dancing off second base and also asking for timeout the royals said before the game that they are going to try to somehow mess with the tempo of John Lester they think it would mean a run maybe even to by making sure he doesn't throw the ball when he's ready to throw up one ball no strikes - okey sump pump fire Bill Miller though I would be like the boy who cried wolf the next value wants time I might not be so ready to give it to him if he's in a Royals uniform now lucky ones time again [Applause] he reached on a fielder's choice his first time stole second and has scored the only Kansas City run on Billy Butler's line drive single the old fly in the eye they've been using that forever town they have [Applause] right through there z11 Kansas City team that tries to manufacture runs last in baseball with 95 home runs only team to not hit a hundred it's interesting with that flat kind of swing of Aoki he kind of stays in that strikes on a long time batting 363 heat against left-handed pitching kind of tells you when that breaking ball if it doesn't have that good curve on it if it's going across the strike zone he's going to stay with it he has a great ability to keep his hands inside the ball and he waits a long time and he stays in there on lefties 2 2 so the Royals last in home runs last him in walks drawn and had the fewest strikeouts and when you're talking about teams he make the postseason with the fewest walks in the fewest home runs has never happened in modern baseball history on the ground right at Lowery throws across for the second out while Moustakas moves to third and when you look at that Royals offense it's almost exactly the opposite of what Oakland is trying to do they want to walk a lot they want to hit the ball out of the ballpark that's all they care about and just the opposite for the Royals [Applause] one of the fans going all biblical here with the cane is able sign as Lorenzo steps in here in the third with two down and the tying run 90 feet away it's Mike Moustakas flied out to right his first time and he's a single down the line could be fill it up and throwing in it it is a stand-up double Lorenzo Cain in the game his time good numbers against Jon Lester King some of the best numbers and he wasn't waiting around he was able with his speed turned it into a double gold plated well in the corner but the go-ahead run is in scoring position with two out to Eric Hosmer [Applause] that's such a big run in a playoff game it's easier to play when you're even it's even easier to play when you're up one run and when you're down and you start getting a little more tight as the game gets going on in the air shallow left that's gonna break the time came scores three to Kansas City mr. ball off the end of the bat powder then he gets just enough on one of those perfectly placed new hits the night for clutch hitting all five runs in this game coming with two out and then here's Billy Butler swinging at the first pitch he knocked in the first Kansas City run with a line shot in the first watching Lester in this game Cal two things come to mind he is not using the outside corner to the right-hand hitters at all middle of the plate in with that cutter and have you seen a curveball yet I don't know if I have that's one of his better pitches breaking pitch stayed up and away there was your first curveball maybe that's why not even close you can fall in love with a cutter inside all the time especially if you're having a success with it but one of Lester's real successes is that he our four-seamer and he can dot that on the outside corner or pitch up in the strike zone if you forget about that just fall into the cutter basically can start to cheat on it rounded is short Lowry will go the short way for the course but the Kansas City Royals have taken the lead over John Wester of age as he's going to in the third it streets [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] to get exclusive behind-the-scenes access and expert opinions from the biggest

half of the fourth and Josh Reddick takes ball one [Applause] heretics lied to Alex Gordon and left his first time and now we see how James Shields reacts pitching with a lead in this game run we saw the graphic 2.0 to er a and shutdown innings the only issue he's having in this game is that the Oakland A's are not going out of the strike zone first pitch was a breaking ball taken by Redick changeup taken by Redick now fastball down also taken this Oakland A's team you're gonna have to come in the strike zone at some point Perez is urging his pitcher on that's a little bit of both it's his control is not pen pinpoint but also the Oakland A's do not swing at bad pitches [Applause] when three and oh now 3 & 2 thanks just been watching shields almost like he's got three different fast balls that 95 Rider that little cutter that's 91 or 92 they can also - seen it away that was a little putter than a little replayed that retic missed I was a big battle back from 302 make a pitch on three two to get that out hard to express to you how important it feels as a pitcher you get 300 on a hitter and you come back you get that first out of the inning huge out there for the worlds and shields here's the shortstop Jed Lowrie grounded to first his first time and seems like that strike zone for bill Miller's opening up just a little bit for shields here in the fourth [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in the air right centerfield that guy has big long strides and his graceful and covers ground like there's nothing to it and in this ball park you got speedy outfielders it's pretty much a necessity it's interesting two outs here and the fourth means four we talked about in the opening James Shields has to get seven outs and not give up a run to get Kansas City to the way they played all season long to that hydra bullpen of Herrera Davis and Holland those three have absolutely been lights out and a big reason that when they lead after eight they're 79 and one quickly ahead of going on to what a play what do they say in Baltimore give that fan of contract or used to they used to say that he's snagged it at his bare hand we called the intensity ramped up here in Kansas

breaking oh and to let's the adjustment that he has to make normally he does you want to mix in that curveball because it has the spin of a cutter but had also changes speeds hardest part for a pitcher in these games is your adrenaline sometimes works against you you end up throwing the ball harder than you have all year and you forget about all those little touch pitches which are so important to your success got an off-speed one down here in the fourth moments ago we spoke with the A's pitching coach Kurt Young Kurt how do you assess you've seen Jon Lester at his best obviously how do you assess what you've seen tonight well he he does well I mean he's always gonna pitch ahead in the count and he's going to attack the strike zone he's not one of those guys that you have to tell to do that so you know they're they're looking to hit the ball early they're looking to to get a good pitch early to hit see he knows that and it's all about location early on for him hey Kurt do you see any problem with Soto now out of the game with the bad thumb and Norris in catching Lester well basically this was Soto's first time catching him this year Dino's been his catcher's all the starts that he's been here so they're real comfortable together and it worked very well together our thanks deferred young for his time in between innings as Salvador Perez faces John Lester again that when to call a breaking ball could be one of those issues of risotto catching him for the first time [Applause] Perez second on this Royals team and home runs and RBIs behind in the count one and two steps out in the air near the line and foul so the increase in curveballs thrown by Lester that was the first fastball away thrown by Lester with the new catcher Norris in there norris with the nickname dino with the duck dynasty haircut and fingernails were all painted so lester can see the signs doesn't seem to all go together going back to the curveball and got him to wave at it for the second out records and milestones presented by Jim Beam and you see Jon Lester's sterling earned run average coming into this game in the postseason of two point one one trailing only Christy Mathewson and Wade point Curt Schilling on that list and Kenny Holtzman number five on that list two up and two down here in the fourth and Infante grounds to Lowry that's a quick 1-2-3 inning for Jon Lester four innings in the books wild card on CBS pouring champions in 1985 last time the Kansas City Royals were in the postseason they won it in seven over the Cardinals and we welcome you back to what is essentially a game 7 atmosphere in the wild-card game one and done Jarrod Weaver and the Angels waiting for the winner of this game the loser goes home Eric Norris leads it off here in the fifth he came on when Giovanni Soto had to leave the game of the thumb injury early [Applause] so Ronnie if you're Jared Weaver you're watching this game like a hawk a big-time big-time just just trying to find out any little nuance from either team it's going to help you in your start you know witch witch witch hitter takes the first pitch curveball which hitter when there's guys on base swings at the first pitch those are the little things you want to know one ball two strikes moments ago we spoke with Royals manager Ned Yost Ned they kind of came out and punched me in the mouth in the first inning but this is your team the way they fight back you wanted a lead against lesser but you had to come from behind to do it quick now you got it we did you know Maude said it changeup off of way go there in the first to put us down too but you know our focus was to try to create havoc on the base pass try to you know bunt try to hit and run try to get guys in scoring position and see if we could make something happen and so far it's been good for us they're creating havoc you almost took it to another level with Billy Butler what happened on that play well that play broke down on both ends you know Billy left too soon it was supposed to wait till Lester threw the ball home break down and take the second break it down and then Haas was going to come to the plate if we ran it right [Music] we had find that we had to find other ways to score runs other than that it was perfect so as well what's interesting is Susan Slusser who follows TAS and writes for the A's said that the Angels successfully did this against Leicester last week but that was run so poorly by Kansas City that could have been defense by the twelve-year-old Cal Ripken travel team have gotten it out there two up and two down here in the top half of the fifth back to the top of the Oakland order and Coco Crisp think about this earning child the collateral damage of that his husband knocked Soto out of the game with the tag he's thrown out at the plate and then the thumb injury knocked Soto out just trying to get Billy at the fence after the game Billy not dinner run and then gave a run away potentially chrisp this mad at the strike zone by team that takes a lot of pitches think they know the strike zone Miller has opened up the bottom of that strike zone see first pitch strikes from shield that's definitely beneficial DeShields when he get opens up the lower part he sets up his changeup sets up that low fastball that you can't knock then lay off of that changeup down below there's alive yeah as opposed to the Royals who threw the fewest walks Oakland threw the most 586 first in baseball someone with a good slider slider that goes down or some of the really good changeup that low fastball strike is something that sets up that pitch three of the last four strikeouts by James Shields have been pitches taken by the Oakland Athletics there's the change-up right down in the dirt move too far down to get him to fish taking that pitch almost like they know it's coming Shields has gotten his control back he's making those pitches those fastball pitches Ned Yost said before the game we give James Hill to lead he will hold it that's the kind of pitcher he is looking for his second straight 1-2-3 inning Chris Boggs time that's that backdoor slider he wants a pitch that he can throw for strike that appears to be a ball so you get just looking back to a Cuddy checked his swing did not go [Applause] says bill welke a clear that Yost doesn't agree then I've been watching games all season the check swing has been one of the biggest differences in the game it has been called early and often but not here by wealthy outside three and two shields on his delivery he'll just drop his head away Jeremy Guthrie for the Royals also does that almost like they drop it towards first base to clear that shoulder to release the baseball to check again he's punched out to end the fifth James Shields and the Royals through four and a half feet routed to don't miss the action tomorrow night in the NL wild-card game as the San Francisco Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates battle it out turn into ESPN at 8:00 o'clock Eastern Time for his pitch around 807 here is Mike Moustakas who takes a breaking ball over for a strike Moustakas again the a shift but he beat the shift his first time single into left [Applause] that's the chip that we were talking about 74 of us hits the center or right only 22 left but first time up tonight yeah look at the AL computers here left fielder Sam Fuld might be a little bit pinching the line and everybody else is definitely straight away in the out there went the other way again Fuld retreating and makes the play think sometimes it must be boring for Sam Fuld when it's just a routine play this is a guy who's filled up the highlight reels in the course of his career he won't even get in the top 25 tonight unless something happened and he paid the price earlier this year he for the first time in his career because he's run into a lot of walls but when he was playing with Minnesota crashed into the wall and missed about 30 games with a concussion talking about that yesterday because you he has seen players all the time with the concussion-like symptoms and he said no I knew right away said the headache and the accompanying symptoms and then all you can do is wait for them to go away looking 32 games Lester has definitely found his curveball using that very effectively now sometimes all it takes is a catcher who knows you and sees from the bench that you're not throwing some of the pitches that he's accustomed to calling when he's in there high chopper up the middle wow he's got a hurry and he gets us khabar by a step to down the way they run don't you feel like the Royals are just tailgating you at all times there's a guy right behind you in the car objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear all of the postseason with mlb.com at bat the number one app for live baseball highlights scores live radio broadcasts replay reviews and more get the at bat app nori Aoki [Applause] reached on a fielder's choice in the first stole a base and scored a run grounded to short in the third gnorga no Ventura is in the pen he's a starting pitcher on this roster for moments like this getting ready in case needed in the sixth inning I think what he's up for is that I don't think they'd bring him in because he's a starting pitcher in the middle of an inning they've now decided that they've gotten far enough that a guy like Fincher who's going to start at some point if they move past here and wind is just getting some throwing in because they probably told him today do not throw just stay in the bullpen and once we get past the fifth then he can go and get loose a little but I don't think he's going to give you getting ready to come in the ball game not the way shields thrown I talked to Ned Yost about him being on the roster the other day and he said look we only threw in for Sunday and as soon as we knew where we were going to go that which is home to host this game if we need him we'll put him there but to your point and you're the guy who's been out there he could be the x-factor for Ned Yost if they do move on because of his stuff close the hundred mile an hour fastball western misses again two balls and two strikes [Applause] you know all the ins and out of hit you but I'm watching him out there and you throw on the side you work at a frantic pace and 50 L right because it seemed like he's trying to get loose and trying to get ready I definitely could be wrong it's just the way that Shields is throwing three outs gets it to that magic point you want with that three-headed bullpen that you have but you're right maybe if something happens where they need a rare to come in and just throw that good fastball for one out why not take the chance just a little nubber over there toward third and Josh Donaldson put that in his pocket we are through five in the wild-card game on CBS [Music] tonight's 2014 al wild card is presented by Budweiser sippin right along here in KC haze got on the board and at first with two the Royals have answered with three one in the first two in the third and James Shields goes to work in the top half of the sixth inning he has set down the last seven s he's faced Sam Fuld leads it off you can handle the bat and stalk us in just on the grass at third it's almost like Shields has decided you're not gonna swing anything close okay here it comes I'm starting to throw strikes be ready shattered his bat and the bloopers gonna fall leadoff single fourfold here in the six let's go down to Matt Winer irony there are thousands of fans here who have never seen a post game post Series game in Kansas City before some of whom weren't alive the last time the Royals played a playoff game rich Burstein is not one of those folks but it has been a long drought more than a third of his 87 years since there was last a postseason game here in Kansas City City he is the season ticket holder since the franchise began back in 1969 what has kept you coming back all these years Belov a baseball and the love of the team here I really do love it a baseball fan over nearly three decades of drought here with the playoffs did you think you'd see this day yes why were you so sure oh I was bound to happen bound to happen times when I fell down about it but it was bound abwehr they've worked too hard on this team what does this day mean to you and everybody else here this game it's just the re-emergence of the Royals we're back back for good I would think so it's not it's not a one-time thing enjoy it rich and very very much let's send it back up DJ I thank you very much Matt big spot in this game at the top half of the sixth inning leadoff hitter gets on for Oakland and Josh Donaldson 29 home runs 98 runs batted in but one of Bob Melvin's hunches is paid off two hits for Sam Fuld now [Applause] one one misses two balls and one strike well it's the biggest pitch of the game you're facing the best hitter that the Oakland Athletics have to one count guy with the best power on the team other than Adam Dunn will they acquired and late August back with a cutter I thought he'd go changeup here [Applause] huge cut from Donaldson fouled it back two balls and two strikes him Salvador Perez wants a word with his pitcher got three shot of Bob Melvin Mike Gallego and Josh Donaldson it's interesting if you listen to a lot of people around American League Salvador Perez is emerging as the Yadier Molina here in the American League not only Weig college calls pitches his durability but also his way of controlling pitchers with four-seam fastball on the outside corner here for Town Donaldson struck out his first time singled in the third now pictures that play now in the third inning one loss lined out the first into a double play he's had a putting rally in that in it there goes the runner pitch is outside doesn't matter they're first in circle this last pitch was away sometimes the catcher will steal it from the umpire because they get up to make that throw to second but good call by home plate umpire Phil Miller Ned Yost is going to the bullpen James Shields works into the sixth inning the flame-throwing Yordano Ventura coming on James Shields departs here in the 6th with the Royals leading the A's 3 to 2 but Oakland has runners at first and second and they are responsibilities of James Shields and you two were right I was completely wrong they're bringing in the young Ventura and looked like Shields or Ned Yost's did not want shields to face Moss whose hit a home run off and of course in the first inning of this game or Reddick who's been red-hot against them in the month of August Brandon Moss two-run homer in the first lined into a double play in the third phases the rookie or Dona Ventura 99 miles an hour 31 games for Ventura 30 of those or starts it can be wild 69 walks is the most on the staff that's why I thought it'd be hard to bring him into this situation all the talent in the world feisty personality can't get better stuff than young Ventura but the walks are a problem in this inning Kelvin Herrera part of that shut him down triumvirate it includes Wade Davis Greg Holland but right now it's all on the shoulders of 23 year old Ventura in the air to centerfield and pretty well hit Lorenzo Cain is back it has no chance Brandon Moss has done it again straightaway centerfield three-run shot in the A's have believed [Applause] caracals it's too big leak it who knows it's coming they dial it up a notch he's got all kinds of power to Center to left center field to right he just squares it up and sends it out of center field really quickly a great swing it's these kind of games where managers get out of their box and do things that they haven't done all season long and you expect the players to excel in a place they haven't all year long venture relieved once right before the all-star break in a sixth inning situation but that's certainly not here on September 30 the reaction from the Oakland dugout and for James Shields three two lead becomes a five three deficit and venturous been rattled by the Oakland three run homer fallen behind 2 and O 2 heretic in his postseason debut [Applause] [Music] Brandon Moss is personally quieted this crowd twice that we good at bath today obviously the two homers but he's also lined out the first [Applause] well Ron you it you have counted it down in the innings leading up to this Pierce is where shields ears here where the Royals are need this many outs to get it to the shutdown guys in the seventh eighth and ninth but the sixth has been a trouble spot with Reddick singling that's three hits in a walk here in the sixth in a long ball by Brandon Moss Dave Eiland as the Royals pitching coach [Applause] Jeff Samardzija he's having a nice smile now seeing that home run by moss and what part he'll play for the Athletics one of their four great starters there's Sonny gray and Scott Kasmir shields almost beside himself Ventura had only allowed one home run in his last 10 starts and that came in the season finale against the White Sox Marcus Semien took him deep and then this by Brandon Moss two home runs five runs batted in here in the wild-card game [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that ball goes all the way to the screen [Applause] you know you're just asking and it's in my opinion now you're asking a young man to do something that he's never done and on this stage it's very difficult to have success that way if you're gonna go with the three guys that we talked about for Herrera Davis and Holland somehow get those outs from that those three guys because they've been there they're used to pitch in with men on base they're used to the big stage maybe not the post-season stage but they used to the big stage two balls and a strike to Jed Lowry in the air to right playable for ROP there's the tag its second and sliding into third is Josh Reddick let's go down to Matt Winer well Ernie there's a lot of baseball to go here in this wild-card game but at this result were to hold up the image of James Shields walking off the mound is very likely the last you'll see of him in a Kansas City Royals uniform Royals knew that Shields would become a free agent at the end of this season when they acquired him last year today Dayton Moore the general manager of the Kansas City Royals was asked about the possibility of keeping em he said winning is attracted yes but quote were not going to be big players in the free agent market in other words they're likely to be much bigger offers shield to the season s where I thank you very much Matt insurer has electric stuff but that Yost is called the plug will be back this copyrighted telecast is presented by authority of the office of the Commissioner of baseball and may not be reproduced or retransmitted in any form and the accounts and descriptions of this game may not be disseminated without expressed written consent top half of the sixth inning continuing here in Kansas City and been a pivotal inning for the Oakland A's they've plated three and have another one 90 feet away in Kelvin Herrera enters the game for Kansas City he faces Stephen Vogt infield in for the Kansas City Royals who were down two and trying to keep the deficit right there only a hundred miles an hour on that first pitch from Herrera [Applause] vote has walked and been called out on strikes this is a situation if you're Oakland you could take a chance on a contact play with the infield in but watching the lead the Donaldson does not look like the contact plays on they're gonna allow the next two hitters to have a chance to drive the run in well Bob Melvin told us he would use the contact play only if he had a runner on that if the runner on third was caught had enough speed to get the second base back in scoring position vote is not that man I in a way and threw balls in one strike [Applause] so James Shields works into the sixth allows a hit in the walk and Ned Yost met with Ventura normally a starter out of the pen in the sixth and he couldn't get it done three one homer he allowed but Brandon Moss and Redick with a single wild pitch got into second Y ball got into third and that's where we stand five three eggs there needs a strikeout here popped up over there behind third and it's going to drift down a play that's one of those Californian fielder do you catch it I mean one out your backs to the play as Moustakas was and not even sure if she should you make that play because ready put it tied up tagged up sorry to tag up on all foul walls myriad and watch the play pretty intently because you can fall into the stands you can get caught up down the line we'll be moving away from home plate just give you a chance to score run good battle going on here between vote and Herrera as he fouls off at 99 mile an hour fastball [Applause] votes a guy who came up with Tampa Bay and when he was called up when over 25 with a race didn't get his first hit in the big leagues till he went to Oakland that's popped up and there is who makes the play big out do down low arrow didn't try anything fancy just kept everything from the letters up on vault at that at-bat it's a big out right there they have to keep it within two runs right here been a long half inning here with Oakland batting and Jon Lester staying loose in the A's dugout here's Derek Norris [Applause] when loris has been one of the more clutch players for the athletics all year 330 hitter with runners in scoring position rounded up the middle and three and another run for the Oakland A's driven in by Derek Norris big two-out hit scoring Josh red again now it is six to three what a huge at-bat cow went up there likes the swing at the fastball has a nice short quick swing can see right into the ground right up the middle a four-run sixth inning as Oakland on top six three [Applause] and I'll tell you this too guys we've given a lot of attention to how strong that Kansas City bullpen is down the stretch seven eight nine Oakland ain't shabby and you got Jon Lester still on the in-control ready to go out for the bottom of the six well I think we talked about the Royals bullpen because it was a three-headed monster that could come in and shut you down but the thing about the A's bullpen is we concentrated more on Lester because let's just kind of guy I can go seven or eight innings can go 125 130 pitches he might get it the baseball right to Doolittle up the middle again Escobar can't get the ball out of his glove in there at first and second tremendous stop by the Royals shortstop but could not get the force another one of those topspin balls up the middle he shows is great range by getting to it but just can't get it out of his glove to make that counter flip the second and they knew once the first time he couldn't get his hand on the baseball correctly he knew he was not going to have a play so so Gard reaches with his first hit of the night Norris is its second and here is Coco Crisp pop of the Oakland order as the A's have batted around here in the sixth and there's a shot to Center and that's going to score another run here comes Norris he'll score easily standing up and it is 7 to 3 [Applause] the Athletics fan has been waiting two months to see this ballclub this is the ballclub that they saw early in the year the first half when they would just bunch hit after hit after hit they were considered one of the top offenses for the first half which got them out there to their best record they just keep coming at you and they can hit the fastball Sam Fuld to the plate 10th a to hit in the inning he let it off with a single and scored a run on that three-run homer by Brandon Moss [Applause] oh and to to the yeas left field it is to 90 mile an hour changeup there from Kelvin Herrera look out let go of the bat there's a runner's more emotion on the o2 pitch well Bob Melvin and the Oakland Athletics playing a little Kansas City Royals baseball sometimes lost in this inning with the big home run by Moss is that when Sam Fuld after he had the hit he was running on that three pitch 3 2 pitch to Donaldson that was called the ball outside of the zone to be called a strike he would been thrown out on second and this ending would have been over that was a risk I thought that was a risk at the time but let foul past first the shields could either throw the change-up or a fastball could get to a strikeout count and then you run yourself out of an inning but that's the way Oakland A's plays aggressive baseball they'll take the stolen base when it's there they'll put their guys in in position and they have the confidence that if it's not a strike they'll take the walk let's chip Hale to Bob Melvin's left his right-hand man another Oh to the hauled and Herrera blows him away but here in the 6th inning boss struck again and he went to straightaway center the age seven three [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Jon Lester now working with a four-run lead 7 to 3 nose to work here in the bottom half of the sixth in Kansas City [Applause] Lorenzo head falls behind Owen - in case you're wondering in his career when he's given a three-run lead three runs or more Jon Lester 85 and one [Applause] but number provided to us by our ace statistician Helga Leela invest in the business know what the seven runs does is you can't really slug your way back in they don't have the homerun power we still have to somehow manufacture runs but they can't take a bunch of chances either now they got a pick away though it's if they can a run here a run there maybe get to the bullpen but it's gonna be tough off Lester ministers legacy just keeps growing and growing doesn't it axe asked about pitching a postseason game said it's no big deal like any other game well I guess it is to him was reading what he had to say going into this game and it's big volumes hit a focus that you need in postseason baseball because he wasn't looking big picture if I can get through this part is I want to win this pitch I want to win this inning [Applause] which cane on the grounder to short one down it was pitch to pitch hitter to hit her ending to any it is golf's most exclusive event the 2014 PGA Grand Slam of golf it all starts Tuesday October 14th at 4 o'clock Eastern and Pacific on TNT Ron darling who shot a 74 the other day but they can only have four there is the major champion well that's a 9 hole record isn't it Ernie there is Eric Hosmer [Applause] right at soulguard two-up and two-down as as Jon Lester settled in or won and you think back to last year's postseason he was four and one in five starts PRA of a buck-and-a-half and won two games in the World Series they are as tenacious as tough as they come and a guy who lives for a stage like this and even though Kansas City got to him early his teammates picked him up with that huge 6th inning and now he is settled into a groove discovering his curveball has been a good good thing for him mixes his pitches also mixes in the cutter and also the four seam fastball there's another example of it right there occasionally when Jon Lester gets into this groove it's almost like he's a pitcher who has the ball on a string I mean that's what it makes it look like [Applause] Billy Butler waiting on a tow to was the four-seamer away now he's up there a lot of players around baseball will say he's got the presence of a Felix Hernandez Kershaw all of those guys big-game pitchers strikes out Butler and has set down the last 10 boils he's faced six innings in the books and the A's nine outs away let's take a look at tonight's playmakers presented by the all-new Chrysler 200 no question Brandon Moss hit a couple of balls about a mile and a half two home runs five runs batted in on the night he will come to the plate second in this inning and Josh Donaldson takes a strike from Kelvin Herrera [Applause] they had a machine to gauge bat speed Donaldson's got to be up there isn't he pound for pound generates about as much bat speed as anyone in the game he didn't get cheated if the guys playing on a bad knee yesterday's workout for the team they trying to find out where he was he's he'll be in the trainer's room most of the day today and tomorrow to get ready for the night this is what the o2 [Applause] the Oakland A's who was touch-and-go down the stretch at one point in August they're 28 games over 500 and then things started unraveling where the month of September became very interesting they went from six games up on the Los Angeles Angels to twelve games down at some point busted trying to stay in the groove we're gonna Nick Punto yesterday at the day's work out and he just he said you know what it's really two words new season and that's and that's the mindset you have to have it doesn't matter how you got there you're there and now everybody starts fresh well he would know every time to come to the postseason Nick Punto is in it he might be with another team but he's in it he was with the Dodgers last year Cardinals couple years ago twins before that two and two Herrera strikes him out to begin the seventh Kansas City fan here comes public enemy number one we had talked about Brandon Moss after before and after the trade of Yoenis Cespedes before the all-star break 21 homers and 66 runs batted in after the Cespedes trade which was run at the deadline at the end of July two home runs and nine runs batted in those home runs coming in consecutive games September 14th and 16th he seemed to be the guy most affected by the trade of Cespedes but here it's a new season you wipe the slate clean and day off and go get him he changes the whole equation for the Oakland Athletics if he's hitting the way he did in the first half what would enemy number one he won't be able to stay on the Missouri side of the Missouri now have to stay in the Kansas side when they come into play first days player with five runs batted in in a postseason game they got him there [Applause] but he did his damage earlier that's for sure two outs here in the seventh you know what makes you feel old two guys Brandon Moss used to watch Brandon Moss played a little league ball in Loganville Georgia when my son's team would play his son's team and luckily he never hit a ball that hard off my kid he said almost 900 feet of home runs in this game Josh Reddick and Brandon Moss another contingent on this Oakland team from Boston both signed by the same Scout robb English [Applause] there's Josh Reddick [Applause] Redick Moss Lowry Lester on and on for the Athletics Red Sox connection Cocco of course [Applause] it still looks right just they don't think people all of us thinking about the trade that it would have that much more effect on the offense that it would actually make them go into that much of a collapse I'm sure Billy Beane didn't think that either and Bob Mel when I heard about it I thought it was the greatest thing ever because you are building you know for the postseason but you're also strengthening your team with that frontline starter but the dynamic of having someone with presence in that third spot you know or the third or fourth spot where it puts everybody else in their slots it is quite possible when you lose that then everybody else feels that they have to do more they can ride a little harder they swing a little harder they think they have to hit more home runs and then they get themselves into a rut bounce up the middle and off the glove of Omar Infante and Reddick is on for the two-out single so in a strange way Cal maybe that trade you're talking about made the Oakland Athletics a little weaker over the 162 game schedule which they proved over the last two months but have made them dynamite if they can get through here and on to the Angels I think that's probably the logic is that how do we give ourselves a better chance to go further in the playoffs and there are type types of pitchers that you want to ride when you get to the playoffs ones that can take it into their own hands and continue to pitch under the pressure and Lester is the marquee player for that Jed Lowrie checked his swing and want to know gonna Lester Jonny Gomes coming to the A's and Cespedes is the only kind of player that the Red Sox are gonna take to give up a guy like Lester and of course season hero from last year Jonny Gomes but you have Sonny gray will pitch the last game of the Year this year throws a nine inning shutout you got Jeff Samardzija who he got from the Cubs who was a number one number one a kind of pitcher but doesn't have postseason experience so it's gonna be interesting let's see how he adapts this man is DAP tonight he's entire career [Applause] Moreira came on in the sixth in relief of Yordano Ventura who had come on in relief of James Shields the game imploded Moustakas made the sky now they made they set a record for the noise made at Arrowhead last night he's going to take a real uprising here at the K tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we welcome you back the ALDS on TBS presented by t-mobile right now it's scenario two that would apply if the A's win it's Tigers and Orioles at six days and angels at 9:30 if the Royals come back you saw the start times for that now Alex Gordon leads it off in the bottom half of the seventh and there's a lot of work for the Kansas City Royals to do and Alex comes out swinging there's no sense in taking fall behind Oh 102 you're gonna have to hit yourself back into this game oh and two from Lester who is retired the last 10 Boyles he's faced they got tools were running the first two in the third there's a strike three Paul Gordon strikes out for the second time tonight and his own for three so fellas we talked about the two runs in the third but since then it's been nothing doing against Jon Lester and for the Oakland bats just when you needed it most in a very critical inning the sixth before Kansas City could load up their big three seventh eighth and ninth they believed this game open but well to me the two swings Brandon Moss has changed his game the Oakland Athletics are a team that are going to take a lot of pitches but to push the pitch count of shields up then they're gonna hit try to hit balls out of the ballpark which Brandon Moss has done and at some point the trade they made this summer that we talked about for Jon Lester he would pitch their most important game after final two months that were tough yeah the world's couldn't get past that Bridge inning that would have almost guaranteed them a win and on the other side of that Lester struggled a little bit for him but then found it with his off-speed curveball and then he's been spot on after that and we talked before that for the Royals to win this game Shields had to get it to the big three in the bull pen he couldn't Ned Yost chose to go with the starting pitcher all season you're down over chin Ventura and he could see when Ventura came in that you know like most young pitchers you want to come in and throw a thousand he kept behind - and Owen Moss made impact a ball and two strikes to the Royals catcher Salvador Perez we labeled at the corner and Miss count even it's always much easier to talk about a decision after it's happened but if you look at it you think okay couple choices you'll go with James Shields to get you there or maybe you expand the role of the big three out there to ask him to get one more out than they normally do Josh Donaldson had a nice play on a tricky hop and threw out Perez for the second out well Lester early on did not have his good stuff I think he was trying to get a lot of the hitters to chase bad pitches but after that he found his breaking ball and things have completely changed I don't know if it's because solos that hurt and Derek Norris had to come in his almost like personal catcher that changed Lester around I'm sure John who did most of it but it doesn't hurt to have a guy who's caught you all year and understands what you're about Omar Infante shortened up as if to bunt and Donaldson on the dead run is playing well back look at this stretch Ronnie where Lester has we taught retired 12 in a row got four of those by strikeouts lots of ground balls had a soft liner to third and really nothing hard-hit well you had two different kind of personality of pitchers coming in a big game James Shields who talked about being the adrenaline junkie loving to be in certain moments loving to try to aspire to those great moments and Jon Lester who said just about nothing and said I'm just gonna concentrate on every pitch concentrate on everything and just try to get the most out sigh can a bushel of outs behind the mound fill that basket is doing it pretty well so far in front a bugs back toward the mound and investor that's wrong may have hit Infante or maybe it was just a problem with vote trying to catch that and we'll see if he was in lay in the lane or if he was running on the infield grass we'll get a good look usually want to hit her bunts here Cal he'll be on the grass for the most part but you see Infante at the very end seems to get as close as you can to that runners Lane he's all kidding all right for sure on that I mean when you do lead an angle from the right-hander's batter's box you do have to get in that Lane and in that Lane is on the line and so he was directly coming to first base he was well within you'll see a lot of runners intentionally go into the grass and get in the way but clearly he made the right attempt at a base runner he was just on the line which he's entitled to it's a hit for Infante here in the seventh with two out [Applause] and here's Moustakas [Applause] Royall said that the bunt was going to be a big play for them in this ball game first one comes in the seventh [Applause] or early on they had the luxury of playing for one or maybe two runs now they find themselves down for Moustakas to left and full puts it away and that'll do it for Kansas City in the seventh get a runner on can't move him and things at 7/3 don't miss the action tomorrow night in the NL wild-card game as the Giants and Pirates battle it out at PNC tune in to ESPN 8 o 7 p.m. Eastern Time and I am certain that the atmosphere in Pittsburgh will be just like it was a year ago when they ended the long drought great place for to watch a ballgame and then in that setting it was just tremendous it was exciting it was exciting here s an eye on the crowd has totally taken out of the game Wade Davis on the pitch and coaxes that lazy flyball out of Stephen the vote for the first down this is not the these are not the circumstances that Ned Yost wanted to see he'll be Herrera and Wade Davis working under what was interesting you see Wade Davis's numbers had one of the best seasons a George Brett told Matt Winer earlier and nathan and guys had in the history of the game just crazy numbers 5 to 1 on strikeouts 2 walks but right now that decision to go out and take shields out it's almost like he almost asked shields field was alright but the right arm came up quick for Ventura there's Derek Norris when you look at some of the deals the the Royals have made it headed to date more he's made some good he's made some good deals you make you swing that and people looked at the will Meyers D as a boy how can he give up this guy look at the potential he has he get James Shields back he get Wade Davis back that'll be easy for Escobar make a deal and get Escobar in pain when it reads that Greinke so a lot of the guys you've seen who have put this team into the postseason were some pretty shrewd deals with some big names involved and this team's on the map for a while even with the James Shields might not become back because of impending free agency you've got a kid Maria you've got Finnegan's on the roster here who's going to be someone that's gonna pitch and start for this world with ballclub Danny Duffy who had a nice year they're here to stay good young ballclub good defense tons of speed there you build with from within and they've done it the right way and they will come together then you have something to build around and so when you lose a piece down now and then you can replace that nice no balls and a strike to Eric's so guard the Oakland second baseman [Music] there's a guy who's hit two homeruns Brandon Moss right now on the mound for Kansas City a guy who hasn't given up a home run in ages and Wade Davis and back to the 2013 season and the strike got a so guard gives way Davis a 1-2-3 inning middle of the age at the cave lay postseason showdown throughout October simply picked the winners of head-to-head player matchups between say Detroit and Baltimore for your chance to win a pair of 2015 season tickets for your favorite team good deal go to mlb.com slash showdown two player right now bottom half of the eighth inning top of the Kansas City order and a tough task in front of them they're down 7 to 3 to Jon Lester I mean they know this might sound boring to some people as the rally caps have come out but your job as a especially a starting pitcher reliever - it's at some point you get your mechanics to a point we cut where you become almost like the mechanical man and that's where Jon Lester is when he's got it going rounded up the middle and under the glove of Lowery and in the center field infielders crossed there and neither could love it and there's a leadoff where I'll see the Seska ball and if you're the Royals you thinking you got to start somewhere here's a chopper over the mound here and the speed of Escobar began forces that shallow angle and maybe a desperate attempt to play this ball on the run ball stays down you know they gave him an error on that play and I don't know him even if he gloves it with Escobar's speed I don't know if they throw him out yeah I disagree with the ball I think they didn't he the guy in charge of making these belts he's got his Dobler down here in Kansas City here's our open you know as I watched luster can't help but remind me of Andy pettite Andy Pettitte establishes his cutter inside but also had a good fastball he would use and also mixing his breaking ball which I always thought made him much more effective and it's the same kind of mentality on the mound also I hope you had a good cut fouled it straight back [Applause] both those two guys are rocks on the mound they don't get flustered and they don't have it they find it so new Pregerson getting loose I was just about to make the point as the inning began that I saw movement in the Oakland dugout on an Oakland bullpen somebody across their legs that's all we had seen but now somebody's up and getting loose in its Gregerson as the runner goes and the flow is high and then Escobar had to make sure he held the bag stolen base here in the eighth well the Royals were saying before the game Jon Lester does not throw over so with a four-run lead probably can even guess I have a better chance of guessing that he's not coming over again another runner past the base and having to reach back all then fielders in baseball in today's game stay with the tag the two one by three balls and one strike when the world's plan all along was to take him out of his tempo by creating havoc on the base pass even down seven to three I'm still employing that strategy the second soulguard nice backhand throws them out as Escobar moves on to third but if you have a guy like Lester on the mound Cal and Arnie I think that you know the temperature doesn't go up you don't even pay attention to Escobar get a 7-3 lead here I'm just gonna get hitters out and he gets yogi out there I mean no big deal Escobar can dance as much as he wants now the game tied whole different case she's the first time the Royals have had a runner in scoring position since the third inning it was in the third that Kansas City took a 3-2 lead in this game after falling behind two when a five-run sixth has did an Oakland the lead that's down low to Lorenzo Cain which pound is excellent for Jon Lester first inning a tough inning and 23 after that more Lester like Lester has made 32 starts between Boston and Oakland and there's a base hit up the middle base pair alone and it's 7 before back to Lester and those starts 32 between the two teams combined in it 27 of those he's thrown at least 100 pitches right here just a simple fastball away he stays true up to big part in the field proved he could hit that cutter down the third-base line earlier in the game Lester makes the adjustment so does he he's gotten three balls hit on the ground to open hits here from the Royals here's Eric Osman who has a home run in his career off of Lester it blends into one here we got ourselves an interesting bottom half of the eighth-inning Escobar who is 11 for 11 from the seventh inning on came the same 16 of 18 from the seventh inning on stealing a base [Applause] Taine's getting off beer and bigger on his lead almost daring him to throw over grounded foul past first ball on a strike Cosmo walked his first time singled in the third the knock in a run grounded out to second in the sixth he was thrown out of the plate in a wasted scoring opportunity in the first inning by the lawyers runner going grounded divorced and asked for a minute Gerry Davis standing right on the line made the call on a ball that one off the glove of Stephen vote and Ned Yost we'll come out remember it's where the ball is does it go over the bag inside the bag Jerry Davis has 31 years missus is 120 third game in the postseason the problem you have it looks like it could have been fair but Stephen Vogt does not move on first base so when he got off that bag he gets off only inches away so when he dove almost half of his body was in foul territory and that play is not reviewable being in front of the base correct he's not reviewable and it's the right call I mean almost the whole body of vote is in foul territory yes he did it did his glove on it to the fans I'm sure it looks like a fair ball because he touched it that's a deceiving angle though on the replay like to see one looking down the first base line down loan with the one-two pitch in the count even there's a lot of hope and wishful thinking on that ball well when you're down like this against a good pitcher you need a break when they're going the throw and he's in there Enzo Kane steals the base and the count pulled Eric Hosmer can't really blame Derek Norris the jump and the lead by Kane that just so large there's no chance for him even with a perfect throw like this to get Kane [Applause] you watch pain at second base now that they've closed the gap a little they steal third base and bunches to the Kansas City Royals being on third with one out is a whole different at-bat for Ozma down 7 3 when the inning started they have played aggressive ball here in the eighth Hosmer just does stay alive Escobar stole a base and scored a run Cain has stolen second [Applause] was with one third which led the majors this Royals team part of their than their toughness and resiliency there at first and second with one out and one in and Billy Butler coming to the plate and the big guy will represent the tying run doesn't look like Jon Lester will have a chance to pitch to it [Music] [Applause] [Applause] that'll be it seven and a third he leaves with the lead and he leaves with the Royals trying to rally Jon Lester's night is through he leaves with a seven to four lead with a couple of guys on here's another look at that ball that Kozma hit down the line was ruled a foul ball it's impossible for us to tell I was saying that because of the way vote does not get off first that his body is inside the zone but remember the first base umpire it's usually the call the home plate umpire before first but it seemed like Jerry Davis made the call and if he did they stand right on the line and they could see the ball as if it to their left in the middle of their body or to their right then again to the point when you get into a situation like that you looking at the ball in relation to the bag you're not looking at the fielder they're still being and well he's still in fair territory touch it when they touch the ball if it was if it was foul as Jerry Davis saw and that's the call he made another fine season for Luke Gregerson they're right-handed reliever you'll see mostly cutters and sliders six home runs he's given up this season and those 72 plus inning for work well the tying run is at the plate in the person of Billy Butler the dominantly a sinker baller comes out with a slider on the first pitch Jon Lester hoping the bullpen can bail him out of this Jam in the right-center field that's going to be down for a hit and it's going to score room when Joe came and it's a seven to five game Willie bumpers knocked in a couple of runs tonight well nice hitting off Gregerson you're going to see you'll see cutters and sliders if you're right-handed hitter how do you defeat that hit the ball to the right side beautiful hitting by Billy Butler one of the fastest guys in baseball has been called on the pinch run as putler after knocking in to run takes his seat and there's Terrance gore Terrence door has five pieces and five tries and he scored five runs since his September call-up so boys at first Gordon at the plate and Hosmer standing out bird the wars are within two go on the moon the throne it's taken seven innings for the Kansas City Speed game to come into play in this game right back in it he didn't waste any time stealing that back Dyson you want a big steel you said myself and gone speed it do what we do Borden's the royals leader in RBIs and there are two guys out there for him the ball gets away almost impossible play for Derek Norris to make that slider swerve of Granderson bounces almost before the plate just past it and the seventh wild pitch by Gregor's in the season that will fly home we'll tie the game [Music] oh my god abyss I think when you have Gore on third base you've got Perez on deck and he has struggled in the second half what better time to try the contact plate got the best speed in baseball missed out slide we came to the bottom of the eighth in a seven-to-three game with Jon Lester on the mound please have changed now Ronnie the contact play is a risky play because you're officially going on contact with a guy hits a line drive at any one of the positions you run yourself out of the inning normally you do that when you're up or maybe you take a chance when you're at a tie game very rarely do you do that even the place this kind of speed with a guy on third base you have two shots to drive them in right now you do and they have been so great with less than two outs got from third their second at baseball a second American League Lion Toronto driving in the runner from third and Western to us but we're talking about a track and field man this the Oakland Athletics were talking about Verve Washington almost at third-base I'm not saying it's not a replay that he reads off of it but a full blown contact play has it moving in the direction on the swing almost and the risk is that you can get doubled off and you don't have that other chance [Music] individual little postseason drama huh love it he reads a high chopper or full-swing but that's the kind of plate he can go on he's got to make the ball downstairs call for Furstenberg you never intentionally want to put to a winning run on but he was not given in to Gordon in that situation he's got a runner it's got a pro hitter up Perez who's the guy that can hit the ball in the ballpark on a tremendous first half as he was an all-star but also a guy who get it into a double play and so you see Lowry and so guard at DoublePlay depth Salvador Perez is open three now if you're the middle infielders you're thinking okay let's turn any ground ball into a double play not a whole lot of speed at home plate with your Josh Donaldson down to third I got to make a decision ball comes to me quickly I still can get a double play or do I need to take the out at home plate Perez 22 grounded into double plays this year and he's behind no balls and two strikes Dan Otero saw him do little loosening in the Oakland bullpen list the situation I know the game has changed and the strikeout doesn't matter as much as an out but it does here you need to put the ball in play give yourself a chance to score this run Gordon going strike three two out Gordon steals second standing up but a chance with a fly ball of any depth there what had scored Terran score by I think cow described it right I don't think stop Noah Perez cut down in his swing at all he had one swing he wanted to try to hit the ball in the gap or out of the ballpark and Gregerson was not going to give him anything to hit now here's omar infante runners are at second and third in a one-run game and funny at 66 RBIs a career-high in the regular season [Applause] [Music] for stolen bases by the Royals listening to get back into it of the three outfielders sampled and left Josh Reddick and right tremendous arms vocal crisp accurate that doesn't have the same arm as those two outfielders all in a strike to the Royals second basement Josh Reddick on the right considered to maybe have one of the best arms in baseball koklos been around forever an accurate arm and Sam Fuld known although with his two hits tonight no mostly for his defensive prowess [Applause] and Josh can sneak in a little bit a little bit closer of being on the off side and right field almost to anticipate if he gets a base hit he'll have a shot of throwing out run a home plate and backin Gregerson ahead all in two strikes there's some pitchers that set up their pitches move the ball in and up up and down Luke Gregerson does one thing and he does it well he droves you that pitch that looks like a fastball and it cuts or slides on the outside parts of the right handers get based on the swing so far you have to get another breaking ball here and you have to hit the ball to up the middle or to the right side off Gregerson well that should be your approach one more hit the ball at the end of the bat in the school he needs make the adjustment to protect against the breaking ball struck him out Infante goes down swinging back-to-back strikeouts for Gregerson the Royals scored three but leave the tying run 90 feet away we head to the ninth [Music] tonight's 2014 a a wild card is presented by Budweiser man well the eighth-inning changed a lot in this game 7 to 3 game became a 7 to 6 game as we move to the 9th and Greg Holland on for the Royals placing the top of the Oakland order Coco Crisp ran up the Bunton mystic Owen walk Hollins numbers unbelievable I told you at 40 plus saves 2 years in row the last person to do that was Dan Quisenberry in the early 80s right now the open a especially with crisp and fold I'm gonna try to play for a run saw the bunt by crisp then try to get on if he does fold will sacrifice him over play for a run [Applause] kriste singled and scored in the first also sealed in the sixth knocked in Iran as they a scored five runs and erased a 3-2 deficit Paulin has that unusual style when he gets in the stretch he'll taina take the ball out of the glove and show you almost like a magician see what I got in my hand and then it disappears nothing up my sleeve the fresco one ball two strikes now neither Ned Yost's team when they score four more runs this season 69 and 14 this should be one of the gate games they're skating on not so far crisp it goes down swinging to start the ninth the NBA on TNT returns with an opening night doubleheader when the champions the San Antonio Spurs take on the Dallas Mavericks followed by the Houston Rockets and the LA Lakers it all begins Tuesday October 28th only on TNT that'll be opening night of the NBA season this is opening night of baseball's postseason if we tie ourselves up dandy there in the ninth Sam Fuld has a couple of hits and scored a run what has happened with the second wild card it's done exactly what baseball's wanted it to do it's made the division so paramount paramount to winning gotta win the division the only problem you have for these wild card games these game sevens is that whoever loses this game it almost feels like you weren't in the postseason you didn't get a chance to play in a series you played in the game I can see that but I could also see the last month of the season as your playoff son and they that's created a lot of excitement a lot of opportunity you've creative almost extended your playoff baseball to include September and we'll set to one game one sixty threes didn't happen but almost the home team as fold pulls that one way foul will the home team in the wild-card game in the American League has never won we were there a couple of years ago when Texas lost at home to Baltimore last year Cleveland lost at home shut out by Tampa Bay and tonight Kansas City trailing Oakland they're at Kauffman another one in the dirt [Applause] two balls and two strikes like the only team the only home team to win the wild-card game was the Pirates last year the Pittsburgh fans retired just by chanting Cueto they changed the outcome of that game [Applause] disbelief [Applause] all under fold and he walked him Sam Fuld on for the third time tonight [Applause] column 1 of this fastball away does it hit the corner pitch track says no [Applause] there's Josh Donaldson well hit to left Gordon has plenty of room and makes the play for the second out [Applause] [Music] well here's the guy who's done most of the damage Brandon Moss two run homer in the first three run homer in the sixth we got two options here for Sam Fuld Brandon Moss having the Reggie Jackson night or should you steal a base 21 stolen bases this year and get in scoring position who mas has been in scoring position in the batter's box tonight I think I would go with hold hold your ground up and in and off the mid of Perez and that puts an insurance run at second [Applause] Perez charged with a pass ball well I didn't think of option number three for fold that was a pass ball a wild pitch Holland had nine of them this year but that ball right out of the glove of Perez and gets pulled into scoring position and that might effectively take the bat out of his hands right now he can pitch careful his first base being open three balls and no strikes and they will go ahead and put him on so runners at first and second [Applause] at Yost hoping that Greg Holland can keep this a one run game going to the bottom half of the ninth inning and give the Royals one more chance to advance small sample but it is off a closer and one of the best in baseball two to four Redick off Greg Holland mr. with the first one one another Sam Fuld is it second he walked with one out and passed a second on a pass ball and set up the intentional pass to Moss who leads from first [Applause] this one game is kind of like a snapshot of the last few weeks in the American League he's going to get in who's going to get knocked out it seems like so many undeserving but not everyone can go and especially for Oakland who look like a walk for the postseason and then had to scratch and claw their way into this game and it looked back way in this game as well balls in the dirt for as made the stop at Lester on the mound with a 7-3 lead in the eighth inning well if they hadn't given up those lungs with Moss had not had such a big day that's speed of the Kansas City Royals would have played it's plenty huge role in this game even despite being behind a run they're loaded Dave Eiland the pitching coach going to come out to calm down Holland not used to pitching in these situations at home used to pitching in a lot of tied games were very rarely coming in with his team behind Jed Lowrie is over for but he stands in here in the ninth with the bases loaded and two out in the air right field hockey is there and the Kansas City Royals escaped a bases-loaded jam they're worn down going to the bottom of the nine we'll be back [Applause] Budweiser is the official beer of Major League Baseball and presenting sponsor of tonight's American League wild card game great times are waiting grab some buds tonight's pivotal moment Luke Gregerson back-to-back strikeouts with the tying run at third in the bottom half of the eighth pin little moment up up grab some time great pitching by Gregerson top of the ninth josh Willingham bottom of the ninth just really had the pinch-hit from Mike Moustakas and Sean Doolittle the age closer is on he's certainly going to be on the line with your third baseman but certainly a shift here against Willingham second baseman so guard will move up the middle but the shortstop moving over to the hole this just seems like a normal shading beside they as your shift is everyone staying home except the left side of the interest so they must have some information he pulls the ball to the to the left side but he's still yet still claim true in the rest of the diamond a ball and two strikes Willingham started the season with the Minnesota Twins plate 68 games two littles numbers ten-to-one strikeout to walk ratio can't see Royals got Willingham to do one thing hit the ball out of the ballpark it falls for a hit and the tying run is on in the bottom half of the night sacr comes into play again the fear comes to rock Dyson good piece of hitting fighting off the fastball making sure you make contact good things can happen thought it might go for a double at first John wisely stops it first baseball game for the Royals is turned half baseball game half track and field meet they were about to watch the 90-foot dash [Applause] opposed to Lester the little will throw over Dyson nine for ten off left-handed pitchers stealing the season miss Guevara shortened up to point and took a strike on one and Dyson also has stolen the toughest bases to steal the seventh inning on he's got 22 stolen bases which leads the major league a lot of people can pile up stolen bases when they get in when they don't count Dyson gets in when they count their owns thirty six bags this year the pump is cabal right back to the mound do little go to first and the tying run moves up 90 feet a basehead and two sacrifices on the card for Escobar as he gets the job done not easy to bunt Doolittle at ninety four plus even though it's bunk back to the pitcher you don't have a play because Dyson has too much speed yeah you have much more margin for error with the speed on first so it doesn't have to be a perfect bunt just get it on the ground Grayson's got three straight years of at least 30 stolen bases first world to do that since Carlos Beltran and here's why okie 10 steals the third by Dyson this year very difficult to do though with a left-handed hitter up or more difficult to do why the catcher's got a free run no one blocking his vision to make that throw to Donaldson Kansas City fans having flashbacks and nightmares of the night when Joe Nathan picked Dyson off a second in a game down the stretch mic djursland third-base coach of the Kansas City Royals this is his first year in the big leagues and he's in a playoff game coaching bird he played 999 games in the minors and managed more than 2,000 and now he's in the bigs and you talk about a big moment here in Kansas City we had 162 games to practice I'm sure with Dyson on second and a base hit is usually waving that left arm Multi waiting on a one Olsen Doolittle no strikes we talked about disrupting the tempo of Leicester right now a closer likes to pick his leg up especially a power arm and throw that ball he's varying his motion home plate which does affect your release point and your tempo [Applause] well usually this matchup would favor Doolittle but a low-key the season 363 off left-handed pitching although that ball little cheap firm and fast for him to catch up on [Applause] the issue you have here is that sogar the second baseman has to keep the runner Dyson so close that there is a huge hole between vote and so far between first and second any kind of dribbler is a basehead there goes Dyson throw to third he is safe [Music] gets a good jump picks the right pitch they just did the inside move and you could see the signal that Dyson could also see from second base he was pretty confident it wasn't coming in as inside mode he was moving so fast he could start his slide about 20 feet from the bag now a flyball ties the game Winfield in [Applause] makes the catch but that's going to tie the game six but a reaction from that been straight path at that by ioki Dyson with the big steel who sent stolen bases on a big part of today's game Lorenzo Cain with a bullet too short glove by Lowry but we got three baseball boys go to the tent vault all [Applause] well the winner of this game gets the angels and we don't know yet who that's going to be you see the starting times on TBS for the Tigers and Orioles through whoever plays the angels the Royals or the A's on Thursday then alive what a game this is Bennett whoever does when attorney is going to earned it that's for sure changes defensively for the Kansas City Royals as we moved to the 10th Lorenzo Cain has moved from Center to right Jerrod Dyson scored the tying run is now in center field Jayson Nix is at third Brandon Finnegan is the new pitcher his 6th used by Ned Yost tonight he's just a kid and it throws a strike to Nate Fryman chains of the major leagues after 13 outings 13 in the minor leagues Heelys Kansas City's first round kick this June just this past June pitched in the College World Series for TCU and here he is in the playoffs that's the fast track boys and girls popped up behind second who launched it bison well this place is buzzin again it got a little bit quiet around the seventh-inning stretch but an eighth inning rally got him interested again and then tying the game in the ninth as everybody on their feet there's Derek Norris Finnegan had ten strikeouts in one walk in his seven innings of work hit sharply but look at Infante we came into this game talking about Jon Lester and James Shields neither is going to be a factor in this game it's been opens power against Kansas City speed and we're all tied up [Music] also I think it's ironic they started Geovany Soto to control the running game he gets hurt Derek Norris comes in and then running the running his rampant here in the last couple innings the reason they won the wild card no one could control their running game Nick burns open shooting here in the tenth and takes a strike from Finnegan Finnegan's only 21 years old what admits that Finnegan's not scared he doesn't appear to be scared right now doesn't seem like he can get enough air in but it doesn't really matter because he's still flown strikes did spit right now if he could you almost make the comparison and we talked about this in the regular season of another pretty good left-hander fairly fresh out of college and David Price back in 2008 came up late in the year and figured into the playoffs for Tampa Bay this kid could be the same thing one two three ten okay we talked a little small ball right here and get it runner on you but him over to second base large on second base let me take third base an easier RBI and here's a sacrifice fly and the city's used to playing that that's their style of life great execution just amazing at that bye just a few of food against a little on the toughest relievers hit that ball to the warning track he's a star in Japan when a batting title at villa glove he's played a lot of big games and he had what would what it took and that had been made fun and at first Nick Punto at second the defensive changes for the a is has removed at the bottom half of the tenth here's Eric Kozma against Sean Doolittle rounded up the middle osmond going to hit long into the bag now those choppers right at the middle Hosparus smells and going in and it used to be a headfirst rock slide would maybe steal a call but there's no such thing as stealing a call he just wanted to get there with his Christian Cologne now guys fresh off the disabled list and he will square and lay it down sacrifice accomplished small ball continues winning run at second light shines on Alex Gordon the second overall pick in the June draft in 2006 the college Player of the Year at Nebraska takes a strike he came in talking about 29 years without being to the postseason while out scorns been their best player through a lot of that and here got a chance to put them into the division series a little whoops Posner back Bob Melvin's team had a seven to three lead going to the bottom of the eighth now it's seven seven bottom ten winning run at second was close ball and a strike boredom is intentionally walked in the a workout a couple of times tonight and flied out to left grounded to short we will throw him out Bosma advances to third [Applause] and here's Salvador Perez looking for redemption he's old for four with a couple of strikeouts and that second one was huge in the eighth inning tying one was a third and he couldn't put the ball in play [Applause] a little bit of chance here though for Perez Gregerson had a lot of those sliders working away from him he got to get a lot of hard stuff in he little Perez led the team with 27 to out RBIs [Applause] and that is going to send us to the 11th inning the ground out to puto ends the threat tonight's 2014 al wild card is presented by Budweiser but to get any closer than the game we have right now 7 runs 11 hits no errors for each side as we head to the eleventh inning we kind of figured with the pitching matchup tonight Jon Lester big game James Shields this is going to be it maybe a one-run game it's going to be very tight well it's tight at 77 how did this happen well I mean I was expecting a two to one one nothing game and they would be out there the whole time but the excitement generated by this Kansas City team stealing bases got me excited I mean six stolen bases power against speed three sacrifice bunts small ball by Kansas City to get back in this ball game Brandon Finnegan out there for his second inning of work and Coco Crisp takes a strike risk the switch hitting the leadoff hitter turns around the batter right-handed against the young lefty Coco has a couple of hits as scored a run and struck out twice breaking pitch fouled away 1 & 2 we've seen all three pitches from Finnegan so far that good fastball 92 plus he's thrown one at 96 curveball and changeup but it poised young man out of TCU as Kansas City's first round pick and number 17 overall in June you're talking before the game in wonder and wonder if anybody's ever pitched in the College World Series and the big league world series in the same year doesn't seem likely does it he struck out Coco Crisp for the first out in the 11th [Applause] this was the fob all previous pitch crisp kind of fell over grabbed his leg like he might have strained something set a bad neck a lot of these A's players they've been playing hurt for the last couple of months of the year Sam Fuld lays down a bunt right back at Finnegan come out to the second out small ball only works if you wear the color blue tonight Finnegan makes a play that some pitchers find very difficult and he makes it with ease I was just trying to think about the likelihood of someone pitching in the World Series College World Series and the big League World Series in same year nobody gets to the big leagues that fast so therefore your answer is no my answer is No we've got the computer it Elias are working on that right now [Applause] just past midnight in the east that's pretty woman Wanda Donaldson even with mosses big day still to me the biggest threat in this lineup [Applause] well hit to left Gordon on the run cannot make the play and Donaldson and for a big turn will stay at first the key there was Gordon keeping the ball in front a little line drive he thinks he's going to have a chance to get to but does a nice job but keeping it in front we always think of gold gloves is making the impossible plays sometimes with these little plays and making sure you get some leather on it keep the runner first Brandon Moss steps in [Applause] two run homer in the first office shields three-run shot off Ventura in the sixth now facing Finnegan in the 11th man takes a strike and even a ball on the strike 1 & 2 Rona you gotta like the boys of this kid boys have up the guts the insides I mean he's been watching this game he's seen this guy go deep two times tonight and just blew a fastball vile breaking pitch missed count even okay we head to the bottom of the 11 in the wildest of wildcard aims [Applause] so Johnny Gomes has gone out to left field Sam Fuld goes from left and goes to center field to replace crisp [Applause] dan Otero is the new Oakland pitcher Omar Infante we related off in the bottom half of the 11th so this is what you have to protect yourself against when you're picking your roster in this one game but this you've got to protect yourself against this going deep and Extra Innings so you do have to take a little bit more pictures than you think and you can't use your guys up so fast I was asking both Melvin and Ned Yost about this scenario if it went into extra innings they both both looked at me cross-eyed but sometimes it happens Otero with seventy two appearances out of the Oakland pen this year the RA of two point two eight he was eight in two the guy who's come back from Tommy John surgery in his career here are the 11 in between innings Brandon Finnegan and tonight starter James Shields my advice don't tell him anything it just letting keep it oh it don't change the thing [Applause] but here's Jerrod Dyson came on as a pinch runner stole a base scored the tying run try the punt pulled it back ball one Josh Donaldson is in so close almost trying to take it off his bat [Applause] of course Infante at second mic Jerry having the yellow Jerrod Dyson to get his attention [Applause] then look for the sign each time something happens to throw over you have an opportunity to change your decision take the bunt off hit and run or put the butt back on again Tolleson creeping in again as Dyson takes inside [Applause] mic Jerry this is playoff baseball it's officially October by the way in the east two balls and one strike interesting with hitters that have great speed sometimes they have a real hard time sacrificing themselves because they've been taught their entire career through the minor leagues in the major league to work on bunting for a base hit this bunt is not for Dyson this bunt is for his team gets this one down the only play is the first the winning run is at second with his second-straight in it Matt Winer what you got EJ Coco Crisp understandably frustrated by the injury had nothing to say as he walked past me behind the A's dugout Eric so guard confirmed that it is his hamstring bothering him although he described it not as a bowl but as a cramp in any case as you saw he tried to give it a go in center field and pulled himself out here late in the wild card in time fans a city trainer Nick Kenney is on his way out to second base along with Ned Yost to walk to Omar Infante you see if anything happened on that play on the sacrifices he moved ii haven't seen five day if it takes off well Infante is going to stay in there they have here's Escobar rounder rows him out the tying run again 90 feet away [Applause] meant to say the winning run obviously 90 feet away they had it there in the tent as well then it was Hosmer [Applause] now here's Jayson Nix how well-traveled has he been this season January signed by Tampa Bay purchased by the Phillies in March free agent in May signed by Tampa Bay again signed by the Pirates swings and misses waived by Pittsburgh chosen off waivers by Kansas City on August 28th then he has a chance to win the wild-card game Jayson Nix and eight at-bats does not have a hit in a Royals uniform that is behind no balls and two strikes omar infante the winning run at third led off the 11th with a single San Francisco and Pittsburgh beat this tomorrow [Laughter] one wild pitch for taro all season long usually impeccable control stairs 1 & 2 [Applause] [Applause] it's recalled - in the eleven seven seven we head to the 12th you would have thought that after four hours and changed we would have the answer to this question but we still don't but there are these scenarios if the Royals win this wild card game or if the A's do of the Tigers and the Orioles and the winner of this game taking on the Angels in the ALDS on CBS Brian Anderson at Joe Simpson and the Eck gettin ready to call that of a series I want a ball game here tonight folks now half of the twelfth Brandon Finnegan still on there and Josh Reddick takes the ball want to know [Applause] and it inside and mist he wanted it 37,000 wanted it Gilmore said no no three balls and no strikes [Applause] Giovanni so toast um already wrapped up with a brace on it and leadoff walk in the 12th for Josh Reddick [Applause] [Music] that'll bring up Jed Lowrie the switch hitting shortstop there was over five if you think he may be playing some small ball here after getting the first hitter on get sit down NYX throws him out go-ahead run at second wall hung up for just a second well that that didn't surprise Nix I think Nix had the plate kind of back just in case they weren't bunting if he knew it was a definite front attempt he would have been in a little more aggressive and would have caught that ball in the air I was a little surprised that they weren't anticipating bunny Ned Yost going to the pen Finnegan hears it from the fans here in Kansas City [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] what a start to the postseason in 2014 and here on TBS in the AL Wild Card Game we're in the top of the 12th identical line scores for the A's and the Royals and Jason Frasor comes on but he did some nice work 61 games split 38 with Texas 23 with the Royals he's been in Toronto Chicago White Sox he has appeared 647 games was with the Blue Jays for a good chunk of time 2004 to 2011 have been traded to the White Sox comes on and relief now a Finnegan Alberto Callaspo has a bat and will hit for Nate Fryman 647 games for Frazier first one than the postseason that takes a strike one of six switch hitters on the Oakland Worcester for this game there's Bob Melvin or Ned Yost's can change their roster for the ALDS beginning Thursday one's a fastball two's a curve yeah now it's not the time to get crossed up make sure you know you're on the same page take time out go out there and make sure the sequence is right you both understand what you're throwing ball gets away and the runner moves up to third that is huge [Applause] Fraser with a wild pitch that Perez got a piece of but a carom the way for wild pitches three in Texas one with Kansas City now this is his fifth had everything else why not a suicide squeeze Reddick is the runner up lured but go-ahead run popped up by CAI ASCO top of the age dugout Fraser's only five nine [Applause] whereas wharfing him as they talked going back toward the mound but wharfing going on at third base - with diagonal and Redick - ooh gospel played with Avoyelles from 2008 to 2010 and further you get in the more evenly spaced you are slapped into left-field and the A's have the lead Alberto Callaspo delivers in the 12th and it's 8 to 7 what a nice piece of hitting cow one of the most unlikely guys to get a hit for the Oakland A's struggled down the stretch yeah-oh for his last 14 big time to get a hit but for for his last 50 guess he was dude what did we say new season wipe the slate clean when he comes up huge there in the 12th now here's Derek Norris and Lennox had been ohh for the last 16 in this game with runners in scoring position and I won 417 Norris did not start this game behind the plate Giovanni's soto did and in soto hooters left palm had believed the game and Norris entered who's Soto again my mistake KY a spell had been told for his last 16 with runners in scoring position not the 8th of course missed outside 1 & 2 three car to house there's Norris caught looking and here's Nick Bluto a fastball away just darts on that outside corner pitch track says it's outside the bill miller has been calling it all night long [Applause] there's a strike to punto so position players that have not been used by Bob Melvin and the Perino and Billy burns and Adam Dunn who has played 2001 regular-season games but never in the postseason and he hasn't had a chance in this game yet [Applause] two strikes the leadoff walk has cost the Royals here in the 12th he walked he was sacrificed to second advance to third on a wild pitch and scored on our brutal pious pose run-scoring single popped him up Kozma over there by the talk with it in father he makes the play that'll do it for the Aged but they break the time and take an 8 7 lead to the bottom of the 12 [Music] seems a lot less daunting than coming back from four runs down with Lester on the mound Lorenzo Cain will lead it off Eric Hosmer is on deck as they face Dan Otero and just in case you're wondering Rahula Banyas is on the Kansas City roster for this game it has a knack for some October magic all in a strike [Music] Tania's and the catcher cracks the only ones left [Applause] Kratz is a right-handed hitter [Applause] and he just played that little ditty that they will play at ballparks everybody clap their hands I was saying what do you think they've been doing it before plus hours I know it's been set a lot and a lot of times it's maybe he overused but nobody's left this place even when it was seven three right at first my ass foam made the play in the throat oh oh taro one down six stolen bases by the Kansas City Royals incredible magic to get the game tied we've got eight runs one more by the Athletics with 15 strikeouts in this game and five of those six stolen bases coming in the eighth and the ninth with the Royals behind and trying somehow to scrape their way back in and they did tying it in the bottom of the ninth here's Howser [Applause] all in a strike Oscar's got papi hit nine home runs this year knocked in 58 runs has scored a run tonight not one in [Applause] somebody's bubble is going to burst tonight 162 becomes one sometimes hoping a one-two pitch now well count even Christian : waiting on deck [Applause] fouled off right at the plate and it stays to 2 in the air the left-center field Gomes is back and so is falling apart he's on his way to third standing and the tying run is 90 feet away what in advance fouls off tough tough pitch after tough pitch he drives a ball to left-center field whenever I see a ball go up in the air when it's in the left-center I figure Sam Foltz gonna make this play one great hitting by Hosmer great at bat has shows great power but no too high off the wall for either fall or Gomes to make a play great hustle by Gomes hospital went all the way around a one-out triple [Applause] or that ball just barely miss getting out of here he was displaying his power that way during batting practice today working on staying inside the ball hit a lot of balls way up in those seats [Applause] while that padding across the board here's Cologne with the tying run at third read it inside a mist you wouldn't put the squeeze out of the equation right here either especially when cologne has a look for the signs until right now now he's stepping out of the box you got two chances here get Cologne and you got Gordon on deck high chopper are you believing this this is just an excellent breed by Hosmer sees it right away brakes Josh Johnson has no chance tries to barehanded but even then couldn't make a throw either might have been better off that would bounce how resilient is that royal punch we'll be back [Applause] Alex Gordon coming to the plate slashing back to August 26 and [Applause] Melvin has gone to the Oakland bullpen and brought on the left-hander Fernando Abad about side effects Lefty's 69 games to a Dra good numbers would inherited runners stranded he came into this season with a career record of 1 and 14 with an ER a of about 4 and a half and a 13 game losing streak but he's been sensational for Oakland Alex Gordon waits pops it up I will tell Josh Donaldson makes the play to down Eric Hosmer's one-out triple and Christian colognes high chopper have tied the game Oh God did his job and true Pomerance makes his way [Applause] it won't be Pomerance but Jason Hammel who comes on here in the bottom half of the 12th with a man on and two out in a game that now stands 8 8 you know we spent a lot of time talking about the less to trade being the big difference maker but they traded earlier in the year Addison Russell who is their shortstop phenom prospect over the Chicago Cubs and they got Samardzija and Jason Hammel and now Jason Hammel has been put on the roster because he's one of those guys that is the starter by trade only one relief appearance open and it can pitch multiple innings if you need it we've seen a lot of things in your career Iron Man this one's gone but this one's got a rank up there going back and forth but in my own experience I was thinking about our Series against Cleveland in 97 it felt like every play you were an extra innings every play was magnified but I've never seen anything like this Malone has two stolen bases right-hander might allow him to steal Salvador Perez at the plate Hamill throws over [Applause] whereas looking for his first hit of the night he's over five [Applause] he struck out in the big spot in the 8th round it out to end the 10th with a runner at third [Applause] there's a no-strike we see the defense thing I notice no doubles defense in the outfield cow they're about as deep as you can play a niche ballpark Hamels trying to keep cologne close but base running for success with 12 out of 15 times stealing against Hamel waiting on a one oh wow right there at the plate the reason he plays so deep is you have a better angle cutting the ball off no doubles so the run can't score from first base here we require two hits in their defensive position they're not playing title on the line though they're pinching a line down to third holy runner at the island first one ball and two strikes competing Perez instead he died of breaking balls you're jumpy at all at the plate you want to hit bad you want to drive in runs you just can't seem to wait on the breaking ball the Hayes took the lead in the top half the Royals with a triple high off the wall in left-center field and an infield chopper had tied it those play their first base Christian Colome fractured the middle finger of his right hand that's why he has that protective sleeve on I kiddingly always call it an oven mitt that's what it looks like to me but protects your hand as you slide back into the base good chance you're gonna get a breaking ball with two strikes and I'd be worth the chance one on this pitch there he goes they pitched out and off the gloves of Derek Norris I knew it was coming you would know better than the ex catcher Bob Melvin [Applause] she see with the eyes have Norris were not on the baseball watching it into the glove they were on cologne he was running the second base that's 11 is the winning run is at second and a roster of 25 seven different Royals have stolen a base the team that led baseball and stolen bases in using it to their greatest advantage tonight now looking for a two-out hit [Applause] the game-winner they're closed to the guava trust Donaldson another breaking ball gets this one a little over the plate Perez just gets enough of it States back just enough and then strong enough hit the ball down the line a night here in Kansas City baseball's version of highway robbery by the Kansas City Royals seven different Royals stole seven bases five of them scored the legend George Brett I think everything in his town is named for him and these fans who have stuck here close to five hours of game time tonight even when they were down seven three no matter they battled back to win it in 12 you
