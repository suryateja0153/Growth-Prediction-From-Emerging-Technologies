 hello i'm masa i'm a founder and they serve a brick which apparently since 2014 and we're gonna give up the one of the world first really a scalable private boxes of 10 above duty and I saw this company to this be a hoarder since it's an 18 and it's a say I start this YouTube channel and the purpose is very simple I don't have two people more fully and deeply understand about the potential of the blockchain and crypto assets and also sorry because you know this is one of the most pile it occurs in the world right now next to the personal computer internet and also through this channel I want to debug the ecosystem with you get together okay and for this time in a previous video I review you know I made the video about me being from you know TRX project and one of the major pro sports it in crypto space and then this is a kind of second video to kind of supplemental - you know SAP remain about the understanding about the future we try especially from the particle prodigy model so the title is about like in a wide Eli matters for trans particular product strategy so you know trauma as a bros as a boss project they take like kind of very unique you know strategy to computers as I like you know the burst project especially from differentiate from you know III Mt but also actually you know one of the reasons they take the process but constructed is competing with other I can take Titans like that Google or Facebook and Amazon or Apple something like that so let's review about this point and a deal I would and play a very critical role for this issue ok so let's start [Music] [Music] first of all 2019 December of 30 so the D live is one of the top dabs project in crypto space there the tokenize YouTube so you finally decided to join the Bitcoin ecosystem so they have own broth chain that you know talking you know broth share also finally migrate to the neutron blockchain so you know the talk any kind of token colonies is actually migrate to the BT and BT did you know which is talking and talking on the big trend okay so I think sorry one of the tops news you know to me actually you know one of the top news and equip the space in 2018 and then to me looks like a top three news for this one then let me explain why this is so critical for that not about that actually trans like in a project success but also intact in deathly success of the brushless itself especially to computer is you know take tight ends you know like a big full player in an Internet space such a school goal okay so the first of all so from you know from my based on portfolio so you know I met invested in a big point also other like a six you know those kind of candidates for categories in a crypto script in a broad sense space so I usually don't invest in any other like a project not let it to these six categories stuff okay and then G light is categories here taps b2c and b2b applications staff on top of the blockchain okay but one of like in a uniqueness on the throne you know family stuff is you know D life is located here but also like you know D life is connected to big trend which is a decentralized CDN and also they know Trump is here its birth project so this is one of the uniqueness about to think about the future of the not about the problem process but also the future of you know a deal itself but especially you know the reason like you know from the Trump prospective why they wanted life is actually quite elated to the boss you know my kind of a business model staff and it's gonna be more sustainable way or more scalable way in long term okay the Olympics are there and it from you know to understand this point I know they have actually two reasons about this point and then let me experiment these two reasons the first one is to keep after minor or sometimes we call the validator inside of their network on boss project so what I what does it mean so to understand this point actually to review about the history of the central cloud market developments it's quite be helpful for you guys but for me too okay so the first so this is like you know but basic market structure of the central you know central scribe market in 2007 so they could we have currency layer in the central crowd size layer first layer and Ananias layer so sauce is applications pros is you know up development platform and years is providing you know rating several services in a timely manner okay and in the beginning like you know the crowd sit and cry the industry staff so Amazon started from like you know aid of s with there is services there now moving to you know more path layer here and a Microsoft Azure also provide the same service to but you can see here is actually there's a couple of like you know I know these kind of like you know player here for the cloud space still first of all the Rackspace kind of good example about this issue because that space is a purely data center player in the past but since you know crowd trends coming up in the market so they you know shifted their like you know system architecture and business model to the more crowded you know model stuff okay they're actually this is kind of good things to know about like you know how you know the first project you know the de Bourgh how they gonna have to develop their you know business model and if I saw sure a more long-term sourcing away from the in a business perspective because you know this slide is one a critical site understand this point so this is the center crowd in a market structure in the 2018 the recent years so this is an entire like you know crowd market and as you can see the able address this he's also they know it of s is the first mover in a crowded market taking a dominant role here okay but at the same time what I want to pay attention here for this slide is like you know all these top player in the market era where Microsoft OS you google crowd and an Arabic crowd they are not purely you know and crowd services just a galactic space because they have their own b2c applications by themselves right so good examples actually Amazon so here so this is a whole revenue over the Amazon most of our revenue from coming from e-commerce that every knows about it but either way is also provided around 11 percent over video of the entire like you know that I know Amazon revenue staff so this is also the things we shouldn't send about the history of the cloud services so the a divest the first mover started to there you know central cloud services you know nos is actually starting from you know they're gonna provide extra server resources to their own application developer then the original ideas coming from wagon since ecommerce you know industry has kind of seasonal sales you know kind of cycle like this especially in the US you know the stocks giving like you know after the sounds living and the Christmas season is the most like you know I know a lot of these are quite active too you know buying staff so most of the busiest season for the Amazon so to deal with that kind of like you know server resources in the Amazon in that you know deal with the connect or sales cycle so they added you know maximum server level to deal with that you know in a busiest season and I think once market but let's say after the new Christmas seasons well sometimes I can before the summer or something you know those kind of in a server they can add it to deal with at the nose busy seasons they're not gonna for they're not gonna do anything complete completely you know they're taking the rest timing so the idea is that the why don't you learn to the services you know other developer they can make money through it so this is the original idea of the air of s so from this perspective you know how they're gonna you know maintain or scare up that about like you know delegating their tasks to the server is actually included in a cost performance of the entire server system itself - and we can apply completely same model conquer similar theory or concept to the decentralized cloud project - because every single miner or ready to join you know to make money right so this is one of the future of the blockchain technology so if they can keep you know kind of busy - Randy their node to monitor some specific proper block instrument Tron something you know they are very happy to you know during it there you know resource computing resources to the proper but if not gonna you know they can keep you but those pothole player cannot delegate those tasks continuously to them some like in a minor revise it or realize that you know oh this is kind of waste of time why don't you move to other like you know probably it's such a release or something because you know you they can keep running a business and continuously stuff right a Bitcoin something so to avoid that kind of potential risk will typically happen in a crowded space you know that Trumper home itself to provide you know all this kind of like you know transaction requests today nobody there network all the time and then this is also kind of in a competitive edge to make keeping like in a lower cost structure for using in a gas price for the inappropriate up to burp aside because you know if the try sales are providing or keeping like a transaction requests old alter divided by the other you know a lot of our data wants to join a tour network because they can make money continuously so competitor inside you know you know about taking the walk resources inside network it's much more like an I know it's computer market is much more first which mean that the costs luster of the impressive model for the birthdate aside rapid approach will be cheaper because this has perfect hash competitions it's kind of natural market economy here that's where market econometrics it's kind of typically happens so how it is so important for the first project that how they're gonna debuff that Scarah you know b2c application who can you know request send a request transaction processing requests about you know for the you know by the data or minor in a p2p network so Amazon's motto is kind of very typical successful case how they're gonna keep him busy about you know server resources all the time quite active stuff right so that kind of understand aquinas in a very important to think about the set long-term sustainability or the past project okay alright second reason is you know particle priority step so particle product strategy model is a quite effective to sell scale the proper business stuff okay what does it mean so we have a little bunch of you know justice to the case about the magical products were cheap model in the past especially IT industry so goodie and one of a good examples Microsoft so Microsoft it wants to be a dominant player in a pro so company industry and they realize that the OS software windows you know kind of key software to be a dominant player in a personal computer but to be a dominant player in a personal computer you know on always always market they recognize that you know they have to provide their own care application by themselves because you know even we're gonna provide on OS you know there's nothing to do for the user so they need the applications to you know engage for the users perspective engage themselves in a personal computer in a daily life so they pick up the three key application items in a word excel powerpoint so they developed the own application by themselves so the orders of the bundle with their always software okay so all the apostle computer integrated this software you know there is no way so that is why you know user naturally engage themselves you know Windows OS through these applications so we sometimes call it secure applications so how the Kara profession is so important give up the platform business in long term same as like you know in a ways for tonight I know Amazon equals for the LMS or Google search engine or YouTube for Google crowd you know Microsoft Office of the crowd office to the Microsoft Azure to its same Siri okay then a lot of examples on Apple I was still because you know Steve Jobs or Apple inside actually kind of you know kind of secret story is that yeah when they like you know came up with in our iPhones original ideas coming from also the very early 2000 2000 so before they gonna reach their iPod so they have original idea of the iPhone but they want to be very successful that iPhone platform in long term and the Steve Jobs you know and actually failed to compete with on a windows sleaze in the past so he learned a lot from about the successful Microsoft so he won't he try to apply you know their strategy in today like you know practices in iOS up iPhone so that is why whatever they introduced the iPod combiners I choose so the purpose of the iPod is actually to build the new surveys on iTunes at massive scale so once again successfully building I choose you know user base like over 100 million user so the diggin leads the iPhone so you know those user who can use the iPod already you know naturally you know transfer the interactivity from iPod to the iPhone because an i/o is much more benefit of products on purpose the iPod note about it'll take and make phone call but also they can access all the Google map or YouTube in battery user application inside its here and among you know big window so you can do you know a lot of like you know competing activity compared with like in the future form so you know especially compared with an iPod so you know those user you know iPod naturally coming to i phone but the key things why they primarily motivate to join our iPhone ecosystem because with the iTunes so you know those people stop buying it an iPod in standing and instead an iPhone but you know with the energy services stuff so you know that initial user based an iPhone with I to user base you know actually attract a lot of an app developer to develop the third-party application on top of iOS platform so like it is a push to inspire network with spiral here that says you know it's so you know I hope probably solve the problem with the promise of a bit you know business - aye-aye-aye OS with the I chose right so this is very important to know about it so you can see how I can back up pronto strategy is quite an effective way to scare our incubator scare up the proper business in long term so in of tonic take the complete the same way to then you know let me talk about in a bar called products wattage in Trump it's actually can again things still because I also mentioned at the previous video but from the Marriott propositioning analysis on the trial so here is trial and the compare with the existing was like III maternal Yas you know these elements are completely related the past project but the uniqueness trial tried to develop is these areas the user never released their own you know the apps applications and you just try to build something but not so insecure yet too bad the trial is actually much more strong advantage here at this moment with a deal I that's what I want to tell you here because you know I think you know founding member of the trial or like a no qualms member truly understand that you know their ultimate competitor in the block industry entirely is actually no no it's actually inside the convenor like a new THERMOTRONIC is Remo Leo's camp they're like an ultimate competitor in this industry actually those in tick Titans like Google Facebook Amazon Apple they know that so the trial is tagged you know especially one you tube filled in a movie area so they have like you know 2.7 billion active user base in the world it's one of the biggest massive use of it in application in a global basis they target on this field you know by crying in Adelaide that why they focus on these areas you know moving field live streaming and recording videos field it's because five generation mobile so this is the key element so you know from 2025 generations adapted adaptation from the mobile industry we just start it and then compare within 40 or 4G LTE you know as a minimum level physique and process you know 20 times to 200 times and much faster Internet experiences for consumer so a lot of users so seriously think about like you know movie is the next generation like content consumption model on a mobile internet space so that is why a lot of an entrepreneur or like you know startups or any kind of big player you know just kind of article on at the industries so seriously think about how they can build up you know will be related to business in five of these generations so like you know movie in live streaming services or gonna add a movie you know out of attachment stuff those are the very hot topic right now and I teen dozen right now because of a feisty relations so trial also focus on same way too right so this is the one reason you know why you know the troll wants to buy one wants to get the D live okay then let's compare with you know D live and YouTube so not typical like a feature in a you know deal I know YouTube those kind of wrap student services you know whether I'm assuming impossible or not of course yes and uploading video is another key element and the data I've actually you know it's not allowed to you know connect creator to upload those video yet but I can explain you later why also the paint content order those covers okay then you know currently they are not allowed to user or limited only email user allowed to upload there be no recording video because you know it require you know this feature you know feature require the massive amount of running cost to save that you know those video data on this rage this is actually from di perspective they all finally decided to join a big Chronicle system one turn and trans family and then let me interior about taken detail in a different video but to be true and stuff so please check them out but the key thing is actually this is you know primary reason that you know they decided to join you know term family project okay but you know you know feature in this animated area you know also the betrayer have a very computer advantage here its first one is actually zero platform fee model you know YouTube take around like a 20 or 30 percent a platform fee for any kind of kinetic creator if we're gonna make money through you know online in a video about ads and stuff but you know deal I've take nothing so it's kind of huge competitor that to attract a lot away you know creator in the market the second word is a total reward for the user watching content so it's another competitive edge let me tell you why but you know let me hear about the D&D test effin later but you know this is also a completely new user experience about the how you know generate engagement for the user side getting bored this twisting you know the livestreamer like you know just like you know live content or recorded video so this is a very new competitive edge here then also like in a Tokarev ad for the use of washing ass in his algorithm another element because they can also make money by watching a user can make money I know by watching you know advertised video in a content ok so then maybe also about the details things that here because it's kind of related to the basket products strategy about the triangle synergy between D live and a big trend and a trial ecosystem here and then later so let me explain this it and these things later but he said how you can see like you know by watching these like you know buddy the car matrix stuff you can see the how the D live is quite competitive and very unique to compete as you chew okay alright then also like it let's at the deal empty marathas so for this time I show you one of the great things that happen is actually the deal I have a very very you know talented in a very you know I know a skillful team member inside so all the people he's joined but you know thrown foundations so you know how you know now that the term foundation team is much more stronger than before you know with that equation of the deal I so let me tell you why so this is a V no founding member of the deal I you know finally actual original name of the platform is the arena network so the Wilson co-founder CEO is a serial entrepreneur and the BS at the UC Berkeley also he was elected to american-born Chinese entrepreneurship award or something in other 30s so he's also kind of well-known guy you know in a tech field you know in the second Valley or us okay and yeah he also the co-founder and CTO so he's also actor entrepreneur and then before starting his own company he was also the you know software engineer at the Instagram and also after that you know he you know he found it on his own I can take setups and it was a CEO that he joined as like you know and wheel sounds like a deal I posit and then a co-founder city of status so those are well know about you know about you know startups test but also I can take stuff too right my mom will say is more like a BD guy he's not because he doesn't have any kind of computer science background but qfn but since like you know to dip up the blocking system staff so they need a kind of computer science expert so you know keifa in joined this team as a co-founder because he got a PhD degree from the Stanford or also like he teaching level he's you know competing a science staff in university in Hong Kong so uh you know also kind of he's was a great programmer got out in a competing I know to programming our you know those kind of my I know those kind of like a commission staff so he's a very talented computer science to supplement a more like in a stronger tech team inside on a deal I've but also like a deal I providing like in a token column staff so they decide is one of the primary role to do running something gross hacking staff to optimize the token Amex to increase mark and user deeper engagement so the investment user based developing staff here so know their way is also the co-founder and the data scientist so he graduate from a you st and you know it USC at the completion of math and I also like university he mentioned like statics you know and I'm a sturdily I know he used to be the data scientist and American Express so you know how these members you know comprehensive or supplemental each other to you know develop the very massive scale live streaming applications on broadchurch space okay and with with this like song founder member amazing the things you know they have an impossible a very talented team member here and most of the people coming from you know Amazon Facebook Google you know very talented like in a computer software engineer including business guy too so you know both members join the term foundation and then they try to build the massive scale up the token and YouTube on abruption space to defeat you to make your system 2.7 billion Aftab user base so like you know it's more like an realists you story right now but you know we can have like an you know break tremendous amount like a successful apps application in an Internet space it's happening right now it's great okay then let's about the execution path analysis so in a broader space we have you know except Eli we have mainly two types of same type of application live streaming and recorded video sharing stuff and then we need look at this number two active user to low transactions and adapts for really say literally the deal I is a number one it's the best demo Tamiya's are the best apps of vacations on a branch of space very good now what another element you know how the execution power isn't so amazing it's you know coming from this news so you know the deal I crows exclusive live streaming and we got video deals with PewDiePie - PewDiePie is you know top tier youtuber with you know over 100 minions and spider and internet space so he sit in the largest you know youtuber at all you know into the space with the you know as a single player he's like you know not like a running back company he's a single youtuber so it's great you know kind of business to movement skill to close the deal with him so only PewDiePie you know broadcast his web streaming content or record a video on a brought in space on a deal I okay no other like in a proper like a theater TV or in is like an untrue untrue right all right then let's with the token analysis so color it's a similar Syria about like you know from Tron project so I told you that you know ye life is part of here adapts but they're gonna join the Tron family so you know this is also you know connective is that you know this intercity and beat trend and also trauma bus was here okay so this is actually a critical element about you know broadcast watch it with hometown and from the project so you know once they gotta give up the deal I backed abuser gross then I'm thinking about you know they're gonna provide we were like you know movie advertising solutions on top of the Pratt home then user can make money by watching you know advertisement so they can get you know be deep talking as an incentives but the next step you know Tron is a post project so what I'm thinking about my guess is my prediction is that you know those kind of like an obedient tokens an incentive or a user by watching ads they can use this talkin to transfer or exchange the brutal item you know the gaming application on top of Tron like NFT staff so it's naturally quite beneficial for the user to you know actually engage in a dubs gaming stuff on you know trombe wall chair it's because you know it's easier to get those kind of and if the items in a games with a BDD taco and then instead we here right so there is a cost energy here then once you know they're gonna develop those caramel those shows here you know transaction frequency or volume will much more increase them before so you know they can build a lot of work for their you know at a PDP you know no network in a big trend so you know a lot of the testings come in here right I also user also bring something ability here in the D line because you know instead it's a BDD so like you know BDD speed how they gonna separate me but in a more massive like an active user action what about the sending or the share applauding and down one is sharing contents that was gonna happen so the BDD speed with AD live act abuser and at all and give the report then you know mass you know they're gonna you know grow up this is a big trend like in a PDP network is a much more active way they can provide more stable streaming services in a guideline because all the PDP base is stuff so this is actually question is it like a triangle you know these three players so you know I think that Ron is you know much more like a PAHO past performing long term about the bad construction model okay but initially I say like you know one of my favorite things about the deal I'm talking economy is actually there in a user engagement in feature so this is the treasure chest so we know this is actually pretty far I'm stirring yourself so when you look at like you know look at the new PewDiePie's livestream yourself here's the chest here's the communication board and it wasn't you gonna subscribe it you know you can join it some time with chatting or sending like in brochure I virtual good student like you PewDiePie but here the kissing of a treasure chest so treasure chest actually you know streamer or content creator and if you gonna join and for those audience to those are audience then you know there are times you know time has after you know like watching of the 15 minutes or 30 minutes you know as time is you know running out within the content inside of his chest the in Oaxaca accumulated about the incentives actually there in Reno points inside then no livestreamer can choose the timing to distribute these incentives the user anytime you want so from the audience pursuit the viewer perspective you know they don't know about the timing and way they can you know get you know get the benefit when you send them from the viewer like lobbyist rumor so they need to keep watching their lives even content this is how so effective way to generate more stronger engagement between you know viewer and also live streamer with the know and a treasure chest it's kind of very you know very effective methodology all right so I think this is also kinda you know sprite will create a very strong user engagement competing with YouTube so I have very high expectations on this ok right so I revealed that you know why chrome wants to quiet addy live from the any vodka strategy perspective you know he's up like in Microsoft you know Windows these stuff but also like the Amazons and it always staff was in iOS and and iTunes stuff right but from the DI perspective this is actually quite quite critical for them to join in on betray niko system and a Trinitron family so let me explain about the next video about this point so deal I really need big trend for scaling why okay so when pre-check check out within a big trend video I explain the why for this reason and also it will you all so please check it out in a video about the trial so those in a 3-3 video including this will help you understand about the potential of the Trump Plaza at the boss you know and up with their particle strategy ok so that is all this time ok so I also make another like and an interesting like a video about the whole coin investments or any kind of rock channel purchases related stuff to stay tuned thank you for watching bye
