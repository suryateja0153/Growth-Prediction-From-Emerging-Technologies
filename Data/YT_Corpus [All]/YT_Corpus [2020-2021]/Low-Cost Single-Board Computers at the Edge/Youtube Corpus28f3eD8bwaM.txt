 I'm working on some more getting started with 3d printing videos but while I was doing this cura 4.5 beta was released so I wanted to test it out with my profiles I did make some minor modifications and I'm releasing those I'll show you that plus I have a lot of people ask me for profiles for version 3.6 they still want to use that and then there's some people like me who like the look of 3.6 but want to use the latest Cura I'll show you the plug-in that does that I've shown it before but I'll give you an update because I tested it on 4.5 I'll show you all this on today's Filament Friday Filament friday is brought to you by these patreon supporters I do keep a version of cura 3.6 on my computer so yes I do go back and tweak the settings from time to time so I do have a new set of profiles and these profiles I try to match as much as I can to what I learn in version 4 and put it into these so now I have four I have renamed them to CHEP I got rid of the magic there's the best there's a medium there's a rough and then there's one designated for round no seam and then of course the ninjaflex if you want to get a hold of these the link is at the bottom of the picture here just go down and download them and then expand them it's a zip file and then you can go here to manage profiles go up to import and then one by one bring those profiles in and that should get you going with 3.6 try them out let me know here's some of the results I got from testing I'm really happy with the results I'm getting with 3.6 so now let's take a look at cura version 4.5 beta they're asking us to test it and I did I tested my profiles on it and I did make some minor changes I also added some profiles I now have a round no seam I have a 0.16 layer height and a 0.24  renamed them all CHEP got rid of the magic and gave a reference for people getting started so they know which one to select now within these there are some like I said some minor changes one of the changes I made is I allow the top and bottom layers to adjust per the layer height there were some issues by leaving it where it was and I also the bottom initial layer I liked concentric a lot of you complained about that so I changed it back to lines you can always change it if you want the biggest one is the Z seam alignment I had them all at random before I'm getting good results some people weren't so I put it back to sharpest corner and then I made that round one that will have a random in it so you can choose what you want here but if you want a really good print with no seam this is the profile I use to make my CHEP pawn come out with no seam and really smooth using random so you can try that out if you want I'm not doing that for 0.2 or 0.28 to many complaints other than that I made some minor changes but the results I'm getting really good prints just like before in fact maybe slightly better so I'm really happy with it if you want to try these out same page on my CHEP club site download them and give it a try Cura has a long list of improvements one stuck out to me right away fuzzy skin outside only if you go back to where I made a video I showed you how to use fuzzy skin I did it on a handle this is the new feature fuzzy skin outside only before without that you would make it like this fuzzy on the outside but it also be fuzzy on the inside where it slid on to my paper cutter the workaround was to use the per model settings put a block around it and tell it don't use fuzzy skin there and that way I could trick it into not doing on the inside but with this new feature you just checked the box slice it with fuzzy skin enabled and then it'll do fuzzy skin on the outside but not on the inside so a simple little thing man I love this. a bug fix that caught my eye is a retraction minimum travel was broken since version 4.0 and that's been fixed and when I did a 30% benchy with 4.5 oh my god this is the best one I've gotten yet there's still some improvement obviously but this is incredibly clean compared to what I was getting with the previous versions of cura it appears that it's mostly bug fixes and performance improvements not a lot of feature improvements that I can see here then we're going to go through it and see if any of it can improve my profiles and now let me show you this plugin that I just absolutely love it makes 4.5 look like 3.6 but still gives me all the features so one of the features I always enable and I really like within Cura under preferences there's the center camera when item is selected so you click on it and it centers to the screen now in version 4.0 and later the screen is bigger so you can see and then you have the drop-down for all the settings but the two overlap so I always move the model to the left so I can see it especially in preview mode not just prepare but as soon as I click on it again it shifts back over it's so frustrating so that was my main driver in doing this and there's this sidebar GUI plugin you can install it accept it then you have to quit Cura and restart it and then it'll make the whole thing look like this this is like 3.6 and when you click on the model it centers to the open window now and so that I can do all my different things to it the profile settings are always on to the right of the model and the scroll bar for preview is now moved over to the window so it's a little easier to work with and all the other features that were in 4.5 are just moved up to a new location you can get to any of these things including the nozzle sizes that's here is a little drop-down just click on the arrow and then your material and your nozzle so everything is still there it's just all contained on the one side just like it is in 3.6 but you have all the features of version 4.5 so this is something I really love and I still have all the flow settings that I don't have in 3.6 this is one of the features I like about version 4 so it's just something to play with I really love it so that's where they're at right now so please download them test them and let me know your experience and if you want more details on Cura I've got some playlists right up here you can
