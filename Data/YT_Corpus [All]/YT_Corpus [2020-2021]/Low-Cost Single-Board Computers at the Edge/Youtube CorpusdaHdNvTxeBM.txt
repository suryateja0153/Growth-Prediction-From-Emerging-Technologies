  THEY HOPPED INTO TESLAS.  THIS IS AN ELON MUSK OPERATION AFTER ALL AND THEY DROVE TO THE  LAUNCH PAD. THEY WENT UP TO THE VERY TOP OF THE FALCON 9 ROCKET  AND CLIMBED INTO THE CREW DRAGON CAP SELL.   WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THOSE ASTRONAUTS IN A MOMENT.  FIRST JOINING ME FROM THE WASHINGTON POST NEWSROOM,  REPORTER, FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT AND DIRECTOR OF THE SMITHSONIAN  AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM. IT IS SO NICE TO SEE ALL OF  YOU AND TALKING ABOUT SUCH A HISTORIC MOMENT. YOU WERE ALSO  ONCE NASA'S CHIEF SCIENTIST. WHAT DOES THIS DAY MEAN?   IT IS EXCITING ON SO MANY LEVEL TOSS SEE COMMERCIAL CREW  WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT NASA HAS BEEN WORKING ON ESPECIALLY WHEN  I WAS AT NASA AND SEEING IT FINALLY COMING TO FRUITION IS  AMAZING BUT AS A SCIENTIST, ALSO KNOWING THAT RETURNING LAUNCH TO AMERICAN SOIL ALLOWS US TO SEND MORE CREW UP TO THE SPACE  STATION WHICH MEANS MORE SCIENCE GETTING DONE.   PAM, AS A FORMER ASTRONAUT WHAT IS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND  TODAY? DO YOU WISH YOU WERE ONE OF THESE ASTRONAUTS GOING ON  THIS MISSION? OH, ABSOLUTELY. ARE YOU  KIDDING? EVERY ASTRONAUT LOVES TO BE ON THE FIRST OF SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, IT IS AN EXPLORATION JOB AFTER ALL AND YOU KNOW IT IS ALWAYS EXCITING TO DO SOMETHING THE FIRST TIME. THIS IS SO  SIGNIFICANT, THOUGH, BECAUSE THE CAPABILITY TO LAUNCH PEOPLE INTO SPACE IS A SPECIAL ONE AND ONLY A FEW COUNTRIES HAVE IT AND IT  HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE A NEW VEHICLE WAS DEVELOPED FOR HUMAN  SPACE FLIGHT HERE IN OUR COUNTRY AND GETTING TO THE POINT OF  SENDING SOMEONE TO ORBIT. IT IS THE ULTIMATE TEST FLIGHT.   THERE HAS BEEN THIS COMPETITION BETWEEN SpaceX AND  BOEING AS THEY WERE JOCKEYING TO SEE WHO COULD BE THE FIRST TO  GET TO THIS MOMENT. HOW SURPRISING IS IT THAT SpaceX IS  THE ONE PUTTING A CREW UP INTO ORBIT?   I HAVE TO ADMIT, LIBBY, I'M SURPRISED AND IMPRESSED THAT  ELON HAS PULLED THIS OFF. REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS  TODAY, AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER, WE DON'T KNOW FOR  SURE IF THIS LAUNCH IS GOING TO BE SCRUBBED, THIS IS A  TREMENDOUS ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT HE TOOK A START-UP COMPANY,  SpaceX BACK IN 2002. HE MADE A BUNCH OF MONEY OFF THE INTERNET  AND HE HAS BUILT A ROCKET COMPANY THAT HAS BEEN VERY  SUCCESSFUL.   IT IS NOT JUST NASA OWNING  THE ROCKET AND DOING IT IN TRADITIONAL WAY AND THEY DID  WITH OTHER BIG CONTRACTORS GOING BACK HALF A CENTURY.   WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ELON MUSK AND HIS ROLE AND THE PRESIDENT  WHO LED THIS EFFORT TO GET TO THIS DAY, PAM, I WANT TO HEAR  WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU TO BE A PART OF A TEST. WHAT MAKES A TEST ASTRONAUT? WHAT MAKES THEM CUT OUT FOR THAT JOB?  RIGHT. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION  DID SEND A HUMAN TO SPACE. WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE VIRGIN --  ACTUALLY SPACESHIP 1 AND SCALED COMPOSITES REACHING SUB ORBITAL. THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUB ORBITAL AND ORBITAL  FLIGHT THOUGH. AS A TEST PILOT, YOUR APPROACH TO THESE THINGS IS WHAT WE CALL A BUILD-UP APPROACH. YOU START BY TAXIING  AN AIRPLANE AND THEN YOU MIGHT DO A HIGH SPEED PASS DOWN THE  RUNWAY. THEN YOU DO A TAKEOFF AND THEN YOU COME BACK RIGHT  AWAY AND LAND. THEN YOU VERY GRADUALLY APPROACH THE LIMITS OF THE AIRCRAFT. WHEN YOU'RE GOING ORBITAL, IT IS ALL OR NOTHING,  YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT. THE ABORT IS ALWAYS BUILT IN. THAT IS  ESSENTIAL BUT THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU EVER WANT TO  ACTUALLY DO, SO I THINK FROM MY STANDPOINT AS A TEST PILOT, THE  CHALLENGE IS TO THINK THROUGH ALL THE SCENARIOS, REALLY  UNDERSTAND THE HARDWARE, AND, YOU KNOW, UNDERSTAND THE ENTIRE  MISSION PROGRAM FILE INTUITIVELY BECAUSE SOMETHING UNEXPECTED  WILL HAPPEN, WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YET AND YOU WANT TO  BE PREPARED FOR THAT. ELLEN, THE ROLE OF THE AIR  AND SPACE MUSEUM IS SO VITAL IN GETTING AMERICANS INTERESTED IN  SPACE AND THEN REFLECTING ON OUR SHARED HISTORY LOOKING TOWARDS  THE FUTURE. THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A STRANGE TIME WITH THE PANDEMIC.  CLOSING DOWN MUSEUMS, CUTTING OFF THE PHYSICAL ACCESS SO MANY  OF US HAVE. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR YOU AS THE DIRECTOR TO HAVE  THIS SORT OF COME TOGETHER TO WATCH THIS HAPPEN TODAY?   YOU KNOW TO ME IT IS JUST REMINDING US THAT SPACE IS  TRUELY INSPIRING. IF YOU THINK BACK TO THAT CALL PRESIDENT  KENNEDY'S TO GET US TO THE MOON AND 8 1/2 YEARS LATER WE LANDED  THE APOLLO THOUGHTS ON THE MOON, IT SHOWS THE SPIRIT WE AN  ACHIEVE TO PUT OUR MINDS TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS SO  WHETHER IT IS LANDING ON THE MOON OR APOLLO 13 WHERE THEY HAD TO BE BROUGHT BACK SAFELY, ALL THE WAY TO TODAY, THE SPACE  PROGRAM INSPIRES. WE MAKE THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE. AT THIS  PARTICULAR TIME, WHEN EVERYONE IS FEELING FAIRLY MAYBE A LITTLE UNDONE BY A CRISIS, THE SPACE PROGRAM REMINDS US, WE CAN DO  ANYTHING WE PUT OUR MINDS TO. YOU MENTIONED THE POSSIBILITY OF SCRUBBING A SCRUBBED LAUNCH. ALL SYSTEMS ARE GO. ASTRONAUTS  HAVE TAKEN THE JOURNEY AS WE SAW THE FOOTAGE. THEY ARE IN CREW  DRAGON RIGHT NOW. WHAT ARE YOUR QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT WHY A MISSION AT THIS POINT COULD BE SCRUBBED?   THEY NEED TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THIS RIGHT. THIS  IS A FAIL -- FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION KIND OF THINGS. THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF ABORT SYSTEMS IN CASE THERE IS A PROBLEM ON THE  PAD, THERE IS A PAD ABORT. THEY CAN SEPARATE THE CAPSULE FROM  THE ROCKET OUT OVER THE OCEAN AND COME DOWN IN THE NORTHERN  ATLANTIC. WHAT STRUCK ME, LIBBY, JUST IN ONE OF THE FEEDS WE SAW  FOR MAYBE 20 MINUTES AGO, WITH THE ASTRONAUTS, THEY ARE IN THE  CAPSULE NOW AND ONE OF THEM, I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN COLONEL  HURLEY APPEARED TO BE SLEEPING. THEY TRAINED AND TRAINED AND  TRAINED AND THEY ARE COMFORTABLE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT IN A  SITUATION THAT, I WOULD BE VERY, VERY NERVOUS. THIS IS A FIRST  TIME THAT HUMANS HAVE RIDDEN IN THE DRAGON AND ON TOP OF THE  FALCON 9 BUT THAT IS WHAT THEY DO. AND THEY HAVE TRAINED. AS  PAM SAID, THESE ARE SPECIAL PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL SKILLS THAT  INCLUDE WHAT YOU WOULD CALL COURAGE AND THE ABILITY TO  PERFORM VERY DIFFICULT TASKS AND TO DO IT WITH KIND OF NERVES OF  STEEL TRUTHFULLY. LET'S HEAR FROM DOUG HURLEY  AND BOB BEHNKEN. WHEN THEY WERE ASKED WHAT THE LAUNCH MEANS TO  THEM AND THE UNITED STATES. LET'S LISTEN.   THE EXPERIENCE IN THE LAUNCH OFF U.S. SOIL IS JUST DIFFERENT. IT IS A SPECIAL IN A VERY BOTH PATRIOTIC. YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT  LEVEL OF PRIDE. I HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF PRIDE BEING  PART OF THE SHUTTLE PROGRAM THAN BEING A PART OF THE SOY YES  PROGRAM. IT IS PART OF OUR DNA TO BE A SPACE FARING NATION AND  AS WE HAVE CONTINUED TO FLY IN SPACE AND NOT HAVE THE INHERENT  LAUNCH CAPABILITY HAS BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE. THE RUSSIANS  HAVE BEEN GREAT PARTNERS AND THEIR VEHICLE IS A SAFE VEHICLE, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT IS TIME. IT IS PAST TIME IN MY OPINION TO HAVE  THIS CAPABILITY BACK IN THE UNITED STATES. WE DON'T HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SPACE GETTING PEOPLE TO AND FROM THE SPACE  STATION AND THAT COMES WITH PRIDE ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO I  WAS EXCITED FROM THAT PER STECK TIVE AND I'M EXCITED BECAUSE NO  TEST SPOT SCHOOL GRADUATE COULD HAVE DREAMED OF ANYTHING MORE  OFTEN THAN BEING A PART OF THE TEST FLIGHT OF A BRAND-NEW  SPACESHIP SO I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.   THAT IS THE INTERVIEW. THE WASHINGTON POST DID IT AND THOSE ARE THE TWO ASTRONAUTS THERE IN CREW DRAGON WAITING FOR THIS  COUNTDOWN CLOCK TO CONTINUE. THEY TALKED ABOUTED PRIDE AND  PATRIOTISM WITH AMERICA BEING ABLE TO GO UP FROM OUR SOIL.  RUSSIA HAS BEEN CHARGING THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE RIDES UP  TO THE HIT EL. BACK IN 2006, THE RUSSIANS CHARGED $21 MILLION A  SEAT AND IN 2015 IT WENT UP TO $82 MILLION A SEAT, SO A 300%  INCREASE. THERE IS AWAY FOR NASA TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN  DOMESTICALLY. I COVERED THE SHUTDOWN OF THE SHUTTLE FLEET. THIS WHOLE THING THAT IS HAPPENING TODAY HAS DEEP ROOTS BACK WITH THE COLOMBIA SHUTTLE DISASTER AND THE  DECISION TO RETIRE THE SHUTTLE FLEET. THE IDEA WAS THERE WOULD  BE A LITTLE GAP AND MAYBE THREE YEARS TO RELY ON THE RUSH SLIPS  TO GET TO ORBIT AND THREE YEARS TURNED INTO NINE YEARS. YES, AS  THE ASTRONAUT JUST SAID, THE U.S. SPACE PROGRAM IS A PREMIER  SPACE PROGRAM. WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO LAUNCH OUR ASTRONAUTS  OURSELVES AND THERE ARE REAL PROBLEMS WHEN YOU RELY SOLELY ON THE RUSSIANS. THEY WIND UP WITH SORT OF A DISPROPORTIONATE  NUMBER OF CREW ON THE SPACE STATION WHICH WE LARGELY PAID  FOR, SO IT HAS BEEN AN UNHAPPY ARRANGEMENT BUT IT HAS WORKED  AND THANK YOU RUSSIANS, EVEN AT THE WORST MOMENTS OF  U.S.-RUSSIAN RELATIONS, NASA AND THE RUSSIAN SPACE AGENCY MANAGED TO KEEP IT TOGETHER AND ASTRONAUTS IN ORBIT KEPT WORKING TOGETHER, AND SO THAT COLLABORATION HAS PATCHED OVER  THIS HUGE NINE-YEAR GAP IN LAUNCH CAPABILITY WHICH ENDS  TODAY. PAM, DID YOU THINK IT WOULD  TAKE THIS LONG, THAT IT WOULD BE A NINE-YEAR GAP BEFORE WE SAW  ANOTHER SPACECRAFT LAUNCH FROM AMERICAN SOIL HEADING TO THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IN PARTICULAR?   WELL, YOU KNOW, I'LL SAY THAT DOES TAKE A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP A NEW HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT SPACECRAFT. OF COURSE NASA HAS  BEEN WORKING ON ONE THAT IS LIEU NER CAPABLE OH RYAN FOR ALL THAT TIME, BUT THE FOCUS WAS SHIFTED AT SOME POINT TO 0 RYAN WAS  FOCUSED ON THE LUNAR MISSIONER AND THE CREW PICKED UP THE ONE  TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THE TRUTH IS, SOME OF  IT WAS ENGINEERING AND A LOT WAS POLITICS. IT WAS JUST CHANGING  BACK AND FORTH ON THE GOALS OF WHAT THE HUMAN SPACE LIFE  PROGRAM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE, AND THOSE CHANGES HAVE IMPACTS. YOU  HAVE CONTRACTS, YOU HAVE TO STOP PEOPLE FROM DOING ONE THING,  START SOMETHING ELSE IN THOSE EFFORTS AS WELL AND THAT HAS  BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE. I THINK WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO  FASTER IF THERE HAD BEEN AGREEMENT AND THEN THE ABILITY  TO HAVE STABILITY THROUGH POLITICS.   PAM, I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE SCREEN. YOU  CAN SEE THE CREW DRAGON AT THE TIP OF THE FALCON 9 ROCKET AND  YOU'RE SEEING IN THE LOWER PART OF THE SCREEN, AND THIS IS  MISSION CONTROL. WE WILL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON WHAT IS  HAPPENING THERE AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER  AND WE'LL LISTEN TO THE LIVE CALL WHEN THE COUNTDOWN FINALLY  HITS. FOR THE MOMENT, THOUGH, LET'S CHECK IN WITH WHITNEY. SHE IS A VIDEO JOURNALIST COVERING THIS STORY FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS  DURING THE BUILDUP AND SHE JOINS US NOW FROM PORT CANAVERAL,  FLORIDA. WHAT IS THE ENERGY LIKE?   Reporter: YES, I AM HERE AT RUSTY'S SEAFOOD AND OYSTER BAR  AND THE HISTORIC 39A LAUNCH PAD IS ACROSS THE WATER AWAY FROM  US, THE SAME PLACE APOLLO 11 LAUNCHED FROM AND OTHER HISTORIC LAUNCHES. WE'RE HOPING TO GET A GOOD STRU. EARLIER THERE WAS A  CROWD BUT THERE WAS RAIN AND IF IT CLEARS UP MORE, PEOPLE WILL  BE OUT HERE. THERE WERE GREAT EXPECTATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FOR THE RETURN OF HUMANS TO GO BACK TO SPACE FROM U.S. SOIL, AND WE TALKED TO THE ASTRONAUTS A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THIS PROJECT AND NA TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH IT MATTERS FOR PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND WATCH THIS, WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE  REENVYINGRATION OF NASA AND, OF COURSE COVID-19, CORONAVIRUS HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING. ORIGINAL ESTIMATES BEFORE THIS WERE  THAT'S ABOUT 500,000 PEOPLE WOULD COME TO THE SPACE COAST AS IT IS CALLED TO WATCH THIS AND THAT IS DOWN BY BY  ABOUT HALF. THEY SAID PEOPLE SHOULD STAY HOME AND WATCH FROM  THEIR COMPUTERS AND TVs US B THE BREVARD COUNTY SHERIFF AND WE'RE HERE IN BREVARD COUNTY SAID WE'RE OPEN FOR BUSINESS AND THAT THERE IS A 50% CAP CITY RULE THAT IS ALLOWED HERE AT  RESTAURANTS, SO, YES, WE'RE SEEING PEOPLE. WE TALKED TO SOME PEOPLE DOWN THE ROAD EARLIER AND PEOPLE ARE EXCITED TO WATCH  THIS. WELL, WHITNEY, YOU TALK ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS. WE'RE ALSO SEEING HAWTHORNE COME PLANNED  AND WE SEE PEOPLE WITH MASKS ON SO IT IS A NEW MOMENT FOR ALL OF US. YOU HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTING THIS TRAINING FOR THE LAST  COUPLE OF YEARS LEADING UP TO TODAY. WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT  OF RISKS WITH SPACE FLIGHT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT INVOLVES  PEOPLE. WHAT DID YOU SEE FOR THE SAFETY PREPARATIONS?   Reporter: YES. SPACE TRAVEL IS VERY RISKY LIKE YOU SAID.  BEING PREPARED FOR ANY EMERGENCY THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IS REALLY  CRUCIAL. WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS DOCUMENTING THE  COMMERCIAL CREW AND A LOT OF TIME WE SPENT WAS SEEING THEM PREPARE FOR EMERGENCIES. IF A FIRE HAPPENS, IF AIR PRESSURE DROPS,  WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY HAVE DONE THIS ON THE REPLICA AT THE SPACE STATION. THEY HAVE COLLEAGUES ROLL PLAY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO, HOW DO THEY COORDINATE WITH THEM IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY,  SO ALL THIS TRAINING IS REALLY THOROUGH AND METICULOUS.   IS THERE TRAINING THAT STANDS OUT TO YOU?   YES. THE EGRESS TRAINING IS THE MOST INTERESTING EMERGENCY  TRAINING THAT I SAW. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WHEN THE  ASTRONAUTS GO TO LAUNCH FROM SPACE, THEIR SPACECRAFT IS  ATTACHED TO A ROCKET AND IN THE CASE OF SpaceX THAT ROCKET IS  ABOUT 230 FEET HIGH. FOR BOEING WHICH IS THE OTHER COMPANY THAT  PLANS TO LAUNCH HUMANS INTO SPACE WITH NASA, THAT IS 170  FEET TALL OR 15 STORIES HIGH. SO WHEN THE ASTRONAUTS GO TO GET  INTO THEIR SPACECRAFT, THEY HAVE TO GO UP THIS TOWER ALONGSIDE  THE ROCKET AND THEY CLIMB IN FROM THE TOP. IF THERE IS AN  EMERGENCY, IF THERE IS A FUEL LEAK AND THERE IS A FEAR NAT  THERE MIGHT BE AN EXPLOSION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THEY HAVE  TO GET TO THE GROUND PRONTO, RIGHT? SO WALKING DOWN THAT  TOWER IS PROBABLY NOT QUICKLY ENOUGH. WHAT THEY DID, THEY  DESIGNED A ZIP-LINE SYSTEM AND IT ALLOWS THE ASTRONAUTS TO HOP  INTO THESE SEATS AND ZIP DOWN AT SPEEDS OF UP TO 40 MILES PER  HOUR AND WHEN THEY GET TO THE BOTTOM, THEY ARE ABOUT 1300 FEET AWAY FROM THE ROCKET. WHAT THEY DO, THEY CLIMB INTO THESE  ARMORED MILITARY VEHICLES AND THEY DRIVE TO A DESIGNATED SAFE  SPOT. YOU KNOW, I GOT TO FILM THIS FROM THE TOP AND FROM THE  BOTTOM AND FROM THE MILITARY VEHICLE. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY IN A LOT OF WAYS IT LOOKED LIKE FUN. IT LOOKED LIKE BEING IN  COSTA RICA AT A ZIP LINE OR REC CENTER AND IT TURNS OUT THAT A  COMPANY THAT DESIGNS THESE FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES DESIGNED  THIS ONE. THE ASTRONAUTS WERE HAVING A LOT OF FUN FOR SURE,  BUT IT IS ALSO JUST REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING. IT IS IMPORTANT THEY KNOW HOW TO USE  THE BRAKES AND HOW TO DRIVE THOSE VEHICLES, AND THEY HAVE TO KNOW WHERE TO GO, SO IT IS A VERY SERIOUS EXERCISE THAT THEY  DO. BACK TO YOU LIBBY.  THANK YOU. WE WILL BE  TALKING TO YOU THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.   TALK TO US ABOUT THE SAFETY TRAINING THAT GOES INTO THIS.  FOR THE ASTRONAUTS AND ALL PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES.   Reporter: YES. THAT IS A GREAT POINT. ACTUALLY I LOVE  WHITNEY'S DESCRIPTION AND I WAS STYLING BECAUSE OF COURSE THERE  WERE BASKETS AND ZIP LINES FROM THE SHUTTLE PAD, BUT THEY  WOULDN'T LET THE CREW PRACTICE IT. ONLY A COUPLE OF PEOPLE,  CHARLIE BOLDEN INCLUDING THE FORMER NASA AND MIN VAY TOR AND  SPACE COMMANDER WAS THE ASTRONAUT SELECTED TO TEST THAT  SYSTEM FOR THE SPACE SHUTTLE SO HE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT GOT THE  FUN RIDE. IT IS JUST REALLY IMPORTANT. IF ANYTHING GOES  WRONG, OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A LOT OF PROPELLANT ON THE PAD AND ONE OF THE JOBS THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS AN ASTRONAUT WAS TO BE PART  OF THE CLOSE OUT CREW TO PUT THEM IN THE SHUTTLE. THERE WERE  SUIT TECHNICIANS AND AN ASTRONAUT. YOU KNOW, YOUR KIND  OF THE LAST ONE TO SEE THE CREW. YOU HELP THEM STRAP IN. THEN YOU GET THE HECK OUT OF THERE AND YOU DRIVE A MINIMUM OF A COUPLE  MILES AWAY TO WATCH THE LAUNCH FROM A DISTANCE, SO SAFETY  TRAINING IS JUST INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR THE CREW. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER IS FUNDAMENTALLY AN AMAZING  INDUSTRIAL LOCATION. IT HAS THE ABSOLUTE CUTTING-EDGE IN GROUND  SUPPORT EQUIPMENT FOR SPACE FLIGHT HARDWARE AND THAT MEANS  THAT PEOPLE AROUND MACHINERY, BIG EQUIPMENT, CRANES AND SO  FORTH, AND SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE TAKE THAT  TRAINING SERIOUSLY. BUT LIKE WHITNEY SAID IT IS KIND OF FUN.  I HAVE GOTTEN UP IN A FIRE FLAME PROOF SUIT AND HAD FIRE TRAINING AND THAT WAS FUN.  [ LAUGHTER ] YOUR IDEA OF FUN MIGHT BE A  LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN MINE, PAM, BUT THAT IS WHAT MAKES YOU AN  ASTRONAUT.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS  QUESTION IN SAFETY. THEY HAD TO PROVE THEY CAN DO THIS SAFELY  FOR NASA TO GREEN LIGHT THIS PROCESS. WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT  SOME OF THE SPECIAL STEPS ARE THAT SpaceX HAS TAKEN TO FRY TO  INSURE SAFETY, BUT WHY AND HOW HAS -- DID SpaceX BE ABLE TO  PROVE TO NASA THEY ARE READY FOR THIS?   BECAUSE THEY ARE A START-UP COMPANY AND COMMERCIAL COMPANY  AND THEY ARE NOT BOEINGS, ALTHOUGH BOEING ALSO HAS A  COMMERCIAL CONTRACT LIKE SpaceX, SpaceX, THEY REALLY HAVE TO  PROVE THAT THEY ARE RELIABLE AND THAT THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK THE  GAMBLE ON COMMERCIAL CREW AND TOOK A GAMBLE AND SAID LET'S LET THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES DO IT UNDER COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS, THEY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THAT WAS WORTH THE GAMBLE WHICH WAS MADE  REALLY THE INITIAL CONTRACTS WERE CAR GO AND IT GOES BACK TO  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATION STARTED THE CREW PROGRAM, BUT WHAT THE SPECIFIC THINGS THEY HAD TO DO,  THEY HAD TO HAVE AWAY TO RESCUE THE ASTRONAUTS IF THERE WAS AN  ANOMALY, SUCH AS AN EXPLOSION ON THE PAD OR EXPLOSION AS THE  ROCKET IS IN THE A SCENT STAGE. THEY HAVE GREAT ENGINEERS, I  BELIEVE IN PART BECAUSE AND MAYBE THE OTHER PANEL LISTS CAN  WEIGH IN ON THIS. ELON MUSK IS NOT JUST ABOUT LAUNCHING INTO  ORBIT. HE WANTS TO GO TO MARS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE IN  THAT.  JOEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I  WOULD LIKE TO BRING IN CHRISTIAN DAVENPORT NOW WHO IS JOINING US  FROM KENNEDY SPACE CENTER. HE COVERS THE SPACE INDUSTRY AND  NOT ONLY HAS HE CHRONICLED THIS FOR YEARS, BUT WROTE A BOOK  ABOUT THE COMPETITION AMONG THE COMPANIES CALLED THE SPACE  BARRONS. THANK YOU. YOU'RE DOING DUB DUTY AS WELL AS TALKING TO  US. I WANT TO FOLLOW-UP ABOUT SAFETY. SpaceX DESIGNED THIS SO  THE DRAGON, THE CREW DRAGON CAPSULE CAN ACT LIKE A LIFE BOAT IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY. IF THE ROCKET BLOWS UP, IT CAN SEPARATE AND TRY TO BRING THE ASTRONAUTS TO SAFETY USING THESE DRAGO  THISSERS. HOW INNOVATIVE IS THIS?   YES. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT LIBBY. THINK OF AN EJECTS  SEAT. THE DRAGON SPACECRAFT HAS EIGHT TO PROPEL THE SPACECRAFT  AWAY FROM THE BOOSTER IF THERE IS ANY KIND OF EMERGENCY AT ALL. IT IS LIKE A CORK POPPING OFF A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE. THEY DID DO  THIS A FEW YEARS AGO. THEN CAME BACK AND DID AN IN-FLIGHT ABORT  TEST SO THEY SHOT THE ROCKET INTO SPACE AND IT WAS RIGHT NEAR ONE OF THE MOMENTS WHEN THE ROCKET WAS UNDER THE MOST ARROW DYNAMIC PRESSURE POINTS IN A SCE NT SYSTEM AND SHOOTING IT AWAY. THAT WAS A SUCCESS S, BUT  WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT AND THAT IS A FEATURE THE SPACE  SHUTTLE DID HAVE. BUT THAT SHUT S EL WAS  ATTACHED TO THE SIDE AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO EJECT FROM THE  BOOSTER. THIS IS SORT OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THAT IT CAN POP  OFF AND THAT WAY IT GIVES NASA A LOT OF PEACE OF MIND. BUT THAT'S VERY SAME SYSTEM WHEN THEY TESTED IT, THEY WERE TESTING THE ABORT ENGINES  THIS IS ONE OF THE COOLEST EXERCISES.  YOU HEARD FROM SUNNY WILLIAMS AND WE FILMED HER AMONG OTHER  ASTRONAUTS. THIS IS AT THE BUOYANCY LAB. IT IS A GIANT POOL AND 10 OLYMPIC SIZE SWIMMING POOLS SIT INSIDE THIS ONE POOL  AND IT ACTUALLY I UNDERSTAND TOOK AN ENTIRE MONTH TO FILL  THIS POOL WITH WATER, SO THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU A SENSE OF JUST  HOW BIG IT IS. AND YOU KNOW, WHEN THE ASTRONAUTS GO DOWN  UNDER WATER, THE REASON THEY ARE DOING THIS TRAINING, THEY ARE  ABLE TO PRACTICE AS THEY WOULD FOR A SPACEWALK SO THEY ARE  DOING SOME OF THE TASKS THEY WOULD DO DURING THAT TIME AND IT ALSO SIMULATES WEIGHTLESSNESS IN A WAY THAT'S NOTING ELSE DOES ON EARTH. BEFORE THEY GO DOWN, THEY PUT ON RETIRED SPACESUITS AND I  LEARNED THAT SPACESUITS COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO  MAKE. TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO THIS IS KIND OF COOL THAT THESE SUITS ARE GETTING A SECOND LIFE DURING THIS  TRAINING, RIGHT? AND YOU KNOW, A WHOLE CREW OF SUPPORT DIVERS GO  WITH THEM UNDER WATER. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HELP THE ASTRONAUTS  AND THOSE WHO ARE FILMING SO THE CONTROL CENTER UPSTAIRS CAN SEE  WHAT IS HAPPEN AND DIRECT THE ASTRONAUTS AND MY COLLEAGUE  WHITNEY WHOM I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF  YEARS, ALSO NAMED WHITNEY, SHE IS DIVE CERTIFIED AND SHE GOT TO GO DIVE WITH THE ASTRONAUTS. IT WAS A RIGOROUS TEST THEY MAKE  HER TAKE BUT SHE EVENTUALLY WENT DOWN AND SHE MADE ME  SUPERJEALOUS. SHE HAS HER DIVE CERTIFICATION AND SIGH DON'T BUT WE GOT THIS GREAT FOOTAGE. HOW DOES IT CHANGE TO THE  TRAINING IN THE POOL? I'M NOT DIVE CERTIFIED. I  HAVE DIVED ONCE ON ASSIGNMENT HERE IN FLORIDA IN THE FLORIDA  KEYS FOR A CLIMATE CHANGE STORY AND I LEARNED THAT RECREATIONAL  DIVERS GO UNDER FOR ABOUT A HALF-HOUR AT A TIME ON AVERAGE.  THAT IS WHAT THEIR TANKS CAN DO WITH THE OXYGEN. THEY GO FOR  OVER SIX HOURS. THE REASON IS THAT IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY  WOULD SPEND ON THEIR SPACE WALK AND TECHNICALLY THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT BECAUSE IT IS PUMPING OXYGEN INTO THEIR SPACESUIT.  THEY ARE DOWN THERE DOING ALL THESE TASKS AND FOR EVERY HOUR  THEY SPEND ON A SPACEWALK, THEY HAVE TO SPEND SEVEN TO EIGHT  HOURS IN THE POOL TRAINING SO IT IS A LOT OF TIME IN THE POOL BUT VERY CRUCIAL TRAINING THEY ARE DOING DOWN THERE. BACK TO YOU  LIBBY. LET'S TALK TO ONE OF THOSE  ASTRONAUTS THAT WE SAW TRAINING IN THE POOL. SUNNY WILLIAMS, WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOOTAGE OF YOU AND GOING DOWN A ZIP LINE. WHAT DO YOU DO THESE DAYS TO  STAY IN SHAPE AND KEEP SHARP? THANKS FOR THE QUESTION,  BECAUSE THERE ARE A WHOLE CREW OF US STILL TRAINING. BOB AND  DOUG ARE THE TIP OF THE SPHERE HERE AND LEADING THE WAY FOR THE REST OF US TO GO ON COMMERCIAL CREW AND WE HAVE DRAGON WITH  SpaceX AND WE HAVE SOMETHING WITH BOEING AND THAT IS WHAT I'M ON. I'M ON THE STARLINER AND I'LL BE THE COMMANDER OF THAT  MISSION AND I'M PREPARING FOR THAT SO THAT MEANS LIVING ON THE SPACE STATION AND DOING TRAINING AND VISITING VEHICLES, SCIENCE  EXPERIMENT TRAINING SO IT HAS BEEN BUSY. WE'RE IN THE DEVELOP  THE PHASE OF STARLINER SO WE'RE COMING UP WITH TECHNIQUES HOW TO MANUALLY FLY THE SPACECRAFT AS WELL AS REVIEW AND UNDERSTAND  THE AUTOMATION. THERE IS A LOT GOING ON PARALLEL TO SpaceX.  YOU'LL SEE NEW SUITS, NEW SPACE CRAFTS. YOU'LL SEE IT LOADND ON  AN ATLAS 5. IT WILL BE AWE SUM WHEN YOU SEE THE DRAGON AND THE  STARLINER AND THEN THE SOYUZ. IT IS A SPECTACULAR TIME PAVING IT  WAY FOR THE ARTEMIS PROGRAM. THOSE SPACE SUITS ARE SO  EXCITING TO HOW IT HAS CHANGEND AND MODERNIZE THE. TELL US ABOUT THE SPACESUITS VERSUS THOSE. THE BIG DIFFERENCE EVERYONE  WILL SEE IS THE COLOR. THESE GUYS ARE IN THE SLICK WHITE  SUITS AND THEY HAD SOMETIME OUT AT SpaceX WORKING WITH THE  WONDERFUL PEOPLE DESIGNING THEM. THE THAT IS BLUE. IT IS MADE BY  A COMPANY IN MASSACHUSETTS, DAVID CLARK. THEY HAVE MADE MANY PRESSURE SUITS IN THE PAST BUT LIGHTER WEIGHT, NEWER MATERIAL,  THE QUOTE, UNQUOTE BOOTS ARE LIKE SNEAKERS SO YOU CAN MOVE IN THOSE QUICKLY AND THEY DON'T WEIGH VERY MUCH. THE HELMET  DESIGN IS INTEGRATED INTO THE SPACESUIT LIKE THE SpaceX SUIT,  BUT IT IS CLOSED WITH A ZIPPER SO THIS IS REALLY AMAZINGLY NEW  TECHNOLOGY THAT IS ALLOWING US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE  LIGHTS WEIGHT MATERIALS AND MAKE THESE SUITS A LITTLE MORE  COMFORTABLE, A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE AND JUST AS SAFE TO  PROTECT US WHENWAY GO INTO SPACE AND LAUNCH AND COME BACK FOR  ENTRY. WELL, WE HAVE AN UPDATE FROM  NA SATURDAY WE'RE WATCHING FOR WEATHER. THEY WILL TELL US MORE  IN A COUPLE MINUTES. JOEL IS THE QUESTION OF IF THINGS WILL BE  ABLE TO PROCEED BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER.   YES. I MEAN, THINGS CAN CHANGE SO QUICKLY IN FLORIDA  WITH THESE POPCORN THUNDERSTORMS AND SO I THINK THAT IS THE BIG  QUESTION, IS WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO GET LUCKY AND GET A LAUNCH OR -- I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ASKED EARLIER  ABOUT JIM BRIDENSTINE TWEETING OUT LIKE A POLL. IS IT AGO, NO  GO? WHAT IS YOUR VOTE? GIVEN THE HISTORY OF WHAT  HAPPENED WITH THE CHALLENGER IN 198, NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE ANY CHANCES FOR POLITICAL REASONS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS THERE.  THAT WOULD BE A TRAGIC ERROR TO EVEN THINK OF THAT. YOU WANT TO  GO WITH BEST PRACTICES AND NOT MESS WITH THE WEATHER.   FRANK, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHECKS AND THE SYSTEMS THAT WERE IN PLACE WHEN YOU WERE FLYING THAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN  BEHIND THE SCENES. WE SEE HAWTHORNE COMMAND WHERE SpaceX  IS. WE CAN SEE THE ROCKET READY TO GO ON LAUNCH PAD 39A BUT WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES WITH PEOPLE MAKING THESE  BIG DECISIONS? THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE  ON THE SHUTTLE PROGRAM THAT WERE MAKING THESE DECISIONS AND THESE INPUTS ALL GOING THE TO THE LAUNCH DIRECTOR WITH A VOTE FROM THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR AND THE HOUSTON TEAM AND THEY WERE  MONITORING EVERYTHING GOING ON ON THE SHUTTLE WHICH WAS  EXTREMELY COME COMPLICATED VEHICLE OF COURSE. ON THE SHRUBS I HAD, THEY WERE ALL SYSTEM PROBLEMS, NO WEATHER PROBLEMS,  BUT ON MY THIRD MISSION IT WAS A WEATHER PROBLEM AND WE HAD  PEOPLE JUST LIKE HERE ALL OVER THE WORLD CHECKING THE WEATHER  FOR ABORT SITES, FOR THE WEATHER OFF THE COAST IN CASE YOU HAD TO BAIL OUT. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE CREW'S SAFETY  AND LIKE PAM, WE WERE SITTING IN THE NINE-MINUTE HOLE TRYING TO  DECIDE WHAT TO HAVE FOR DINNER THAT NIGHT, PIZZA AND THEY SAID  WE'RE GOING PICKING IN THE COUNT RIGHT NOW, BOOM. NINE MINUTES  LATER WE LAUNCHED AND WE LUCKILYWAY WERE NOT UNSTRAPPING, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE CHECKING THEIR SYSTEMS VERY  CAREFULLY. I HAD A GUY TELL ME, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE THINGS  DO, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FAIL BECAUSE OF MY  SYSTEM. THAT IS THE GREAT THING ABOUT AMERICAN INGENUITY AND  CAN-DO SPIRIT OF GETTING US BACK INTO SPACE.   HE MENTIONED THE ARTEMIS PROGRAM. PAM, WHAT ARE YOU  WATCHING FOR FOR THE ARTEM MUS PROGRAM?   OH IT IS INCREDIBLY EXCITING. TO THINK ABOUT GOING BACK TO THE MOON, NOT JUST ON A CAMPING TRIP WHICH IS WHAT APOLLO WAS.  BASICALLY CARRIED SOME -- EVERYTHING WE NEEDED WITH US AND BRUT A LITTLE EXTRA BACK HOME IN TERMS OF ROCKS AND THINGS LIKE  THAT, BUT IT IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW TO LIVE IN  SPACE AND DO SCIENCE AND EXPLORE IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY, SO TO ME  THAT IS REALLY EXCITING. THE PIECES. IT IS NOT A CAMPING  TRIP. IT IS THE MAYFLOWER. WE ARE GOING AND WE'RE GOING TO  UNDERSTAND HOW TO HAVE A PERMANENT PRESENCE IN DEEP  SPACE, BEYOND EARTH'S ORBIT. WE HAVE DONE THAT WITH THE SPACE  STATION AND LEARNED A LOT AND NOW WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO  THAT ON OTHER PLANETS. ARTEMIS IS THE TWIN OF  APOLLO. ARTEMIS IS A WOMAN SO SUNNY WILLIAMS, IS THERE A REAL  PUSH INNA SA TO MAKE SURE THERE IS A DIVERSE CREW TO BE READY TO GO INTO SPACE? YOU KNOW, LIBBY, IT HAS JUST  COME NATURALLY AS WOMEN HAVE OVER THE PAST COUPLE DECADES  HAVE REALLY MOVED UP IN THE S.T.E.M. CAREERS AND WE'RE  FINDING AS WE HAVE SELECTED ASTRONAUTS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF GROUPS, WE'RE GETTING ALMOST EQUALLY AS MANY WOMEN EQUALLY  QUALIFIED IF NOT MORE THAN THE MEN SIGNING UP, AS EL W. OF  COURSE IT IS A NATIONAL PROGRESSION AND IT WILL HAPPEN.  WE HAVE GOT IN THE LATEST CLASSES,  CHRISTINA AND ANNE MCCLAIN, SPACEWALK KERR NUMBER ONE. THESE ARE AMAZING, TALENTED LADIES WHO ARE UP FOR THE CHALLENGE.  NICOLE. STARLINER. SHE IS RIGHT THERE. THE NEWEST CLASS AS WELL. ALL THESE GUYS, I THINK WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO SELECT THE BEST AND THEY WILL BE UP FOR THE CHALLENGE WHEN IT COMES.   SUNNY WILLIAMS, PART OF THE COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM. WE'RE  WATCHING TO SEE NEXT STEPS HERE. IT IS CLOSE TO LAUNCH TIME. THE  SCHEDULED LAUNCH TIME IS 4:33:00 P.M. LET ME REMIND YOU, IF IT  GETS SCRUBBED FOR ANY REASON, THE NEXT LAUNCH WINDOW IS THIS  SATURDAY AND THEN THE FOLLOWING ONE AFTER THAT IS SUNDAY.   LET'S LISTEN UP. LAUNCH CONTROL. WE WOULD  PROCEED INTO THE LAUNCH ABORT AUDIENCE SEQUENCE PLEASE.   STARTED.  LAUNCH ABORT HAS STARTED.  SUNNY WILLIAMS, WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?   DID I HEAR WHAT YOU SAID, LAUNCH ABORT HAS STARTED?   YES. OH, WOW. WELL THIS HAPPENED  TO FRANK AND ME. PAM, I AM NOT REMEMBERING BUT YOU HAVE WAITED  FOR THIS MOMENT FOR A LONG TIME. THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO  TURN IT AROUND AND DO IT AGAIN. WE'RE STILL WATCHING TO SO  WHAT WILL HAPPEN, SO LET'S KEEP MONITORING JOEL. THE BIG  QUESTION NOW IS, IS THIS SCRUBBING?   YES. I MEAN, THAT IS WHAT THEY SAID. IT HAS TO BE THE  WEATHER. JUST MONITORING THE ONLINE WORD, WE HAVEN'T HAD AN  OFFICIAL WORD BUT PRESUMABLY THE WEATHER HAS CAUSED THIS ISSUE  AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY AGAIN ON SATURDAY UNLESSWAY MISS HEARD  THAT ANNOUNCEMENT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO THE  SEQUENCE OF -- THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LOAD THE NEXT BIT OF  PROPELLANT THEY WERE GOING TO PUT IN, THE LIQUID OXYGEN.   I WANT TO SAY NASA IS CONFIRMING THIS LAUNCH IS  OFFICIALLY SCRUBBED AND I'M SO SORRY TO TELL YOU ALL THAT. IT  WILL NOT HAPPEN TODAY. THAT IS THE WORD FROM NA SATURDAY. THE  NEXT POSSIBLE LAUNCH WINDOWS ARE THIS WEEKEND. FIRST WINDOW IS  SATURDAY, MAY 30th AT 3:22:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME. THE SECOND  POSSIBLE WHIP DOUGH, THE NEXT DAY, SUNDAY MAY 31st AT 3:00  P.M. EASTERN TIME. PLEASE STAY WITH US AS WE MONITOR WHAT IS  HAPPENING NEXT. YOU WERE TAKING US THROUGH  THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE. JOEL, PLEASE CONTINUE.   NO, I MEAN THIS IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING, BUT THIS IS ALSO  IN A WAY IT IS A SIGN OF THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE PEOPLE  INVOLVED. THEY ARE NOT MESSING AROUND. THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE  SURE THEY GET THIS RIGHT, AND I THINK IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE  WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND FIRST LADY AND VICE  PRESIDENT AND THE HEAD OF NASA AND EVERYONE ELSE IS THERE WITH  THE BIG PLANE HAVING FLOWN INTO SAY, 16 MINUTES IN ADVANCE OF  THE SCHEDULED LAUNCH, OR 17 MINUTES TO SAY, WE'RE NOT GOING  TO DO THIS. THAT JUST SHOWS NASA AND SpaceX UNDERSTAND THE  WEATHER AND THEY SAW -- THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW. I DON'T  KNOW THE EXACT LAUNCH ABORT SEQUENCE, BUT GIVEN THE FUEL,  PROPELLANT WAS ON THE ROCKET OR BEING LOADED, THE CARO SEEN FIRST AT SOME OF THE LIQUID  OXYGEN, I THINK THAT THIS WILL TAKE AWHILE FOR THEM TO GO  THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF THE LAUNCH ABORT.   SO WE HAVE IT THAT IT IS WEATHER THAT IS THE REASON FOR  THIS SCRUBBED LAUNCH. FRANK, YOU HAVE BEEN IN THIS POSITION  BEFORE. REMIND US FRANK, YOU HAD A MISSION SCRUBBED FIVE TIMES?   ACTUALLY,WAY SCRUBBED THREE TIMES AND THEN WE HAD OTHER ONES WE NEVER GOT STARTED AND THEN WE FINALLY LAUNCHED ON THE FIFTH  TRIP TO THE PAD. THE ONE BEFORE THAT, WE GOT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THREE SECONDS WITH THE ENGINES RUNNING SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT  THE ADRENALIN LEVEL IS AT THAT POINT AND WHEN THE ENGINE SHUT  DOWN, HE SAID I THOUGHT WE WOULD BOW A LOT HIGHER WHEN THE ENGINE SHUT OFF. I BLAMED MY PILOT, BUT IT WASN'T HIS FAULT. IT WAS THE  RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE SOMETHING IN THE ENGINE WASN'T  WORKING CORRECTLY BUT IT IS VERY DIGS A POINTING AND IT TOOK THEM AN HOUR TO GET TO THE LAUNCH PAD TO UNLOAD US FROM THE SHUTTLE  AND THAT IS WHAT IT WILL TAKE FOR THIS, TOO. KNOWING YOU HAVE  ALL THAT FUEL ON BOARD AND VERY CLOSE TO YOU AND THERE IS NOBODY WITHIN 3 1/2 MILES, SO DOUG AND BOB ARE PROFESSIONALS AND THEY  ARE DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO ON THE CHECKLIST BUT IT IS DISAPPOINTING BUT WHAT I TOLD ONE OF THE NEWS AGENCIES  AFTER THAT SCRUB WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS GOING ON, JUST LIKE THIS, ALL YOU'RE DOING IS DELAYING ANOTHER SUCCESS. IT  IS NOT A FAILURE AT ALL. IN FACT, IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.   WELL, JIM SIGNED THE -- NO LAUNCH TODAY. SAFETY FOR OUR  CREW MEMBERS. YOU CAN USE TWITTER HANDLES   BOB BEHNKEN AND DOUG HURLEY ARE OUR TOP PRIORITY. HE SAID  WE'LL TRY, TRY AGAIN TO LAUNCH AMERICA ON SATURDAY AT 3:22:00  P.M. EASTERN TIME. THAT IS COMING FROM THE NASA  ADMINISTRATOR HIMSELF. SUNNY WILLIAMS, THIS IS PART OF THE  JOB, RIGHT, FOR THE ASTRONAUTS AND ALL EL PEOPLE WORKING?   ABSOLUTELY. FRANK MENTIONED IT. IT IS THE PROFESSIONALISM.  JOEL MENTIONED IT ALSO. THE PROFESSIONAL LIVE AND MATURITY  FOR THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE THAT THEY KNOW WHEN IT IS THE RIGHT  TIME TO LAUNCH AND WHEN IT IS NOT. WEATHER WAS A FACTOR TODAY, BUT WE'RE READY FOR THAT. WE KNOW THAT COULD HAPPEN. THIS  VEHICLE IS STILL FUELED AND IN A DANGEROUS POSITION, SO EVERYONE  HAS TO MAINTAIN AND CONTINUE TO DO THEIR JOB PROFESSIONALLY TO  SECURE THE LAUNCH ABORT SYSTEM AND GET OUT TO THE LAUNCH PAD  AND GET BOB AND DOUG OUT OF THE SPACECRAFT AND GET IT REFUELS.  WE KNOW THIS PROCESS. WE PRACTICED THIS. WE KNOW WHAT  WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. SO WE'RE READY FOR IT. IT IS A LITTLE  EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER LIKE JOEL SAID, BUTWAY UNDERSTAND IT  AND WE GET OUR FAMILIES READY FOR IT. THEY ARE PREPARED FOR  IT. BOTH OF THESE ASTRONAUTS ARE  MARRIED TO ASTRONAUTS. THEY ARE MARRIED TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW THIS  INTIMATELY. LET'S GO TO CHRIS DAVENPORT WHO IS DOWN IN  FLORIDA. YIS, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW?  WE KNOW THE LAUNCH WAS SCRUBND AND THAT WEATHER WAS A FACTOR.   Reporter: YES. THAT IS ALWAYS A DISAPPOINTMENT. YOU COVER  SPACE LONG ENOUGH, YOU REALIZE THESE THINGS SCRUB ALL THE TIME. I HAVE BEEN ON A LOT OF LAUNCHES, BIG ANTICIPATION, NOT  QUITE LIKE THIS, BUT LAUNCHING SATELLITE AND CAR GO AND NO  HUMANS AND THEY HAVE SCRUBBED REPEATEDLY. COMPUTER BACK ON  SATURDAY AND IT MIGHT NOT WORK, BUT FOR HUMAN ASTRONAUTS ON  BOARD, THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH. ANY LITTLE THING THAT IS OFF,  THEY ARE GOING TO CALL IT. THEY HAVE TO. THE NASA ADMINISTRATOR  TWEETED THAT SAFETY IS THE TOP PRIORITY. THAT IS WHAT IS GOING  TO HAPPEN NOW. HERE IS WHERE THEY ARE. BOB AND DOUG ARE STILL ON TOP OF THE ROCKET. THEY HAVE TO GET ALL THE PROPELLENTS OUT  OF THE ROCKET AND DE FUEL IT AND MEANTIME THE ABORT SYSTEM WILL  STAY ACTIVE THE WHOLE TIME IN CASE THERE ARE PROBLEMSN'T ONCE  IT IS CLEAR, THEY WILL GET BOSTON BRUINS AND  BOB AND DOING OUT AND TRY IT ANOTHER DAY. THE ADMINISTRATOR  TALKED ABOUT THIS AND ASKED LEADING IN THE DAYS LEADING UP  TO THE LAUNCH, WILL YOU FEEL PRESSURE OR LAUNCH FEVER WITH  THE PRESIDENT HERE AND ALL THE PRESS HERE? WITH ALL THIS  ATTENTION, AND HE SAID SAFETY HAS TO BE THE TOP PRIORITY. SO  HE TEXTED WITH BOB AND DOUG AND SAID IF YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE  IN ANY WAY, I'LL CALL IT OFF. IT IS SpaceX'S LAUNCH BUT NASA  COULD STEP IN THERE SO IT IS A DISAPPOINTMENT BUT THESE THINGS  HAPPEN. DOES THE CORONAVIRUS AND  PANDEMIC COME COMPLICATE THINGS? THEY WERE IN QUARANTINE LEADING  UP TO THIS, BUT HOW DOES THAT AFFECT HAVING TO GET EVERYTHING  ROLLING AGAIN FOR SATURDAY? Reporter: YES. I MEAN, THEY  HAVE THE CREWS HERE AND THEY HAVE SAID LEADING UP TO THIS  LAUNCH, TO GET EVERYTHING READY, THEY WERE PRACTICING SOCIAL  DISTANCING, AND ALL OF THAT. BOB AND DOUG HAVE  BEEN IN QUARANTINE EXTREME FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AND TESTING  EVERYONE ELSE AROUND THEM SO OBVIOUSLY ALL OF THAT WILL  CONTINUE. THEY HAVE TO TAKE CARE NOT JUST OF THE ROCKET AND THE  SPACECRAFT BUT MAKE SURE BOB AND DOUG STAY HEALTHY AND THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM STAY HEALTHY AND INSURE ANOTHER LAYER OF  DIFFICULTY WHERE NOTHING CAN GO WRONG. THERE IS NO MARGIN OF  ERROR AND THAT DOES COME COMPLICATE THINGS.   CHRIS DAVENPORT LIVE FROM FLORIDA. THANKS. JOEL, WHAT  QUESTIONS ARE YOU GOING TO BE ASKING AS WE LOOK TO LAUNCH ON  SATURDAY? WELL, THE FIRST THING, AT THE MOMENT BOB AND DOUG ARE STILL IN THE CAPSULE THAT HAS TO HAVE THE PROPELLANT REMOVED. IT TAKES 40 MINUTES TO GET  ALL THE PROPELLANT OUT. THEY ONLY STARTED THAT LOAD  AT T-35 MINUTES AND I BELIEVE IT WAS AROUND 17 MINUTES THAT THEY  CALLED IT. I'M SURE THAT CHRIS AND OTHERS WILL ASK THEM, WHAT  CHANGED IN THOSE MOMENTS BETWEEN T-35 AND T-17 BECAUSE IDEALLY  YOU WOULD WANT TO CALL THE ABORT PRIOR TO LOADING THE PROPELLANT  AND MAYBE EVEN 45 MINUTES BEFORE LAUNCH, SO THE WHOLE PROCEDURES  OF IT, BUT RIGHT NOW, LET'S WATCH AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY  GET OUT OF THERE SAFELY AND CAN DO IT AGAIN IN THREE DAYS, BUT  IT IS STILL KIND OF A DICEY SITUATION WITH ALL THAT FUEL AND AS FRANK SO PERFECTLY PHRASED IT, NO ONE AROUND FOR 3 1/2  MILES. PAM MEL ROY, NEXT STEPS  YOU'LL BE WATCHING GOING FORWARD HERE?   WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT IS GREAT IF -- SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS  THE WEATHER WHICH IS WONDERFUL. IT IS TERRIBLE IF IT IS A  PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE YOU'RE TRYING TO PARS OUT AND FIGURE IT OUT AND SO FORTH. I GUESS I'M LOOKING AT THIS AS A DRESS RAE  HER SAL AND IT WENT INCREDIBLY SMOOTHLY KNOCK ON WOOD FOR THE A PREACH TO THIS, FOR  THE APPROACH FOR THIS SO IT GIVES EVERYONE ON THE TEAM A  TIME TO REST AND RELAX. WHAT IS REALLY TOUGH WHEN YOU TRY TO DO  TWO OR THREE DAYS IN A ROW BECAUSE IT IS A LOT OF TENSION,  IT IS VERY INTENSE, SO THIS IS A GOOD THING. IT WILL GIVE  EVERYONE A BIT OF A BREAK AND THE CREW WILL GET TO SEE THEIR  FAMILIES, THEIR SPOUSES TONIGHT.  EXPLAIN WHY THESE WINDOWS?  WHY WON'T WE SEE ANOTHER LAUNCH WINDOW UNTIL SATURDAY AND THEN  SUNDAY AFTERNOON AS ANOTHER BACKUP DAY?  WELL, SO I'M NOT 100% SURE ON THE SHUTTLE WE SLIPPED EVERY 20  MINUTES EVERY DAY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE  ASPECTS OF THE VEHICLE AND ORBITAL MECHANICS BUT IT MAY BE  BECAUSE THEY SAW THE WEATHER FORECAST, AS WELL. YES, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A WINDOW. YOU'RE CHASING THE SPACE STATION OFF  THE PAD. THERE IS A NARROW WINDOW TO GET INTO THE SAME  ORBITAL PLANE AND IT TAKES A LOT OF PROPELLANT TO SHIFT YOUR  ORBITAL PLANE TO CATCH UP WITH THE STATION SO YOU NEED TO BE AL LINED WITH IT SO YOU JUST SIMPLY HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT  OPPORTUNITY. AND SUNNY WILLIAMS, WHEN WE  TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER, WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING FATHER WEATHER  RIGHT THERE AT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE  REGION IN CASE SOMETHING WENT WRONG AND THE ASTRONAUTS HAD TO  EJECT AND GO TO SAFETY, SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT A COMPLEX OF  VARIABLES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER.   ABSOLUTELY. IT IS ALL UP THE EAST COAST AND LIKE AIRPLANES  FLY THE CIRCULAR ROUTE. WE'RE FLYING A CIRCULAR ROUTE AS WELL, ACROSS CANADA, ICELAND, IRELAND. ALL THAT WEATHER ALSO HAS TO BE  SLIGHTLY COMPATIBLE JUST IN CASE YOU HAVE AN ABORT AND THEN  HOPEFULLY THE RESCUE FORCES WILL BE ABLE TO GO AND PICK YOU UP IN THOSE AREAS. WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THAT WEATHER. THERE ARE  HIGHER PROBABILITY AREAS SO MISSION MANAGEMENT TEAM THAT  FRANK WAS TALKING ABOUT, ALL THE PEOPLE MAKING THE BIG DECISIONS, THEY ARE WEIGHING ALL THOSE FACTORS IN WHEN THEY ARE  DECIDING WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO LAUNCH OR NOT LAUNCH. IT IS A  BIG JOB TO FIGURE OUT ALL THAT. HATS OFF TO THEM FOR DECIDING  TODAY THE WEATHER OFF THE COAST IS JUST TRICKY IN FLORIDA IN THE SUMMERTIME. WE ALL KNOW THAT, BUT THEY WILL GET OFF. THEY WILL BE PLAYING BEFORE LONG. WEATHER WILL BE NICE.   WILL YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMERCIAL CREW TEAM GET TO  TALK TO BOB AND DOUG OR MESSAGE WITH THEM IN SOME WAY?   OH, YES. THEY WILL BE -- THEY WERE PROBABLY DREADING THEY ARE  GOING TO LOOK AT THEIR E-MAIL AGAIN, BUT I'M SURE THEY WILL BE E-MAILING AND MESSAGING AND PROBABLY CHATTING ABOUT HOW  EVERYTHING WENT AND WAS IT AS YOU EXPECTND AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND ALSO GIVING THEM TIME, BECAUSE LIKE PAM SAID THIS GIVES THEM A BREATHER AND THEY CAN RELAX AND SEE THEIR FAMILIES AND THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR THEM. WE'RE ALL NOSEY AND WE WANT TO KNOW HOW THINGS WENT AND THEY ARE GRACIOUS AND  PROFESSIONAL SO AIM SURE THEY WILL WANT TO GIVE US FEEDBACK AS WELL. WE CAN SEE JUST THE TOP OF  YOUR SHIRT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE THE OLD SCHOOL NASA LOGO,  THE WORLD, WHO GREW UP A COUPLE DECADES AGO REMEMBER IT. THIS IS BRINGING BACK THE OLD SCHOOL NASA LOOK INSTEAD OF THE  MEATBALL AS THEY CALL IN THE. TELL US ABOUT SORT OF HOW THIS  BRINGS THE OLD AND THE NEW TOGETHER?   YES. I STAU IT'S ON THE SPACES. I WAS MENTIONING WE HAVE WORKED WITH SpaceX FOR A LONG TIME AND GETTING THEIR SUITS  READY TO GO AND WHEN I SAW THE WORM ON THE SUIT, I SAID WE HAVE TO BE PART OF THIS EVENT. AND IT BRINGS A  DIFFERENT GROUP OF PEOPLE WATCHING WHAT IS GOING ON. IT  HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT TODAY LIKE JIM MENTIONED WE WANT TO GET THE YOUNGER GENERATION TO GET INSPIRED AND PSYCHED ABOUT THE  AMAZING THINGS THE PEOPLE AT NASA AND ALL OF THE SPACE  AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE DOING. THIS IS GREAT STUFF.  THESE ARE LIKE THE SMARTEST AMAZING ENGINEERS WHO ARE  HELPING WITH COVID-19 SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS DOING THEIR SPACE  JOB. WE WANT MORE PEOPLE TO JOIN IN, BECAUSE IT IS REALLY GOOD.  BRINGING THAT BACK, THE OLD LOGO WITH THE KNEW IS JUST RETRO IS  IN AND I THINK WE LIKE IT. IT IS JUST AS MUCH AS WE LIKE THE  MEATBALL. FINALLY, WHAT DO YOU DO  TOMORROW? WHAT DO YOU DO TOMORROW AND ONCE WE DO SEE THIS SpaceX ROCKET GOING INTO ORBIT WE SEE IT JOINED THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, ARE YOU JUST GLUED TO MONITORING  WHAT IS GOING ON? HOW MUCH ARE YOU TOTALLY FOCUSED ON THAT AND  HOW DIFFERENT WILL TOMORROW BE BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE DOING THAT?  IT IS INTERESTING. I THINK WOE ALL WANT TO KNOW AND SEE HOW THE MISSION GOES. WE HAVE SEEN DRAGON GO TO THE SPACE STATION  BEFORE. WE HAVE SEEN THE PROFILE HOW THEY ARE GOING TO GET THERE, BUT WITH TWO PEOPLE IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT SO IT WAS  DEFINITELY GOING TO BE ON EVERYONE'S LIST TO WATCH THAT  DOCKING AND HATCH OPENING AND SEA THEM GO IN, BUT WE'RE  PROBABLY GOING TO DO THAT ON SUNDAY SO THAT IS OKAY. TOMORROW WE TRUST THE WORK AT HAND WHICH IS FOR ME, AGAIN, JUMPING IN THE BOEING STARLINER SIMULATOR AND WORKING THROUGH THE MANUAL  FLYING PROCEDURES THAT WE'LL HAVE TO BACK US UP FOR THE  AUTOMATION SO IT IS WORK AS USUAL. WE HAVE OTHER SPACECRAFT  GOING TO THE SPACE STATION AS WELL.   TTHANK YOU SO MUCH. FRANK, FINAL THOUGHTS?   THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A POINT OF  BUT BEFORE THAT, I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SUNNY, WHO IS YOUNGER,  MEATBALL WAS RETT FROE THAN THE WORM IS NOW BECAUSE THAT WAS THE FIRST EMBLEM AND WE BROUGHT IT BACK IN THE '80s OR '90s. THE  TWO IMPORTANT POINTS ARE IN BETWEEN MY COMMAND I WAS IN  PROGRAM MANAGEMENT. AS A NEW PROGRAM MANAGER, ONE OF THE  SMARTEST MANAGERS I KNEW, POINT THE OUT TO ME WHEN WE WERE UNDER A LOT OF STRESS AND PRESSURE, LOOK, FRANK, NO ONE IS GOING TO  REMEMBER WHAT DAY YOU LAUNCHED ON, THEY WILL JUST GOING TO  REMEMBER WHETHER YOU LAUNCHED SAFELY OR NOT. DO NOT FEEL YOU  HAVE TO LAUNCH ON A PARTICULAR DAY. JUST MAKE SURE IT WORKS.  WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE PAD ON THE PICTURE WE HAVE HERE NOW, THE PRESS IS GOING TO GET AN ANGLE WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE  WEATHER IS NOT A PROBLEM. THEY WILL SEE A LOT OF BLUE SKY AND  EVERYONE WILL SAY NASA WAS TOO CONSERVATIVE. IF YOU LOOK BEHIND THE CAMERA, IT IS PROBABLY REALLY BLACK SO DON'T BE MISLED  BY CAMERA ANGLES THAT CAN MAKE THINGS LOOK DIFFERENT THAN WHAT  THEY ARE.  THANKFULLY CHRIS DAVENPORT  CAN TELL US EVERYTHING HE SEES. FRANK THANKS SO MUCH.   PAM, FINAL THOUGHTS FROM YOU?  THIS IS WELCOME BACK TO HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT, RIGHT? THIS IS NORMAL BUSINESS THAT WE HAVE  SCRUBS BUT IT IS STILL EXCITING. FOR ME PERSONALLY, ONE OF THE  THINGS THAT I LOVED ABOUT THE SPACE SHUTTLE WAS PEOPLE CAN GO  AND WATCH THEIR SPACE PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATE AND WATCH A  LAUNCH. UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN'T SHARE THAT MOMENT WHEN WE DOCK  TO THE SPACE STATION BECAUSE IT IS EVERY BIT EXCITING AND  ASTOUNDING BUT I AM GLAD TO SEE US WHERE WE'RE BACK TO WATCH A  LAUNCH FROM AMERICAN SOIL AGAIN.  THANK YOU. WE'LL LEAVE IT  WITH JOEL FOR FINAL THOUGHTS WHO I WILL SEE BACK HERE ON SATURDAY HOPE YOUR CALENDAR IS CLEAR, JOEL.   LET ME COLLECT. I'M OKAY. YES. JUST A QUICK NOTE, SpaceX  TWEETED OUT THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE UNFAVORABLE IN  THE FLIGHT PATH WHICH MAKES ME THINK TO WHAT FRANK SAID.  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE WERE POPCORN THUNDERSTORMS AROUND THE CAPE, AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLY IN THE PROGRAM, THEY WANT TO  MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS FAVORABLE WEATHER ALL THE WAY UP THE SEABOARD IN CASE THERE WAS AN ABORT AND THEY HAD TO SPLASH  DOWN IN THE OH CEN SO THAT IS POSSIBLE THAT IS THE CULPRIT,  ALTHOUGH I'M STILL CURIOUS AS TO IF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS YOU KNOW IN THE OCEAN 100, 200, 300, 500 MILES AWAY THAT IT TOOK SO  LONG TO MAKE THAT CALL. WHEN YOU HAVE THE AWKWARD SITUATION WITH  THE PROPELLANT ALREADY ON THERE. BUT I WILL SAY AS I SAID AT THE  BEGINNING OF THIS, WHATEVER HAPPENS TODAY, I THINK I SAID,  QUOTING MYSELF, IT IS A BIG DEAL. IT IS A BIG DEAL THAT  SpaceX HAS GOTTEN HERE. THAT THE COMMERCIAL YOU PROGRAM HAS  GOTTEN TO THIS POINT. THAT THE SYSTEMS AS PAM SAID THE SYSTEMS  WORKED. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ROCKET OR WITH THE  HARDWARE AND SO THIS IS GOING TO LIKELY WE'RE GOING TO SEE A  LAUNCH AND THAT IS A HISTORIC TRANSITION MOMENT FOR THE SPACE  PROGRAM AND IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT WE'RE MAKING A BIG DEAL  ABOUT IT. WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK  YOU SO MUCH. JOEL AND THANKS TO PAM, FRANK AND SUNNY. YOU CAN  SEE THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK STUCK AT MORE THAN 16 MINUTES OUT FROM  LAUNCH, BUT WE WILL BE BACK ON SATURDAY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK  YOU FOR SHARING THIS ROLLERCOASTER DAY WITH US HERE  AT THE WASHINGTON POST. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. COME BACK  SATURDAY WHEN THEY TRY AGAIN. IT IS DAYS LIKE THIS WHEN WE BEAR  WITNESS TO DREAMS AND INGENUITY AND WEATHER AND SAFETY THAT ARE  REMINDERS ABOUT WHY THIS TEAM HERE CHOOSES TO WORK AT THE  WASHINGTON POST TO BRING THE NEWS THAT MATTERS AND AS QUICKLY AND COMPLETELY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. WE CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT  THE SUPPORT OF VIEWERS LIKE YOU SO IF YOU'RE NEW TO WATCHING THE WASHINGTON POST, TAKE A MOMENT TO SUBSCRIBE. IF YOU'RE WATCHING ON THE HOME PAGE, CLICK THE LINK IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER OR  CLICK SUBSCRIBE IN YOU, BECAUSE WE WILL THEN LET YOU KNOW, WE  CAN BRING YOU THE NEWS AND WHEN THE NEXT LAUNCH WINDOW OPENS, WE WILL BE RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND US. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO  SEEING YOU BACK HERE ON SATURDAY. NOW WE'RE GOING TO  NASA TV.
