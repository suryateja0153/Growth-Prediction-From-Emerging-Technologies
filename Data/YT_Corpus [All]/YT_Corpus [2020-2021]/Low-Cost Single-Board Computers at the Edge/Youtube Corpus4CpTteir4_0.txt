 the processor so we will we would strongly  recommend the nvidia processor for any   edgeAI device it is designed for artificial  intelligence application this and processor   bringing power of modern ai deep learning and interference to embedded system at   this edge so as i said it is designed for  edgeAI and you have a system on module for   every application be it a small facial recognition  application or be the fleet management application  where you require up to six cameras and  you may have to do you may have to run your   neural network in all the six streams it is possible you have options for   all the applications let's look at one  by one so this and nano is a most cost  effective low power in media processor   uh it comes with a quad core processor  and 128 gpu cores what it really means   so 128 cores so with more the gpu code  more better it is for the algorithm   and the floating point operation  that's an indicator for how powerful  it is for inference system so the more the  flops the better it is for inference and the  nvidia also have a complete ecosystem  so you can start your edgeAI application   right away with the sample deep steam  sdk we have a deep stream demo at the  end of the presentation so you have a complete ecosystem and   the stack the application stack can be  shared with all these processes so if you  develop an application on json  nano you can if you want to  move ahead with a higher processor you  can use the same application that will  run on savior as well so the software  stack is exactly same for all the   four processors provided by in media so  when you choose the processor look at the  number of cameras you need the  nano can support up to four  two lane and three four link cameras so  you can have practically four 4k cameras   and also look at the encoder capability  of the encoder is also important when it   comes to applications like  remote monitoring or telepresence   so next best processor uh  better performance processor  is nvidia chess and tx2 that  has multiple cores like one  quad core and one dual core and it is twice better in terms of gpu cores and   also more than twice better in in terms of inference engine the flops   and it can have up to six cameras so there  are customers some of our customers are  already in the field with six  cameras and all the six cameras  can stream uh full hd at 30 frames per  second then the xavier nx and xavier   these are the most powerful edgeAI platform available today   so it has a six core uh the xavier nx  is one of the latest launch from nvidia  which has six core processor and powerful  gpu also it has a 48 tensor cores  which is specifically for inference  neural network and it can have up to  uh three 4k cameras and two six uh  full hd cameras like nvidia tx2 and   it is printed in compatible with nvidia nano  as well so if you develop an application  with the json nano and if you  want to upgrade it if you want to  scale it in the future you can just use  the same carrier board and switch to   xavier nx and finally the xavier agx xavier  it's the most powerful limited platform and   it can have up to four 4k cameras and as i  said it is having a more powerful gpu course
