 Hi I'm Josh Ellsworth with Stahls and Stahls Transfer Express and thanks so much for tuning in to this video, How to Start Your Own T-Shirt Business from Home. I've helped thousands of t-shirt entrepreneurs get started and make money with the heat press. A heat press is a high profit machine and i'm going to prove it to you in this video and show you how to generate your own income from a spare bedroom a garage maybe even a living room or a kitchen. I've seen it all visiting different customers and it all starts with a technology called a Screen Printed Transfer. At Stahls we have a division called Transfer Express that manufactures screen printed transfers that get heat applied with a heat press in four seconds or less it's really phenomenal. And you can make so much money with just a small machine like a heat press. A shirt like this including the garment the labor and the transfer I can print easily for seven dollars or less. You can sell these all day for a minimum of twelve dollars possibly much more. If you're like me and you like math that's five dollars in profit for every shirt that you print. And you can print 50 of these shirts in less than an hour generating 250 dollars in income. All you need to do is learn how to order the right transfer, make sure you have an accurate press, and make sure you have customers that you can sell to. I'm going to help you with all three of those things over the course of this video. And I'd like to start by explaining the five most popular heat transfer types that you can print from home let's get started with screen printed transfers. Screen printing is still one of the most popular technologies for decorating apparel at retail, and as a business you should be interested in mimicking that look with your heat press. With screen printed transfers such as this Goof Proof Transfer from Transfer Express you're getting actual plastisol ink, the same stuff that's used in screen printing, onto a paper carrier. The benefit of this is you can group up multiple images onto one sheet, as long as they're utilizing the same colors. You can order these and they start to make sense once you hit 15 shirts or more. You receive them in all you do is trim them apart and heat apply. The finished result on the garment feels great just like screen printing this is the easiest way to decorate t-shirts with a heat press. The second way I want to show you to heat press a shirt is with heat transfer vinyl. We call it CAD-CUT. This product is especially popular because you can do extremely low quantities cost effectively as little as one and personalization which is really popular right now. You can buy this by the roll, load it into what's called a vinyl cutter, their desktop or industrial units. You cut your vector design in the mirror image, weed away the excess and you get your pieces ready to press. So unlike screen printed transfers where we're getting everything all of the colors on one transfer sheet and they apply it once. When you're working with multiple colors and heat transfer vinyl we need to layer. So we cut each roll each color separately, piece them together on the shirt at the press and finish the job. Because of these steps involved this isn't ideal for very fine detail artwork because we need to complete the weeding process. And you really want to keep your color count down, but one of the biggest benefits of heat transfer vinyl is the range of special effects from reflective to glitter to metallics to foils. There are so many finishes that you can complete on a heat press with heat transfer vinyl. The third way I want to show you to decorate apparel with your heat press is Print Cut Heat Transfer Vinyl. It's a little bit different than standard heat transfer vinyl because in this case the material just comes to you in clear or white. You actually need to have a printer cutter, solvent, latex one of these large format machines to be able to print all of the colors that you need onto the vinyl. Now the benefit of this is i can do as many colors as I want onto a transfer without increasing my cost. No more layering involved just print, cut, weed, mask and then you're ready to heat apply. Print Cut Heat Transfer Vinyl comes in many different styles and it's great from everything from t-shirts to athletic wear and there are special effect finishes such as glitter that you can use with the process. If your design has three or more colors and it's a low quantity you're going to want to look at print and cut heat transfer vinyl to complete the job. Option number four, and this is one I'm really excited about because it's brand new technology for 2020. We call it a Digital Screen Printed Transfer. So in the past we've had to use print cut heat transfer vinyl for jobs sizes that really weren't ideal for printing, cutting, weeding, masking. Completing all the steps that we just talked about. Or maybe there was too much detail in the design that i didn't want to weed it. And so you know we have screen printed transfers, you know we have digital which means printing's involved and so we have this Digital Screen Printed Transfer. Now you can get a heat transfer that combines the best of both worlds, digital printing and screen printing. Allowing for fine detail, cost savings as you go up in quantity, and lots of opportunity for multiple colors all on one sheet. Group different designs single step application I love this technology for decorating t-shirts, performance wear, and more. Okay I want to take a brief time out now that you've reviewed what I call the core 4 print technologies for heat transfer. Believe it or not those four print methods that you just learned a little bit about are going to be used for I would say 95 percent or more of the jobs that you're going to want to print in your business. And so the natural question is "How do I decide which one to use?" We've given you some baseline understanding, but there has to be an easy way to process this. And so just to give you a little background and some context, I was sitting in a room. Gosh it was probably about two years ago with some of the largest contract decorators in our industry out at our Transfer Express West facility in Arizona. Over the course of a couple days we were talking about a lot of topics, but one of the topics that came up, one of their challenges was "How do I equip my sales people to quickly select the right transfer product? So we can do a quote quickly and we can order the right product quickly and there's some consistency to how we're doing this." And so here's what we came up with it's a "What to Use When" grid. And these big dogs, these experts they're using this grid. And I mean these are the largest of the largest contract decorators, but it's something you can use too even in your small startup from home business. You'll see the four print techniques that we've talked about so far represented on the grid, and you'll also see along the X and the Y axis a number of colors in your design or your logo in quantity of garments. And so all you need to do is figure out how many colors are in the logo pretty easy to figure out right what quantity the customer may want to order and go ahead and see where those two accesses join and that gives you your print method it's going to be the lowest cost option that allows you to print your job and most importantly it's going to add consistency into your selection all of these products are high quality and durable this just helps you to get to the right one a little bit faster okay so as i told you uh there is a fifth print method um that's involved here and it's new technology it's a water-based transfer it's most like our screen printed transfers but those are plastisol ink traditional screen printing uh this is water-based not highly utilized as one of our top four methods but nonetheless important for you to know about in case you want to do something super premium on the results so let's show you that one okay so we have the fifth product that we finally come to and i call this the filet mignon of heat transfers because it is a premium finish now we're talking about more new technology that is a water-based screen printed transfer so you remember that first screen printed transfer that we applied well that was plastisol water base is where screen printing is heading and now you can apply water-based transfers with your heat press the advantage is that you get something that's buttery soft on the garment that has stretch that it can apply to practically any fabric so you want to take your business out of t-shirts and start applying nylon jackets while water-based screen printed transfers are the ticket this product is called Aquatru so there you go we have those five different ways to print apparel at home with your heat press and by no means does that include all of the ways I like to say there is a whole umbrella of print methods and technologies that can go underneath your heat press and as we get to the end of this video i'm going to show you a lot of different finishes and styles that you can complete with your heat press from home but before i get too far i want to make sure that we talk about investing in the right heat press because as you might imagine this is the cornerstone of your printing business you're seeing a heat press on my desk here um the A2Z is the heat press that i'm going to show you and in the last video footage you saw the Stahls Maxx machine at Stahls we manufacture a wide selection of heat presses uh everything from entry level to super high end as we've talked about from 600 dollars to eight thousand dollars is the price point but uh regardless of what heat press you select you need to make sure you have accuracy in time temperature and pressure because that really makes sure that the items that you are creating are going to be of high quality and they're going to last there's certainly a lot of machines out there on the market that don't deliver accurate time temperature and pressure we've designed this A2Z heat press specifically for you for a startup home decorator that wants to get into heat printing and do it with quality so i'd like to show you the features of this press now in a previously recorded video the first thing i want you to notice about this machine is that it swings away this gives me a complete heat free workspace to place my t-shirts and also to position my design i have a high quality t-shirt here that i'm just going to load onto the press and make sure my pressing area is completely flat by just draping the collar off of the back edge of the press i programmed the press to 360 degrees it has accurate digital time and we know that's exactly the temperature that it is anywhere on this heat pressing surface i'm going to preheat my garment by locking it down for just a few seconds and then open the machine there's a nice handle to swing the machine away and then i'm going to position my design this is a screen printed transfer and we make them from TransferExpress.com this is actual screen printing ink and the big secret here is that you can now screen print from home with this machine with the same durability that you see in the retail store position your design where you'd like it onto your garment bring the heat press back into the location and lock it down this transfer only takes four to six seconds to heat apply once it's complete i open the press and i peel the back of my design and i have a design that sticks and it stays through many washes now not only can this press print screen printed transfers it can also print heat transfer vinyl to heat apply the version of heat transfer vinyl that we have i'm going to go ahead and reduce the temperature on my digital control board down to 300 degrees and we will set the timer for 10 seconds we're going to apply a glitter design that's been cut on my Silhouette cameo vinyl cutter wait for the press to cool down and i'll show you how to print a bag when printing an item like a bag there is a lot of seam structure so it's not just a product you can lay on top of a press and be able to print with any accuracy because you need to get your item flat now the A2Z heat press has a semi-threadable design that means when we look underneath it we can actually split our item open whether that's from the front or from the back to load it easier to get rid of that bulk and seam let me show you how it works you just split the item open and we're going to slide it up on the press that gets me the start of a flat printing area and then i'll either take a Heat Printing Pillow or what we call a Print Perfect Pad and i'll slide it under the item to make sure that that print location which is right here with my monogram glitter design is higher it's raised versus all of these seams now this heat press does have an adjustable pressure it's right here on the back of the machine it's okay that's on the back because it is a swing away style press that locks straight down when you're using it so bring the machine over center i'm going to retract the pressure just by turning this counterclockwise and i'm going to lock the machine down to get a feel for the pressure and i'll just make adjustments until i get an accurate pressure on the print location that i want to use i have the machine set we'll position our glitter heat transfer vinyl design we'll bring the press back over center and i'll press it for the 300 degrees for 10 seconds so whether you want to decorate t-shirts or bags you can do it on the a to z heat press screen printed transfers or heat transfer vinyl very accurately after it's been applied i'll peel the backing while it's hot for this design and i have a high quality completed result very easy to do let's move on to our next item team uniforms are a big opportunity for your heat press business i'm going to decorate this mesh polyester football jersey with a product called thermofilm in pre-cut numbers for this i'll need another tool that's a heat printing pillow the heat printing pillow is going to slide into your jersey to separate the layers of mesh so that they don't stick together when it comes to applying your design so i'll just slide the pillow in center the jersey onto my press again i'll swing the press back around and conduct a preheat i have a nice 15 by 15 inch printing surface which is going to give me plenty of room to be able to decorate with single or double digit numbers these come loose with the adhesive on the back i'll position that into place in this case i'll use a craft paper cover sheet and then i'll heat apply thermofilm applies for eight seconds lock the machine down it will count down to zero and beep when it's completed now let's flip the jersey to be able to print the back i just need to make some slight readjustments to my pillow make sure i can see my print location also going to preheat the back position my back number into place cover and heat apply thermofilm is the fastest easiest way to number athletic uniforms in the a to z heat press makes applying thermal fill numbers easier than ever for the next item i want to show you how to decorate a jacket this is a quarter zip so we're going to utilize our semi threadable and be able to split the jacket over the bottom to load it on and there's still some seams up on the pressing area and zippers so i'll take my Print Perfect Pad i'll slide it inside of my jacket into the left chest print location that i'm trying to hit to make sure my pressure is accurate and any pressure adjustment can be made on the press and this heat press is capable of applying any transfer type in this case we're using a digital full color transfer to put a company logo onto this item it's a nice 15 by 15 inch printing surface it allows me to see the placement of my design make sure it's lined up correctly cover and heat apply a high quality completed result now that you know the products that you can create let's take a look at all of the features on the A2Z heat press first it has digital time and temperature which produce accurate quality results two it has a pressure adjustment that allows the machine to be raised and lowered to adjust the pressure and to accommodate the thickness of your item or Print Perfect Pad or Heat Printing Pillow the press features a nice swing away design that allows for a completely heat free workspace for both placing your graphic and also being able to see over top of your item for alignment next the press has a convenient handle to be able to return the machine back to the pressing location and a shovel handle design with a Foam Pad to make for comfort when you're locking down the machine the base of the press is semi threadable allowing you to split your item and print more items than ever before we say everything from A2Z also this machine has interchangeable attachments there's a knob underneath the lower platen that allows you to remove the 15 by 15 attachment and load another size if you need to for printing your item and last but not least this is made in the usa which means quality accuracy and durability not only of the machine itself but also of the products that you create so for less than 700 dollars i think the A2Z heat press is a great startup option and just to talk a little bit about roi you remember this shirt that we reviewed at the very beginning of the video when we talked about the profit potential on this shirt we said five dollars in profit if we could sell it for twelve dollars which i think is a really low price uh for 50 shirts so take that five dollars in profit multiplied by the 50 shirts in an hour 250 dollars an hour so on your list right now one of your goals should be to sell three jobs of 50 shirts or six jobs of 25 shirts that's gonna mean you're gonna print 150 shirts it's gonna take you less than three hours with screen printed transfers and you're gonna pay off your machine and and from then on out it's profits you can get a ton of return on an investment of a heat press and you can print so much more than just t-shirts with screen printed transfers as you've already started to learn and so
