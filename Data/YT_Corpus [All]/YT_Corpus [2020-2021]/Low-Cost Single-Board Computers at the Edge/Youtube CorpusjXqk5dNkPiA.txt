 welcome to the shop steve here at sks props and  in this video i want to show you guys some of   the basic tools and techniques that it takes  to be a foam fabricator now for those that   are not familiar with my particular work i am a  multi-award-winning foam smith i love foam and   i love it so much that i develop my own line of  high density foam products specifically designed   for prop and costume fabrication blick and i  partnered up not long ago so they carry my hd   foam foam dowels and the ever popular foam clay  online and in select stores this particular video   we're just going to go over the basics of the  different tools you need and different techniques   to get you started on your journey to be a foam  smith so let's kick things off by talking about   the material itself blick will be carrying my  hd foam in thicknesses of 2 6 and 10 millimeter   those sheets are 24 inches by 60 inches so that  is a lot of material to be able to craft with   now if you haven't used eva before i am a huge fan  of it because it's an extremely versatile material   but it's also very very light so it's great for  cosplay and for props because it's con safe you   can carry it around all day now the things that  separate my hd foam from a lot of the others that   are out there is that is a high density foam so  it cuts and it sands beautifully the other thing   that's great is the fact that it's light gray  which means you do not have to use markers on   this to transfer into your templates you could  use a ballpoint pen or pencil which is going to   make your templates a lot more accurate now along  with my hd foam sheets blick will also be carrying   my hd foam dowels the dowels would be round  half round and bevel they'll come in sizes of   10 15 and 20 millimeter there are two of them per  pack and each one of them is 36 inches in length   now this is going to give you an opportunity  to add some really quick and easy details to   your costumes and props and last but not least  we have the ever popular foam clay foam clay is   great for your props and costumes especially if  you're trying to get an organic look to it you   can sculpt with this material by hand the moisture  will eventually wick out of it so it becomes hard   but it still retains its ability to be extremely  light which is great for cosplay now that you   have your character or prop references ready to go  you need to start thinking about construction and   your templates now there's a couple different  ways to do templates there are websites out   there that will have pep files available which are  computer generated files that you can download and   put together like a puzzle piece you could also  do it a lot more traditional which is typically   what i do i hand draw most of my templates  because i do a lot more custom creations   so if you're doing that i prefer to use bristol  board bristol board is like a thicker cardstock   but it holds up really well for doing templates  because you can actually hold it up to your   mannequins duct tape dummies or a friend  to get all the armor situated that you need   now this is a shield that i had done that was a  custom creation again drawn onto the bristol board   you can see the back of it though i've done a  lot of different iterations where i've changed it   and that's going to happen you know when you're  doing these types of templates you got to still   take into consideration the thickness of the  foam so a lot of times they change but it's   great to have a starting point with your bill  before we talk about some of the basic tools   to use one thing i want to bring up and that  i feel is very important is safety make sure   that you always do set it aside enough along with  all your tools to get the proper safety equipment   that includes eye protection i prefer ones that  are shatter proof a decent dust mask and that's   because our foam does generate quite a bit of  particulates into the air when using a rotary tool   and an organic filter mask and that's because we  use solvents we use spray paints we will make sure   none of that is getting into us so moving on to  the workstation itself this isn't really the kind   of hobby that you want to be doing on your kitchen  table so out here in the shop i have a piece of   butcher paper down and i have a self-healing mat  i feel self-healing mats are really important   because most of the work you do with foam  fabrication is going to be cutting it so having a   self-healing mat allows the blade to go all the  way through the material and into the surface   this does two things it'll give you a nice clean  cut it protects the edge of the blade and most   importantly it protects the tip of the blade now  this particular one that i have out here is put   out by blick it is a 36 inch by 24 inch so that  gives you a lot of room so if you're doing a nice   big piece of chest armor or a shield or something  you're not going to be running off so you can have   a continuously nice cut next to that i always have  a pencil and pen on hand this is how i do all of   my template transfers nowadays because the foam is  light gray so i've noticed that my templates come   out a lot more accurate now when it comes to the  blades honestly i've got three of them that i use   pretty much all the time and this is really all  that you need three blades one is kind of a bigger   heavy duty this is great for 10 millimeter foam  one that's kind of a mid-range that's great for   a six millimeter foam and then a little detailed  scalpel blade that's great for two millimeter foam   and also for scoring and doing a heat treatment to  it to make the foam open up this is great for that   so for the best type of cutting technique you want  to make sure that the blade remains completely   straight up and down you don't want it at an angle  unless you're specifically trying to get a bevel   notice i'm using a metal ruler here press all  the way through the material into the cutting   mat itself and then pull in one straight cut this  is going to give you the cleanest cut possible   so you have all your pieces cut out for your  prop or costume and now it is time to clean   them up and we're going to do that using a rotary  tool a rotary tool is going to be one of the most   important tools in your arsenal for being a foam  fabricator it's going to allow you to clean up all   your edges round them over and start giving the  foam character now there are a lot of different   rotary tools that are on the market and they're  going to range in price anywhere from 20 bucks to   several hundred dollars so just make sure that you  get one that's in your budget and it works for you   when it comes to the features of the rotary tool  the biggest thing that i tell you to look for is   one that has a flex shaft without the flex shaft  the sandy drum will just go right here on the end   but then you're dealing with the weight of the  tool itself when you're working around your piece   having a flex shaft it's a lot more natural  feeling and it's a lot more flexible and so   you have that agility to work around the piece  in a lot more fluid way now along with the rotary   tool usually you will get a box of accessories  the most important in here of course being your   sanding drums this particular dremel series comes  with a coarse one and a medium grit one the coarse   one works great for taking away a lot of foam  really quick the fine one i use as a second pass   to smooth everything out and then for a third  pass i like to use stone bits you set these to   the highest rpm and what it does is it actually  cauterizes the foam and it gives it a very smooth   appearance and remember whenever you're using  your rotary tool make sure that you're always   practicing shop safety so whenever i use mine  i always have my eye protection and a proper   dust mask for demonstration purposes we have our  foam that has been rounded over using our rotary   tool and now we're going to pretend as though  these are pieces that need to be assembled to   create our final proper costume which means we're  going to talk about adhesive but before we get to   that i actually want to talk about heat sealing  foam real fast and to be clear you actually do   not have to heat seal my foam you could just go  ahead and seal this with plasti dip or flex bond   and paint it and it would be good to go if you  are going to heat seal it i would recommend to   do a very light heat treatment to it i feel too  many people overheat their foam as it is currently   so with mine just barely hit it with a little bit  of heat even after i do that i will then go back   in with some 400 grit sandpaper lightly buff  the surface so if i'm using plasti-dip or any   other type of a sealant on there it has something  to bite into now while we're on the subject of   heat guns let me talk about one real fast this  is one of blick carries it's put out by wagner   and i really like the design for two reasons  number one you have these fins on the side   so after you're done using it if you set it  down the heat source is not in contact with   the surface of your top that way you're not  accidentally burning or melting anything here   number two is you have these two additional  foot stabilizations on the bottom there and   so it's completely hands-free you can actually  be manipulating something up above it and have   a direct heat source without actually having  to hold it so if you've got a large piece that   you're trying to manipulate you can do that all  hands-free so this is definitely one that i would   look into if you're needing a heat gun i just  really like these safety precautions that are   on it now when i first started building props  and costumes i of course just used hot glue   which there's nothing wrong with that the only  problem that i ran into is when i made an armor   set and i was walking in a parade in atlanta  and it was summertime a lot of my hot glue has   started to fail on me so nowadays i use contact  cements and super glues for a lot of my builds   now that being said if you are going to use  hot glue and i still deal with certain aspects   of my costume such as if i'm adding fur or other  types of linings to the inside of the foam itself   these surebond hot glue guns work really well and  they've got a few design things that i really like   about them so number one this is the larger one  this is a high temp and it's all cordless which   i think is great because the cord gets in the way  so many times so if you have this charging and you   need to use it for a little bit it'll actually run  for two minutes before it needs to be recharged   again and get the glue back to an optimal  temperature the other thing i like is that it has   a silicone pad here so if it does drip additional  glue out of it it's not again getting onto your   surface it's getting on the silicone pad same  thing with this little guy so i've got a large one   and i have a small one that has a detail tip on  there so if i'm wanting to make sure that some of   the small wires that i'm using inside of my masks  or costumes aren't going to be moving around i   like to use a little detail one to make sure that  i'm just not getting hot glue all over the place   so both of these surebond ones are really cool  and if you're using hot glue it's definitely   something i would look at if you're going with  the contact cements of course there's lots of   ones that are out there this particular one  is a weld wood i also use barge quite often   and then as far as your super glues you have  lots of those to choose from as well so when   it comes to putting together pieces like this  a lot of times i do a double adhesive method   where if it's a large piece i'll do contact cement  for the majority of it and then i use super glue   around the perimeter and that way i'm making sure  that if one glue fails the other one will actually   step up in its place so when it comes to gluing  sections together like this like if i had these   two smaller pieces what i like to do is actually  take a pencil mark where that one is going to be   on the front and on the back that way i'm not  over using my glue in areas i do not need it   and just for this particular instance i'm going  to use the super glue just because it's not a   large piece i usually use the super glue when  it comes to a lot of the smaller detail pieces   just on its own so that is now going to be set  that's really not going to go anywhere even if   you were to bend this you could tell there's still  a lot of strength with that super glue holding   these together but i've used all different types  of adhesives so far on my phone and i have not   found anything that hasn't worked yet now that we  have our foam pieces cleaned up and assembled we   can start thinking about sealing it and there's  lots of different types of materials that you   could use to seal your foam you could use white  glue or mod podge me personally i like brands   like plasti dip and flex bond both of these work  great because if your armor is to ever get crushed   you can use a heat gun and it will actually pop  back out without distorting the surface now the   big difference between these two plasti-dip is not  really safe to use inside you want to make sure   to use this in a well-ventilated area if you're  going for a non-toxic version flex bond is great   because you can add your acrylic paints directly  to it and apply that to the foam so you have your   completed proper costume it has been sealed and  is ready for paint now painting is an extremely   important step because you could have an amazing  prop and a poor paint job and it could ruin it   you could have an okay prop and a stellar paint  job and it will look great now when it comes to   me i usually like to do a primer base on top of  the plasti dip so i'll do a rattle can of a primer   usually in a black or in a red and that just gives  it a nice base for whatever colors you're going   to be building up on top now as far as the layers  after that there are a couple different ways that   you can go you could airbrush or you could hand  paint me personally i like to hand paint most   my stuff but i was an illustration major so i've  been hand painting all my life i have friends that   all they do is airbrush and there's no right or  wrong way it's just whatever works for you if you   do airbrush i prefer ones that have a dual action  which means that you're able to press down to get   the air flowing and you pull back and that sends  the paint out so when it comes to hand painting   your props of course brushes are key and there are  a ton of them to choose from but if i had to just   tell you a couple to put in your paint box the  ones that i would choose to go with would be a one   inch mop brush a half inch flat brush a number  eight filbert brush a number four flat brush and   a detail brush you can paint just about any proper  costume using these types of brushes now i know   that's a lot of information to take in all at once  if you're new to this hobby so let's take a look   at some of the practical applications of putting  all those techniques together to make one build   this custom armor set was fabricated to show off  what the hd foam products are capable of most of   the armor on here is made out of six millimeter  hd foam i used a bunch of the 10 millimeter bevel   dowels for a lot of the detail pieces that are on  there the shield is made out of some 10 millimeter   hd foam and 15 millimeter bevels on there i also  use foam clay to fabricate all the horns on the   armor now that technique was accomplished by using  tin foil as a base and then skinning it with the   foam clay that way i didn't have to use as much  material and the horns are more structurally   sound to fabricate his weapon i used a pvc pipe  for the main under structure and then skinned   that with some two millimeter foam i also did the  same wrap for the handle the top is made out of   10 millimeter foam pieces now because i used the  pvc pipe as a main structure i could then use the   couplers and make it so the entire piece breaks  apart so i can take it to conventions all around   the country after the fabrication on this guy was  complete i sprayed it with two coats of plasti dip   to protect all the foam armor pieces after that  had been allowed to cure properly i then sprayed   it with a rattle can hammered metal then i go  in and i start hand painting all the details   now on this particular guy i used a lot of the  utrecht and liquitex brand heavy body acrylics   i specifically use heavy body though when i do any  of my pieces i actually don't seal any of my props   or costumes once they're done i let the paint  speak for itself really allows for that luster and   shine that you see in a lot of these pieces now  this entire armor set including the weapon weighs   less than 10 pounds which is great because scott  had to walk around new york comic-con with it for   hours but he said it was actually one of the most  comfortable costumes he's ever had to deal with   well guys that's my basic intro into the tools  and techniques needed to become a foam fabricator   the cool thing is almost all the tools that  are seen in this video can easily be found at   blick art materials including my hd phone line  which means blick is quickly becoming the one   stop shop for cosplay now if you guys enjoyed  this video and you want to see more tips and   tricks that are prop and costume related head  on over to sksprops.com because on my website   i have full build threads and videos of almost  every single costume that i've ever created   and if you guys are using hd foam or any of  the materials from blick
