 Where's Ty? I hear a bear. He's losing a Croc! He's losing a Croc! That's just two screws. Sorry, guys. Back door was locked. I had to come through the roof. There's an opening. That's glass. No, it's not. Yeah. You can't get through here. Did y'all not know that? What? Yeah. Who installed glass there? I had Ryan do it. Cue the intro! [THEME MUSIC] THEME SONG: Tall guy, beard, twins, purple hoser. Dude Perfect's in Overtime. Tall guy, beard, twins, purple hoser. Now we're heading on to Overtime. Why are you wearing sunglasses? I got attacked by a stray cat over the weekend. That doesn't sound like a true story. Oh. Oh! [ALL GROANING] Yeah. He was not declawed, obviously. Anyway. Let's move on. We got a great show for you guys today. Cor, what's the first segment? Games With Consequences. Codes, what's the second segment? That would be Wheel Unfortunate. Cobes, what's the third segment? Betcha! Gar, what's the fourth segment? Cool, Not Cool. It's going to be a good one. Well, remember that guy's not partaking in Cool, Not Cool. Oh, wow. Keep in mind, Cory is serving a one game suspension. Been there. It's time to dive in to some Games With Consequences! [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Ty. And I'm Gar. And it is a beautiful night for some Games With Consequences. The game we're playing, PGA TOUR 2k21. Kicking it off at Monte Cervino. Got two contestants going head-to-head in stroke play. I just want to say I'm excited for this game because it is a game that's great with friends in multiplayer, accessible for anybody to pick up and learn, and it has tons of depth for the hardcore golf fan. If you say so. You know, we've got a wonderful sideline reporter tonight. I believe his name is-- Floyd. Floyd! Floyd Chesternut is the name. I'm up from the Junior Tour. And if you think this is fabricated, you're dead wrong. Perfect combo of shampoo and conditioner equals great flow. That's enough about me, though. Where do you reside from? What's your name? My name's Cody. This is my first night on the sticks. Going to take down this salmon-colored pink fellow. It's going to be good night. Here we got, uh, Cory. No. Here we got Coby. Yep. OK. Tough night for Chester on the job. I'm excited to be here. Yeah. Right now, my mind is already in Monte, and I'm halfway down the first fairway. Three holes. Best score at the end of that is the winner. As with Games With Consequences, there will be penalties and consequences after most, if not every, shot. We've got the characters portrayed in real life and I do say portrayed in the truest sense. How lifelike and detailed these guys are resembled in the game. Oh! Oh. And live from the 10th tee box, from the Woodlands, Texas, Coby Cotton. Good luck, sucker. Dusty. Oh, wow. He absolutely hikes it. Second on the tee box, Cody Jones. Rough! Oh, there it is. Didn't that hit a tree? It did. And the beautiful maple trees of Monte Cervino are spewing maple syrup right now. Oh! Oh, the beautiful Monte Cervino trees. A bad shot! Oh, these are my favorite pants. Ugh. One of the downfalls of booking at first tee time is sometimes the grounds crew is not quite finished yet. And I think we've got a mower. It's getting a little too close to Coby Cotton here after that first shot, unfortunately for him. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, he's got the grass. Oh, and he pulls it a little bit. That was a lot of grass! Pulled off an unbelievable shot. What an absolute dart. Holy Toledo. I am absolutely covered in grass. He looks like a Chia Pet. I think there's some gusty winds. Oh. And he's going to have to get pinned with that for the putt. Oh, and he smokes it. Oh, no. And that one is going to be a little mean. Stop! Stop! Stop! Oh, boy. And that one might head into the sand. Oh, come on. Chunky Codes is back up. The thick grasses up in Monte Cervino are known for their snakes. Oh, my gosh. Are you kidding me? Oh, and he shanks one. Oh, no. OK. OK. I'm done. I think I'm done. Is this poisonous? And he banks it in the back of the cup. There he is. Coby with a two-stroke lead, heading into hole 2. You go into the maples, then you get on the green. But overall, a sticky situation, if you will. What went wrong? The syrup. Mainly just the syrup. On the tee, we have Coby. Oh, and he's fast with it. Oh, come back! Come back! Oh, no. And that could hit a patron if we're not careful. No! Oh, my God. Oh, no. Do you have a corpse to throw on Coby for that one? Oh, morbid jokes from the large man. OK. It's amazing what you can do without syrup on your head. All right. On to the next shot. [AIR HORN] Oh, no. Oh, no. It's slow. Get up there. Get left. Get left! And he hangs on. You hate to see inclement weather come in so quick, but. It's a beautiful day. That looks like a cumulo nimbus known for producing large quantities of hail. Oh. There it is. Oh, boy. Oh, my goodness. There it is. And he has to hit the shot. Oh. OK, OK. I shot. And he actually leaves that one a little short. I did it. I did the thing. This is the worst night of my life. I thought Cody put on the extra pounds to play through it. I'm so mad. [CAR CRASH] Oh, what was that? Oh, my. Ladies and gentlemen, I've got some unfortunate news. The cart girl took that turn too sharp and outspilled all the peanut butter crackers and they look peanut buttery. Oh, no. No. Oh, in the ear? I can't hear. I can't hear. This is insane. Shoot your shot! Cheater! Oh, no. What in the world? And he hits a decent shot. How is he doing this? I couldn't even hear. Floyd? Lloyd? What's his name? Floyd. Floyd! Could you get us a up post look at that, please? Can you hear me? What was that? You still got 24 feet to go. No, that's him. It is his first gig in and looking like it might be his last, if you know what I'm saying. Cody is up first putt. Am I waiting for a skunk? Oh, and you know what? We've got a pack of coyotes running around behind him right now. What is-- are they at least trained? No, I think those are actual wild coyotes. No, they're unplanned. We did not have that one in the books. That just happened. Let me send a signal to my power animal. [HOWLS] Woah, what is that? Woah. That, my friends is what happens when you play golf around water. I think we've got a gator in the house. Oh, my gosh. Those things bite ears, dude. Oh. OK. Do I go? Oh, no. He's about to clamp down on-- How is he so good at putting-- And he shorts it. And the gator is getting feisty. Oh. He's attempting the death roll. Yeah. Oh, my goodness, I've only seen this on National Geographic. Oh, the death roll. Ah, the death roll! I can feel it breathing on my leg. Cody, I think you really need to sink this for bogey. Why is the gator still with me? He needs this. It's going to be a little uphill. And he absolutely sinks a buttery biscuit. And it appears one of the patrons who was hit has taken it upon himself. Oh, yeah. There it is. Oh, no. There it is. And he has to putt right now. He has to putt right now. He has to putt right now. He has to putt. And he sinks it. Monte Cervino is an unpredictable monster. Oh, and we've got a finisher for the ages. A 529 yard par 5 into the win. He's down by 1. Down by 1. Headed to the final hole. I believe I'm ready. Four! Oh, no. It appears that he has been hit by-- So quickly. --a stray ball from the hole number 17. What in the absolute heck are we doing out here? And that-- What in the world? --was a shank and a half. Monte Cervino is just brutal. I don't want to play anymore. These are real tears. They just turned the sprinklers on. Oh, no. And you hate to see it with one hole left. There they are. And he actually gets up. Oh, no. That's gotta go. That's gotta go. Oh. Oh, no. And he's in the first cut. Great shot. Ty, do you see that? I do see that. Say it ain't so. I thought the dust storms were behind us. The sandstorm is striking. Oh, no. Oh, and he-- oh, dear. Oh, no. He hit a tree! Syrup city! He's in syrup city! He just hit a maple tree in Monte Cervino. It's spewing! Oh, goodness. Monte Cervino. Oh, no. Oh, no. Can I go? Yes, you can go. Four! I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Oh, wow. And he plays that to perfection. A beaut. Gives himself a birdie opportunity. Four! I'm kidding. Four! The dime. Cody going for birdie. This is for the win. Oh, my goodness. But you know what, Gar? Right behind the patrons, there is a glaring, blinding light. And it is nearly impossible to see through. This is a low-budget show. Oh! Oh my goodness. And Coby needs it. No, he is looking into the same lights. Penalty, penalty, penalty. For the tie. For the tie. Four! He does it. He sinks it. Wow. And this is a big putt coming up. Will we head to a sudden death playoff? I'm not risking it for more penalties. I'm getting out here, man. I can't do another hole than this. See ya. Goodnight. It's over. You're the winner. Get me out of here! I'm going home. Good for you! I don't even think there's a trophy. I have to say, I did not see it finishing like that. He probably doesn't even know that we were completely out of consequences and it would have been a very enjoyable final round. Yeah, it would have been. Before we head back to the desk, we would like to thank 2K for sponsoring this segment. To purchase a copy of the game for yourself, click the link in the description. Also Chesternuts, you're fired. Oh, and he's throwing his shoe. Yeah. He's just throwing his shoe on the-- Oh, he does a second. Oh, no. There goes the jacket. Oh, no. I told you it was fake. Back to the desk for Wheel Unfortunate. Absolutely. Now I'll take my hand back. All right. Thank you, Ty in the past. That was a great throw. Appreciate you. You look good, by the way. Thanks for hanging out. Guys, we know what time it is. Chad, cue the most unfortunate music you could find right in this moment. Go. Oh. Oh. OK. Stop the sad music because I have an announcement. I'm a gamer now. If you want to get to me and Sparky on the DP gaming channel, we just get Warzone dubs and it's awesome. [CHEERING] Go back to the sad music, Chad. Who's going to select? I think Cory. I can not. Stop the sad music because Cory's going to pick. Yes! I'm not, though, because I'm actually suspended from the segment. No. That is not how this works. No. No. Cory's going to pick. Give it up for him, ladies and gentlemen. My man. I can't. Chad, cue the sad music. You're not a team player. No, I am. No, no. He's not. He's not a team player. He's not a team player. I really am. Cue the non-team player music, Chad. Cody's picking. And cue the happy music. Cody's picking! Let's get it over with. Wow. Wow. Woah! Woah! Stop the music. Garrett! [EXCITED CHATTER] Guys, guys, that's not how this works. It doesn't matter. It's how it works today. It's so much better when it's not me. I've never seen him before. Huh? Who is that? I'm Dale Tweedly and it's good to be with you brothers and sisters. My step dad told me that I could make $20 if I-- This one. --if I just come on the show and fill in for Ned Forrester brother, he's on a sabbatical. You know he's still going to be in a lot of pain, but it'll be good at the end of the day. Hey, come on up, brother. What's your name? Where's Ned? He's on a sabbatical. Yeah, I only do the show with Ned. The producers are saying get in front of the wheel. OK, yeah. Just-- Yeah, stop touching me. Can I spin? No, I got to-- I didn't even tell you my story. So last night, all of a sudden, the dogs start losing their minds. The dogs are going. And I'm out there, and I'm like, oh, I better grab my crossbow and go out to the back 40, because across the creek it sounds like there are some-- there are some trucks. So they're loading up, and I hear metal clanking and banging, and it's just crazy out there. You know what I bought and I had on me in my skivvies? I'll show you. Don't go anywhere. I bought this, the tsetse fly masterpiece. And I snuck up on one of the cattle rustlers, and I stuck-- look, let me show you what I did to it. Hold this. No, I-- Yeah, it was a couple big-headed weird fellas. Right between the eyes, and I just drilled him. And I'll tell you what, it didn't kill him, but it knocked him out for about 30 minutes. Can I just spin the wheel? Hold on. Is this my punishment? Hold this, hold this. Is this my unfortunate punishment? Because I'll-- I'll suffer thought it. Listen! Just-- the other one stuck up on me from behind like this. Oh, got him. And then they continued to just-- and then he comes, and he swings at me. And then I went-- and then it was a fight to the death with the last one. You're the last one. I said, bring it on, muchacho. And so I went bam, and then-- Yeah, this is my penalty, isn't it? You know what I forgot to tell you I'm going to go ahead and spin. --trailer. And what I did-- I had to grab him by the haunches. I grabbed him by his haunches, right up in here, and I said, come on, little buddy. We're going to go for a ride. And I took him, and I walked him all the way back to the house, five miles on my back. I took him on my back five miles. And I said, let's do this, brother. Hey, what does that mean? That means I get to pick. Yeah, I'm going to-- No, no. I never thought I'd have this much power, folks. You know what? You know what? You know what? Brother, brother, hey, you know what? What? I'm going to tell you a story, brother. No. OK, OK. We're done with the stories. You know what I got? And stay right there. Don't move. Don't move. Go ahead and select one out of the-- out of the fishbowl. Give it a good mixing. You already selected. All right. Spend a day as Gene Simmons. Brother! Rock on, brother! Rock on! I'll pick whatever. I'll do whatever. I'll sing on an elevator. Just let me do something. And you're watching Wheel Unfortunate, where Gary's going to become Gene Simmons. Thanks for joining us. Hey, get out of here, or I'll bash you on the haunches. All right, brothers and sisters, going to see you next time. Say it with me. I'm Dale Tweedly! It is time to unveil the Gene. Should we look at him? No way! Wow! No way. Yeah, it's not my real tongue. Wait, put that back in. Let's see the tongue again. It's so freaky. Ew! That looks creepily real. I don't know how you got that penalty, but I love it. Can I get rid of this? No. No. That's the best part. I was getting makeup on, and I thought all I had to do was dress like this whatever. And he said, no, you got to go out in public. No. Did you film it? Yeah, of course I filmed it. Yes! No! Here you go. You know, honestly when I landed on the question mark, I didn't know what was happening. Then when he said I had to dress up as Gene Simmons, I was like, is it that bad? And yes. I'm going to go grab some lunch. Can I do five four-finger meals? I can't let you come through like that without getting you on our group chat. You do know who I am, though, right? I don't. No, like what I'm dressed as. Of course I do. Yeah, OK. Yeah. Honestly, I can't believe he did this every night. This is brutal. Thank you. Here you go. You know, on a nice summer day in Texas, Gene would get ice cream. How's it going? Good, you? I'm pretty toasty, to be honest. Do you know who I am dressed as? Someone from Kiss. Perfect. It felt like a Kiss kind of day. I have to take a picture with you. Oh, absolutely. Hold on, wait. My hair-- yeah. Man, people love Gene. Yeah, Gene Simmons! Yeah, I love it, man. You guys here to see Dude Perfect? Lincoln, is that daddy or somebody else? No! Daddy. Can you give me a kiss? That's scary. Well, scarred my kids, got some ice cream, and hope it was worth it. It was. What an effort. Thanks Dale. Wow. Hey, next time I'm just going to drink a Hot Pocket smoothy if it lands on me. Oh. I'm not doing whatever that weirdo wants. Where are we heading out to next? We're heading to Betcha. Betcha. As Gar hinted at, it's time for Betcha. We've had some pretty good Betchas in the past. We have. Right. The moment that we first hit that diamond with a hammer, that was just like mine grenade central. We also had not great ones. Cody floating a mile in the pond. I was treading water. The entire time. That was like the opposite end of the spectrum-- like not that mind blowing. This one is diamond level. Also, it's a first. This is the first ever we Betcha, because Coby and I have come to the table united as one. Betcha time! You guys are in for a treat. Come on into the Betcha room. Tyler and I, as a dynamic duo, Betcha that this entire table full of cotton candy will fit in this here tiny glass. It's true. No way. It's true. I love the concept, and I understand that, yes, it's going to dissolve. That's a huge table. Ain't no way. Gene says no. Cotton candy, sir. Yes? Is the official betcha that it will not overflow the cup. Correct. All of this will just be gone-- Into this glass. Into this glass. If there is cotton candy drippage down this side, we win. Sure. Yeah. OK, no, no, no. Here we go, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Enjoy this. We betcha. That's pretty-- that's pretty amazing. That's one of the most satisfying things I've ever watched. If you guys do this-- And it's gone. Wow. And it's gone just like that. And it filled up at least a centimeter. Did it? No. Dos adios. Yeah, Gene didn't believe it. Dude, that might happen. Look, it's getting so full. It's getting so full. Y'all are crazy. It is getting a little full. It's getting a little full. I'm getting nervous. Oh my, it's-- we're not even halfway through. Incorrecto. We're fine. We're fine. I'll allow you to change right now. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Re-vote. All right, I'm on their side. You're on your own. He brought the idea to me. I didn't want to do it, just so you guys you know. The betrayal is the biggest emotion I'm feeling. The second biggest is disappointment. I think there's still a glimmer of hope. The table-- it's starting to open up. Maybe if you make it extra compact. I saw what he did there. What? We have on film that you're not a man of integrity. Hey, maybe you ball everything that's left up into one ball, and then-- Something to think about. It's close. It was the last ball. Yeah, the last ball. I'll help you. Just so we realize how far away you really were from doing this-- Not that far, if you really think about it. One rope short. That's all you were. And just like that-- Wait for it. Oh, easy. Oh. Guys, look how close it was. You know? I mean-- [BUZZER NOISES] Well-- Winners. Fans at home, we don't fake this stuff. If we make a betcha, we see what happens. We'll see you next time. Nope. Nope. Nope. Take a sip. You and Ty have to take a sip. No! Ty-- I-- Yeah. What do you mean? I jumped ship-- You're not getting out of this. --before it was on fire. No. Chug it. Chug it. One more. No, that's good. That's good. That's all you need. I'll be honest. I've tasted worse. Ty and I were really wrong. Gene, send it. Send it. You guys got to clean up first. We'll wait. We'll wait upstairs. I'm Ty. I'm Coby. And welcome to a new segment we like to call instant regret. What we meant to betcha. Gone. Gone. Still gone. Just as impressive as the cup. I told you we should've used the fish tank! I told you-- Your betcha that you brought to the-- well, you blew that one. Who's you? You! You were looking at me when you said that? If anybody knows a good counselor, we're going to need to go to one. You know what? Let's go to Cool Not Cool. Moving on. Welcome to Cool Not Cool, where Cory is serving a one game suspension. Is that a noise? Do we need to tee him up right now? I got it. We'll just do wheel next time. I don't hate it. With a verbal confirmation. If you oppose Cory doing wheel with a verbal confirmation, all we need is one-- one no. OK, well, I guess he's going to be doing it. The people have spoken. The people-- or the people have not spoken. Was that worth it to you? Yeah. Yeah. Getting that off the table? Who wants to kick us off? Gene will. If you guys have ever been to one of my concerts, you know I love fire. And boy, I brought something that changes the fire industry. Who knew? Who knew you could revolutionize the fire industry? If you ever get stranded out in the campfire with your family, and need to turn on your phone or charge something, I got the thing for you, the BioLite. This thing right here turns fire into electricity. You put some handy wood in the pit. You light the fire, and then-- check this out-- the fire makes electricity. Wait for it. Look at that. Could you charge your phone, or just-- Yeah. Hey, hey. Is this is this all you can use? Got a phone charger right here for you. There it is. So you could just get sticks from around, power your phone, and you would theoretically never run out of energy. Correct, because the forest is filled with sticks. I don't what you're burning, but I'm allergic to it. And for that reason, I'm out. I can use a little charge. But remember, if you plug in, the phone turns green, which you should hit that green button. It does. You know what I mean? Smash that green for me. Oh, there it is. This, to me, is the type of thing that would be on "Shark Tank," and I love "Shark Tank." That's a green. Obviously I'm a green. And Cory, green? Just say it. Just say green. Yeah, you can just say green, and we'll take that. You can say green. No? All right, I'll follow that. As a family who purchased a puppy during the quarantine season-- Sure. --I am well aware of potty training, and the need for dog food, and all the elements of chewing that go into owning a dog. Yeah. I have provided today an item so cool that it could potentially replace the pet life. May I introduce to all of you a real live robot rob. No way! Check this out, guys. He is a fully functioning non-pottying puppy. Coby, if you would do me the favor of going and pushing my puppy in the shoulder. Let me show you-- He is so powerful. --his ability to react. You can feel him move in the floor. Watch how cool this is. He's going to break the TV. Look at that. Hey, hey. Don't break that TV. I've been there. It's not a good place to be. That's a standing O for me. You get a standing O from Gene. Well done. That is a standing O for me. Well done. As much as I wanted to be a you there and just let you know what it feels like-- I know. You want to drive. Yeah, let me drive. He can dance, too. Yeah, again, Ty, you know this isn't your item. No, yeah, I know. And for that, I don't care what Ty brings to the table. You guys-- I bet you're-- Did he just pre-vote? Good luck following that. I'll go next. This is an item that was inspired by actually a previous item that we've had on the show, one that I thought was simple, yet particularly intriguing and useful. Oh, no. Who had the watermelon slicer? That was me. Oh Mylanta. Here we have another version of that, I guess, for a different type of food. OK. Corn on the cob. So, you know, a lot of people will, you know, get the fork and then the knife, and then they'll try and cut it off. Yeah, but you lose a lot of corn doing that. You lose a lot of corn doing that. Not with this bad boy. What you do is you take the corn donut, and you stick it right here in the middle of the corn cob. No way. One size fits all? You start the process just like this. It looks really easy to use. It's simple. Look at all his veins in his hands. Easy to use with ease. And it comes right out. And no issue whatsoever. Who is ready for some corn? The effort was there. I saw right through it from the beginning. Wait a minute. No! I'm sorry. Here's the thing. It is clear that you did not put any butter or salt on that corn, and for that, it's going to have to be a red for me, dog. Is he going to get a super not cool? Gar, talk to me, brother. Yeah, I pre-voted. Oh, yeah. Was that how you expected that to go? Everything minus the reds, yeah. Ty, do the right thing. Look at me. Do the right thing. And you push that button, and you know what I'm talking about. I don't want to. You know what button I'm talking about. The corn donut is wrong for all of us. I just super not cooled my own item. That's big time, though. That's rare. You know what? That takes a man. It takes a man to admit when he is wrong, and today I was wrong. I'm TT, and I was wrong. Opportunities to follow something that bad do not come around every single day. I know Ty just through that, but I'm going red. It just made Gene so bad, and all I can do is vote red. I apologize. Hey, solid chance I give you a green here. You know what? He said he's going green. Yeah. I'm going to do you a favor and go green. Yeah. You don't even have to show us what you got. Show us what you got. Hey, show and tell with no pressure. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, if you could please clear your buttons off the desk, I proudly present to you the kayak in a suitcase. Wow. Hold this, please, Gene. Send her this way. Don't mind if I do. Wow, it's got pads and seating? Just like that-- What a design. --kayak in a suitcase. Wow. Oh, man! I might have to borrow this on the weekend. I've been saving a long time. Put it on the ground, and get down in it. Deal. I want to see what it looks like. Deal, happily. All right, boys. It's light. Look at that. Very light. You guys are probably wondering yourself, but does it float? I've been here before. I've already filmed a video of me in the water. Take a look, boys. One really beautiful perk about our office is we have this disgusting pond in the back. It's perfect. I'm not worried about getting wet. I'm worried about gators. Off we go into the unknown. Oh I forgot how fun kayaking is. You guys want to see a speed turn? Something just jumped. Coming aboard. End the day, good item. Well done. Great item. That's impressive. That will do it for OT 17.
