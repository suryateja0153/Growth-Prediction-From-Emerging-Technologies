 New Horizons I everyone is so small in the in the video view that it's hard to see if someone raises a hand so Dave I'll rely on you to interrupt but otherwise we can just hold questions to the end I'm going to give you a pretty good introduction to what the new horizons mission is about up beginning at the very beginning and so let's jump right in with that and see if I can you know that's there are you on the second slide okay well most of you will recognize this cartoon as a depiction of the middle and outer solar system orbiting the Sun you see the Sun in the middle and then those white circles are the orbits of Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune respectable I can't show on the scale the inner planets so beyond the orbit of the giant planets what we now call the middle zone of the solar system is the Kuiper belt that's the destination that new verizon society and the red line in this cartoon is is a depiction of our trajectory which is aimed to meet Pluto next July in fact on Bastille Day next July at the time that Pluto's orbit is crossing the plane of the solar system which is the most energetic and favorable way to reach Pluto from a launch giving standpoint you can see that we launched back in January of 2006 we flew through the Jupiter system for gravity assist in 2007 just 13 months later and for the last seven years almost seven and a half we have been flying the spacecraft across the Great Gulf of the giant planet region will be crossing the orbit of Neptune next month then Pluto encounter begins in January and then after that hopefully we will love move on and explore objects from the more distant reaches of the Kuiper belt which is shown there as a haze of particles well that's a very simple overview the way that we did this of course very simply that is crossing the solar system in record time in fact New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched the way that we did this is twofold one we built the very small compact space ball you might call it the tablet of spacecraft if you compare mainframes the tablets you think of Voyager is a mainframe and our vehicle as a tablet it's much smaller much less expensive but has a lot more capabilities at the main point and then I bought the biggest rocket anybody would sell me the Atlas 5 in its largest configuration call the Atlas 5 551 that that vehicle is about 80 meters tall almost closer to 70 actually and you see there in the upper right the blue arrow pointing at not just the spacecraft but also attached to the bottom of it the flaring green cone represents an extra stage that had never before been placed on top of an atlas 5 to give it even more speed so in effect we built such a small spacecraft that we want this monster off essentially empty with really nothing essentially nothing on it and so it built a very very fast feed in fact when we left the earth we crossed the orbit of the moon in just nine hours and to put that in perspective when I was a boy growing up and Apollo missions were going from they launched at 25,000 miles an hour and it took three days to reach the moon we did it in about point three days now you might ask you know this is sort of expensive how did we get to do this in fact some of the core people on my team worked on this for a very long time to get a mission to Pluto in the Kuiper belt we began in nineteen eighty nine at the time is young scientists we didn't really know how to sell a space mission like that a billion dollar enterprise we thought we might commercialize it originally we thought about something like this but this doesn't really work in space science it works very well for Virgin Galactic the suborbital industry it works great for communication satellite or land remote sensing but it doesn't work in science very well what you have to do in the United States and the science enterprise is make the case that your mission has more scientific value than all the others competing for the same dollar so that you can get to the top of the funding and that's what we did and it took us 14 years to do that it was a very long difficult struggle in fact we went through a whole series of different mission studies working with NASA and oftentimes we would get cancelled and we'd have to start over from scratch and find another approach and for the younger people in the audience I would just say that if you think of bullying at science don't forget that there's a big aspect of perseverance involved give me an expensive big-ticket space on its particle physics things like that now actually sold the mission part of it was making the case to our national academy of sciences just how fascinating the Pluto system is and how much it has to teach us and I'm going to give you a few examples of that and then I'm going to tell you what was really made the difference what put it over the top what we call a home run hit in the States but let me start with this and it's something that many people don't appreciate and it was quite surprising when we learned it and that is that Pluto is not really an icy body it has ices on its surface and we see them in the high reflectance the albedo of the surface we see them spectroscopically but the first time that Pluto's density was measured jaws dropped because no one thought of the outer solar system as a place where rocky planets should form and yet we found that Pluto's density is about twice the density of water ice and when you model that it means that Pluto is about seventy percent rock I'm asked it is a rocky planet encased in an icy shell but it is primarily a rocky planet and that really surprised the planetary science community in it in a fundamental way then as we began to develop information about through those surface and you see on the lower image on the lower right the best picture we've ever had made with a Hubble Space Telescope we began to see surface details even at low resolution there you can see at the top wilton believed to be a very bright northern polar cap and as we were able to obtain spectrum we found that the surfaces very complex with multiple volatile on the surface I sins that are thermally active they can move around in the same way that water transports from the ocean to snows on the surface through the atmosphere of the earth we found that methane carbon monoxide and nitrogen all lie on Pluto's surface and that all of them can act like water eyes done on earth this is a very complex system and is no doubt related to why the surface reflectivity is so bright up but interestingly enough if you look at that spectrum on the left you see that little tiny spectral feature of due to nitrogen and it's a very hard to detect creature because nitrogen just doesn't interact well with sunlight for atomic physics reasons but that little kink in the spectrum when inverted tells us that the surface of Prudhoe and therefore its atmosphere are both primarily nitrogen in fact it's estimated that Pluto's surface is about ninety percent nitrogen that's the same stuff that you're breathing right now 70 / seventy-seven percent of the Earth's air is nitrogen and on in Pluto's atmosphere it's about ninety percent margin with about ten percent carbon monoxide and just a trace of methane gas whois atmosphere itself was discovered in the late 1980s when the Clipper airborne observatory and several ground-based telescopes all simultaneously observed a star disappearing behind Pluto in a predicted event of an occultation and by detecting the signature of refraction which you see in that little blue graph in the bottom center we were able to establish that Pluto has an axe here and what you see in that graph is the light level at the beginning of the graph on the left upper left that black trace of Pluto plus the star and then the star goes behind Pluto and the light level drops off but if you look carefully you'll notice the light level doesn't drop off immediately like a square wave it takes several tens of seconds to drop and that is the signature of a fraction if there were no atmosphere the signature the star level would go away we would see only Pluto within just a few seconds as the star disappears that long decline tells us there's an atmosphere there you can learn other things from this crap for example you see the same pattern on the right hand side where the star is emerging that tells us the atmosphere is global not just a spot like a dome over some particular place onto though but that it's a global acts here in fact this atmosphere has now been observed on dozens of places on Pluto's surface so we know truly global also if you look even closer at the trace the black trace in that center bottom you'll notice that the slope is it's sort of steep at the top but then about halfway down it's even steeper and makes a u-shaped trough at the bottom that steepening tells us that one of two things is going on a tour of X with either there are Hayes's that are extinct ting the light removing the light more rapidly or there's a change in the refractive index of the atmosphere do Thermal structure in the bottom half of the atmosphere and we're still debating at this day but the fact that total have actual that it's extremely distended that is that it it's much larger than the planet itself and that models tell us that the atmosphere is escaping hydrodynamically which is a fancy term for saying the way that the Earth's curly hydrogen helium atmosphere left it's very interesting to planetary scientists because this is the one laboratory that we have in the solar system to study the same escape process this hydrodynamic escape that removed the Earth's primordial acid and so the high density of Pluto the rocky nature of Pluto the complex surface appearance and Composition the hydrodynamic escape of its atmosphere acted like ornaments on a Christmas tree to the scientific community to attract a lot of interest adding to that the fact that Pluto has really fascinating satellite system when we first started trying to sell a Pluto mission only its large satellites Sharon about the size of Texas that is about 1200 kilometers across was known but what was known about it very importantly is that Sharon seems to have been created in a giant collision between some former planet and Pluto that's falled material off into orbit coalesced in orbit around Pluto to become shed and that's the same formation mechanism as the formation of our moon which added even more interest to sending a mission to Pluto because by going to Pluto we could learn not just about the early Earth's atmosphere but also about the formation of the earth-moon system since then of course we've discovered Pluto has a much more complex system of satellites a total of five satellites now none for small ones and you see their names there Nix and Hydra Kerberos and Styx and then the very large when share and they're all shown to scale in the upper left you see their orbits are all in the same plane and they're all circular this probably means they were all formed together in that one cataclysmic collision and again this adds to our interest in going there because we keep finding in our studies of Pluto more and more interesting things that bring on more aspects of frontline planetary science from atmospheric to interiors to the surface to the satellite system all of these contributed to the case to spend the money on this mission and not some other but this wasn't enough let me tell you what really made the difference it was the discovery of the Kuiper belt and on this slide I'm depicting the solar system as we knew it before the early 1990s what I call the dark ages of planetary souls when I learned first things I learned about our solar system in grade school well before the 90s I probably learned what you look which is the solar system has four inner rocky terrestrial planets for giant gas giant planets on the outside and a little misfit on Pluto that nobody understood if you look on the upper right in that logarithmic graph the log-log chart you see that the depiction of the solar system where the horizontal axis is distance from the Sun in units of the earth-sun distance and mass vertically depicted in units of the Earth's mass so the earth on this plot why is that the coordinates 11 and you see grouped around it Venus similar mass but a little quotes from the Sun Mercury and Mars somewhat lower mass one closer to the Sun one further but there's a distinct grouping the terrestrial planets and then there's a distinct grouping in the giant planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune 10 to 100 times more massive in fact true pedor three hundred times more massive and then in the blue box far beyond the giant planets Pluto with much smaller masks and didn't fit either group didn't fit the pattern thought to be a misfit but the discovery of the Kuiper belt changed my law and what I hope to do here is to show you a graphic a visualization of the Kuiper belt and the discoveries of objects in it but it looks like the video won't start let me see if I can try it a different way I'd like you to see this so bear with me and I'll show this video let's start it I hope you can see it and you should be able to hear it these are the discoveries of pepper belt objects with time since the 1990s huge numbers of corporate belt objects beyond the orbit of Neptune they are depicted by their relative sizes the largest one is about as large as gluto now as you watch this is going to show you a view from the plane of the solar system pluto is the one that looks closest to us if you can see my cursor upon it you can see that this is a very fat distribution of orbit rises far above and travels far below the plane of the poster planets and I didn't produce this alex parker gets credit for it you let me now go back to the slides the revolution of the Kuiper belt is truly fundamental here's another depiction of the left looking down of known corker belt objects shown in red and white depending upon their orbit class all the blue thoughts in the middle are our Jovian Trojan asteroids they're not part of the court the belt when you look at that I know some of you will see some things that will puzzle you first you'll notice that there's a gap near the bottom here near the six o'clock position or there appear to be no quicker belt objects that not so that's the direction of the galactic center that's the direction of Sagittarius and the star fields are so crowded that we don't normally put our send our telescopes to look there it's just too hard so the apparent gap is only an appearance it's just that no one looks there you might also notice that the Kuiper belt objects sometimes appear to be aligned in radial fingers and that's not structure in the Kuiper belt that's just reflecting the results of individual telescopic observing runs we're quite a number of quattro belt objects will be discovered along a single line of sight in a single night or a few nights what rebelled did was revolutionized planetary science for three reasons first it showed us we were completely wrong that what we thought was the outer solar system where the giant planets all it was really the middle solar system we've had it completely wrong secondly we started to discover numerous small planets in the collector belt objects rivaling and maybe even equalling pluto-sized we didn't know in planetary science until the late 90s and the early 2000s that the solar system was very very good at making small planets and it's small planets dominate the population of our soloists we also learned that this great head originated in that population the colors shown on the right are real you see a great variation in colors probably reflecting the great variation surface composition or surface evolution and we learned that Pluto is not a misfit there may be as many as a thousand dwarf planets in the solar system in fact it appears that the terrestrial planets and the giant planets or the misfit that that the dwarf planets dominate the population of our soul disks and that is what so revolutionize planetary salts that the United States National Academy of Sciences catapulted this mission to the very top of the queue for funding in 2003 so I think I said what's on this chart and I just want to point out the same time we were going through this revolution in discovering trans-neptunian wiper belt objects and their discovery rates were rocketed we were discovering exoplanets in larger and larger numbers around other stars and I tie those two things together they're both due to advancing technology in astronomy in the case of the exoplanets through radio velocity and augmentation techniques in case of trans-neptunian objects through big telescopes and sensitive ccds and very heavy computer processing to pull needles out of haystacks but in both cases what we learned is that our view of what is and what isn't a planet was very biased by our knowledge up until the nineteen ninety-two balance all we knew about work the inner planets of our solar system and the middle zone of the giant planets and we didn't know about the hot Jupiters or the balsa wood plan explore walk pulsar planets super Earths that were to be discovered nor do we know about the dwarf planets that certainly orbit other stars and which we've discovered so many of them now in our own solar system it's oh goodness so the PowerPoint just quit now it's coming back up can you see it yeah let me catch up are you looking at a picture of a little girl yeah you are yeah good well shown you know this is something I tell my colleagues we've got to get over we may have learned that planets were small in number and very special because we live on one but in reality there are lots of them and like the Stars we will never remember the names of them all and we don't need to just like mountains in geology rivers and earth science stars and galaxies in astronomy the numbers of planets are now too large to ever memorized and no one should ever try the top part of this diagram shows the planets of our solar all of them beginning in orange is actually the Sun but then Jupiter that's too big to fit on scale Saturn Uranus and Neptune the blue arc all much larger than the earth then you can see the Earth and Venus Mars and so on this includes the satellite planets those satellites that are large enough to be considered planets by many planetary scientists and Pluto is actually if you can see my cursor in the middle of that diagram my cursor is pointed at it and this is a bit of a Copernican revolution for us for you and also for a scientific we just didn't realize that planets would be so prevalent in our solar system or in fact in others and it further displaces us I think from the center of the universe in that the kind of planet we live on a terrestrial planet an earth-mass class object close to its star turns out to be very rare really you can see in that diagram at the top that most planets are nothing like the earth the earth is unusually large and compositionally much denser with an iron core than most of these other objects in our solar system we call planets those things catapulted this mission at the top of the queue got us our funding NASA put out a request for proposals listing these objectives for the study of Pluto and incorporate belt objects beyond and we wrote a proposal to respond to that list to fit within the budget cap with NASA gave and the time limit that NASA gave to get the mission launched this is the cover of the New Horizons proposal it's about as thick as an old-style phone book from New York City that proposal ran about 1500 pages and described how we would build a spacecraft how it was design how we would build the sensors on board who the team members are how we would reduce the data the flight operations the launch beautiful the nuclear launch or Google and many more things big thick budget sections management sections everything and we competed with other teams that proposed to do the Pluto mission but mighty New Horizons one and we were told that we won on November 29th 2001 and we built that spacecraft in four years this is New Horizons shown four years later in November of 2005 after its construction was complete this is down at the Cape where we launched it in Florida I like this picture a lot because you can see people next to it for scale pretty small everything we need for the journey the guidance systems the scientific sensors the flight computers communication system the power system everything is in that box or attached to it you can see it's sitting on a stand on the black hair curler looking a fair on the left is a nuclear-powered generator called an RTG because we're going too far from the Sun to power the spacecraft with solar power you can see the dish antenna on top most of the spacecraft doesn't yet have the thermal blankets we reflected the gold and reflective material on it yet so you can really see the walls of the spacecraft and if you can see my cursor on pointing now in the upper right-hand corner at a couple of the scientific instruments all the scientific instruments point out of the spacecraft where they have clear views let me tell you a little bit about our scientific payload we have the most sophisticated payload ever sent on a first reconnaissance mission to any object in the solar system it's light years ahead of a Voyager ad of course our instruments were designed and built with 2000s technology instead of 1970s technology but we carry a very complete sweep of sensors I'll start at the top and we'll go counterclockwise I'll start with rex which is radio science that experiment which uses our radio communication system will probe temperature and pressure structure and profile includes axle and measure the pressure at the bottom of the acts here also measure put a surface temperature at a variety of places in the same for the large satellites Sharon moving to the left you see Pepsi and you see another instrument swab Pepsi is a mega volt mega electron volt analyzer swap is a kilovolt electron till electron volt analyzer that together let us study material coming off of pluto zack suit so we can sample its composition and the rate at which its escaping then moving around at the bottom position you see Laurie Laurie stands for the long-range reconnaissance imager it's like a celestron eight telescope more sophisticated with a thousand by thousands ccd in the back this long focal length camera lets us begin the encounter about 10 weeks before you reach Pluto and beat Hubble resolution for 10 weeks on the way in and ten weeks on the way out it also gives us very high resolution imagery of food i'll show you something about that later and it lets us study Pluto's far side which we will not fly by at very close range because put a turns very slowly on its axis let's get good images in the Far salt and the same for the satellites then moving around the next instrument is the student dust counter and its job is really a cruise science instrument it measures the rate of collisions on the spacecraft by dust particles and will be particularly important in tracing out the density of matter in the Kuiper belt the last two instruments are called Ralph and Alice Ralph is our main imaging system it has eight ccds inside that let us do color imaging optical navigation and a variety of other kinds of mapping broadband mapping of the total system it's not as higher resolution as in Laurie but it has this color capability that's very important it also has embedded in Ralph an infrared mapping spectrometer which will allow us to obtain a quarter-million spectra on Pluto circles to map every location we see for its composition so instead of showing you one spectrum of Pluto like I did earlier we'll be able to know at every place on to know what the dominant composition is of different places whether it's dejected blankets from craters or polar caps or on mountaintops frosty or regions darker regions well Ralph is our composition mapping spectrometer in addition to being our main amateur and then alice is our ultraviolet mapping spectrometer that will determine the composition of the atmosphere as a function of altitude this payload is not only more sophisticated in its capability than any ever since on the first reconnaissance of another planet it is also very highly miniature walls the entire payload seven instruments has less mass than the camera alone on the casino Saturn orbit and draws less wattage when they're all running at once then one standard US light bulb in fact all seven instruments at once including their flight computers draw less than 30 watts so we got this thing built the rocket was delivered on time and we launched in on january nineteen 2006 during a very short critical launch window to allow us to fly to Jupiter for graduate schools and I have a launch video but we're running behind and the videos aren't working so I'm skipping that you've seen Rockets launch before I'll just say that our first stop was Jupiter we made that gravity assist very successfully we also conducted over 700 observation from the Jupiter system and this was a chance for us to test out our instrumentation and a lot of the software that will be used next year for the tweto flyball and of course it speeded up our trajectory and shaved for years off the flight bone so that we could cross the solar system in only nine and a half years up by one comparison Voyager took 13 years to reach more than a little more than 13 years to reach Pluto's orbit although Pluto is nowhere near by we're doing it about nine and a half years and we had a very good success at Jupiter not just been hitting that aim point but in testing all that instrumentation good science the imagery you see here on the cover of science magazine from 2007 one of the premier journals like nature are actual images made by New Horizons Jupiter and IO if you look closely at the satellite I oh you'll notice that blue bit at the top that's one of several volcanoes we're going off as we flew by I owe this next slide shows other imagery of Io with the same volcano at the North Pole it's called the Vashta are the blue is real color it's not enhanced and it's not a false color that's actual emission from gases in in the plume of the volcano on the upper left you can see infrared imagery of the backside the night side of Io you can see numerous volcanoes going off the one that's saturated the top is too Vossler again the same one that you easily see in the other images we made many studies of Pluto's atmosphere Jupiter's atmosphere Jupiter's ring system other satellites plasma studies in the magnetosphere we did lots of science of Jupiter I think the most interesting thing to show you is this movie that we made up to Vashta are erupting this is the first time lapse that has ever been constructed of a volcano anywhere in the solar system except our earth and it it only spans eight minutes of real time it only has five frames so I'll show it to you three times I'll show it now forward and backward forward yet again that volcano has a muzzle speed of about a kilometer per second io is the size of the Earth's moon it is 3,500 kilometers in diameter and that volcano is ejecting material from the inside of Io up more than 100 kilometers almost 200 kilometers in space if you look carefully on the limb of Io at the seven o'clock position and along the terminators you can see bright spots that are other clues not as large other volcanoes going off but the Vashta are really is the mother of them all so that's a little bit about our Jupiter battle this is another nice image from New Horizons as we left with Jupiter system it's actually a composite of three images with Jupiter below and then two of its large planet sized satellites including io and we spent the next eight years flying across the middle zone of the solar system we actually fly New Horizons very differently than most space missions New Horizons hibernates most of each year and wherever that you see the magenta or purplish color were hibernating and then the other colors are wake ups where we either doing course corrections instrument calibrations or check outs of the spacecraft and what this allows us to do the hybrid spacecraft is too old it's very important first you know we're doing this mission for about twenty percent of the cost of the Voyager mission it's really a breakthrough in low-cost outer planet exploration and but one part of the low cost is not having to have a large round the clock operations team when the spacecraft is hibernating we use the operations team to plan the Pluto encounter it took us eight years to plan it because we only have about 25 people on that operations and engineers by comparison Voyager head over 400 people on the on the team the other thing that hibernation allows us to do is to let mostly electronics rest for most of the flight so although New Horizons will be nine and a half years old nine and a half years from launch completo informal at the time we arrived most of the electronics will have a very small amount of on time about three years so the spacecraft is from an aging standpoint much younger than you could otherwise achieve I like to make the analogy if you bought a television back in 2006 January and you want to make sure it was operated in the summer of 2015 you could run it all the time or you could leave it off except for an occasional periods into your check it out and turns out if you test electronics that way if you run things all the time versus lead a lot mostly phone fine ladder is a much better strategy for preserving the life of those electronics so that's what we did on the right you can see where we are now for about a year from encounter in fact we arrived fifty four weeks from now on Tuesday the 14th of July Bastille Day next year but the encounter itself is not just that day for that week but we specifically designed this space ball to be capable of a very long and intensive encounter with the Pluto system which actually begins after our last hibernation food this fall we wake the spacecraft up in December parrot foreign counter the counter begins in January it gets very intensive in May and even more so in June closest approach comes in July we continue to study the Pluto system through these departure phases to see below where my cursor is and then we begin a very long download or downlink of imagery and spectra and other beta sex one of the ways that we design new horizons in expensive was by making sure that it was very capable at Pluto of taking as much data as possible so we designed the sensor sweep to be useful even months out we put very large solid state memories on board the spacecraft and we have very fast bus speeds on the spacecraft so we can operate multiple instruments at once where we saved our money's in telecommunications and this spacecraft actually communicates with your very slowly from Pluto's distance at speeds of one or two thousand bits per second which is much slower than you would ever stand for reading email and for that reason it takes us the rest of 2015 from july to December and virtually all of 2016 to get all the data the ground so from your perspective this mission will look a lot like an orbital not a fast flyby although we take the data primarily in the first six months of 2015 you'll be seeing new imagery and new results as will we on the science team every month month after month for the rest of 2015 and all of 2016 now of course we're intelligent about it because we could always have a failure we're going to send them the most valuable data sets first but you never know where the discoveries are gonna live and the last of it doesn't come down until the end of 2060 I'm we do feel now like we're close to arriving but not just because it's next year but also because we can now resolve Pluto separately from its largest satellite Sharon in imagery made by New Horizons these images were made last summer and in just a few weeks you'll see more imagery where twice as close now one year out instead of two and we're going to make a rotation movie of the satellites not just shared but others orbiting Pluto against the star fields that will allow us to more precisely comb in on the Pluto system because we're actually using those data for parallax purposes to measure where Pluto is from close range where we are and to target our arrival by making engine burns to home in based on those data when we arrived at Pluto the geometry is something like this the red line is our trajectory we're coming from the direction of the Sun so the trajectory begins in the lower right follows the red line to the upper left Pluto like the planet Uranus is tipped over on its side and you can see the satellites are presented to the trajectory almost in a perpendicular fashion which means when we're closest to Pluto were closest to all the satellites on the same day that's a little bit unfortunate because it complicates the encounter planet if Fudo were upright like the earth instead of on its side like Uranus we could encounter each satellite individually one at a time on approach but instead we have this geometry this is what the universe gives us and so we're going to have to divide our attention between pluto and charon and mix and hive your sticks and fear boils on that closest day we have all those different objects to study at once and so a lot of choreography goes into the UH the flight planning six different objects that we want to study and we want to search for new moons search for rings other dust assemblages that may be and we want to target the spacecraft so accurately that we fly through the shadows of pluto and charon because we can use the disappearance of the Sun fruit Pluto's atmosphere to study the composition of the atmosphere as a function of altitude and to search for an atmosphere around show we're also targeting the shadows Europe so that our radio science experiment can measure that temperature pressure profile so we have to do a lot of image approach send the imagery to the ground where our navigation and mission design themes calculate what engine burns we have to make to fly through these very narrow shadows at very high speed to achieve those occupations it's going to be very exciting on approach this is one little snippet of the flight plan each one of those colored depictions that looks rather like a battery like a sea cell battery in the States for a portable electronic device is a different observation this is just a few hours on one day um and the different colors represent different instruments the red is an infrared mapping spectrometer blues the ultraviolet mapping spectrometer Green is the visible mapping camera the orange sort of color is radio science etc and what I want you to learn from this is that we're going to be doing many things at once in a very intensive wall over a thousand scientific observations with this very powerful suite of instruments looking at different objects Pluto Charon Nix etc you can see those what we call license plates the names out to the right of each observation like the top one says p Lisa Alice 18 that's a Pluto observation by the recent infrared mapping spectrometer with the Alice ultraviolet instrument writing along for free also observing and this is the first in a sequence of Biebs 18 below it will be later to a TV etc I'm not going to go through any more of this but I want you to get a feeling for how intensive the encounter works and then I'll just wrap up by saying we don't know what we're going to find that the exciting part this is a completely new kind of planet everywhere we've ever sent a reconnaissance mission in the history of planetary exploration we've really been surprised you know in the early days they didn't expect river valleys on Mars or volcanoes on venus were from Mercury to be a planet virtually all core for I ought to have volcanoes in the outer solar system I could go on and on like the ocean at Europa right on down the list everywhere we've been we found these tremendous surprises when we got close if it really see this world in detail um this is an image of something else at the same resolution as our current best imagery of tuna and I defy anyone to tell very much about this object in space from this image this is the true object you can see how primitive our knowledge of Pluto is today our imagery of Pluto will be much better than this imager imagery of the earth that I'm showing through let me illustrate it one more time this is something else at Pluto resolution and I think my colleagues in the planetary science community could write a bunch of papers about this image because it would be the best we have about this red object imaged at low resolution at a distance it seems to have structure in it perhaps a southern polar cap some sort of lighter bluer structure and upper left you could go on and I'll and analyze this image and you'd be completely wrong that's sorry I didn't get the Union Jack in there on the weekend haha but you I'm making the point that we really know almost nothing and that's what's so much fun about New Horizons it's raw exploration and i would say hold on to your hats let me show you this in the upper left is an image of Pluto I'm sorry an image of Triton Pluto sighs planet orbiting Neptune which Voyager studied in 1989 and on the right you can see what Triton revealed to Voyager just below that fuzzy image of Triton made by the Hubble Space Telescope in the upper left is a fuzzy black-and-white of Pluto at the same resolution and you can see when we got the Triton how much more detail on the imagery allowed us to see the big polar cap The Geysers the black smudges on the surface the lack of craters the telescope Triton is internally active many other things the magenta inset the blow up if you will shows how much better we will do it Pluto then Voyager would have been able to do at it been sent there we're going to get imagery that's about ten times higher resolution than anything Voyager did that means a hundred times as many pixels in those images and we will see much more detail by the way the inset isn't really from Triton it's taken from an image of one of the satellites of Jupiter but it's just to illustrate let me illustrate our higher resolution one more way taking that picture of the earth and blowing up New York City which is shown on the right to the very best resolution that we will obtain with new horizons and I realize some of you may not have been to New York so you may not appreciate this if i put london on it would have worked better this is manhattan island in the middle the hudson river along the left side or the west side of manhattan the east river running along manhattan on the other side governor's island you can see Brooklyn big parks like Prospect Park Central Park in New York in Manhattan itself you can count the ponds in Central Park you can see some of the broader avenues running down the town town you can count the wharf for the big ships on the Hudson this is the kind of detail it better than 100 meters per pixel that we will have of course I don't expect us to see any cities on Pluto but it gives you a feeling or just how detailed the imagery will be and remember with every image we get a compositional spectrum so we're very excited then after the Pluto flyby we hope to have targets to fly further in the fiber belt and observe smaller primitive Piper belt objects in the years after Pluto flyby we're looking for those now with a Hubble Space Telescope and i'm going to close with this video i think this one works it's just for fun but enjoy you I love the credits take a look at this okay and we have the best bumper sticker in the space business for new verizon's i'll close with that and say thank you for inviting me today if I can answer a few questions as your will gonna Ellen yes I can't you have a question so maybe David or someone's been repeated loudly I'm Alan health after photo will new horizons last how far will it go usefully well we we think that like a lot of spacecraft new verizon is very healthy we think that that dumb barring mechanical you know our electronics failures that the spacecraft will probably die of power starvation in late 2030s about a hundred times as far from the Sun as the earth is about triple Pluto's distance will it still be doing useful science in 20-30 repeat please will it still be doing useful science in the 2030 well I hope so we have the power to do avoid you're like missions of the heliosphere our instrumentation that Pepsi and swap instruments in the dust cattle are much more powerful than they are equivalent instruments in fact there's no dust counter on on Voyager so this will be a first time investigation with SWAT and Pepsi have much more sensitivity to study the outer coil school i and voyager did so we expected to be doing good science right to rule that depends upon funding of course that the spacecraft is capable hello and just question the electronics you save more reliable descending into sleep mode and I would sort of be more reliable if it kept at a constant temperature may being remain remaining turned on permanently and T just explain what it is well there's a sweet spot in the middle if you leave it on all the time then you risk using up the the design life of the parts the capacitors and resistors and the chips etc if you leave it off all the time you're not using any of that if you turn it on and off too many times in between your risk hurting it with the on off site but we have only cycled New Horizons once or twice per year all the way out and i'm not an electrical engineer i'm a planetary scientist but the spacecraft design team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics lab where New Horizons was built is among the best in the world possibly the best of them and our engineers designed this hibernation strategy to prolong the life and reduce the risk and help us save money as well and it's been very very successful how long will the information takes to get back each individual bit has to cross the solar system at the speed of light from Pluto that's about four and a half hours and we can down link about a hundred megabits per day we're going to take close to 100 gigabits so even with data compression strategies it takes more than a year to get it all back but you'll see lots of imagery beginning next January it'll get really interesting around Bay and beginning in june you'll see new things every day and that will continue for a year and a half how accurately can you navigate new horizons how do you know exactly where it is that one so we so there's two things involved a navigation is the art of determining where you are or where you are relative to something else like the earth or Pluto and then as guidance which is targeting to go where you want to go and we can measure put it excuse me new verizon sins position to a few hundred meters using modern techniques we can measure its velocity to millimeters per second our principal unknown is where Pluto is this is true for every first flyby of a new planet till you've been there you don't have an accurate orbit you have an accurate orbit but not a sufficiently a little bit the current uncertainty influence position is about 10,000 kilometers so as we approach Pluto will make images against the star feels it that will use Pluto in the positions of its satellites and more sizes to let us refine how far we are from Pluto ultimately we expect to arrive with an error of only about 30 kilometers left and right from where we're aiming and only a couple of hundred kilometers a long track which is our are less sensitive access for the trajectory so our arrival time is going to be known to about one minute pretty good they say could you run the buses yeah this is as good as the German trains for sure I could not hear the lady speaking so quiz with that thing about when it go through the fourth belt as well but I think that's a little bit too far life so so New Horizons will traverse the Oort cloud a thousand times farther away but it will be a derelict there will be a dead spacecraft the spacecraft is traveling so fast then it is escape the gravity the Sun already at it will fly out into the Milky Way galaxy prove your clout on its way where exactly is it heading in the direction of spice constellation wise it's heading behind the direction of Pluto which turns out to be the constellation Sagittarius which is one thing that's been bedeviled us in looking for quicker belt targets remember that chart I showed that no one looks in that direction that's where we're headed and that's where we have to look that's why it requires the Hubble Space Telescope to do it because the star fields are so crowded that you need the sharper resolution a bubble to find these very faint guys behind clean still I wonder yes and I am conscious memory you were saying here at times it scientists at one particular question if you like actually is repeat yeah just louder if there's one particular question you really want offices that I want answered yeah your personal question that you really want answers I have to say it's top secret I've been telling audiences that for 15 years okay okay well thank you very much Alan over fantastic their presentation sauce the ether and a lot to the vote of thanks for edible to hear been spending your time with us today and thank you all again for inviting me it was a pleasure and hold on to your hats it's going to be very very exciting next year well Humphrey could you come back and I'd love to where it's going to be busy just a wee bit busy but after encounter me okay thank you very much well by now okay leave you in peace now Alan thank you very much I am
