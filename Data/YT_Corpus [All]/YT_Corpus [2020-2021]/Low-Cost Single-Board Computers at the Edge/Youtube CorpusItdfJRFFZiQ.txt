 you know thank you good yeah good day good evening wherever you may be this is a Walt white cut and I've been in the cloud for about ten years and we'll be talking a little bit about the edge products and this Carina kinda indicated we usually spend a significant amount of time on this because there's a lot of variables having said that our contact information is later in the stack and you'll get that information seeing things as if there's a question or a spark of interest you might have a follow-on discussion so Ronnie if you can go to the next slide you know why are we here I think when people look at this quote from Gartner and you'll kind of think just notionally with your smartphone and think about what that was just a few years ago with just pictures and - what potentially like I use my phone it helps me with navigating traffic across the national capital region and the crowdsourcing information that's tied to that device is allowing us to leverage some of the things that are tied to edge computing so looking at artificial intelligence and m/l models that route me relative to crowdsourcing with not only my phone but thousands of others in the Washington DC metro area when we were meeting more often as opposed to now these days but the point with this slide is that going forward as more and more things get IP enabled or have a sensor that emit signals data that it was historically created in the data center is no longer the center of this this explosion of information it's actually coming from the edge and so Microsoft has invested significant technology as well as software and hardware to leverage this so you can get those patterns and those benefits not only in the commercial world like when it comes to driving safely and getting routed around DC but also helped us leverage information there are several companies as well as many government agencies that have used these are bid solution sets and have them accredited and certified to operate from the Department of fence to pretty much every cabinet level position with the Department of deployed and used across the government widely X lied please so some of the reasons that folks are looking or organizations are looking at hybrid are tied to these bullet points and so of late with lionized conversations over the last several months we're seeing a lot of folks with another one that's tied to essentially learning hyper scale cloud and we'll get into those some of those technical pieces later but as you can see with the information on the rights letter side significant interest both from commercial and government agencies and others that have actually built multi-cloud strategies and as I alluded to earlier with that slide significant amounts of data are coming outside of the data center so it's calling us rethink how we use information and data is kind of becoming the new oil or the gold when it comes to leveraging information from that and so hybrid architectures allowed us to speed up things relative to deployments and architectures at the edge make sense of things in a timely manner and then potentially not even send stuff to the data center anymore and there are several other use cases where folks are lifting and shifting applications or potentially building things as a move forward to modernize them next slide Ryan so some of the things that we look at is characteristics that should be thought about as you make investments in hybrid architectures and hybrid technology you need a comprehensive all-inclusive kind of capability where the ecosystem tied to these five bullet points has got mutual benefits for the end-user our own Liem partners and then obviously us as a company to derive benefits that allow you to leverage these things as I mentioned earlier to derive Public Safety benefits profit motives things of that nature and then there's others that are tied to the speed of light and latency well we can't operate without a hybrid operator it has something tied to the edge the core and potential hyperscale cloud and we'll cover some of those concepts and some of the following slides the the the latest type of originally the current and the more prevalent use case for supporting hybrid is that some companies or organizations do not want to put regulated or certain types of protected information into the cloud or the public cloud and so they they look for ways to build systems and services potentially linked on premises and then maybe strip out certain parts of data and put that up in the hyperscale cloud prevent things like a date exposure or breaches next slide please so we're gonna talk a little bit about you know back to those those pillars there you look in the center part of the slide so things that are tied to what should you look for to get consistency and holistic approaches from a cloud service provider and things that are tied to developing hybrid capability or pattern and so some of the foundational aspects are tied to the c2 pieces in the top part of the slide and so when you think about building something in a hybrid mode you're gonna have an application or maybe data that resides in an on-premise hybrid implementation as well as in the hyper scale cloud so you need things such as your code base the databases the environments to be consistent when it comes to the tooling and then as a developer or working things like an identity and jumping around relative to these five pillars things that people are familiar with when it comes to like a baseline of api's folks from the legacy of dotnet Visual Studio migrating something like Azure DevOps it provides you for the developer is a consistent platform where folks are familiar and comfortable with these things instance you know visual studio team service is an example from an app development perspective things that are tied to data tied to sequel databases that are essentially consistent that are operating in the cloud if you desire to go there or pull that into a hybrid on-premise implementation things like Postgres no sequel those common databases and having the consistency between what you have in the cloud as well as on-premise another aspect of these pillars and one of the biggest ones when you think about the largest identity solutions that on the planet Active Directory and looking at how that might work in an azure active directory invitation or potentially federating that with Azure Active Directory a federated services again those consistent tool sets being able to use things that you're familiar with in the cloud and on-premise provide you that comprehensive as well as consistent platform and the last one is when you think about and we're going to talk a little bit about this with ARC their partners shortly but having a platform that provides the same policies things like our back and implementation so that you have secure platform and can implement that with holistic governance that works the same in both platforms either on-premise or microscope cloud these are all key attributes and those pillars that contribute to things that are tied to or hybrid cloud platform next slide please oh don't spend a whole lot of time on these but as I kind of alluded to earlier there are several types of use cases we have three different products that Ryan I'll talk about shortly but each one of these has kind of nuanced approaches and layers and architecture relative to the specifics of your requirements and so that comprehensive platform can meet all of these use cases and many others that are out there next and then from a high-level picture we'd spend a lot more time talking about this if we had some more available tonight but we're going to focus primarily on the purple column they're about two-thirds the way to the right but the point in showing this from an intelligent edge perspective and developing hybrid solutions and giving you kind of a layout of what the product sets are holistically from from our leadership perspective and Southey has talked about this we're providing you a capability like an azure sphere micro control they're very inexpensive but very singly purpose-built to allow you to take information from the edge for instance like something's open or closed or it's hot where it's vibrating and then leverage that across this this essentially spectrum of capabilities and giving you some information and then putting it in where it makes sense based upon your requirements and your needs or speed to get information at the edge you can leverage all of these devices and in combination derive an architecture that really suits you your purpose your needing the clients as well as your mission and moving to the right if you think about capabilities go from an IOT device moving to an edge device it's got more compute more storage capability to the stack edge and the stack rather we spent a little bit more time today talking about and the hyper scale you have a certain amount of form factor low and very simple on the left side and moving all the way up we've got tremendous capability and random just just unbelievable capacities but simple form factors relative to how you interface through the portal and so picking and choosing and building this gives you a lot of variability that's why we mentioned earlier a lot of complicated potential architectures and getting it right is the goal that myself and roundwood focus on if you have an interest in taking this conversation further next slide please Ryan over to you awesome thanks well so by way of introduction my name is Ryan Zeller I work in the federal space along side wall covering our federal DoD partners and customers and happy to be presenting tonight on our set of edge workloads in portfolio so we're going to touch on each of these it's going to go pretty quick I'll add a little bit of commentary as we go through based on some experience and some learnings and as Walt said we're happy to engage you know after this conversation during a QA or in the future with our contact information so what you're looking at here is a set of those edge product lines that fell within that purple column of edge products from the previous slide Walt talked about and so I want to touch on each of these briefly understand what the use case is understand when it makes sense to use those versus the hyper scale cloud and how the three products are differentiated and so you can kind of see just a few bullets here but as we go into that you know we'll start with Azure stack up so Azure stack Hub has been out for several years and its really our product around bringing a subset of Azure services into your data center or into your customers data center and really the value prop or the reason it by which you would want to use an azure stack hub is really highlighted on the right so it's really around scenarios where you have an investment in the hyper scale cloud and Azure but you've got workloads or you've got situations be it a tactical edge data sovereignty classified environment where you need to run those workloads at the edge not in the hyper scale cloud and you want to take those investments and tooling and knowledge of the Azure ecosystem and you want be able to apply those out to the edge and so that's one scenario the second one's really around regulatory or data sovereignty or as we refer to it at Microsoft data gravity and so where that data needs to sit and you want to bring those azure services closer and then finally it's all about maybe I want to do some app modernization an app modernization might be using some of the the platform services or the infrastructure is code that we have built in through our as a resource management API that's exposed from the Nasher stack up and so on the left hand side what you'll see is you know some of the characteristics of Azure stack it's a purpose-built system so think of it as an appliance where you partner with our OEMs and then you get this sub set of hardware to run and then you operate it in your data center and you control it similar to how Microsoft would operate as your region's on behalf of your customers and so some of the use cases that we typically see again are really around disconnected environments so if you've got those disconnected scenarios and you want to bring as your services there you can do so also field operations or humanitarian assistance we've seen scenarios there across you know multiple customers within the federal not only us but worldwide and if you look at this from the developer perspective or from an IT Pro it's really around dev sec ops and dev sec ops is all about how do i hydrate my workload and make that available and end and achieve that you know accreditation or ATO if you will within the the defense space and so if you look at Asher Asher is just a target at endpoint it's an API and we're doing the same thing with Azure stack hub so you see I could just put my workloads within this pipeline and that pipeline here we're illustrating as your DevOps but this could be any sort of IDE or or CSE the pipeline that your organization is using and then just look at Azure as a targeted endpoint a release same thing with Azure stack hub and maybe the same thing with something with your on-premises data center and so we can understand as your resource management templates on Azure stack hub similar to how we do that in a sure okay so popping over to Azure stack edge so azure stack edge is another hardware appliance this hardware appliance has got a little different business model and by which you order this from the azure portal so this is hardware as a service straight from Microsoft and the use cases that you really see around Azure stack edge are highlighted on the right and so typically what we're seeing is customers that are developing cloud native applications and workloads and they're looking at kubernetes or they're looking at it's some sort of docker container and they want to have massive amounts of ingestion at the edge and then they want to bring that compute processing closer to where that data is generated that's where they will start to look at things like a stack edge and so a scenario could be you know training that machine learning model up in Azure taking that train model out to the edge and then bringing in data be it from a drone feed or whatever sort of collection end point and being able to process that through let's say some cognitive services that are looking for you know image recognition or you know speech to text or something of that nature and so those are sort of the scenarios that we're seeing with Azure stack edge and again this is going to support today it supports containers and we'll have kubernetes but in the future we have a roadmap for VMs and we're also bringing some other capabilities to the azure stack edge appliance these are the appliances that we have available so we've got the commercial series appliances that you see on the left so I think the most intriguing that we're seeing now a lot of interest in is the new T for GPU that's a part of the carful series and then of course we've announced some ruggedized series that we're gonna be bringing to the market as well and if you look at a solution architecture around what does this really do and what does this mean for you or your customers it allows you to take those various on-premises devices and be able to suck in the data and ingest that and then do that local compute and that doesn't mean that it's replacing the hyper scale cloud it's just that local first line element and you can then push it up to the hyper scale cloud for additional analytics or processing or storage for long term retention so this is just a basic diagram of how those can be used together some scenarios that we've seen with customers and partners is really around retail out of stock detection so you can see here we're using our cloud services by just using existing video camera captures as well as operating rooms Olympus did a great study you can look at it out here on YouTube where they've done hospital oh our prep and so they had cameras that are looking at the o.r making sure everything is ready to go before they you know bring in the patient and the staff to do their work another scenario I think that's that's relevant this is manufacturing but across you know federal specifically this can apply in many different capacities but this is really around making sure that you know PPE in different scenarios are in play as well as you know damage product control and so if you look at bringing in those existing cameras and then you know training some model to look at that floor and then now you can get those metrics and then put those into an automation workflow and then take action on those based on what you're finding okay so let's pivot to Azure stack HCI so as your stack HSV I is a third appliance that's available and and this is really around the ability to run virtualized applications on Prem as well as replace those you know maybe that aging hardware or doing a refresh for those branch offices and so this doesn't have the azure control plane that sits on it but this is really more around virtualization workloads in in potentially running you know Windows or Linux or containers at the edge and doing that on a hyper-converged architecture so it's a little bit different than what you'll see with an azure stack hub so the scenarios again are on the right you can connect this to the azure hyper scale cloud and what we've done is we've wrapped this with a very easy admin UI called Windows admin Center and so what Windows admin Center does is it gives you a lot of capabilities to automate common tasks that you find to be difficult to repeat and so what we're doing is we're bringing in all of that IP from Microsoft and we're kind of putting that into those workflows and then it's it's able for you to easily make those deployment efforts so if you look at what as respect HCI looks like under the hood it's really just a validated partner hardware solution we've got over 20 partners that we that we're going to mark it with with that you're stuck HCI and then on top of that we're running Windows Server 2019 hyper-converged architecture layering it on top with Windows admin Center and then you're able to connect it into Azure from a hybrid perspective so you can do things like disaster recovery of those workloads backup in dr maybe some log analytics or application performance monitoring or whatever it might be so there's many scenarios and then again we're supporting the workloads that you have today so Windows Linux anything that can be virtualized can run on Azure stack HDI and then you're seeing those common administrative interfaces that you'd have to do in order to maintain an HCI environment and what we're doing is we're putting those all within the windows admin center and so that's got a lot of workflows that are in there that are wizard driven that allow you to do that automation at scale so building clusters building machines automating some of the hardware replacement those sorts of things so some of the use cases that we see around hazard stack HCI are really around like branch and edge offices VDI scenarios maybe you've got some high performance IO around sequel server endpoint virtualization and scale-out storage and so traditional HCI approach so another thing that I want to call out before we shift to the last section that I want to cover is we've published a lot of these hybrid cloud patterns out on Asscher calm and so I published or I added the github link here at the bottom so you'll you'll be able to take this and and look at that after the presentation but go out there and check those out we've got a lot of QuickStart templates that are available for code both for Azure stack hub for for edge and then soon over time well like we have some things out there for HCI and others but this is a great area to kind of understand what do these patterns look like how do they interact with the edge in the hyper scale and then once you start to develop and deploy those you can start to to get your idea of how these things work and then build your code on top of that so great places to start we're constantly adding and iterating to that okay so this brings me to the last section that I want to cover and this is this is one of the newest pieces so if you attended julia white session this morning there was a big hybrid event so i'll let the following presenters talk a little bit more about that and get into detail with the demo but Azure Ark is a service that we unveiled at ignite last year in November in Orlando and this is really about extending our control planning making it available to manage systems that are outside of Asia and so it's a common theme that we're hearing with customers especially within the federal space is they like what is available in Azure they like the centralized management and governance but it's very difficult when they can't move those workloads to Azure and they may not need tech go to maybe national stack or an edge they're fine with what they're doing but they just want to take advantage and that's really what as your arc is trying to solve it's really around bringing those non azure assets and bring them in under as your management and then now with that I can do some very interesting things around governance or policy so for example a few of the scenarios that were unveiling with Azure Ark are Azure Ark for servers so that's going to manage your server infrastructure regardless of where it's at on-premises private cloud maybe it's in a different public cloud the second one is going to be around azure arc for kubernetes and so how do I manage kubernetes at scale across my IT Estate and then the final one is around data services and so if we look at what this looks like from a management perspective asher is kind of your control plan and management plan for your asher assets and so what we're doing is we're essentially extending that and now you can bring in those systems that are in data centers branch offices multi-cloud so it's it's it's about the governance and management story it's not about bringing services per se into your data center but that's coming when you will get things like our data services and other options so let me give you a quick takeaway for each one of the services that we're unveiling with Azure Ark today so the first one's azure arc for servers so it's all about inventory governance being able to do some role based access integrate it with lighthouse so for those MSPs and partners that are out there that manage multiple has your subscriptions these will integrate because what ends up happening is these VMs and workloads become Azure resources and so then I can then I can use other azure services to overlay and start to control those the second one is around as your art for kubernetes and so it's going to provide centralized management for your kubernetes clusters regardless of where they're at and so you can do things like assign policy and make sure that your clusters are set up to the way that you they need to be within your enterprise organization you can put those into your git ops pipeline and then you can start to you know administer what you want those clusters to look like what's your the configuration be what sort of applications should go on their manage the pods to scale out all of that from a centralized control point up in Azure and then finally we're unveiling and this is I think we just got an update on this today from the the hybrid session this morning this is about as your arc for data services and so this one is still in a is in a private preview so you have to sign up on the azure portal and what this will do is allow you to bring as your managed instances of sequel as well as Postgres to the edge and run it on your appliances and so this is that true how do I get as a service like database as a service in my data center without it running in Azure and so that's really what we're kind of taking away with art for data services so if you want to go out and take a look at that we can manage OpenShift or aks engine or workloads in GCP or AWS so it doesn't matter as long as it's a kubernetes cluster I think it's version 1.1 for later we can take it under arc management and so that's a lot in a very short period of time as Corina mentioned we typically spend a few hours going through these products you can learn more on the entire portfolio of hybrid out on Azure comm slash hybrid Walt in myself email and contact information is here so please reach out to us from a federal perspective we can do a much deeper followup with your organization and with that I want to I don't want to shortchange Steve and Mike but I want to introduce Steve and Mike from a Vinod and they are going to show a demo on arc and they've done a really good at workflow here so Steve over to you
