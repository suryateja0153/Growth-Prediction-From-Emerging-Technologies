inviting us on uh for today so um today what i'm going to take you through is is how you can improve lead quality with ai powered call tracking so um i set up at eSales Hub about six years ago purely because um i realized how valuable calls were my background is that i was marketing director of hilton hotels i then moved to virgin as commercial director of halford auto center and i was charged with driving website sales and we created a fantastic site we took the site from six million quid to 80 million quid in 12 months and it was about driving bookings online and it was only one day when i was actually in one of the halfords auto centers that i could hear the phone ringing i was ringing off the hook and i think myself uh you know are any of those calls being generated you know via the website because we were promoting the telephone number of the auto center on the web page but we weren't attributing any of those sales or even any of those calls or any of our marketing and i'll be quite honest with you i figured that i could potentially be missing my boat and see if i did track it so as i started to move through my career i was looking for solutions that would give me an answer to the problem of how can i make sure that all the cells that i generate are attributed to my knocking spend and one of my uh i guess one of the good things i've done in my career is it's not just about finding those channels that work really really well for you it's also what i call legging out so negating the keywords that don't work or getting rid of those channels at the end of my drive visitors or they might drive inquiries but they don't actually convert getting rid of that wastage which is why i've started to develop um e-cell sub and it's only recently that we've actually added ai to our capability because it gives you a lot more flexibility and a lot more visibility a lot of people you know say to me why um you know why focus on calls surely the drive to transact online you know everybody transacts offline so surely caught was in a dying business but actually 65 percent of people prefer to uh contact a business by phone than form phil and i liken it a little bit to my my daughter you know when my daughter she's 14 years of age uh 14 going on 21 i should say and um when she's in a bedroom if she wants something urgently she'll literally call me and when i say the word call me as in she's only in the next room and she'll call me from her mobile phone if it's not urgent she'll text me and i think that is the the the way that contact is moving forward with people is i don't think you're going to see a sudden drop-off in calls i think you're always going to get them but the key to it is understanding why are people calling you because it could be a multitude of uh of reasons why so um this is a bit of audience interaction for you so i've got a question for you that i'd like to ask and hopefully by the power of technology of this fantastic webinar we'll be able to get you guys to vote well i'm really interested in it how much of your marketing reaches your intended audience so you can start voting now so does 100 of your marketing reach your audience 70 percent of your uh marketing reach your intended audience 55 25 or none so if you'd like to vote now then give me your view on um how much of your marketing reaches your intended audience um the reason i ask this question is is that um as i say my my philosophy or the way when i was a marketing manager marketing director i looked at things it was yes let's focus on the stuff that work but it's also making sure that you get rid of the stuff that doesn't work and particularly with things like adwords and big i found that actually optimizing campaign you know was as effective as adding keywords it was increasing bids so i'm just going to give you about uh another five ten seconds to put in your responses already it looks like we have a clear winner so that from the poll and the answers that we've just got it looks like 50 percent of people believe that they're only 25 percent of their marketing which is intended audience which that to me says that there's a lot of wastage and actually when i hear that straight off the bat i think about right how can i optimize my online marketing to make it more effective to reach my target audience so thanks very much for voting really appreciate it so the the this is an old quote and i roll this out in front of a lot of people half the money i spend on advertising is wasted the trouble is i don't know which half so john want to make a it's a quote that's about i think it's literally about 100 years old but it's it's actually very very relevant today because nielsen actually um uh have estimated that 45 of online ads don't reach their target audience so if you're trying to optimize your campaign obviously the more people relevant target audience that see your advert or your online marketing obviously the more effective that's going to be and i think the key thing about um about being able to to track calls is being able to identify and categorize calls so that you can identify those that actually want to buy from you any more powerful keywords you more powerful channels than those that don't and they're just simple service calls but from the poll you guys have answered today it kind of suggests to me that actually you think that um even less is effective which is interesting so um why do we focus on the phone i've already mentioned to you about user behavior i've given you an example of my daughter but i thought i'd just throw up some stats for you just to give you a bit more idea about why is so key so this is google's data they believe that seventy percent of mobile searches use click to call uh to contact the business um i think that's a little bit skewed if i'm telling you honest review by local search um because i think the local search a lot of people call directly off uh google my business or off the landing page itself but as you can see here you know mobile users is exploding it's now pretty much half uh half the traffic or half the searches on google so it's a massive segment of the market uh seven percent of people called because they want to speak to a real person and i think that's quite key because there are always you know particularly when there's variables in a transaction and i always remember one of the the first calls that we had for one of our conveyancing clients so someone who's wanting to buy a property in the uk uh and they want to um you know get a legal representative do all the paperwork for them or remember the first call the woman phoned up and she said oh hi i'd like to buy a house and i need to find a conveyancer great you're in the right place uh and she said but i've got a problem and said oh what's that well the person i'm buying the house from they're in prison well that's not a problem we can send on the paperwork what you know no problem at all and the second question she had was well the problem is that person is actually my ex-husband and she thought that she had a problem and actually it's a dead easy transaction they converted straight away in the call but that variable in a track transaction that difference if you like you can't necessarily get that across in an online booking or a form fill you feel you've got to phone somebody so we find that call tracking really does work you know very well when there's when there's particular variables or people have got questions about the product or service and then the final step which is very interesting is that sales conversion from telephone calls is actually a lot lot higher so as you can see here google estimate that conversions from uh from callers compared to online is 18 so obviously that's a significant increase in self-conversion over online sales conversion we tend to find that our clients once we've been working with them a while to optimize their campaign actually convert our calls or because we generate anywhere between 33 and uh 50 which you know in today's uh online marketing you know those are kind of stats that you don't you know find difficult to believe but often you know these people are phoning you their how's your news that they want your product or service and they're phoning you so actually as long as you know you can actually fulfill their requirements they're actually quite an easy sell to to generate so cool you know lots of volume lots of people want to talk you know to people and they're high converting as well so if you think about it it's a good tick in some of the key boxes that you look for now the key thing is and i learned this very very quickly when we started to do call analysis at halfords is not all calls a sales leads and the the the problem i had with with previous um call tracking solutions is that they just did that is they track the volume of calls that they generated and the problem i found very very quickly that is if you don't categorize the calls that you're getting you could actually optimize your campaign to drive more non-sales calls than sales calls and um you know the process that the ar process that we used today was actually something that i developed you know six years ago and i used to do manually but you know not every single call is is a sales lead on average we find that 58 of the calls our customers uh receive are our actual sales calls 29 are calls from customer service from existing clients eight percent of calls are people looking for a job or trying to sell you something and actually there is a degree of mysticals as well about five percent uh some of our clients unfortunately you know have days where they miss up to 20 but if you're optimizing your online campaign particularly google ads or bing and you're optimizing it on call volume you could literally be optimizing for the wrong type of behavior to happen so categorizing those calls and categorizing the outcomes is absolutely key to getting your online strategy right so what does core categorization enable you to do well on the left there as you can see we've got lots of uh squares circles and triangles if you're using call tracking and you're not categorizing those calls you'll just see 20 sorry 12 sales calls so it doesn't necessarily mean that they're all sales calls but you will see uh 12 sales schools whereas if you categorize your uh the calls that you're getting so as you can see here four sales calls four customer service calls and four missed calls or straight away if i can link the keyword that's driven those sales calls i can increase my bidding i can go and find all keywords of that variant likewise if i don't want customer service calls and i don't want them clicking on my ads because it's costing me marketing money to generate a customer service call which i don't want to it's very very easy to spot the keywords and the channels that are driving that behavior sometimes you might find it as as non-brand versus brand keywords for a certain brand keywords that might drive customer service calls and again with that visibility you can make really really good decisions on okay what i'm not going to do is i'm not going to generate customer service calls i'm not going to generate them so they cost me as much money and actually optimize my campaign that way but again unless you're categorizing uh the call it's very very difficult to optimize your campaign other than volume and what you could end up doing is actually increasing those customer service calls and spending more marketing money without actually increasing sales we get a lot of our clients where particularly where they've got multiple sites or multiple locations or multiple branches you know if they're tracking calls on on uh volume the challenge is is is that well i can see more calls are going into the business you know and and i can't connect those calls to sales and i can't see that the sales are going up so is my marketing work working you know am i driving a load of wasted activities we've just described or is it actually having a benefit um and i'm actually improving you know the revenue and the return on investment and that's why core categorization is is so key because without knowing you know what the outcome of each call is you're just going to drive more calls and those calls might not actually have any revenue associated with them and therefore you could be wasting 50 to 75 percent of your marketing budget online so it really is key and it was one of the reasons why we developed um e-salesforce because i was very frustrated that i was sat there i was trying to optimize my online marketing and i was doing it based on core volume and i had exactly that problem i was driving more calls into our garages at halfords but i wasn't seeing the revenue increase on the other side and it started to get frustrating which is why i came up with the idea for e-cell sub and it literally was myself and my business manager um we were sat on the sofa in my house doing some content management work and we literally came up with the idea of you know of course categorization then because trying to find out those keywords that not only drive a sale but actually a high value sale so that we could enhance or optimize based on even average invoice value let alone the outcome of the call being either a sale or customer service then we knew that that would make a big difference to our revenue and you know i'd like to say we did it because we wanted to we purely looked at this because we wanted to hit our bonus criteria so that's why you know we believe that call categorization is so important now what you could do is you could leave your your call categorization up to your you know your sales guys but let's be honest your sales guys are there for one reason they're there to sell um you know and even if they're customer service agents you know they're there to fulfill the the need of the customer their primary goal is not to make uh you know not to track your marketing so that you look good um and i always remember this when i was at sporter health clubs we had a very sophisticating sophisticated offline tracking uh theory and what we got the sales managers to do was every week they'd fill out a sheet to write how many leads to be generated and where have they come from as they come to the leaflet have they come from offline and um we launched a new website and i was the commercial director science responsible for sales and uh and marketing for a sporter and uh you know suddenly we launched a new website and all right you know we've got a spike in in leads that we've generated this is really really good i can see core volumes are going up i can see the sales managers are telling me um that we're getting more membership inquiries this is you know things are going really really well then about four months down the line i had a conversation you know just a general chat with our sales team uh but we were doing these regional road shows and i picked on this one specific club in uh wimbledon and i said god it's it's amazing you know how you know you you're getting a lot more membership sales from online you've ever had before and the sales manager started to smile at me and i'm thinking okay what have i said and um he basically admitted there and then that actually the the manual tracking that he was doing wasn't accurate and he just filled out the online section with more leads because he thought he thought that's what i wanted to see was that the website was working and because i was his boss it was artificially changing the manual tracking not not in a sinister way but he thought he was doing the right thing by making a website look good and that's the problem if if you leave your call categorization to your sales team it won't be accurate you know it could be really really busy on the phone um taking sales trying to close people and to make sure that 100 of the call categorization is correct in my experience it never happens you'd be lucky if 50 of the days they give you is correct because if you're really really busy you know if you've got a drop down box and you're really really busy it's very very easy to click the first option rather than to actually click the one that makes the most sense so or is actually accurate is relevant so when i've used um you know core categorization models based off if you like you know somebody manually doing it i've always found that they've led me down a completely different path and what's actually happened and again it was a frustration i had with you know i can see i'm i'm i'm generating calls i can see i'm i'm generating sales but i just can't get that that you know the gap bridged between the call and the sales so that i can optimize my my campaign so why do we use ai ai has come on dramatically over the last few years and there's many different elements to it um you know there's machine learning where you know the ao actually learns over time itself which is a pretty scary thing um but the reason why we use ai to determine the outcome or the category of the call is mainly for speed you know you could do this by recording every single call and listening to that call and categorizing it yourself but i used to do that manually six years ago just to do one day's data for one client used to take me a week using ai we can do exactly the same thing and it takes two seconds so yes they there are over um uh 700 calls that went through our system yesterday for and we've got over i think it's 240 clients in the uk and um to categorize all of those calls for that volume probably would have taken me about six weeks um yesterday was all done in two seconds so we could establish by using artificial intelligence by reading the call and putting the core recording through ai we could understand the words that have been used on the call to define the outcome of calls so was it a sale was it an appointment was it a quote that didn't go to an appointment or a sale was it you know a prospect somebody that has phoned up that they haven't converted and very very quickly using ai you can get an up to the minute picture of um exactly what's happening within your business and the insight that you get of what is actually going on on the phone why are people calling me you know who are my best sales people are we doing the right things we've got the clients at the moment who um because of covid they're getting a lot of calls into their branches but they're um they they can't take cash orders they've got to refer them to their online website and so they're using our tools for actually understanding well actually are the branches do what we're telling them to do and it's fascinating um understanding which branches are actually you know complying with with operational procedure which ones aren't what their sales conversion is and this is data that we've generated within 24 hours it's given an amazing picture about what's actually happening in the business and as marketing managers as marketing directors my frustration always was i'm always one step away from the customer because i'm not physically doing the selling either my website's doing the selling or the selling is being done in person by someone on the phone or someone in a branch and the beauty of using ai means that at scale you can analyze a lot of data very very quickly get a really good view even down to granite level of knowing you know why are people calling you based on their location based on you know what page they've called from based on a number of different factors and even moving on from ai um because we're tracking the users um telephone number the telephone number they're dialed in on you can even go to the next level you can demographically analyze that so what we're now able to do is once you've categorized uh the calls we can then take that data and and you can even do modeling based on demographic profiling so who are the customers i'm converting versus who are the customers that i'm not converting and which demographic groups am i almost repelling so again going back to that wasted message of how much my marketing is wasted by understanding what you're driving on the phone which is you know a big bit of what you're probably generating anyway you're just not attributing it back to your marketing you know you can get those answers in a very granular clear level at speed at scale so you can make decisions um you know pretty much on an hourly basis um the way our ai ai works is that it updates um the client every hour at the end of july we're moving that to being real time so as the call is finished it will immediately go through uh ai to establish what's actually happened on the call so it can give more responsive reporting to our client base so if you think about you know from years ago when it used to take me you know a week to six weeks to do data analysis and now i can see calls as they come in and get them analyzed within seconds it's a real game-changer because the insight it gives you the ability to optimize your online campaign to to not only focus on those keywords and those channels that generate themselves but more importantly those people that you know you aren't converting all those keywords that aren't even driving a sales call but driving customer service call it can make a a massive difference so um as i've said that the difference really is is it really bridging that gap between what you know the the customer calling in and and your sales reporting well actually what happened and by being able to attribute all the sales you drive over the phone so you're probably all attributing your online sales no problem at all because they're dead easy to track but being able to attribute those sales and you know push that data into your crm system into google analytics you know into third-party systems so that you can see that the keyword the source the time of day it re-enables you to optimize to such a greater level that you've probably been able to before and it gives you the chance to as i say grow sales so it might be that you're spending a chunk of your budget just simply on the wrong keywords you know and just by pausing your ppc on a couple of keywords that are driving customer service calls you'll probably get those anyway because they'll go to natural search but what we tend to find is is that um if if the customer's made an order with you and then they're fed you back because they've got a customer service issue they'll press the first telephone number or the first thing that they see which is generally adwords whereas if you take the the ad off and actually they go straight to natural search and find you that way you won't have a customer service issue but what you'll do is you'll utilize your budget more and again get rid of a lot of that wastage where yes you're driving calls and if you're measuring volume you're probably thinking great i'm doing a great job generating 10 calls but actually if any four of those are sales then you're not utilizing your budget but what this also does is it measures your conversion accurately we find with a lot of clients that because they're measuring on volume they're artificially lowering their um their conversion figures so it's making their marketing not look as as strong as it possibly is so if you're generating 10 calls five of those are sales and you um you know convert two of them you're talking about a 40 sales conversion yet two out of ten would be a 20 sales conversion so already you're underplaying your value as a marketing manager as a marketing director as a marketing specialist as to how effective um your your marketing is and what a good job you are doing and and it really is about integrating the data so you get a full view of what the customer service or what the customer journey is so it really is about ensuring that you've got more data to make a more informed decision so that you can optimize your marketing and and get a get a much better result so as we see it the future of call tracking is using artificial intelligence to analyze the calls because there's you know there's no hard job in the world it's pretty light mind-numbing listening to hundreds of calls and the time that you'll waste when you could be spending that time optimizing so it really is about discovering you know why your customers calling you you know a lot of our our uh clients you know that's the number one objective you know what i'm getting tinkles day or getting a hundred calls a day why are people calling me we don't know we just know their calls but we don't know what the different categories are and and then it's it's using that data to optimize um what you do and and to really get the maximum for your marketing budget we tend to find that you know that's about a 45 wastage we tend to find that within the first six months a lot of our clients make big data discoveries um so that they could optimize their campaign and not necessarily spend less but just generate more from what they've already got or potentially use the data to go to the board to go and get more marketing money a more marketing budget based off the value that you're now driving compared to what you're driving previously and it's that attribution it's making sure that you know you're attributing all of your the sales that you're generating and you're getting the reward for that because as we've seen you know there's a high percentage of people that want to call as part of the transaction and don't just want to transact online so how does it work so this is the point where my uh my heart rate rises because we're going to do a bit of a live demo for you so yeah i've left the slide in the deck um so you can see the different steps um that uh that it takes to to actually analyze calls um but what we're going to do is we're going to we're going to show you what kind of semiline we're going to give you a bit of an idea um about actually how does the the call work so what we're going to do today is is we're going to go to sunny milton keynes so i worked in milton keynes for uh 12 months when i was at virgin and uh in the uk it's it's a great i guess you can't call it city but you can call it a town so essentially what we're going to do is we're going to open up a web browser i'm going to type in the key to unblock drains milton kings so obviously i'm doing a local search and we're going to skip past the ads because i don't want to cost us any money and skip across your gmb but i'm going to click on the first which is dynarod so dino rod is a client of ours and you see that telephone number at the top every time that telephone number is called it goes into our analytics platform now obviously what i've done is i've hidden certain bits of data because obviously they've i've got permission from our client to show you this but obviously not with their data inside so what we're tracking is the date the time uh we're tracking the caller's telephone number which we've we've uh we've hidden from you uh the connection times how long it takes to connect the call uh the talk time there's then a call recording so essentially if you like all of this data here is what we would call switch data so from a call tracking solution that's probably what you'd get to see now what happens is is as you can see here the list of keywords and we can actually show the source as well but where the ai kicks in is here so um essentially what we've done is we've categorized these calls now you can see that the first call is an appointment the second call is a live quote so that means that they've actually quoted on the phone but they've not actually closed that as a sale on that specific call and then you can see there are a couple of calls that marked in red because they're duplicates so what's actually happening is when you dial a telephone number off the milton keynes page for dyno it essentially is we're tracking the click so we've got a google tag manager script um so when you land on the page we can see where you've come from we can see your uh google analytics cid and then what we're doing is we're categorizing the call using ai and then what we're doing is we've got the ability to then once we've categorized that call is attach more data so you can see we can put in a lost reason you can see here um other columns on the tracking for tracking view you've got here is that we can take a scrape of of the crm system so that although we've identified it as an appointment a transaction hasn't necessarily happened at that stage but we can pull the data in from a crm system or an ordering system or an epoch system so that we can actually give a true line of sight to actually what's gone on and the big thing about this was and this is what the game change was for our clients so um again i've hidden the actual keywords so that um you can't actually see their data but what was interesting is the top graph here is volume uh and it's core volume and as you can see on the far left hand sorry far right hand side you've got two really really big bars okay what was really interesting was that those two keywords that were driving probably about 30 of their overall core volume didn't actually drive a single appointment or sale within 30 days but actually what it was was that their their third uh highest volume keyword was where all the sales were coming from and so straight away what they spotted was that yes we were brilliant at driving loads of cool volume but actually 30 of the core volume isn't a sales lead and but they were spending half their marketing budget on these keywords and so what they're able to do very very quickly based on the data inside that they got from us was they could see very very quickly how to optimize their spend so that they drove more from the keywords that drove sales leads rather than spending money on customer service calls which they were getting no reward for so straight away just by simply categorizing the calls they've got the visibility to optimize their keywords drive more sales it wasn't the case if they increased you know their budget um it wasn't a case of you know they spent more money on google they had the same budget it was just about making that budget target more of the customer base that they want to target more of their audience that would drive physical sales on the phone rather than driving core volume that ended up being customer service so um yeah straight away from this data you can see the impact that actually you know ai powered call tracking can have on your markets better and this is just one example um you know we we tend to find um the uh you know we do a 14-day trial for clients and um a lot of a lot of questions we get you know always 14 days long enough and what what clients are quite surprised about is within the first 24 hours within the first three hours the amount of data and the amount of insight that they will pick up that just didn't realize what was happening because they'd never had the visibility of of you know why people are calling them and the stats behind it it's a real game changer for their for their marketing budget and but also you know that your conversion is way way better than you think it is and the key words that are driving those cells they're always different than what you expect they are and and i'm giving examples here of dyno which is a british gas uh brand in the uk that we work with you know the difference between uh generic versus location-based search terms is huge in terms of sales conversion difference between brand term which you know the brand term on the facebook look like their cheapest source of lead but actually it's the most expensive because most of the calls that generated you know were actually cert you know customer service calls they weren't actually sales leads so it completely spun on its head what they needed to do with their google spend so a little bit about us before i take questions there's a couple of questions that have been asked by the ux which i'll get to um but essentially um the way we work as a business are essentially two services for smaller companies we offer a free marriage service where we take the risk of google and facebook and you only pay us per lead and again you only pay per lead not per call so it has to be you know somebody that requesting your service or product for you to be charged but you get full campaign visibility um exactly what i've just shown you whereas for other companies where you've got your own you know your own ppc resource um you know your own um resource internally or through an agency uh we have a lot of clients actually just use our platform to give us uh to give them the insight that we can gain from their uh from their marketing what their existing marketing they're doing already and so for us you know we're very much about generating that data insight we realize that you know there are some smaller companies that actually this is all great but i just want sales leads how to generate them for the for us which is our managed service versus those that you know have got the internal resource and actually we just want the insights that we can make changes ourselves to our online campaign so we we actually um offer uh both uh as an option for you so that's the end of the uh the presentation i think we've literally got uh five minutes to go through a couple of questions so um we've got uh a question here very interesting question actually so i'm going to read it out will ai be so i'm just going to paraphrase what it says but it says does the ai pic keyword related to sales if there is a wide language width um does it pick up multilingual calls coming to one number and then categories so we have clients based in the uk germany and austria and what's interesting is is that the ao that we use actually learns over time even different accents so when we first started using it if you're using a deep yorkshire accent halifax actually used to come up as holy fuck which is a new interpretation of of halifax and what our ai does it learns regional dialects so in germany there is a massive north-south divide in terms of not the language but the accents that are used uh but yeah we the multi-language capability the reason why we pick germany as our second language is one of the most difficult languages in the world um in europe um it's it's quite strange our election is very direct um as it were and also the behavior of germans and austrians on the phone is very very different from from anywhere else in europe you know they they don't phone on the weekend whereas here in the uk we do and um we um uh you know that they but as soon as the doors open at eight o'clock on a monday they're phoning like you wouldn't believe and and germans you know they insure their insurance they're very very risk-averse so what we find in germany and austria particularly is that core volumes and the percentage of calls versus online transactions is much much greater because they want that assurance of the service or product that they're buying so hopefully that answers that question i've got another question here uh if the sales rep has an issue with the customer will these genuine cells be overridden and genuine calls be forwarded to next in line um yes so um the the way our ai platform works is uh what we're able to do is to look at customer history so whether person has phoned before and actually build up a little bit of a profile about that customer so often what we find is um we've got a client and some clients take two and a half calls per transaction some clients take one some clients take five so if you're a mortgage broker you know it will take up to five calls to actually convert that customer so you'll see that customer coming in as a sales lead you'll then see you know the five calls that associated with that client and then you'll see the end conversion so um you know our ai call tracking capability does take into account the different customer journeys a lot of it is in the setup when we work with a client it's about understanding their business understanding their order value their customer journey and a lot of our reporting is actually bespoke because again um per industry i tend to find that the terminology used is slightly different and you know what we might regard as appointments or might might call as a test drive so particularly with the automotive industry we work with mg cars and you know it's not about driving appointments for them it's about driving test drives because they know that you know for every person that that test drives a car they'll pretty much convert one in two um so for them they're key kpi and we tend to find most clients it's it's just really understanding you know what's the key kpi that you measure and for mg is test drives and so all of our reporting is right how many test drives that we generated and how many of those have actually turned into uh into car sales another question has just come in what crm platform would you integrate with um so um into the crm platforms so salesforce act microsoft if if your crm system has an api or even a csv upload capability uh we work with homemade systems as well um we can integrate into it um but you know the main ones off the shelf are the top brands people are oracle and salesforce uh uh you know microsoft um those types of crm systems but like i said we've got a client and they've built their own crm system uh and we've built uh an api integration so um again it really depends on on what you've got as to how we can work with you we find that actually uh you know pushing data in and out of crm just gives that little bit more of an edge so that okay fine we've tracked what's happened on the call but did it turn into a you know into a real transaction with crm data we can absolutely categorically confirm that so you know some of our clients we integrate some we don't um purely because they don't have that capability or they're upgrading their crm system um so um another question i've got is can i trace the end to end call um it's interesting question you should ask because um one of the questions we were asked previously is you know how do you track users how can you do that um essentially what we're doing is we're using google tag manager and we're tracking the google m6 cid and we're tracking that all the way through so what we're able to see is the complete customer journey so how they got to you which pages they went through and then when did they call you and it's interesting because for some of our clients you know where they've got a lot of locations and someone lands on the homepage and then how do they end up calling the number is it that they go through the site search to find a branch they want to call or they go onto a specific page likewise with some of our e-commerce-based clients you know which pages are is a customer calling me from is it you know part two three four of the shopping cart experience you know why am i getting these calls why is someone calling me at shopping cart stage two as opposed to three what's the difference in those calls and what language they're using um one of the things that we do is we analyze the words that are used on calls so you know what questions what words are they using what's coming up more and more so that you can amend your um you know your copy and your content on your your site so that you can answer those questions and you can drive higher conversion a lot of that can come from from tracking so it really is end-to-end some clients you know we use a last click model um other clients we use the first click model other clients use you know different attribution models again the flexibility of our system is you can choose um you know it's all about giving you the data inside that you want so that you can better optimize your campaign so that you can make more out of the budget you've got and you can properly attribute all the sales that you're getting so you get that reward you know and we have found with quite a few clients that whenever they've gone through this there's a hell of a lot more sales that get on the phone line that um than they thought and actually the impact that their site is having on the business in total is far greater uh than what they thought it was um so i think that's pretty much all the questions and and lewis i think that's out of time isn't it yeah pretty much pretty much bright talk will probably be kicking us out very soon so um yeah thanks a lot mark that was fascinating um really really interesting i think the audience probably agrees looking at all the questions that have come coming um so yeah thanks a lot for your time today mark thank you very much lewis appreciate it yes um okay so that's the third show of the day wrapped up the fourth one is coming in sick and fast in 15 minutes so it'd be great if you join us for that um thank you all for joining for this webinar i'll catch up with you all very soon cheers
