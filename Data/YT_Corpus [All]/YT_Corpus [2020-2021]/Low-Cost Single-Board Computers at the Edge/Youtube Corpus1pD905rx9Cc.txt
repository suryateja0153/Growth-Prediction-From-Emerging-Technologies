 okay well I just like to say welcome to everybody and those that are watching the live stream we're having our monthly work session tonight via livestream versus Google meet and so this time we'll just turn it over to dr. Nolte in continue on with the agenda Thank You mr. Francis members of the board and those who are listening on the public side we have a number of work session items to discuss tonight that should bring the board and those listening up to speed as well as give the board an opportunity to give us some feedback in direction when some items our first item is an update from mr. Heinz on state emergency sick leave chairman members of the board as you know back in early April the State Board of Education approved state emergency sick leave for employees basically for three reasons one would be underlying health conditions which they would work from home or take advantage of the state emergency sick leave work remotely or do the the sick leave and child care was the second reason and the third reason would be elder care taking care of grandparents parents that sort of thing so they made that retroactive back to March 16th when schools were closed and we did that through April and then the State Board of Education came back again last week and extended that through May 30th so the same three reasons would apply and the same type of leave applies to the same folks who are currently utilizing that leave so doctor Nolte wanted me to talk to you a little bit of how many people we have doing each as you know our teachers are working remotely all of our administrators are still coming into the buildings and supervising and overseeing what's happening in the actual buildings and also the online instruction that sort of thing most of our clerical are still coming in the buildings and working with the public and with our employees so currently we have thirty-seven classified employees working remotely and that could be either a teacher assistant or a clerical we have a couple of them our custodians they're not working from home but they are taking advantage of the sick leave so 37 classified working remotely and we have 28 classified employees who are taking advantage of the state emergency sick leave that generally requires a doctor's note unless you are 65 or older which automatically qualifies you for that leave if you choose to take advantage of it so I was telling dr. Nolte earlier today we have between five and six hundred classified employees depending on what time of year you count them whether you count part-time full-time temporary you know there's lots ways to look at that but right now out of close to 600 employees we have 65 who are either working remotely or are on the state emergency sick leave so the overwhelming majority are still coming into the buildings and that sort of thing the folks that are on working remotely or on state emergency sick leave have very valid reasons for that have been those have been checked and and we appreciate them helping us every way they can great you know kudos to all of our employees for what a great job they've done through the whole thing and everyone keeps saying that and rightfully so what a fantastic job so so that's sort of the update if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer those for you mr. Heinz this is Jim Francis I do have a question how is this affecting their pay is is there a different pay scale for that leave or are they still drawing you know same pay or how does that work good question mr. Francis the the state emergency sick leave is at full pay at the number of hours that they were working when we shut down so if there are 40 our employee if they're a teacher assistant it's 37 and a half hours which is their normal hours if they were a temporary employee they can also take advantage of that and what you do is you take the average of hours that they work the weeks they were working and they get paid that average but the state of emergency sick leave is full pay at full hours now that's been confused a little bit with some folks with the federal leave that was given by the federal government which pays two-thirds salary for child care or elder care and it pays full salary after ten days of using their own leave if 12 weeks for actual Covid 19 illness but we have not had to utilize the federal leave yet the state has extended a large amount of the state emergency sick leave which has covered all of our employees so far so so they've all been paid in full pay for full hours up to this point okay one more question I know we gave we had some extra money from the state and we you know did increase some of the the pay for those people the people that are at home are they getting that increase as well for just the people coming in and working it's it's just the people coming into the buildings and working you know in the child nutrition custodial and bus drivers like the ones at home do not receive that extra pay okay thank you sir yes sir and clerical and clerical yeah clerical it's in the building other questions for mr. Heinz okay thank you mr. Heinz he has done a good job answering questions are there other questions for him before we move down the agenda he's been a rather busy fellow helping people understand the difference differences in all of the new regulations coming through okay well we can always come back it's a work session so we can go back and forth I have a couple updates on a couple items and then dr. Putnam and mrs. Barker have some also before we want to go into closed session I've had one thing that might come to your attention just a couple less than a hand full I'd say more than more than two but just a handful of requests from parents from students who have always done very well academically and they are requesting a retention I have listened to many of the state webinar regarding the pandemic I've also had a couple statewide meetings with state superintendents I had one of those early this morning started at 7:30 and then I've met with regional superintendents we meet weekly and the initial just if this comes to your attention the initial promotion retention meeting is always made by the principal that's public school law I happen to have memorized that law when I was a principal 115 C 288 a but they would make that decision promotion or retention can be appealed to the superintendent and if I receive any of those we certainly give that a lot of due diligence in consideration we'll look at academic performance history but I would probably not be likely I'm talking very general terms because you'd want to look at each one of them individually but not likely to overturn a promotion decision for a student who has done well academically for many many years that's not in line with our directions from the governor from the State Board of Education from the Department of Public Instruction and typically students who have done well throughout their career they have missed instruction as has everyone else but they would also be very likely to to catch up and maybe catch up even quicker than others have missed some of that direct face-to-face instruction so just in case that comes across your radar that is out there not many of those requests but a couple are there any any questions about that okay great well we have had several calendar issues come up and I have talked on the telephone when I have made decisions around those things that you all need to know about and the state just recently passed state General Assembly and the governor signed some new calendar legislation and so I want to spend a little bit of time talking about the end of this year's calendar and Kim Guffey is going to pull up for us hopefully if you're on video you should see the Haywood County Schools end of year calendar for the current year there it is can you can you make that larger there you go very good that's probably good right there scroll up just a little bit miss Kim so I can see can see the bottom of that so we were directed under new state law just recently passed in May that we would get a waiver on this year's instructional hours if we went to the end of the student calendar as approved by the board and submitted to the state originally and so when we did that well I think we approved it last December or January December Jenny says she's sitting here our last student day before we had snow or anything else was May the 29th and that's I think what I had mentioned to people who had asked me about that so we would like to put on Monday's agenda for you all to consider for approval remote learning for all of the schools except the early college we'll talk about them in just a moment to end on the 29th the the days they're coded in purple June 1st through 8th would be those are work days those are required for 10 11 and 12 month employees and we would use those as days to do all of our end-of-year activities that we're required to do unfortunately this year we're having to do that through social distancing and in small groups so those days when we would collect materials collect Chromebooks we might actually start some of this before the first we would do grading and even in elementary school where we're not giving a grade the state has directed us to provide feedback to parents about student learning and other things that they have noticed throughout the year the high school teachers in particular are going to be looking at grades and mrs. Barker covered this in a previous meeting about grades on march 13th or grades that were improved you do all the things around getting students reunited with personal items that they may have left at school will need classrooms prepared for the summer like they're always prepared so we would need people to come in a few at a time who are capable of coming in to clean out rooms and take down bulletin boards and there just a number of things that need to be done those purple days would look a little different at each school because of school size and because of the grade levels but what we would ask the principal's to do if you approve this on Monday would be to communicate with their staff and designate sometimes on certain days where there were just mandatory things that had to be done those things I mentioned then some other things and then the other times would be optional based upon how much teachers and other employees had got done and if if they wanted to work they certainly could or they could take accumulated leave but there would certainly be some mandatory times are there questions about that calendar which applies to really to all of our schools except the early college dr. Bill Chuck Francis just so basically whatever calendar we had in place is going to be still in place yes sir the the employee calendar has not changed and okay I have written a press a draft press release okay hopeful that you all will be amenable to these suggestions and vote on those on Monday that's certainly something you all can consider between now and then but yes the the calendar itself for employees is unaltered for students we with our snow were scheduled to finish on the 4th and we would actually finish the 29th and we feel like we need that time for all the things I mentioned earlier that the staff needs to do while social distancing plus some other things okay thank you for answering that okay any other questions or comments forward on this proposed request this is actually just a request to change the last day for students in all of our schools except the early college okay great again we can come back to any of these Kim would you mind to pull up the this year's early college calendar make it just a little bit larger for us okay board members you can see that or if you can't see that it's fairly easy to describe it's the very same thing the employee calendar has not changed for 10 or 11 or 12 month employees they're all expected to work there days or use accumulated leave you'll notice that the early college started earlier or you'll remember that they started a week or so earlier we do our best to match our calendar as closely as the law allows to the College calendar because we literally have hundreds of students taking courses at the college not just the early college but so the early college itself starts a week earlier their high school classes end a week earlier in the college ends typically early in May and so in Jenny and I talking to miss Fox at the early college we would like to propose to you on Monday that their last remote learning day be Friday the 22nd that's very consistent than what we've done with the other schools given the stars in evening dates and then the days of the 26 Tuesday the 26th through the 29th would be those days where they worked on grades got Chromebooks back in materials back in prepared rooms for the summer provided feedback for students all the things that like other schools that they would typically typically be doing on those days are there any questions or comments from the board about that proposed request that we would bring forth on Monday okay great all right and as always you guys can call or contact us between now and then I'll certainly be in the office all day tomorrow I don't always sit by the landline phone but you can get me and as well as Monday would be in so miss Jackson if you would pull up the calendar for all of the schools except the early college that we amended literally yesterday and reviewed again this morning after a state meeting that included Catherine Joyce who is a state well known attorney in the state so in the state's most recent legislative action around calendars they did two things because we have always spent a lot of time working on making sure our students don't lose a lot of instructional time and because we have done a very good job with the remote learning we don't think that the the state legislative changes that were made last week or earlier this week actually will actually impact our calendar a lot they did two things that they're now requiring in future calendars the first thing that they said was that they wanted us to place five remote learning days in the calendar this is a legislative requirement and they wanted to those to occur on a teacher workday and they wanted those to be within our thousand 25 hours and then I think in an effort to get school systems to have a good long school year like we do they also said we want to make sure you have five instructional days beyond your thousand twenty-five hours and so when we looked at the calendar that was created by the calendar committee and approved by you all last December all that we really had to do sorry that's a safety device on my computer that likes to beep they're all that we really had to do was go into four of the workdays that we already had scheduled and make those remote learning days so we went into October the 19th and made it a remote learning day that is near the end of the first grading period we felt like that would be a great time for teachers early in the year and hopefully we'll have a normal year to say to their students okay we've got this remote learning day with a remote learning day here's some things you can do if you're behind or here's some things you can do that I know will be assessed later these learning these remote learning days are very different than the intense remote learning that we have done over the last couple months these are supplemental teachers would still be able to take optional leave on those days and the students and teachers could look at what they did when when they all returned back to school and we plan to design these remote learning days in such a way that it wouldn't be too disruptive to parents if they decided to take a long weekend or something like that so we put we change the workday on the 19th of October to a remote learning day we change the National Election Day to a remote learning day that's a day where they don't really like us to have school anyway we felt like that one could be around the Constitution or elections and things like that and then with over three days in in February and March and right before spring break with the idea that we have snow during some of that period and we would move those to a snow day so I know that's a lot of new information it took us a while to sort through it and then our our we will probably designate the last five days there in May as the five days beyond the thousand twenty five hours and we have plenty of cushion there because we've not shortened our instructional time like some other districts have that's a lot of information and would try to answer some questions for you and Jenny is here also I like the way it's laid out dr. bill well I appreciate that mr. Francis I'll give you a little bit of logic there we and this is our theory and I hope I don't get in trouble with anyone who knows people in other school systems but I think our think our state legislature is trying to send a message to people who cut some corners there were certainly some school districts who did not do remote learning very well at all and the legislature and the state school board have asked us to create a remote learning plan which we're all over that we've just got to write it down we started in a hurry and did remote learning and food distribution really really well so I think that requirement to put those days in there was not really for us probably not even for the majority of school districts so we felt like that was a pretty easy shift for us and we we promise to be kind and gracious to both students and teachers as we implement this new state policy and then I think the five days after your required minimum number of hours was to make sure that school systems didn't have the shortest possible year and there were a few that have done that well certainly we have not we have always been you know significantly passed our thousand 25 hours so I appreciate that as a school system that has a waiver we might use Jenny was poking me or trying to put me in the arm here I think she got more than six feet away you know closer than six feet away but as a school system with a waiver because of snow if we needed to we could add up to five more remote days for snow make up no more than that so everyone in the state will be required to have the five that you see and be will be required to put them in their original calendar and then if you have a snow waiver you may use up to five more and certainly we won't do that unless we have to because we understand that direct instruction in a classroom with the qualified teacher is better than remote learning in almost every instance I got a question for dr. bill yes sir the the snow remote learning days so are we our teachers sending home a snow packet in advance when we have advance notice of the potential how you gonna work that well what we hope to do is the days that you see for example my phone is trying to answer your question it picked up on your voice let me turn my phone down here what we plan to do you see the one there let's just use this as an example you see the one there in February if we were to miss on earlier in February or in January we hopefully we will see that storm coming we do a really good job of watching the weather and we would say to our teachers we're anticipating that we might miss for snow sometime during the first week in February please be ready to send something home I had discussions with other superintendents this morning in the state that remote learning does not always equate to a computer and the type of remote learning that we would want to do would be supplemental so we would we would try to send something home that we know the student would be assessed on something related to reading or grammar for younger children fifth grade may be something around fractions high school courses and middle school classes have specific things so we would ask teachers to provide a little bit of remote learning and I mean a little bit it's not designed to replicate a six hour day it is supplemental in nature and that could really take any reasonable form and it would certainly be different from kindergarten to third grade and from you know fourth grade to sixth grade and from high school course to high school course the ones that you see there may or may not be used for weather any beyond those would have to be used for weather okay good question that question has been asked many times in the last three or four days all across the state other questions or comments board members okay Kim if you'll pull up the early college early colleges as far as we can tell and asking questions to the state need to do the same thing they need to make sure that they have five remote learning days in their calendar and they need to make sure that they have some instructional time after their basic year in the calendar their hours of requirements are a little bit different than ours so they work really hard to mirror the College calendar they do not want their high school students who are in college to miss college classes and so you'll see there the first two remote learning days are on the 19th and 20th of October that is the scheduled College fall break and so that seems like a perfect time we had workdays there already that seems like a perfect time to do a little bit of remote learning in particular for students who may be struggling or need a little extra work and then they have one on January the 4th which is a semester transition for them and that transition is not as cumbersome as it is for Tuscola and Pisgah who have to build rebuild semester schedules for nearly a thousand students they also have the one right before Good Friday right before the scheduled spring break and then they have one on March the 16th that could be moved based upon weather that impacts the school system or the college that's a very similar idea it looks a little bit because their schedules a little different any questions or comments on on that proposal that we would like to bring forth on Monday does anyone have any questions all right thank you board members at this time I'm going to ask a dr. Putnam to give a couple different updates the first one as you know the commissioners have voted to provide the deed for the annex two building and some funds to renovate that building and that's you know knowledge that we have shared with you and the community knows about now and we will put on our Monday board agenda an opportunity for you all to talk about that in a bigger meeting and decide whether or not you want to accept that offer which we think is you know certainly not what we asked for but very very fair and reasonable and certainly more than the commissioners have been able to provide for us before so it we've been pretty pleased with that so dr. Putnam is going to give you an update on some of those details and then he will transition into the agreement bid process he'll cover a couple of things dr. Putnam thank you dr. nolte board members mr. chair wanted to talk to you a little bit about the possibility the possibilities that exist with annex two becoming in the central office we have begun demolition top floor and that is moving along rather rapidly we've also did exploratory work in in the way of inspection and things that we will need to do we've talked to several contractors and have also talked with some architects and engineers as well as the licensing office our permitting office for the town of waynesville which is the township for which that that building falls and we are being advised to create an RFQ to secure a designer and then once we have secured a designer architect then what we would do is put out for bid with contractors obviously the project will exceed exceed 500 thousdand and general statute 83 a 13 would require the use of a designer or architect as well as that's what we're being about the permitting office and consult from contractors and architects locally so that's kind of where we are we we as I say have began begun demolition on the top floor it's a two-story building 7,000 square feet on the top 7,000 square feet on the bottom roughly and we're moving through the top floor pretty good it had we have had some inspections which we will we'll talk or discuss later and we've already prepared an RFQ to be put out so that qualified architects engineers can put in a proposal to us if you will for design work any question on annex 2 are we gonna be able to complete that work with the money that we're getting from the county you think or we're still looking at that or we're gonna have to come up with more to go with it that's a great question I will tell you in a best-case scenario it is going to be really really tight and as is the case with any old structure you can reasonably anticipate some things and there will always be surprises just about every time if you if you've dealt with old buildings at all and so the best I could advise you at this point is it's gonna be really tight any other questions for dr. Putnam all right okay you want me to turf at this time that would be great no I was like hey if you don't mind I do have them I do have sort of a follow-up question okay [inaudible] [inaudible] dr. Rogers you broke up just a little bit you may need to repeat that you broke up just a little our focus kind of shifted when when the annex 2 became a possibility we began to negotiate with County Commissioners now we had talked about some property and and we really left dr. Putnam in a in in a in a bad place where we didn't provide any further direction on the land owned by Hayowod EMC so in the big scheme of things now that we know central office is gonna go into what was formally annexed two what about is there updates from Haywood EMC property we were looking at because I don't want to stay to lose sight of the fact we still want to do some consolidating and we still want to build an educational support and dr. Nolte you correct me if I'm wrong here but that that's a great point in question and I believe that'll be discussed since it's real property acquisition in closed session is that correct dr. Nolte yeah we can talk about that we did have a really nice statement I think from chairman Enslee at the end of our meeting with the commissioners that he realized that we still had property that was old and inefficient and that we would need to work on that at some time in the future and I would just say that we'll we'll follow up on that conversation and I think we had good two years of conversations with the commissioners and I think they do understand that resolving if we can get resolved in the next half year or so this central office situation does not resolve all of our real support services needs and that's something that we'll need to continue to work on and dr. Putnam has many conversations administratively about that so that's not a ball that we have dropped and we will continue to work on that and involve you all especially since property is a matter of the board okay any other questions before we go on to the turf discussion okay all right miss Jackson if you will if you will queue up the transmittal letter for turf replacement okay for those of you who have visual your logged in through the computer and I'll just read it for those that cannot see it this is a letter from civil design concepts Re: Haywood County School synthetic turf replacement Pisgah and Tuscola High School's certified bid tabulation pursuant to the receipt and public opening of bids on April 14 2020 for the project noted above and after evaluation of the bid packages and verification of proper license for the Haywood County Schools synthetic turf replacement we have prepared the attached certified bid tabulation as you are aware the bids and bid bonds are good for 180 days from the date of the bid which takes us out to early October 2020 once the school system is at a place to make a decision regarding the status of these projects please let me know and we can discuss the appropriate next steps at that time and so that's from Patrick Bradshaw civil design concepts so he's basically letting us know that the bids are going to be good for 180 days and that'll take us out to our early October 2020 Kim if you will if you will queue up the bid tab sheet I'm I'm very pleased to show you if you'll look on there and for again I'm I apologize for those of you who can see it reading it to you but I want those who can't see it too hear we had three bidders one of which kind of back out at the end and provided no bid once he realized the scope of the work we had astroturf corporation and we had geo services southeast incorporated astroturf came in with a bid of 1 million forty thousand one hundred dollars that's one million forty thousand and one hundred dollars geo services southeast came in with a bid of two million four hundred nineteen thousand and ten dollars so the clear and apparent low bidder is astroturf Corp and that one million forty thousand and one hundred dollars is significantly under the projected numbers that we discussed in Prior work sessions and board meetings we did not make adjustments to the timing of the turf replacement for the sole purpose of saving money but it was a significant savings that one million forty thousand one hundred dollars includes all alternates that includes grading work at Tuscola high school field with a pad extension for future renovations to the bleachers it includes cheer platforms being redone it includes fence displacement back to 20 feet in each end zone and it includes fence displacement on the sidelines back to 15 feet and it includes cheer platforms at both schools so it's all the alternates we looked at all wrapped up in that one million forty thousand one hundred dollars or if you chose the geo surfaces southeast at two million four hundred nineteen thousand dollars it the only thing it doesn't account for if you'll remember we talked about there were two certifying agencies one being the National High School Federation and one being ASMI who is another Safety Authority they recommended that twenty feet from the interior boundary of play as the suggested and the National High School Federation recommended 15 so if we went with the higher order the the the greatest call for safety that being ASMI at twenty feet what we could do is and again include it already is twenty feet out of the interior edge of play in the end zone that's already in that one million forty thousand one hundred dollars but the sidelines cannot be extended twenty feet so one additional item that we could add one if astroturf Corp is the low bidder and that's the one that's selected we could add padding to the down both sidelines at both schools for a total of a hundred thousand so 50,000 at Pisgah and fifty thousand at Tuscola provide padding on the fence down both sidelines and then already included in the million forty thousand is the movement and replacement of the fence back to twenty feet in both end zones bringing the total project costs to one one point or one point 1 million 140 thousand one hundred dollars approximately for that addition of the the padding to the fence down each side line at both schools and then one other additional thing to consider upon review by dpi they recommended the addition of a handicap ramp to the Pisgah cheer platform Tuscola already has one they recommended it it's not required but it was recommended that a handicap access be added to the cheer platform at Pisgah I do not have an estimate on that work so I will stop there and let you all ask whatever questions you may have ok I have a question the cheer platform it is going to be like the one at Tuscola so that that handicap ramp will be accessible to people in wheelchairs yes ma'am the recommendation by dpi was to add a handicap ramp to the pisgah cheer platform just like the one that already exists at Tuscola ok that's what I wanted to know because when I went to when I go to Pisgah games it's I don't want there's not a ramp so I really like that you can't see me I'm nodding in my head you know I can't see I'm not I don't have all the electronic devices but I do appreciate that very much dr. Putnam the astroturf corporation is the original installer of both fields correct you are correct I'm sorry I didn't point that out that is correct astroturf is the one who installed the the initial fields then the the second thing is do will give me a second it'll circle back around here in a minute oh the total original with the original if we were to went ahead and and and was in the process [inaudible] you're breaking up pretty bad but I'm gonna restate what I think you said prior to this bid opening and prior to moving the installation back we were looking at preliminary numbers at or around 1.7 million okay so so even with the additions and I have no way to estimate what it's going to cost to do the ramp at Pisgah [inaudible] we we it is very safe to say that at least $500,000 cheaper with than what we projected correct with all alternatives I know you can't see me now but I'm doing a happy dance probably best that you don't and I'm laughing and smiling that's great great so this bids good until 180 days from the bid opening at April 14 well nice my suggestion would be you know we don't wait the 180 day but we go ahead and begin the the you know by awarding the bid as soon as possible we we get the ball rolling and I think the public will be just as happy as we are about that's savings and maybe [inaudible] issues as well yeah and there has been just so you know in regards to that there have been some questions about raised about the delay of the project even you know by commissioners and members of the community but what I what I have told the committee what I spoke to in the commissioners meeting was this the the real reason for the decision to delay was if we tore the field up May first not knowing at that time but we chose to go ahead and execute the resurfacing project there was the potential for high school senior girls who play soccer to return and expect and rightfully so to play on their home field and it would have been torn up at that time the other thing that we looked at was okay well we'll move back to June and then the real quagmire that we got into is we could potentially have the field tore up from the high school football and boys soccer seniors returned so there was really no good timing with the uncertainty of school that we could do this field replacement prior to December but dr. Rogers you are 100% correct it is a really really good deal in a significant savings well I think we should you know no we don't need we don't take action tonight but you know I would like to discussed this in building and grounds at the board meeting or next building and grounds meeting and in accordance to their desires I think we want to push this out and make it public as soon as possible well I'm sorry go ahead mr. Hinson if if we approve this let's say we approve this Monday are we're still looking trying to get it done now or we're still gonna wait till next year well part of the reason we got it that bid for that price was the delay to 180 days see they have scheduled work more than they you know it's a really tight timeline for them they have scheduled work trying to get all of their customer current customers projects completed so I think the fact that we moved it back for 180 days looking at December they said well we don't have scheduled work beyond that and we want to make certain that we do and so that's why we got the low bids I don't I don't think you can start it earlier off that bid that was in the addendum that the work would be scheduled and and secured at a later date beyond 180 days okay so right now when we want them to start projecting and start the work December December would probably probably be best you know as we as we look at athletics and I really wished I could give you more definitive answers you you just have to look for little clues and cues based on how people react to certain things and one of those little clues that I picked up on is the North Carolina High School Athletic Association move the start date for winter sports back two weeks so usually in a regular normal school year you could start the second week in October and they moved it back to November first which tells me that they're anticipating the the the sports seasons being condensed or collapsed or delayed so I say all that to say this I think if that's the start of the winter sports season if November is the start of the winter sports season December looks like a safe month as far as not interrupting the play of our kids if I could add a comment just for those who are streaming in and listening that is a very well educated guest by dr. Putnam please do not quote us on when the winter sports season and everything else we'll start an end because that's what the High School Athletic Association has said at this point and we know they can change that and certainly pandemic situations could alter it but I think he's made a very good educated guess but the truth of the matter when all that occurs was really yet to be determined by things we don't know so that's just a disclaimer for those listening in on the livestream that's not an announcement about sports from us just very good guessing thank you dr. nolte yeah only clues where we're just trying to figure out the unpredictable so what I would recommend miss Jackson if you will pull up the next item which is a letter of intent what we could do if you so choose not tonight obviously but for your consideration maybe for vote on Monday I have for those of you who cannot see it's a letter of intent Re: Haywood County school synthetic synthetic turf replacement projects Pisgah and Tuscola high schools Haywood County North Carolina it's addressed mr. Alexander with astroturf based upon the receipt and public opening of bids for the aforementioned project on April 14 2020 we're pleased to share that astroturf corporation is the apparent low bidder as I am sure you are you are aware Haywood County Schools as owner as part of the bid and contract documents required that the bids for this project be held for a period of 180 consecutive days which falls on October 11 2020 that said Haywood County Schools will make a decision about how to move forward with this project prior to Oct. 11 2020 as noted in addendum number two issued on April 3rd 2020 bidders were notified that the probable construction start date is anticipated to be November 15 2020 or as soon there after as possible given each school's football playoff standing at that time obviously with the Covid 19 crisis ongoing Haywood County Schools is making many decisions as information is made available to us that said based on what we know at this time we have every intention of proceeding with the replacement of both the Pisgah and Tuscola fields later this year we will certainly keep astroturf corporation in the loop should their scenario change so basically it's a letter of intent I have Pat Smathers he's not with us today but he has reviewed this document it is not legally binding it's merely a good-faith effort to let astroturf know that they are the apparent low bidder should we exercise the option to replace the turf any question for me on the letter of inten t I think it's a good Letter dr. Putnam and I think that the building grounds will definitely be looking and discussing that Monday Night at their regular meeting okay any other questions for dr. Putnam okay at this time this is the last item we have other than general announcements or questions in open session but what we wanted to do before we went into closed session was give you an update on graduation ceremony plans and the potential dates and I'm gonna roll away from the computer here and mrs. Barker roll in and talk to you about those things again this is for your information we would bring this to you on Monday to approve the dates if you so agreed chairman Francis and members of the board good evening and miss Jackson if you want to pull that the dates as of May 7th for graduation you could pull that up can everyone see that okay not yet so I'll talk to you while she's getting that I just want to let you know and obviously I wish I was come tonight not with revised graduation dates I think everyone feels that way our staffs at our high school and our principals administration have really had some tough decisions and I know they put a lot of thought in it I don't think this is how anyone wanted things to turn out I will say that with that being said so much positive in wanting to do the best they can for their kids under the circumstances so that part I know they will do a good job if you look at the dates proposed dates new dates you can see community learning center that date will be June 1st 2020 at 4 p.m. at HCLC and their plans are to have a drive-through graduation with balloons bubble makers have the kids come through on their car there will be a few admin teachers mr. Haney will confer the diplomas and that is their their general plan right now for the HCLC on June 1st at 4 Tuscola high school has two days for again a similar drive-thru approach they are taking it hour by hour if you look on June 2nd the kids will get to sign up for a time that is convenient for their family from 10:00 until 11:00 and then there will be hour increments from 1 until 7 so there'll be times from 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 or 4 and so on on June 2nd same thing on June 3rd just to get the flexibility different times they're looking at like 20 students at a time likewise with Pisgah although as of right now 20 students can't get out of the car those schools wanted to be able to have that student and their family be able to be on that campus and the good location where there could be a nice picture made and be able to confer their diploma at that time central haywood high school will do the same probably in this parking area possibly in front of the school I know mr. Roden was still working on that on June 4th at 5 o'clock p.m. Pisgah high school their plan to is to have students are going to try to do theirs in one day from 9:00 until 4:00 just their 5 members their admin team and then the student and their family hopefully obviously no more than ten people can be there there will be a photographer and a video person at both all these locations so that doesn't leave many people that can be there that can get out of the car so they want to at least get as many family members as they can up until 10 people the early college will you know their their graduation will follow the college graduation and hopefully they'll be able to do that on August 7th at 4:30 at Haywood Community College and do not know what the plan is after that if that gathering size is still not allowed I'm open to any questions you have for me I have talked to all the principals several times mr. Haney's provided me information to so any questions you have I'd be glad to answer for you Jill only question I'm sorry so did you say the would be able to get out of the car their plan is so let's take Pisgah high school for instance there's five administrators there'll be a video and the camera that's seven people they'll be a graduate as eight and then two more people that would be only ten people there and I don't want to speak exactly for their location but I think for mr. Connor maybe right there at the bear in front of their sign so those people would be able to get a picture there they would have that decorated nicely confer the diploma Tuscola would like to do theirs near where the not were the band tower is but with that beautiful mountain view down the lower end of the parking lot and set something up there and they drive through so I think they're really trying to follow those guidelines of no more than ten people and comply comply with that so and then you know other people can be there in the car they just would not be able to get out of the car okay given given the newest guidelines they were just announced you can now gather outdoors more 10 people our latest guidance dr. Rogers I'm you tell me our latest guidance this morning talking to superintendents was for church services they said outdoor gatherings but I think the superintendent's were under the assumption this morning that I did not apply yet to other venues but I do want to say the principles are if anything changes you know they want they they're just they want to be able to change this and open this up I mean that is their wish and you know they they have plans that they could change this pretty quickly you know so even if it was that they will change it anyway that something like this happened so they did want you to know that I'm not sure dr. Rogers and doctor nolte's moving over here so by then it could be opened up more could it not it it could be and we will adjust accordingly what we're trying to do is you know what we've talked to you all about is in the past is think long term and act short term we what we'd like to do is nail the dates down I met with the state superintendents and regional superintendents there's only one school district in the area that is waiting until August I've spoken with that superintendent personally know her well her public health director tells her they may or may not get to have a more open graduation in August certainly if we have the opportunity to open up and do more in early June we'll be glad to do it we are very concerned that if we wait we will lose students we had parents of some students communicate to principals that their child was moving or their child is going to be in the military and their child would not be here we feel like we will be able to provide a personal celebration for more students now and certainly if we can open up the activities in a safe manner we'll be glad to do that I again if the rules have changed since I've talked to them you know we'll be glad to open it up some what I have read and seen is that those exceptions were for work or church services if that applies to graduations and other ceremonies then we would certainly try to access that so really we're just looking right now graduation plans well we had we do have plans and we have to have those but we want to change our plans Keith Roden wants to go across the river because we've been told the Community College will not be available and he wants to do it in the football field across the river and have everyone there and we've told him if the social distancing permits will pat him on the back and join him and then the other schools want also want to open it up we didn't want to promise people that we would do that now not knowing what it's going to be like in a month but certainly we we will open it up as much as the the guidelines allow us to we're also our County Health Director is he involved in this too as far as you know and some of the decision-making as far as the numbers of people and that stuff was our thinks about as well like dr. Rogers said you know it's opened up some things and like you said it's the for churches but I think I think our County can have some say-so on that too as far as our County Health Department I will be glad to talk to Patrick I will be glad to talk to Patrick Johnson about that I spoke to him today about inside gatherings I did not talk to him about graduation again it's a month away and we knew that we would expand it if we if we could but I will talk to Patrick about that and provide that information to schools into the board and you know if it's if it's available to the community what we don't want to do now and I is tell people for sure that we're going to do something in June and not be able to do it because the restrictions get tighter and it's a whole lot easier I was told when I did my student teaching many many many years ago it's easier to loosen up than it is to tighten down so what we're starting with is what we know we can do under almost any situation and then we would certainly expand that if the if the regulations allow us to that's very fair thank you yep that's exactly the answer I was looking for all right thank both of you mr. Rogers and dr. Rogers I'm gonna slide over and if you all have any additional questions for mrs. Barker and if you don't then I'll slide back in and we'll see if there are any other items for open session yeah and I think everybody you know is hoping that we can change this is definitely would be the tightest we would want this to be at this point and the principal's did want me to convey that to you that they do want to get some dates also on the calendar any other questions for me thank you Miss Barker that's a great update and I love the fact that we're gonna be fluid on this it's this thing that opens up we're going to open up I think that's a good idea yes we are yes she didn't take her chair with her I had to push it out of the way so I didn't get any kind of infection there so mr. Francis members of the board are there other questions or comments before we go into closed session I'll say while you're thinking about that we do not have anything administratively that we would expect you or ask you to act on in closed session so if there's any action to report after closed session that would come from your deliberations or conversations but we're not anticipating any of that and I say that upfront because there is no action we could come out and close the session and people who are streaming in would not have to sit there and wait on us doctor nolte I don't have any questions I have a comment yes sir okay I was impressed and I want to thank you for how gracious you was to the County Commissioners about you know our about annex 2 and so I think you handled that really well and so I just think it kudos to you for how you handled that situation and letting them know that given a certain circumstances that it was definitely something that you appreciated so I think that was well handled you know thank you mr. Burnett dr. Putnam and I were both sincere in our in our comments to the commissioners and to the public that meeting was also being streamed the contract from 1980 lease contract from 1980 was I'm sure great early on but many boards of commissioners and of Education have worked on it through the year and while it does not solve all of our problems or get us to a place we need to be we were very appreciative to have a good working relationships with the commissioners and we were able to come up with what we came up with that's something that had not happened before on this particular situation for many years so we worked cooperatively together we had lots of hard conversations mr. Francis can tell you  he was in those and while it certainly did not take care of all of our needs it did take care of a portion of those and we wanted to express that thanks for that portion to the commissioners well I think I think Becky Johnson did a good job in the paper laying the situation out and you know showing that you and the school system was gracious however that there were some obviously some shortcomings to the long-term plan you know I can add a comment there as well in favor of all of you at your decision make one of the things that I think was brilliant that you did was lay out lay out your plan your wants your needs so that they're out there for everybody's consideration and you know anything short of that people were clear where where what it was you envisioned for the school system so I thought that was a brilliant move on all of your parts thank you the good news is that we've got a dialogue now and they know our needs like you say dr. putnam I think I concur with that and I did talk to chairman Enslee later that evening after the County commissioners did what they did and I just thanked him for working with us but he also does understand there's further needs and so any other comments I would say mr. Francis if someone does not have the closed session link if they'll text me we'll get it to them okay I guess on this one we need to go ahead and do a motion and a second to go into closed session at this time I'll entertain a motion to go into closed session so moved a motion okay we have a will it mr. Burnett has made a motion second by Miss Barrett it's been suggested that we also vote by actual polling so is there any question or discussion on a motion on the floor there being none we'll vote I'm gonna roll call it okay mr. Clark yay or nay yay okay mr. Francis yay mr. Kirkpatrick yay mr. Hinson yay dr. Rogers yay mr. Rogers yay mr. Burnett yay miss Barrett yay okay motion carries unanimously you
