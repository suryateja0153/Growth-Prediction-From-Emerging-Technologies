 so i will call our meeting to order of the psc for today august 11th and i'll start off in keeping with oregon public meetings law statutory land use requirements in title 33 of the portland city code the portland planning sustainability commission is holding this meeting virtually i promised i was seeing this in song last time but i haven't come up with one yet all members of the psc are attending remotely and the city has made special has made several avenues available for the public to watch the broadcast at this meeting the psc is taking these steps as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the need to limit in-person contact and promote social distancing the pandemic is an emergency that threatens the public health safety and welfare which requires us to meet remotely by electronic communications thank you all for your patience humor flexibility and understanding as we manage through this difficult situation to do the city's business we'll open today with a our sorry our consent agenda which is consideration of minutes from the july 28 2020 pse meeting someone like to make that motion i'll make the motion thank you steph second from chris um all in favor raise your virtual hands where is it it's a good practice or your real hand is fine too thank you okay that passes and so we have adopted the minutes and i will pass it over to um items of interest from commissioners i'm getting one from mike yeah a couple things uh we got a follow-up letter from josh from the oregon state marine board indicating that their process that we participated in the hearing recently is continuing and in fact they're going to have yet another hearing and i am anxious for us to remain involved in the marine board's uh deliberation about uh rule changes on the lower willamette river staff has indicated an interest um assuming she has time with other priorities to continue providing our input as we decided some time ago um so unless there's some problem with that from my colleagues i'd i'd like to continue our providing our input as actually we were invited by the marine board to continue our involvement okay thank you mike i don't i don't know if if people people have any concerns with us to have input on that process i'm hearing no concern so i think we'll the only comment i would add is that um uh we just need to coordinate across the city um with bureaus that are interested in this including um fire yeah we got that um and a second point um i did i forgot the fact that um debbie bischoff is actually formally retired from bps but she's still on contract i believe that's is that the case at any rate she i thought did some incredible work along with the rest of staff but i think i think it would be nice for the the psc to send uh eli send a note on behalf of the psc thanking her for her service at the bureau and the work she did on the south reach planning process i think that's a great idea okay yes i'll work with you on that okay thank you mike um chris and then katie yeah i'll just mention very briefly that we had the first meeting of the reconstituted southwest corridor task force uh of this group and uh good meeting i think we have a number of folks committed to the work and we got everybody up to speed on sort of the current state so i appreciate folks participating in that thanks all right thank you um katie yeah this is just a minor thing but i got in the mail of the document that we send out to folks on the tree code and how to testify in the tree code and um i noticed that it says two o'clock which is when the meeting starts but i think the um testimony takes place at 3 30. and i noticed that the last few times we've had testimony online folks kind of complained that they'd been on there for a long long time that they had been on since the start of the meeting so i'm wondering if that needs to be looked at um i could be wrong and i mean i'm looking at this i thought that it was time time certain that we would uh take testimony at 3 30 but this doesn't mention that it just says that it starts at two so katie katie i can reply to that for for the measure 56 notices they have to be sent out before we actually finalize the psc agenda the timing is just a little bit off so we always put the beginning of the meeting time for ps for the psc meeting and you'll note on on that message it should also say please check or call a number like seven days in advance of the hearing date to confirm the time for this agenda item i think that is some line on there and that's when we can say for sure that that's the time certain that that agenda item will start does that make sense yeah it does it's a little convoluted it's just how the the timing and sequencing of one notices yeah i know i totally get it i wonder if that could be bigger and then also uh just i'm hoping that when they do call in to um get a a date or get uh signed up that they somehow can be updated at that time maybe that's happening already yes yes and that is when that happens yes right thanks thank you kitty good point and unless a mistake and this is a joint hearing um with the urban forestry commission is that correct so correct september 8th is a yeah okay um okay if there's not some additional oh mike you're putting your hand back up sorry yeah okay thanks yeah i got a fair amount of feedback on this and having testified myself many many times before the psc and other bodies going to the minute and a half i think is problematic i realize we've got time constraints but people take the effort to put a lot of thought into providing us with with input three three three minutes was already pushing it from my perspective in terms of getting information out but i i have noticed that two minutes people can can really get their thoughts out and i i would personally prefer that we stick with the two minute time frame or testimony i agree with that it felt uncomfortable this last um public hearing having people and even many did effectively get to two minutes but um especially people who are new testifying it's it's hard to make sure you get the points across from the time um thanks for that hey um i've been thinking about that a little bit too and i would like to recommend and i'm happy to provide some capacity to do this but in advance of every hearing have especially because we have this capability through zoom and maybe if we start meeting in person again we can still hold the space through zoom just doing a quick check-in a space where folks can come and talk to a commissioner about testifying like as a lobbyist i can provide some good tips um you know if you write something down you don't always have to say it like providing a little bit of coaching opportunity um and and just giving folks some resources and i think we should do that before every hearing whether it's immediately before a few days of before so people have time but just giving more space because there are folks who are pros at testifying because they do it all the time and they don't think about it and are much better at pivoting if we have to reduce time for constraint options although i agree that i don't think we should do that but um just in the interest of being a friendlier body let's let's provide space so that if folks want to you know you know be clear that that's not a new space to lobby us but ask questions about how to testify or get advice and feedback we can we can help it be a better experience for them and help better set expectations thank you um i'm seeing katie's your hands still up okay um steph um thank you i know that there's a lot happening in our world right now and so it's easy to miss uh that the u.s census has uh stepped up its deadline to september 30th um as of last week only 63 percent of the nation's households have been enumerated have responded and that tracks with oregon's um that has significant impacts on 10 years worth of funding for education healthcare land use and transportation planning um as well as representation on state and federal levels in our democracy so to the just wanted to mention that to the extent that we can all in our various capacities ensure that people feel comfortable responding and supported that would be great thank you thank you um i want to follow up one moment on orianna's point also is we put on following our last hearing on our officers meeting agenda coming up this thursday to talk about ways we can be more welcoming as a commission and and my role as chair and how many things have to juggle i think we can do some creative things to make it a more friendly environment despite the zoom setting so if you have additional ideas um in the next day or two please send them in um so we can figure out if we can adjust our our format a little bit um to be a little more welcoming and open any more comments now okay then i'm going to hand you over to andrea durbin the director's report thank you andrea oh i saw jeff's hand go up just now jeff did you have something are you practicing well never hurts practice i said a quick comment question as you're looking at ways to handle hearings differently i've been in a couple of hearings in other jurisdictions where when i testify they can see me and i can see them is there a way we could do that because i think would again try to be more welcoming to people who are testifying if we were visually connected i don't know if that's technologically difficult or not but just something to think about as host i think that would be great i don't know the tech side of it though um thank you okay um andrea thank you very much what i want to share today for my director's report is an acknowledgment of the loss of one of our colleagues and friends at bps on july 31st tony lamb died from suicide his loss has reverberated across our bureau the city and the community because tony was so beloved for those of you that did not know tony he filled a room with joy and energy he was passionate about racial justice and worked hard to create and support community tony was a planner focused on racial equity and passionate about using the tools of land use to create a more racially just community and to begin to address the harms of the past tony was a part of our team that worked on the report we released last year about the racist history of land use and zoning in portland he shared the report in those lessons with different stakeholders both inside the city and out tony was also part of our anti-displacement team doing research to assemble the current strategies and practices portland and other cities use to stabilize residents and businesses and also helping us think of new strategies we will hear more about that work this afternoon and tony was a leader amongst our bipac staff helping us think about how we change as a bureau to center racial justice in our work and change the systems and practices at bps and across the city to create inclusive and safe places for bipoc staff he helped shine the light on our practices that need to change as donnie aloe vera and i shared at the last commission meeting with our progress report of our five-year racial equity plan we've made some progress but we have a lot of work to do that is the work that i'm committed to carrying out and working with our staff across the bureau one way we honor tony and his legacy is to double down on our racial justice work both in how we center racial justice in our work in prioritizing and creating more space for that work and also making internal changes in how we operate what i did not understand was the depth of tony's personal struggle the other way we honor tony is to speak out about mental health struggles and the recognition that many people struggle and are struggling more than ever today with covid the national reckoning with race and racism and our economic downturn that it is introducing new pressures on people we need to find ways to support one another our colleagues our family our friends during these really hard times and the city needs to make sure that we are providing culturally supportive mental health services to all of our bipark staff i think i want to appreciate the commission for taking a moment to recognize and appreciate tony's legacy and impact we have lost a gentle soul a passionate activist a change agent a community leader a community connector and with that i'd like to ask for a moment of silence to honor tony thank you i know that there are a couple of commissioners that also knew tony and worked with him i'd like to invite commissioner ralph and commissioner magnera to share a few words to honor tony as well this afternoon thank you commissioner ralph um sure and uh i don't know if uh commissioner larcel also wanted to um but yeah tony was ubiquitous um he was uh when i was thinking about him the last week the i was thinking you know he was just a a bumblebee for justice and planning um like he was uh i knew him through um well working for a little bit at the bureau planning and sustainability and just being able to you know casually have uh you could just walk up to tony and start with what started with a casual conversation and quickly became a very deep and meaningful conversation and every conversation with him was a true joy uh he served on fixing our streets uh oversight committee um he's been involved in the rosewood initiative and he just created across across the city in so many different environments uh just a supportive thoughtful interconnected holistic uh space of change that was filled with humanity and just empathy and love and i think one of the um the hardest things of losing someone anyone that's losing someone like tony is um is just the city doesn't know what it lost and we have lost to to think about the profundity of the loss of all tomorrows with tony is uh significant and let's finish uh i am wearing my community cycling center shirt in honor of tony because he was a board member and just tony we're gonna we're gonna miss the hell out of you thanks i've been thinking about shock and just to warn everybody i'm i'm gonna cry a lot um so we're just gonna just gonna cry on the public record i've been thinking about shock something surprising and upsetting a sudden disruption and a body that now must rewrite rewire for a new reality a community is a body and those of us who are in community with tony are reeling from the seismic jolts of his death shock is a matter of perspective we think we see the whole of someone when really we teeter at a veneer above multi above hidden multitudes i was close enough to tony to know that his incredible resilience lay in his ability to delicately fold together many and sometimes conflicting identities that the fierce and tender way he showed up in different spaces and lives drew from deep wells of empathy and a complexity of experience tony was always real but there were few places in which he could and did show up as his full self it is easy to confuse the two we believe that when someone is consistently unafraid to speak truth to power they are unfurled before us but we are capable of holding so many complexities within us and for many it is unsafe to reveal every dimension suicide is often described as shocking especially when it precipitates the loss of someone who is viewed as accomplished ambitious brilliant charismatic exuberant a fighter tony was all of these things but we are not well served by a dichotomy between excellence and struggle it is false it is often the people who show up the boldest the kindest or the most playful who use these traits to cover deep wounds and this was tony too there's a crack in everything that's how the light gets in a friend recently shared this leonard cohen line and it keeps playing in my head tony felt tremendous pressure to hide his cracks i'm going to take a moment to share my own cracks and i want to be clear that my intent is not to make the passing of a black man about my experience as a white woman but instead to practice radical vulnerability on the public record i want also to acknowledge that my race and my position of power afford me this privilege that as a black man and in particular as someone without a permanent position at this bureau tony was at a far greater risk if he told his truth finally i should name that what i'm about to say may be a trigger for some people so i'm going to put um i don't think i've screen sharing privileges but we'll share the multnomah county mental health crisis line and hope perhaps we can share that as a body uh out more widely the number is 503-988-4888 and i have co-hosting abilities now so i will pause to put it up and i'd like to invite anyone who needs to virtually step out and take a break at this time for any reason to do so without judgment i have wrestled with depression anxiety disordered eating and self-harm for most of my life in january i tried to kill myself after our psc retreat i felt an incredible amount of shame coming out of that space and it exploded the next morning when i woke up to an article that framed me as a white savior i cycled through a series of mistakes that allowed this narrative to be published the harm i perceived that resulted felt insurmountable i felt too destructive to continue to exist but i was able to dig deep inside myself to see that these were thoughts and not realities and i sought help i was almost too late my heart stopped and had to be shocked back to life in the ambulance i am grateful to be alive today grateful to be doing this work grateful to the people who loved and supported me then and now and grateful for the time i knew tony a joy in the past week has been hearing story after story of people who felt the warmth of tony's son i certainly did but it has also been cathartic and feels important to hold space for anger at the ways in which that light was so frequently diminished the bureau of planning and sustainability failed tony it failed him again and again just as it has failed and lost other bypoc especially black staff in less tragic ways we failed tony we the planning and sustainability commission are the body that is meant to hold bps accountable but we are complicit in long-standing and institutional practices that have done and do harm tony's death is a shock in that it has short-circuited a culture in which racial equity is addressed nominally while internally and externally perpetuating systems of oppression and white supremacy this is a reckoning this is an emergency rebecca solnit reminds us that inside the word emergency is a merge we are at a hairpin not a dead end tony consistently laid the groundwork for change he left behind documents and ideas that clearly articulate what actions must be taken to transform the bureau in our city we have a map to find our way tony's email signature ended with the most difficult thing is the decision to act the rest is merely tenacity he got that quote from a tv show about people surviving alone in the wilderness tony was surviving in his own wilderness through sheer force of tenacity we must be tenacious too and when we are ready we must decide to act change must move at the speed of grief healing and reparations for bypoc staff and the communities that tony touched must be prioritized these are the first steps and are not separate from the work but if i knew tony he would have kept grinding could have kept hustling would have kept pushing and i don't want to lose sight of his big vision so i'm going to grind and hustle and push for radical transformation in honor of his memory tony was supposed to present his anti-displacement work today and our recent focus on racial justice is a direct result of internal organizing to which he contributed greatly he and i were working together to amplify and codify this and i'd like to share some context for how that effort came to be and we will hear later about tony's contributions and guidance around anti-displacement as a black man who loved to run tony was deeply affected by the murder of ahmed abre already one to think about how he navigated space how spaces were designed to be navigated and by whom he felt the constant danger of a world constructed to protect white women like me and harm him shortly after tony ran 2.3 miles in honor of ahmed arbury's birthday he humbled me when i tried to cross the street against a light he reminded me that i held a privilege of safety and rule breaking in a world that was constantly trying to kill him for any or often no infraction i thought about this whenever we were in protest spaces what it meant to put my body on the line before his and i thought about this when energized by the streets he wanted bps to explicitly add to the call from the portland african-american leadership forum and unite oregon to defund and dismantle the police at a time when his job was uncertain and unstable tony still spoke up demanded action and made himself vulnerable tony was courageous as organizing shifted to addressed injustices within bps and for the actions in the palf people's plan i helped create a container in the psc to receive the generative work tony and i wrote language to chain titles 3.33 of the city code to give pbs an explicit charge for racial justice and accountability for the racist history of planning if that was the direction in which the organizing collected wanted to move or chooses to move when it is ready during the first psc meeting centered on racial justice tony and i texted back and forth he got more excited as he started thinking bigger a racial justice state land you skull he later remarked that such a milestone would cement someone's legacy if it were achieved i want that for him i will fight with fury and love to make that happen but i cannot fight alone and many of you hold other pieces of tony's legacy i keep coming back to nipsy hustle with tony today with the lines dedication hard work plus patience the sum of all my sacrifice i'm done waiting tony cannot continue this work he will never see the sweeping changes he saw as necessary but were constantly deferred he will never bear the racial equity planner title he hoped to create now we are all responsible for his legacy and we will never lose him if we continue to hold true to the course he sat tony lives in the courageous brilliant tenacious and resilient passion we must all channel around may tony rest in power thank you thank you victoria thank you steph can i just say let's hold each other and especially orianna and steph and tony in our hearts together let's hold hold each other through our hearts together thank you reverend myself i'm not even sure who comes up for a nice session in the meeting because it would have been coming yeah the displacement i have not did not get to know him and we have some of his work in front of us now so i guess i'd like to invite whoever is going to be leading the segment from staff to let us know who it is and let's step up to it yeah hi everyone this is tom armstrong andrea pastore and i will be talking about the anti-displacement work um i just want to acknowledge and appreciate everything that um steph and orianna said um i really it really resonated with me um tony was a part of my team uh since 2017 when he came to bps as an intern while i was earning his master's degree at psu um i always admired him as someone that brought a lot of passion and conviction to his work and you know as as was discussed here i mean he um he was really what what we aspire at bps to be as a really powerful combination of expertise and lived experience and and what has amazed me in the wake of his death is just the deep connections that he had in this community and across portland um you know and it just it just leaves me um with a a profound sense of loss and and what could have been um but also a renewed commitment um to see him reflected in in my work and in and in this work um that we'll talk about today um which is just getting started and he brought so many ideas um to the table here um that you know we we want to see that carried through um as one of many contributors to this work so i think um jp can you share the share the screen share the um slideshow oh andrea has that okay so what we have um this afternoon is an update on the anti-displacement action plan we've really spent this year doing a couple of different things one earlier this year we spent a lot of time getting a community grant of city funds to health so that they could hire a community organizer to help us get get a deeper outreach into the community and that was done with city funds in addition to um there's also additional money available um that we'll be making working with health and a steering committee on making additional grants to other community groups to participate in this process we also were worked with palf and were able to secure a metro community engagement grant that will fund the community organizer position all the way through the end of december of 2021 so we have a good structure in place um [Music] to support community engagement because as you'll see you know a key part of this process um is is for it to be co-created and co-led with the community um the other thing that you we've done um also has been um and as you saw in the summary memo um we've been working with other city bureaus on what we're calling a foundation report that really captures um where the city is at today um in terms of our anti-displacement work both uh the policy framework the analytical tools um the mapping the risk typology mapping that that tony was involved with um and and some of the other measures and metrics as well as an inventory of the current actions that the city is doing in terms of anti-displacement and mitigation and then the third thing that we've been doing that andrea will talk a little bit more about in in just a minute is the um anti-displacement task force and working with our community partners um to stand up that that task force and so just just a reminder of how we got here um you know this the issue around displacement um has really really came to the fore in um as part of the comp plan and a coalition of community groups came forward with um i believe a set of at least a dozen different policy ideas um that both bps staff and the psc worked to insert into the comp plan and um one of one of these things one of the important elements was sort of beginning to define what we mean by displacement and and or gentrification that's a term that can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people but what we're really focused on can be considered um economic displacement or involuntary displacement it's not so much the the old school the 50s 60s urban renewal highway building that we saw in the lower albina neighborhood when the memorial coliseum was built or when i-5 was built when or or the legacy emanuel hospital when property was taken and um people were physically displaced um from their homes and their neighborhood what we're talking about is a little bit more subtle um it's it's when changes in a neighborhood um result in both um increasing market values rents home values but that that also what we're seeing is uh it also leads to a change in the neighborhood culture and changes in as in shops or what goods and services are available that you know really erodes your sense of place that even if you could figure out to hang on in terms of being able to afford a rent or maybe if you're lucky enough to own a home you can hang on the neighborhood but the neighborhood has changed around you it's and and you no longer feel that sense of place and so where we've most seen that is in the inner north northeast albina neighborhoods where the black community has been displaced largely to east portland and the rockwood area you know we did a study um for prosper portland um a year or two ago that really looked at the inner north northeast effects and the fact that you know four thousand black households have been displaced from the inner north northeast neighborhoods since the year 2000 um this graphic is one that we we put together that really sort of gets at the the um the cycles um that a neighborhood can go through that leads to the displacement and the disparities if you think especially the example of inner north northeast portland where you really had a disinvestment um in that community through redlining and through public decisions around infrastructure investments and maintenance and then that all really started to turn around in the 1990s when you when at the same time you had really a a back to the city movement or a reverse white flight where uh young white households decided they want to stay in the city and the popularity of living close to the central city living in in the old streetcar neighborhood commercial business districts became attractive and that in turn or combined with investment in amenities like the yellow line max train and zoning changes really enabled um a lot of development that that turned around these neighborhoods that that was sort of a cycle that fed fed on each other uh in terms of escalating property values and rents and a wholesale change in the community um which is what led to the displacement of bypoc communities and then what we've seen also is not only has this led to racial disparities um and and displacement to lower opera what we call lower opportunity areas areas with less infrastructure fewer parks more distant from job opportunities less transit connections but also that neighborhood that has gentrified and change you know we can also see that that increase in affluence has led to a decline in transit use and has eroded some of our other goals in terms of carbon reduction and climate change and reducing reliance on automobiles so you know addressing displacement and moving towards a more equitable development strategy is both an environmental justice as well as a racial justice strategy so the policy framework uh in the comp plan um there's there's a number of different policies that that really give us levers to help guide our actions and this not only applies um to zoning changes which which you've seen how we've tried to address that in projects like the better housing by design changes by the residential infill project but also for major infrastructure investments so some of the things that we're trying to do with the southwest corridor [Music] equitable development strategy but what we want to do is when we make these major decisions we want to analyze those impacts and try and mitigate expected harms we want to try and leverage private investment for public benefit through programs like inclusionary housing and the affordable commercial bonus um that we now have in our zoning code and then we want to look at the combination of what makes a community the the empowerment and voice of the community the economic opportunity as well as affordable housing and the environmental justice issues that all combine to be that that community so we have like i said we have a number of different things um that we have in place um but that we recognize are not enough um and that we need to do more and the purpose of this project is to be both cl collaborative with city bureaus as well as the community to figure out what's going to be effective um in terms of doing more um you know we we've done a lot in the last few years you know especially in terms of um housing affordability um and and trying to keep our most vulnerable renters in their homes and to and to produce more affordable housing um let's go to the next one and and so what what we really are looking at um is is trying to move further upstream uh in these decision-making processes and not so much figure out how we can mitigate um the impacts but how can we produce equitable outcomes from the beginning and i think what we've what we've learned and andrea will talk a little bit about how we got you know started or not necessarily how we got started but how this process really got a boost from our work with policy link but really working with bipac communities up front so that they can can enjoy the benefits and sharing the benefits of of equitable development all through the process and that it's not as much an afterthought or a catch-up game like we've been playing in inner north northeast so i'm going to uh turn things over to andrea pasteur um to she's a senior economic planner at bps and has been leading um this project effort um and have her talk a little bit about um the this this policy link process that we went through and um the task force process that that we're currently um trying to stand out thanks tom so yeah as tom mentioned a lot of uh this project is based around the work that happened last year in 2019 with policy link there was a it culminated in a three-day convening between city and community leaders and the result of that meeting was um outlined in a memo that contained the recommendations that you see here a real they focused on a racial equity that and how it must define both how the city operates and what's prioritized for anti-displacement work they urge the city to identify a target population and in that weekend the group identified black indigenous and people of color as the target group to kind of focus their work around focused policies that will actively address near-term displacement pressures in communities commit to a process that is led by people and communities most impacted by displacement and racial inequities be prepared for a long-term commitment particularly a long-term commitment of resources and building accountability transparency and measurement for every goal and action so these recommendations and next steps outlined in that memo form the basis for this current work as tom mentioned we have both through grants from the city of portland and metro committed multi-year funding for the anti-displacement coalition by funding their community coalition organizer position they will serve an active role in advocacy and organizing to advance the needs of community that are identified in the project the second step was to create a community-led anti-displacement task force which will be a collaborative effort between the bureau leadership and community members to make policy and program recommendations to city council we'll be opening applications to this new advisory body next week and hope to recruit about 15 participants who will commit to the project for the next year and a half and the next two steps would be part of the anti-displacement task force's charge in addition to identifying policy and program gaps that could help the city reach our anti-displacement goals they'll also work together to identify a permanent source of funding for this anti-displacement work and finally the anti-displacement task force will determine the goals outcomes and metrics the city of portland will track annually and then assign to report to city council over time to ensure that we're making steady progress in stabilizing our communities our recruitment for the anti-displacement task force is currently ongoing and applications are set to open next week as i mentioned the task force will be a joint community city leadership body making recommendations to city council including five bureau leaders the members will be selected and appointed in september and hopefully convene in october the focus of their work will be the center black indigenous people of color in conversation around displacement we'll be looking for potential members who have experience or expertise in these areas tenant rights affordable housing development transportation justice arts and culture houselessness workforce development education equity climate justice and or lived experience of displacement and the charge will be pretty wide they'll be charged with developing a shared framework for equitable development for portland identifying the most effective tools for stabilizing our most vulnerable communities providing guidance in our update of the city's displacement risk analysis tools and developing an agenda for further state and federal support that may be necessary to meet our anti-displacement goals finally we really wanted to show this relationship between the task force and other bureau advisory groups especially such as the planning and sustainability commission we expect that there will be coordination and communication between the task force and other advisory bodies and that the task force will be making their recommendations to city council city council will then direct bureaus to do the work and with those recommendations in mind and this way we hope that task force can have a collaborative relationship with other existing bodies bps staff expect to update the psc as desired and needed on this work of the task force especially as it pertains to land use issues and through the task force process we hope to determine the framework for incorporating the building blocks of equitable development seen here into every aspect of portland's future growth and development as tom mentioned you know we really have some work still left to do in this area finally i wanted to share the three main ways that people can stay involved and up to date on this project first through participation with the anti-displacement community coalition organizations or individuals who are interested in getting involved should reach out to palph for more information on how the different community groups are being engaged second would be to apply to be a member of the task force um our applications will be up on the project webpage next week and finally on our webpage community members can also sign up to receive updates via our project mailing list now we have some time for questions now you're muted sorry i'm catching up here is it possible to stop screen sharing for the q a just we can see each other i'm looking for it okay jp if you could turn it off i don't know um let's open up the questions i see mike's hand up so start there yeah i was i was uh interested in tom's presentation about moving further upstream and rather just rather than thinking only about mitigation right off the bat looking at what i i'm interested in the parallels with the environmental issues and the hierarchy for for addressing negative impacts on the environment and moving toward avoidance avoidance is is definitely the first step and then mitigation and mitigation on-site in kind service just interesting parallel i think and secondly andrea's comment about interacting with the psc particularly in uh uh instances where land use is involved i just want to re-emphasize we're the we're the uh planning and sustainability commission i think we need to continually think about the fact that we can we do have our our purview i think is lies outside of strictly the land use process because i think there are ways particularly with regard to climate change and issues related to sustainability that are not necessarily tied to land use thank you um katie i have not seen your hand up first but i got my stream oriented now okay yeah no worries um gosh i have a whole bunch of questions so be patient folks um i wanted to just compliment you on the design it looks like a great design and um i think that's it's going to be kind of a first to go um you know you're talking about the power dynamic you're going you're raising up people that have less power and maybe more lived experience around what's actually going on and um i you know one of the things when i look at anti-displacement it's um i one of the things that i've wondered about this project whether the scope is too small um anti-displacement you know it's almost like if you pull one thread you're going to get into all kinds of other issues around employment around education there's just there's just uh even even policing um one of the ways that i've been looking at that policing can be made better is by building up neighborhoods you know where the violence is is taking place so i'm just wondering if the scope is too small and i know the history of the project that it kind of got carved out because the bureau really wanted to do it got carved out of people's work days etc and now it's gotten a lot more support but i think actually with the the very recent events that nobody's had time to adjust to whether it should be a bigger effort and and just acknowledge the messiness and the interconnectedness and make it a bigger effort um so there's anyway so that's not really i guess i'm just opining in here but that's has anybody thought about making it a bigger effort i'll make it a question here well i i do think we recognize that and and i think it will we're interested to see where the task force takes these discussions because i think initially um and it's sort of reflected in that memo you know we you know we have the housing bucket and maybe the the business space bucket and the workforce development and cultural space um and so you you know that agenda quickly expands and then we talk about zoning and infrastructure projects and and i agree with you you know the policing and education in it and it really grows from there and so um i think you know it's going to be a challenge to how do we focus this effort so that we can accomplish something and it doesn't drag out for as long as the comp plan drug out um kind of thing um one of one of the ideas that that we heard is to really sort of become think of us more of a and this task force more as a policy lab um you know like as part of residential infill at council uh commissioner u daily has really brought forward the idea of tenants opportunity to purchase program well you know we can get the task force to dig into that and make a recommendation rather quickly to try and get that program up and running um and and sort of not get overwhelmed by the magnitude of the problem but let's start you know here's what we're doing what's working what's not what else should we be doing and start to roll that out so there's a there's a bunch of different approaches um but i think sitting within the model of a co-created co-led that's a conversation that we're going to have to get into with the task force on where they want to start and how they want to steer this work so here's my other another question that i have that has to do with the design and i do want to thank you so much because this is something that we've been asking as a planning and sustainability commission is that we hear about these projects when they're still kind of yeasty enough to make changes to and that's really at the time when you can actually have the most impact and so i'm wondering how have you you know the fact that this is such a multi-dimensional problem i'm looking at that you've expanded um the power base at one end you're expanding the power base at one end in fact the low power people are getting more and then who are they going to connect to on the other side have you thought about you know i mean i read in there that you're interested in bringing in other bureaus but what about other state and um the county and the other you know power brokers who are going to listen more if they're part of things up front whereas if they have this commission that's coming at them later on in a year or two after they've gotten things together and they don't they're going to be asking for stuff from the state they'll be asking stuff from the county they'll be writing grants for the feds right and and it might be a really good time to write grants for the feds we hope and um so uh you know i'm just wondering how much you've thought about how you get a bunch of people who don't have a lot of power you give them a lot of power and then they don't have and then they they get kind of disappointed later on because they're not able to um connect with the power brokers that actually still have that power and they have the money etcetera so i'm wanting you to think about that um and then um and that's i think that might be it just that um did you have you thought about changing the definition of a complete neighborhood then yeah definitely um you know as part of the the sort of um improving our our analytical tools both you know how we define what neighborhoods are at risk um but also how we define access to opportunity and and i think those those will be part you know revamping those tools will will be part of our our work and and i think we we have um identified and and sort of that need again it's sort of how do you get started without making this too big but we definitely see you know sort of a here's what the city can do and here's where we as a partner between the city and the community groups need to go lobby for change at the state level or at the federal level or work with the county on a program um to to to be more collaborative in that way and i totally get that but i think that if they have some in input into it at the beginning they'll be much more likely to listen and um so uh let's see what was the there was one other thing i've got my notes here buddy um oh just there was something that you said in the stuff that you sent out and it was kind of and it made a lot of sense and it shows that you're thinking in terms of um of of systems and you're saying uh uh if we if we build parks and we put sidewalks in it inevitably causes uh displacement and so then um the uh so therefore when we put in parts and we put in um uh sidewalks we need to be thinking about displacement and we need to uh plan for it and so i think that's wonderful and it's a wonderful way to think but the problem that i that the little evil part of my little brain says does that mean that you're not going to do anything in neighborhoods anymore and um and but it also means so that's my the evil thing that i think but then the other thing is just um if you have to do more every time you do anything you really need all the again you need all the players because they then you have to do a lot when you do things okay so i just yeah no i totally agree that's the that's the challenge around making these investments and sidewalks and parks and and i think one of the things that we want to explore through this process is like what what level of that investment is at lower risk and and let's go do it and then also as andrea pointed out you know okay we know we want to do parks and sidewalks and safety improvements in east portland how do we find the resources to address the housing issues or the the retail space issues at the same time so we can do it all we very much recognize that more resources both in terms of building community capacity but but just building more affordable housing um has to be part of this strategy but it is totally unfair to say well we got to stop because we might displace people um you know i don't think anyone would say that i'm just worried that it might happen yeah yeah thank you so i'm going to switch um i'm done i need to i need to let other people talk but um yeah thank you thank you so much that was i i i really appreciate the opportunity to talk about something before it's all done and i'm just going to add that i know we're behind in our agenda i need to keep moving forward but the um we will share out when uh the announcement for recruitment for the anti-displacement task force um goes out next week we'll share that with you all so hope that you will circulate it to your networks and help us identify good people that you think should serve and apply for those positions um orianna and then i had steph and then i'm gonna jump in myself so orianna excuse me so before i ask a question i just uh want to name something um because it's concerning to me and i appreciate where you're coming from katie but as long as we as a body and institutions like the bureau of planning sustainability continue to give power to those institutions that we're feeling like we have to call in in this moment or that it's being named they will have power the way we give power to community is by keeping those folks out of the process and then not letting them come in at the end and everything up sorry uh to swear on the record but i'm a little raw today um so i think that's just worth naming is that there's a solution that doesn't involve perpetuating the structures of oppression that already exists in in this space and in this work and i think i just like to encourage us as a body to do what we can to when we have those thoughts really challenge them and think about like where do we want the power to live and how do we get it there and not do so in such an incremental way and i think what's happening with this task force is really really powerful and so we have a charge to do everything we can as a body in everything we can as a bureau and everything we can as a city to ensure that this body has true power and is not disappointed um so just just throwing throwing that piece out there but then a couple of questions that have come up for me and i'll ask them all together because they're pretty short but may have more lengthy answers and i'm happy to take this offline as well in the interest of time but the first is i think when we talk about bipod communities in particular in terms of displacement work we sometimes need to disaggregate a little bit more and i'm wondering what the conversations in the work have been specifically around black and indigenous communities um whether that's something that's being last more for the task force and the lived experience there or just what the internal conversations have been about the specific experience and harm that's been done in particular to black communities in north and northeast um the second piece is what is being done from the task force structure perspective to kind of decolonize that work or remove white supremacist structures from the way that works like we're still functioning within a system but what are the ways in which it's being designed um to break that down and truly shift that power more to community in the way i was just describing and the final piece is and this may be kind of putting a solution ahead of things a little bit but just curious how land banking and um alternatives to just building regulated affordable housing are playing into this that help to preserve communities and allow for those kinds of investments that katie was talking about to to come forward um but in a way that is a little bit more protected for an entire community as opposed to just individual plots um or or individual buildings so i'll i'll stop there thank you tom can i yeah go ahead and address this for sure yeah i just really yeah i wanted to recognize that um especially because we're working with the community coalition and um uh palf has really been the the lead organization in that we are definitely very you know very intentionally centering black and indigenous communities in this work and in in terms of our task force recruitment you know one of the questions that they really wanted to have as part of just like the screening process was are you aware and you know what's your understanding of anti-black racism and are you committed to dismantling it so just to give a little example of how we are really trying to lead with black and indigenous communities um you know front and center because those are just two communities that have their own very different but particular histories with land um you know just land you know ownership and dispossession that um you know i feel like really need to be discussed in a very particular way um and really centered in this work so definitely wanted to uh you know kind of put that out there that we are very aware of that and trying um our best to do what we can with that um and in terms of land banking and equitable development i think that that is definitely one of those bigger picture items where we are trying to move the conversation into a broader discussion of equitable development and not just this is a housing project where we only talk about affordable housing development really talking about how do we get ahead of the curve on all of these things when we're in the planning stages well well ahead of these investments being made and in particular the community coalition has really stressed to us that they want to focus a lot on community benefits agreements that they are able to negotiate themselves without necessarily having intervention from the city so i think that that's a really interesting and powerful thing that hasn't really been that successful in portland but has worked in other cities so keeping in mind how we can get some community benefits out of investments that are being made from the private side of things too and i i think um also you know to to speak to your point about decolonizing the process i mean we made an intentional recommendation and as part of the task force structure that the that the five bureau uh leaders that sit on the task force are non-voting so you know we want the bureaus to be at the table and part of the discussion but we want the recommendations to be made by the community and and so we we want that collaboration but have the community hold the power thanks steph um thank you for that uh so just to follow up very briefly um community benefits agreements thank you for mentioning those um also a standing question you know how do we ensure that those have teeth uh because on the other side of that you know we've seen a lot of cvas um uh get watered down or just uh forgotten about over the passage of time uh and then uh to the uh conversation around uh uh bypoc uh leading um just to name that uh we the idea that we are following as a as a body and when we are talking about prioritizing our agenda and looking at what what uh what potential tools or decisions are we waiting um that we find ways without adding to the capacity uh issues of i'm sure an already uh very in-demand task force that has not even been assembled yet that um that we uh we be responsive to to those priorities and needs as a body and act on them thank you thanks mike is your hand back up yes it is yeah i want to go back to katie's comment and tom's response um i think a very real problem we're going to have to wrestle with is the is the notion that we don't want to create communities that don't have parks that don't have sidewalks that don't have good um urban design and there are people sometimes i think cynically who push back against providing those things to the community based on displacement so that's that's going to be a really huge challenge parks natural resources environmental programs already are strapped financially and there's absolutely i have no problem no disagreement with trying to figure out what the unintended consequences might be but uh adding costs to parks for example to account for the potential for displacement just isn't going to cut it we do need a broader conversation about funding these programs that not only provide excellent parks and protect the environment but do provide funds to address affordable housing to address all the issues we've been talking about that's going to be that's a really huge challenge but just to say no more parks no more sidewalks because there may be displacement is not where we want to go i'll jump in with a question is the anti-displacement task force um will they be i'm imagining that various policy ideas will generate out of this process um heading to city council would that group be making recommendations through and will they be empowered to take public testimony and to to listen in addition to their membership yeah you know as with most city advisory committees we'll we'll set up a process where people can submit comments and and testimony on on items that they're that they're talking about um i don't know if they'll actually i mean whether we'll actually you know have the task force hold public hearings or or how that will work um but eventually you know the it is the city council that um will act on these recommendations and and sort of that public process at council will be will be the ultimate um destination for for these recommendations but yeah getting getting creating that opportunity for public comment early on will help form those recommendations okay i guess i'll flag that sometimes it is powerful to have a non-um non-group of politicians making the original policy recommendation to have the power of a public input process before it goes to city council we've certainly seen that in the psc's deliberations um and that can help because the city council sometimes likes to have things pre-vetted um in some public way so this might be a format where that would make sense i don't think one more last question is just a thought after having um in in the housing and affordability section it says using zoning and fair housing programs to expand housing types and affordability for people of all incomes to live in high opportunity areas and just flagging that high opportunity areas have a lot of people living them already and so i hope that as a group goes forward there's acknowledgment that redevelopment does involve displacement the question is who's displaced and we have such a unfortunate history of lower income people and minorities being displaced but there may be other people displaced or more affluent and i think that i hope there's an acceptance that that could be okay in fact appropriate um i remember talking to alan lazo with the residential infield project who pointed out that although rip is projected to decrease displacement for low-ranking people um in low-income neighborhoods it decreases displacement more for affluent folks so he was pitching appropriately to try and flip that narrative so i hope that as this goes forward there's there's that lens applied to it any other questions or comments for this stage all right well thank you um thank you tom and andrea and we'll look forward to speaking with you again soon thank you all right thank you so i'm not sure who's leading this one either i have to admit that i either didn't get notes or lost them so next on our agenda is community involvement committee briefing great and um for that i'm going to turn it to our new equity manager nikoia phillips who manages our community involvement committee and she will introduce the panel welcome nikoia hi there thanks so much for having us it's a tough day and a tough meeting so appreciate everybody for hanging in there and making space for us to all bring our whole selves um so as andrea mentioned my name is nicoya phillips i've been working in bps for a little over two years now and i'm actually really sad to not be joining y'all in community with video but i have a really unstable internet connection so i'm hoping this will help and if i get kicked out we'll we'll work through it um any hoosiers so as andrea mentioned i have been the equity manager in bps just for the last month but leading up to that um i served as our community engagement lead focusing on racial equity strategies and strategies to better involve community members in the work that we do and our decision making processes and so part of that work was my role as the coordinator for our community involvement committee and so i facilitate and coordinate that committee that is a committee of about 12 folks and we'll be joined by two of those folks who i will let introduce themselves in just a minute but we're here today because we want to introduce ourselves to you tell you a little bit about who we are what work we do and talk to you about what it might look like for us to work together more in the future so just to give you a little bit of background on the cic um the cic was originally convened quite a few years ago during the development of the 2035 comprehensive plan in particular they paid a lot of attention to the second chapter where the policies on community involvement were developed and they met for about five years pretty consistently and one of their last kind of orders of business right before the 2035 plan was adopted was to ask that the committee be a long-standing committee they thought that it shouldn't be project-based but that it should be an ongoing committee of community members that would have the ability to weigh in on projects as they came about in the bureau and so after the adoption they sunset it in their original form and this new format for the committee was born and that was about two years ago right around the same time that i came on actually i came on and we had about three active members and today we have 12 members and so each of the members were selected by a panel they all went through a rigorous application process and our panel was very intentional about selecting members that were diverse in racial identity and formal education lived experience ability you name it and we were very intentional about making sure that this committee had a low barrier to entry so we did look for folks that had a strong interest and some experience in land use projects and community engagement but that wasn't a determining factor on whether or not you could serve so we are really excited about the fact that we've engaged a lot of folks that are new grads folks that are retired folks that like i said have just a range of diverse experiences that really wanted to get engaged in this work and folks are serving staggered three-year terms we've had about 95 retention of those 12 folks over the last two and a half years or so so really excited that people are staying with us um and excited about the work that they're doing um and i wanted to talk a little bit about kind of how we make decisions so the group is brought together to talk specifically about the community engagement process on the different land use projects that come through bps and so we don't meet often enough to see everything but the projects that we do see we focus less on the actual technical pieces which is a little bit more of what y'all do here at psc and we look really specifically at those community engagement plans that sometimes the planners will report on by the time they get to you and we've decided that we'd like to make recommendations on what those plans look like really early on so we'd like to see projects early on and give feedback on how to structure the community engagement plans how to do a power analysis to determine who the stakeholders are and which particular groups of community members project managers might want to uplift we've talked a little bit about how to budget for community engagement so we really explored a variety of ways to weigh in on how the project managers structure their community engagement work and over the last year that's really been kind of the space that we've been in is just kind of looking at projects as they come up really experimenting with how we engage in projects at what point in the project like lifespan we engage and then also working on a new charter since we've been a new committee we needed a charter to kind of lay out what it is that we were doing and our chartering process just so y'all know was not an easy process um we've been focused on doing things collaboratively and by consensus so we don't operate using robert's rules so it's a little more laid back than what y'all are doing here um but it's just different just a different approach and so when you do collaborative uh design for all of the ways that you approach your work and consensus decision making everything just takes a little bit more time so our rechartering process took us about or actually the first chartering our chartering process took us about nine months and that was done with a series of interviews with some of the original members that were in the cic when they were kind of developing the plan for the comp plan some of the staff that staffed it at that time original members that joined as soon as the new cic was formed different planners a couple of folks from community-based organizations and neighborhood associations that expressed interest in what it was that was happening in the cic so it's really just been a very collaborative community-led process by which i really just again consider myself the coordinator i don't feel like that i've really led the work in any way just really provided structure and support and technical assistance as was needed by the community members involved to kind of shape the work um and so i would like to just read to you and some of y'all should have gotten our charter in advance so if you've had a chance to review that awesome and if not that's okay i just want to read a little bit of the preamble before i share some time with two of our members to kind of talk a little bit about their experience with our community involvement committee so our preamble says or at least a bit of it as members of the community involvement committee we are committed to authentic transparent and equitable public engagement processes our intent is to challenge traditional thinking and move the bureau of planning and sustainability towards its own stated and admirable goals in the 2035 comprehensive plan and their racial equity plan we volunteered for this role because we believe bps can do better for the city's residents especially those who are traditionally underrepresented in planning processes our work officially started in 2018 when the city of portland finalized its 2035 comprehensive plan a comp plan advisory committee overseeing the community engagement during the development of the plan recommended convening and staffing a standing committee to guide its implementation thus the community involvement committee was born but our purpose still needed clarity in late 2019 we participated in a six-month rechartering process this involved training and experiential learning around land-use planning racial equity bias awareness and consensus decision making various interviews with both past and current stakeholders and practical project application using popular education methods while we explored our vision and mission the rechartering and visioning process clarified our scope of responsibility provided guidance on how we will operate and shaped the development of this charter so i really love that preamble because i feel like it just kind of in a snapshot really captures kind of the sentiment of this committee and in particular the people that were involved in kind of creating this guide for what the work will look like of the committee going forward and so at this time i just want to share one of our members and give her a moment to share a little bit about her experience on the committee um miss herity chambers the floor is yours okay i'm testing can you guys hear me with my okay yeah welcome okay hi hello um i am harini chavers i am a member of the cic i recently graduated from portland state receiving my bachelor's degree in community development i chose just i chose to join this committee because i value inclusive engagement within the community and equity among diverse groups racial equity is really important to me um being born and raised in northeast portland i have seen low-income people and people of color who struggle or get or get by or face this sorry that who struggle to get by or face displacement and as the economic investments start to grow in urban places i want to make sure no one is left behind and all residents can benefit from this new growth racial equity is an important component to have in our work because it is inclusive rather than being exclusive racial equity is a solution that gives equal opportunities to people of all races from day one being a part of the committee we have worked on land use planning and legislative procedures as a member of the committee i see success as finishing a project from start to finish seeing progress learning new things and understanding it and resolving conflict we have given our input towards a few projects such as the montgomery park to hollywood dealing with the transit and land use development strategy within that project the cic members we came up with the population of who would be affected by this transportation expansion which included small business owners homeowners renters affordable housing and industrial workers and as we split into groups we noted that this project is on a budget of 45 to 50 thousand dollars and my group members and i wanted to make sure this equitable development plan included an anti-displacement strategy we thoroughly thought about the focus groups and what outcomes would come out of this transportation expansion as well as being on a budget and once again thinking inclusive and not exclusive we thought about the outside focus group that wasn't mentioned such as the houseless community within the area of northwest to northeast um as we asked how would they take this change will this cause displacement where their needs be accommodated those were a few of many concerns we questioned for this project and i feel as though being on the committee the cic brings a diverse perspective on projects due to our inner sexualities i myself bring a perspective of a 22 year old black educated heterosexual female that grew up in a low to middle social class i volunteered to be in this position within the community so that i can have the opportunity to advocate and bring community voices into decision making and so far being on the committee i am able to voice my opinion and have the respect enough to be heard and to be thought about rather than the my suggestions going in one ear and out the other um i have seen things be taken into consideration and being on the committee has definitely helped and brought a new perspective on projects that may have not been thought of within the perspective that everyone brings and yeah that's pretty much it i enjoy the cic and it's very helpful to have a diverse members i wish everyone i wish the other members could be present um is really diverse within the age and social class and and our identities and yeah thank you so much tereni and i hope the psu program went well yeah i did a little while ago um i um i just wanted to say first off that we absolutely treasure the cic role people play i'm supporting these projects and and you're probably going to get involved in projects before we even see them sometimes i hope you do um i'm thinking back to when we had the cic through the comp plan project and at the end of that tiresome volunteers had we just relied on them to make sure that we got feedback from a much broader rate of the public than we would have gotten if it just been us and staff doing the outreach so thank you so much for serving there um you know i'm gonna um i think orianna's hand is on one other uh we got one other person that wants to speak and then if y'all wouldn't mind just if you got burning questions just hold them tight for one more moment okay apologies yes nikoi please thank you for that speaker yeah so tony griner who's also um a member of rcic has a couple of things that he'd like to share about his experience so tony the floor is yours welcome well hi everybody uh i've been a member of the committee for about a year and uh was recently retired and this was part of my what am i going to do with my life here's my chance to uh to contribute to the city which i've lived in for almost 30 years now uh i was really impressed with the i have been impressed with the intelligence the commitment of the committee members it's uh racially and age diverse as heron he said we're not so diverse in educational levels i think we're leaning towards people who have at least some college and we're maybe a little more middle class than working class but still it's a group of people that is committed to making the city a better place i don't think anyone's walking in there with with the idea of defending their turf it's it's all an idea of how do we make it better the city staff has done a really good job explaining city processes to us as best as best they can given the complexity of all of it and uh and that's really helped us too but uh that being said i'd like to say there's some we can work better together um well eli has said that uh the group has been treasured uh by your committee there's a big sense in our committee that that uh we're not being used to the full effectiveness of that we could be used um there might be a well let me just give an example in the the streetcar project that herity mentioned the montgomery park to hollywood extension uh there was a presentation to us uh where we were given the material that would be shown to the public on the two options going down sandy on the east side or broadway on the east side and uh what the committee members pointed out my committee pointed out was was that the streetcar is laden with with problems right we know it's slow we know it breaks down they don't collect the fares because the machines don't work we all know these problems and and the presentation that came to us was like wow the streetcar is just the best thing ever and which neighbor which which street is going to get it and and it just wreaked of dishonesty to tell you the truth that it sounded like the streetcar is just wow we're going to be fighting to have the streetcar come through our neighborhoods and uh and so we challenged that and said you know until the the public needs to know that the streetcar problems are going to be addressed before we start asking them for money and time and the hassle of expanding a construction project there and and so that was our feedback so a a while later uh the the public hearings started being held on this project and i went to one of them over at the place on mlk i can't remember the name of it now and uh while i was pleased to see that that the the statements that the streetcar is the best thing ever had largely disappeared there was still just which one do you want we're gonna build it does it go down sandy or does it go down broadway and and that still felt like no you're not addressing the problems anybody who's ridden the streetcar knows that it that we have problems there so in a way i felt like you know so what we what what did we accomplish here not not much there so i could go on about other examples about that but um it's it does seem like we could do better and uh you know katie and tom earlier today had talked about the importance of getting local people involved in the process well here we've got the citizens involvement committee where our emphasis is to get local people involved so uh nicoya is going to be talking more about uh our ask of you but uh i did i did want to point that out and give an example and there's there have been some other things that have come in i i got an email that i don't know why i got it but it was about my comments on proposed changes in the portland tree code and there's a survey you took a b c d answers and uh it wasn't written very well the the answers were often ones of uh you know like utah do you want to be executed by hanging or shooting it wasn't there wasn't like i don't want to be executed or i don't want this provision of the tree code if we had seen that earlier we could have pointed out these flaws but no it just comes out as a finished product and it's it's too late for us to do anything about it so with that in mind i'll be quiet now let nikoia come in thanks tony so y'all got to hear from a couple of our members a little bit you know a little bit of information about how the conversations go in our committee meetings um like i said diversity of experience diversity of opinion and perspectives which i think really makes our conversations really rich and makes our recommendations even that much more um representative i think of the things that will come up when these projects actually go out to the public um and so there's a couple of things that we need help with because we're giving these recommendations and for the most part our project planners have been really excited by them um and have really tried to use them to the best of their abilities to build their projects out in terms of the community engagement process thinking about what questions to ask um asking even more challenging questions about you know what our role looks like in the development of some of these projects and programs that kind of land in the bps ether but one of the things that we'd really like to ask from y'all as psc commissioners is that like i mentioned earlier your focus has really been a lot more on the technical aspects of the work and there are several of you actually in fact many of you that care very much about the community involvement and we know that your time is limited and that you want to engage in those conversations at a deep level and that there are other things that are kind of in your realm of responsibility to kind of ask our planners questions about and do a deep dive on and so what we would like to ask is that we would like to start to structure our recommendations in the form of either memos or letters so something very similar to like what you would send to city council after you've made a recommendation on a project so we'd like to start to structure our recommendations in that format and to be able to send those recommendations to you as a body before you see a project so that you can kind of have that level of guidance and information on the things that we've picked up on whether it was early on in the process or if we've seen it later in the process and have determined that maybe there were some steps missing in the community engagement process or maybe there were some questions or equity considerations that have gone unaddressed or unanswered we'd like for you to help us be another level of accountability for our planners and for our projects that come out of our bureau to ensure that everything that we're producing and everything that we're doing has that community-led kind of information attached to it and has that equity lens attached to it so that's the first ask that you would accept our recommendations and and actually take them seriously and consider them when you see a project and then the second ask would be that orianna magnera has very graciously offered to support us in um a liaison role so that she can keep us informed of the discussions that are happening here at psc on different projects and we'd like to ask you to in a more formal way recognize her as a psc to cic liaison so those are our two major asks for you today and so we can let you kind of digest that for a moment and if you have questions for myself or tony or haroni i think we have at least a couple of minutes for that if if y'all have space thank you nicoya i'm going to toss out one just clarifier on the first ask you have um is which i think you'd love to have your feedback would that be and presumably you would give feedback to staff before that as you're designing a community engagement process for a project and then we do be giving feedback to us at the time we're receiving the project so that we you we have your take on how well staff did and whether there's additional public involvement that maybe didn't happen as well and that we can try and um especially do special outreach to get that perspective in when it's in front of us am i interpreting that right yes that sounds right so as of right now we review a project sometimes in one meeting sometimes it takes two and then we have some discussion about it and we write up a memo or a letter that kind of captures elements and highlights from our discussion and recommendations and then that is sent to the project manager and then we move on to the next project so you would then get that letter or recommendation at the same time that we've sent it to the project manager okay thank you um so i'll open up the comments um orianna has put her virtual hand up [Music] excuse me i just want to say thank you to harini and tony for taking the time to talk to us today and for the service and good work you're doing you both brought up kind of a common theme that brings brings me to this question which is harney you mentioned that you felt like the cic was a space in which people took what you were saying into consideration and tony you felt like maybe that isn't something that's translating into the bureau or perhaps our body um and i'd like to ask of both of you how can we show you that we are hearing what you have said today that we are taking it into consideration and that we are taking it really really seriously i think i'd like to get that on the public record and make sure that as a liaison i can hold this body and the bureau more accountable to to making you feel heard and then a second piece of that is just how can we work with you in a way that we don't rely on you too much and that we we don't create like too much extra labor but make sure that we're hearing you and considering you but not leaning on you in a way that feels feels inappropriate or labor us well i'll weigh in with my two cents here uh on the uh how do you how do you uh recognize that you heard us so just send us a note send an email to uh nikoia say okay hey we heard this and uh we got your memo and we're gonna do x y or z or maybe say we can't do it because of whatever reason that happens sometimes um as far as workload we could use more work in my opinion uh i'm we we've kind of got to the stage of educating ourselves coming up with our process uh i wouldn't be worried about overburden us it's a pretty verbal group we'll we'll tell you if it's too much do you want to jump in i'm not sure if you're able to raise your hand so please no i was just going to ask that to show that um that we're being heard is as just giving your time time is really beneficial to show that someone is really interested in what you have to say so by speakers coming in and making time um after they just worked at nine to five to come meet us for a meeting at 7 p.m just shows that um that they're interested and actually wants to hear what we have to say and um also what tony said just like to follow up and just be thorough to finish what you started rather than just coming in and then i never see you ever again and yeah thank you so to your second request to have a representative from the psc um our process will be we're not all here right now so i'm gonna give everyone a chance to chime in with interest um and if it's okay just put it on our agenda for the next meeting to open to pick a representative but i'll ask first ariana are you your game to serve absolutely i i would be incredibly honored and can certainly commit to in that role um really checking in with the the committee on on projects that they've heard or even projects that they have haven't without you know providing too much labor but maybe adding adding a little bit to tony's point and then bringing that back and and reflecting that i personally like to see as a request for bps that as part of staff presentations there isn't there's staff is responsible and accountable for naming what is the feedback we receive from the community involvement committee how do we take it into account and then as the the representative on this body i can provide feedback of like well you know the cic didn't feel hurt in this way or felt like staff did incorporate that but that wasn't sufficient or just serve a role you know as a liaison to really listen in that space and and help provide that that feedback here and reflected in my vote as well i'll be frank that i think i would have a hard time voting uh in favor of projects that the the cic did not feel like had sufficiently um listen to their recommendations around community engagement and and would be pretty vocal in terms of whether that's something that has to go dragged to the drawing board or a project like the street car that has had problems on a number of levels really asking the question you know why is this coming before us if it's not really serving community well and i would say i'd be open to um our representative to the cic briefing the psc but also members of the cic could give us a little briefing during that time slot i think that'd be totally appropriate so um i'll end this agenda item thank you much maybe we'll see you again soon um and so i'm nikoia and terrain i might pronounce your name right okay and tony thank you very much thank you we've got two more agenda items and we already um previewed that we're going to cut them a little bit shorter than expected they know this um so first we're going to go to vision zero a briefing from matt kelly and dana dickman at peabot and after a 15 minute briefing we're going to be concise here so i might have to do some things follow up after meeting we'll switch over to earthquake ready burnside bridge so let's start off with vision zero matt and dana we're gonna be brief um i do have some slides to share so i don't know if someone can give me control or if someone wants to pull up the presentation should i do a shared screen or the other way i just paid i just made you a co-host so you should right i'm a little concerned about um my connection so when i do share are you seeing yes yes yes um when i do share this i may turn off my talking video um because i'm not sure that the connection's gonna hold for both things are you able to see that properly yep okay great thank you um so first i just want to say thanks for having us and how much i appreciate you taking the time to honor tony at the beginning of the meeting he is deeply missed and i just really appreciated hearing from some of you about how much he has missed on this committee and as a colleague as well i'm going to be very brief and give some updates on fatal crashes last year we had initially thought we were going to come closer to your end um but scheduling challenges and then some year-to-date crash information that's a little bit different because we're getting it from a different data source but just so you understand how the changes with the pandemic are affecting crashes and then our goal is to have a broader discussion that really touches on a lot of what you've already been discussing today with anti-displacement but i think probably what we'll just leave it with is some big questions that we're asking ourselves as a program in vision zero and then we can either have a follow-up or have opportunities to um talk later so just a reminder our goal is to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries but a safe system is how we get there i think we introduced the concept of a safe system in our last meeting it's really about overall systemic change culture change it's including vehicle change changes to the way we think about speed our roads and behaviors we are in the midst of an overall trend or we were at the end of 2019 where we were seeing vehicle miles traveled increasing all over the country and that was correlating pretty strongly with increased fatalities and serious injuries portland's trends were looking exactly like the national trends one of the things i want to call your attention to is that we do use like longer term five year and ten year crash data because in any given year we might have spikes related to the different modes one thing that we have seen consistently is that pedestrians are almost always year after year um disproportionately represented in our fatalities we have a lot of people that are killed walking on our streets we saw that particularly in 2017 and 2018 really high numbers of pedestrian fatalities the last two years 2019 and into 2020 we're seeing spikes in single vehicle crashes both um motor vehicle automobiles and motorcycles so it's been an interesting switch and we'll see that a little bit in this this shows five-year traffic death data ending with our worst year in multiple decades last year in 2019 but you'll be able to see with the colored bars that the pedestrians represent the black line are represented by the black line and you can see those numbers um are proportionately high but in the last couple of years well actually we don't have the 2020 data on here i'll show you that to you next that vehicle crash data is coming up really high and again this is a spike in mostly single vehicle crashes that are typically speed and impairment are primary causes of those crashes these are our year-to-date deaths through just last week you can see i'll show share the kind of covid data later but this is where we are to date again you can see those single vehicle crashes are you know pun intended sort of driving the numbers right now um i think one thing that is interesting about this is that we started the year trending similar to 2019 where our overall fatalities were quite high and then i'll show you some data where the crashes came down significantly and now as motor vehicle traffic is coming back up the crashes are coming back up as well so i just want to make sure we're clear that the data that i was showing you previously is crash data that we get from odot we get that usually about a year and a half after the the date or the year ends with the exception of fatalities this data the covid19 data that i'm going to share with you is actually injury data from fire and rescue so they are getting call outs um and reporting that it was a car crash and an injury-related crash so it's not comprehensive but it definitely shows us trends i just want to be clear that it's slightly different data sets so what you're looking at here is um an average five-year monthly basis um average and then a baseline trend and then the orange represents the crashes by month and so you can see we actually were trending slightly upward like we had been in 2019 and the early part of the year and then when we kind of get to that march and april piece where we got into kind of the lockdown around the pandemic crashes dipped precipitously in the city and that was overall crashes automobile auto pedestrian bike crashes this we did a little bit of further study these are the study areas that were used so when you see this data you'll understand that it's parsed out by these this is the same kind of look at the trend line but by those study areas again you can see that precipitous drop in about march or april with the exception of the northeast uh quadrant which was kind of on track to what it is for that monthly average um you'll also notice that as we got into may and june that in east portland and downtown and a little bit of a spike in southeast we start to see those injury crashes and call outs come back up pretty quickly i'll say that we don't have a ton of data on speeds but working with our partners at the police bureau and then just hearing from community members at the same time that we had traffic volumes going way down on some of our larger roadways we had speeds going way up we don't have a lot of monitors to do like a city-wide analysis the few that we had showed that those top end speeds did increase but just from community members and from police police were telling us on streets like mclaughlin bigger streets that were wide open it was common to see people going 20 and 30 miles per hour over the speed limit they were getting um people regular regularly going over 90 or 100 on the freeways and it was just like this sort of constant barrage and those that kind of mid-march to end of april some of that has come down but overall volumes have come up and speeds are still up in some areas of the city this just shows you another kind of look at these trend lines where you can see overall crashes are trending down for 2020 and part of the reason to share this with you all is just because we want to know what's happening during the pandemic but also because it connects so strongly to this discussion about land use and transportation connections and vmt when we see vmt up we also see crashes go up and when we see people driving less we tend to see the crashes come down now i'm going through this really quickly so um just so that you know a little bit more of some focused work that we were doing in 2019 i will say that for vision zero and the focus on our high crash network the pandemic hasn't dramatically changed a lot of our focus because the issues are still there we have in 2020 or in 2019 and in early 2020 been completing road reorganizations in east portland some clear examples are 102nd outer gleason there's another one in on southwest capital highway in southwest we completed our left turn traffic calming pilot which i believe we previewed here last year which was really focused on reducing pedestrian crashes at signalized intersections the early results show that it's really reducing speeds and helping to align drivers at those intersections so it's kind of moving beyond pilot to a practice that we are going to deploy throughout the city we have been actively doing speed limit reductions on all types of streets um throughout the city and working sort of towards an internal policy of no streets more than 30 miles per hour in the city there may be some exceptions with streets that have that are um kind of access blocked mclaughlin again might be another example we don't expect pedestrians on mclaughlin but the thinking behind it is really that um [Music] we have people walking biking taking transit driving on all of our corridors and if it is an urban street it shouldn't really be more than 30 miles per hour and in some cases much slower where we don't have separation for modes we are currently in the process of looking at a photo enforcement expansion for both intersection cameras and fixed speed cameras that conversation is definitely being part of a larger conversation about community safety and what role does enforcement play in vision zero there's a number of new and updated crossings particular of particularly have high crash corridors and then we're focusing a lot on street lighting and fill you may have seen in the bureau's budget we asked for a significant portion of money to be brought over from an led conversion savings into a lighting infill project and that is specifically to support high crash corridors in east portland and address streets that currently have single-sided lighting so that will start imminently and is expected to take about three years i believe peaches and winfield sent some additional updates about the heavy truck side guard so i won't go into that but those projects both internally and through [Music] the bureau of sustainability has have been moving forward it's big picture takeaways for us currently that as a city and this is true around the us we need to continue to work towards protecting pedestrians in portland speeds continue to be a serious safety risk we've seen them increase and we see and still in a significant portion of our crashes that speeds are a primary contributing factor they're certainly a contributing factor to the severity but whether or not the crash happens at all and also in vision zero um that we have these broader public health issues that are really interconnected with what's happening out in the right of way we specifically want to mention houselessness early in 2020 we had two fatalities where people sleeping because they were unhoused were killed on sidewalks and just the recognition that people are out and exposed to um traffic and what like the extra level of exposure that um our houseless neighbors have is a significant issue it's a public health issue that we're grappling with in vision zero in addition issues around hate speech in the right of way people being targeted people not being yielded to issues around racism and hate in the right of way are omnipresent in our discussions around how to support street safety and then on kind of this safe vehicles issue that vehicles in general have gotten significantly bigger over the last decade and there is evidence to suggest that it is contributing to greater injury and risk and we're certainly seeing that it is um inhibiting people's visibility of pedestrians so those are just some like big picture takeaways from the work that we've been doing over the last year this i just wanted to share but really i'm just going to go on to the next slide because what we're recognizing is that as we're doing the safe systems work around traffic safety that all of the issues around displacement housing systemic racism we can't build the safe system structure and focus it alone on traffic safety this is so much the conversation that you were having earlier the questions that we've outlined here are because we know specifically that in east portland almost every single one of the major roadways needs significant investment in order to be a safer street to be the the streets that people deserve and we know that that level of investment could trigger additional displacement we know that the disparities that exist in sidewalk infrastructure and access to schools that's already there that's part of the legacy of systemic racism means that that's the place that we need to invest more but it is a challenge for our program because we want to act quickly we know people are literally dying on the streets but we also don't want to create undue harm so these bigger picture questions for us are like how do we move quickly and with urgency without exacerbating you know that sense of urgency is kind of a one of the pillars of upholding white supremacy and and so those dominant structures so how do we move quickly while having inclusive engagement while making sure that our investments are not exacerbating the housing crisis while making sure that we are being more interdisciplinary as we're thinking about investments in parks and transportation and housing some of the examples here of the cic like pibot doesn't typically may be on street car but we don't typically engage with your cic and on land use decisions you don't typically engage with pbots committees and so how are we how are we thinking more intersectionally about this work because we know like uh ethically we're not going to not build sidewalks and improve safety in east portland we're not going to back away from those safety investments but we also um are fully aware of the challenges that that level of investment might create so how are we working together um to mitigate that and to be more proactive in it i know we're basically done i just want to frame up one um other big issue that we're really grappling with and that's really expanding our definition of what traffic safety means and what it means to deliver on a safe system and this includes really thinking about people's personal safety and their experience in the right of as a bureau we think a lot about the travel choices that people can make and right now community members bipac community members are making travel choices not based on just things like how much it costs to trade transit but on whether or not they're going to be harassed or assaulted in the street whether or not they feel like their you know teenage daughter can go on the max and make it home alive and so we are talking as a bureau about how those kind of deeper issues about personal safety need to be part of how we think about engineering and design more fully um traditional traffic safety has really focused on crashes and we're really moving to a broader definition of delivering on safety for people using the right-of-way thank you so much thank you so much yeah and i appreciate you um stuck with us for this and i know you're ready can you perhaps minimize your relinquish the screen yeah there we go give me some reverb from someone dana you need to mute as well okay maybe that'll solve it back to my sound engineering days thank you so i'm seeing chris's hand up i think i'm going to ask chris to share your thoughts your question and maybe one more and ask if we can just all say an extra five minutes on this once we have at least 15 minutes for the next presentation so let me know if that's a problem but i'm gonna um hand the baton to chris uh thank you um i want to express my appreciation uh for the presentation this year uh as every year the efforts in peabody provision zero uh i also want to note the increased focus focus on the racism aspects this year versus past years and i'm glad we're trending in that direction and then finally i'm going to briefly plug a book there is a book coming out later this month called right-of-way race class of the silent epidemic of pedestrian deaths in america it's by angie schmidt who delivered the niles lecture here in portland last year so i would encourage people who want to really focus in on what's happening with pedestrians to pick up a copy of that thanks thanks chris can you send that out to the psc for those sure thanks steph sorry thank you very quickly um thank you dana for that presentation um i'm really excited about the um the methodology of and the implementation of ped pdx um which uh got uh updated after 30 years of us not having an updated pedestrian master plan so and i know you're not supposed to have favorites uh but the street infill lighting is uh the importance can't be overstated and um particularly you know having come from the the walking wall black focus group and and we've you know the idea of perceived safety and as as i also appreciate you um highlighting some um real tensions as as former executive director of oregon walks we had a lot of um conversations intention of like walkability but walkability for for whom and for how long and at what cost so um uh i'm looking forward to that i have a lot of other a few i will leave it there okay well thank you and it went hours too yeah um so thank you so much dana for joining us and um and for pse members who have questions please send dana an email i think that's all right can you not if that's all right okay we just lost you okay thank you so much um okay i'm now going to switch over to our last item which is the earthquake ready burnside bridge when we have large projects being proposed in portland we we usually take a look at them and this is one so patrick sweeney from the city of portland will be presenting along with megan neal from the county so i'm not sure who's going to go first but i'll ask you to start off all right hey thanks eli this is patrick sweeney with uh peabot good afternoon it's all planning sustainability commissioners uh again my name is patrick sweeney i'm a capital project manager for pbot and the city project manager for the earthquake ready birth side bridge project i wanted to let you know i'm working really closely with rachel hoy and bureau planning staff as well as my colleagues in parks bds bes and other bureaus to make sure the current environmental planning process not only identifies and mitigates project impacts but broadly seizes the opportunity a new improved central city bridge connection can provide for all users in the decades to come as i'm sure you all know multnomah county owns and operates the burnside bridge and megan neal is here to introduce her project team and share more information about this exciting project thank you thank you patrick and thank you for the opportunity to come back to this group i believe the last time we came and break this group was september of last year so i'm excited to come back and provide a project update most specifically about some recent recommendations that have come out of our community task force which met in june they made a recommendation on the preferred alternative for the project to be included in the draft environmental impact statement as well as how we will manage traffic during constructions so i just wanted to touch on those two recommendations today and then answer any questions you may have and um i'll try to make it quick i know where i want to respect your agenda's time so hopefully you can see um my screen um just wanted to uh briefly remind the group the purpose of the county's project which we call earthquake ready burnside bridge as you may know many of our downtown bridges would not stand if we had a major cascadia subduction zone earthquake tomorrow so the county feels it's important that at least we have one downtown bridge that can be immediately operable for all users and right after an earthquake it would help allow emergency responders across the river and serve people allow family and friends to reconnect um and cross the river and then um also in the years after the major earthquake as our community rebuilds we feel like having a link across the river is important for our economy and then finally this bridge has served our community for nearly a hundred years however it is uh crumbling and weight restricted and we really would like to extend the service life life of this crossing for another hundred years so we're looking for a long-term crossing to serve our community and all users um that is easier to maintain than what we have today a brief touch about our overall project timeline we are halfway through the environmental review phase that green bar in the top left there we anticipate publishing our draft environmental impact statement in january of 2021 and then following up with our final environmental impact statement com combined with a record of decision in late fall of 2021. so we are currently funded through the design phase with the county's existing registration fee vehicle registration fee we just recently raised it this past fall specifically for this project however that does not get us uh all the way there in terms of construction funding we are very grateful to be considered as a project that's as part of the upcoming get moving 2020 bond measure should that measure be successful that would secure another 150 million dollars for the construction phase we are still working on looking for additional funding at the state regional and federal level as i mentioned we came back we um briefed this group in september since then we have eliminated the fixed bridge from further consideration as part of the environmental impact statement after we did a preliminary navigational study to determine what height the fixed bridge needed to be to allow all ships to pass underneath it it just turned out to be very expensive and had a lot of impacts to the community and the urban streetscape and then it was also just hard to access um compared to today given how far it would reach into either sides of the bridge so that is no longer being considered um and so we have been working with evaluating the remaining four build alternatives as part of the environmental impact statement so as i mentioned our community task force has made two recommendations regarding the preferred alternative recently so that first one is the recommended build preferred alternative so up on the screen is a conceptual example of what we are calling the replacement long span alternative and what this alternative is is it replaces the existing burnside bridge with a new movable bridge in the same alignment with the same landing points however with far fewer columns underneath the structure resulting in longer distances between the supporting columns and so that's why we call it the long span alternative and um we are going through a bridge type selection study starting this fall to really determine what type of movable bridge the alternative should be as well as what type of fixed spans adjacent to the movable bridge span um the structure should be and we we plan to incorporate this information into the preferred alternative that will be included in the final environmental impact statement and now this is not typical of a nepa process however because we are working the nepa process under a new um executive order that streams lot streamlines the need for process we need to make these decisions now in order to comply with the [Music] faster federal permitting timeline as required in the new executive order so we um we'll be exploring a variety of mobile bridge types like the vertical lift bridge type you see on the screen as well as a vascular lift type similar to what is out there today and then for the spans adjacent to the movable bridge uh we have up on the screen the tight arch structure type similar to the fremont bridge we will also be exploring the cable state option um like the telecom crossing as well as a through truss option similar to hawthorne or the broadway bridge so there's a couple of reasons why having less columns underneath the bridge and there's a couple reasons why having less columns underneath the bridge has led to this alternative being preferred by the community task force so up on the screen you see a photo of the site and in light orange um you see areas of either side of the river that have highly liquefiable soils and it might be hard to see but in dark orange we are showing the proposed location of the support columns and as you can see on the east side of the river we really don't have many columns in that highly liquefiable soil and the benefits of this decision um there are several so first of all it's really good in terms of seismic resiliency so the less foundations you have in this um soft movable soil the higher likelihood that the bridge will perform well after a major earthquake and then this alternative ended up being the least cost overall simply because working in the ground and having a lot of foundations is very expensive and risky which adds up to a lot of costs during construction another benefit of this alternative is that it will preserve the burnside skatepark um in its current uh configuration uh simply just experiencing short-term closures during construction so this is um instead of demolishing it or um partially altering it so that's a another positive aspect of this alternative this also removes a lot of the columns that are currently in tomoko park so it really opens up that space for a more variety of uses with um better views and then um because we are place replacing the existing bridge with a new bridge we have an opportunity to add additional width within our existing easement that we already have so the new alternative will add approximately 10 or so feet on either side of the typical section and this would allow us to bring the bike lanes and sidewalks up to current city cone and even provide a physical protective barrier of some sort between vehicular traffic as well between a vehicular traffic and the cyclists so improve safety for bikes pedestrians and ada users and then finally with less structure in the river this alternative has the least impacts to natural resources so those are some benefits that come with this alternative however there are some serious impacts which number one it removes a structure that's on the national historic register the burnside bridge so we are um understanding how to [Music] address that if this alternative moves forward and then um something that we're also considering and it's a concern we're hearing from the community task force is that because we have less structure under the deck this means a lot more structure needs to be above the deck and this significantly impacts the current views that are there today so we are exploring that further in our bridge type selection uh phase that we'll be starting shortly now the second recommendation that's coming out of our community task force is what to do with traffic during construction and we evaluated uh having a temporary movable bridge on site as well as closing the bridge completely to all users during construction so we worked with the community task force to evaluate both alternatives and they are recommending to fully close the bridge during construction this would um some of the reasons why this decision has been recommended is that a temporary removal bridge would cost about 90 million dollars and then an additional one and a half to two years to the overall project duration and then also it will require additional structure in the river which um increases the impact to natural resources for so for these reasons this is the recommendation that the community task force arrived at so right now we are currently in a strong public outreach campaign we released an online open house on august 3rd we've been doing um over 50 briefings about these two recommendations to get input and feedback and hear what the broader public thinks about these recommendations um during covet we um rather because during because it's coveted um is upon us instead of doing actual bridge tours we have a bridge tour video as well to orient people to the site as well as animations representing the two recommendations and why they are being recommended and then we also have a robust community engagement liaison program to do outreach in the non-english speaking community i think we are doing outreach in seven languages so far a couple of um a couple of key topics i wanted to touch on in regards to how our product is addressing or incorporating diversity and equity inclusion we in addition to the community engagement liaison program we also are have been working for four or five years with the social service community on the west end of the bridge we've been working hard to understand what the impacts are to of this project how to avoid certain impacts and mitigate others so they are um [Music] they're a group that we are very concerned about about this project and um we meet with them frequently and to as we as we progress through the project one thing that's not mentioned on this slide is that as the project moves forward should we have should we be successful with our funding strategy for construction we will we will have a community benefits agreement largely based on the agreement that we had for the multnomah county courthouse as well as well as well as have a supplier diversity program and workforce equity program as well as part of our construction phase another couple highlights i wanted to share is that we are looking to certify this projects this project through the green roads certification program at the gold level green roads is like lead but um for buildings but it's for infrastructure so we are starting that process now in terms of community health we are working with multnomah county health department to perform a health impact assessment um to determine what the impacts of this project are on people during construction as well as permanent impacts and then finally i wanted to highlight that we are closely coordinating with the city on a variety of levels with this project um including we are starting the early assistance permitting process as well as the land use process and then coordinating on a variety of other topics like potential mitigation and utilities so um just to wrap up uh what to expect from our project over the coming six months um we will be after our august outreach closes we will bring we will bring the feedback and input that we've received back to the community task force to see if they'd like to modify or continue with the same recommendation for a preferred alternative that recommendation will go to the policy group in october and they will in like endorse or comment on the recommended preferred alternative we will also in october kick off the bridge type selection phase and um then as i mentioned in january we will publish our draft environmental impact statement and have about a 60-day comment period either during that period or right after we'll probably come back to this group to provide a briefing then um in may we will wrap up the bridge type selection phase and incorporate the outcome of that study into the preferred alternative and then publish the final environmental impact statement and record of decision in late 2021 so that is the um that is information we wanted to share with you today and i'm happy to open the floor to questions um i have several members from the project team here to help with any technical questions you
