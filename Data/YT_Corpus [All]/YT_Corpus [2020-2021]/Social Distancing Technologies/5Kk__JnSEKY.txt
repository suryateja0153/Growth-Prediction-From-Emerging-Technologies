 what if social distancing was not something we had to do but the start of something revolutionary and new long before the pandemic there was a trend that started in South Korea the marketers called it untapped their vision was a world in which all your goods and services could be delivered autonomously without people having to interact the idea was especially popular with younger consumers and generation Z awkward in social circumstances more familiar with smartphones than TV so now there are coffee shops where robots can brew 90 cups of coffee per hour and gene stores that are open 24/7 without a human in sight augmented reality Beauty bars where an AI can offer you advice automated convenience stores and the contactless ordering of noodles and rice and supermarkets where your choice of basket color indicates whether people should talk to you or not when Cova 19 arrived South Korea was in a way already prepared with far more automation than most countries would have dared South Korea's robot density is now the second highest in the world with 774 robots to 10,000 human employees and untappd is now part of the government's official response to the disease their plan is a 62 billion-dollar New Deal that incorporates high speed broadband robots remote work and drones will it be a high tech heaven or a sad inferno of digital addiction and being alone over nineteen let us experience what a socially distance world might be with digital interactions automation and home delivery but self career is just one glimpse of what the post pandemic world might become they aren't the only country dreaming of being robot run in China there are robot restaurants automated retailers and AI hotels while in America there is Amazon go food delivery robots and parcel delivery by drone could you imagine living and working your whole life without leaving your home the untapped revolution is bigger than just being left alone and doing everything from your phone it's about creating an operating system for daily life that can anticipate your needs and save you a lot of strife but there's still a number of things that we need to think about if this is going to be a blueprint for the world that is to come number one use online to offline to accelerate innovation online to offline came from China where they simply call it Oh - OH the idea is that the relationship between the digital and the real world is one of two way flow in China anything you need or want can be organized from your phone with just a tap ride-sharing travel haircuts massage dry-cleaning financial services it's all there on the way Shin app the Chinese know that the more of the world that can be digitally coordinated and booked the richer the data that can train algorithms to keep us engaged and hooked number two know the difference between delivery and service part of getting contactless right is knowing that there's a difference between delivery and service or fulfillment and a light delivery is getting something done service is doing it great sometimes done is enough a quick bowl of noodles paying a friend getting crosstown service is when you want something more an amazing experience a new insight or a welcome surprise when you're feeling down delivery is best automated for repetitive tasks that don't require people much service is best when it's tailored for experiences that demand a human touch number three keep the world at human scale there's a risk in a world of machines that we design solutions that are no longer at human scale but just because something is contactless doesn't mean it has to be an automation help an AI Hotel might not need a physical check it but a great concierge should never be more than a video call away a robot barista may make the perfect cup of coffee without making you cute but a cafe can still be a great place for human interaction and conversation too you can use AI and a contact center to fix customer problems and disputes but still have human beings armed with insights to solve the ones that don't compute as strange as it may seem designing your business to work without human contact may actually be a path to greater human intimacy what if by eliminating the frustrations and frictions of getting things done we could actually find a path to delivering great experiences for everyone [Music]
