 - We are living in unprecedented times. There's a lot of fear and uncertainty about the future. The economy is taking a hit, businesses will struggle, and many are facing concerns around job security and paying the bills, but we cannot live in fear. We must approach this storm with compassion and kindness. We all have family and loved ones at risk. We must now discover creative ways of coming together. We are blessed to live in an age with numerous communication technologies. Pick up the phone and call a loved one or friend, offer to help others who are in need, and spend some time on Skype, FaceTime, or Messenger with loved ones. Whatever we do, we cannot allow social distancing to become emotional isolationism. We must practice patience, trust, and care for one another. More importantly, our community needs to set the standard for how we approach the months ahead. We each have a role to play in all this. This is Kevin Heinbuch with The Kevin Heinbuch Team at WHY USA Eastern Iowa Realty. Live and love fully.
