 okay great so we're live and then when we get to QA it's up to you we can do you want to stop sharing the screen um up to you whatever you do it might feel more interactive if we stop sharing the screen yeah okay I see the button to stop sharing okay it's great you'd also be talking about working from home when everyone's working from home a new reality for everyone yeah I I'm so excited to hear what you have to say about if it's here to stay and stuff because I've been hearing so much for both sides yeah I'll say some things but there's no ways and now yeah no totally I know my brother he lives in Vermont but he works in Boston so like what he did was he would just come stamp my parents house two days a week but now they've moved everything um remote and I think he's just gonna plan on just living there now which is awesome if they keep it going after right yeah okay I think we can start now hello everyone and welcome back to our webinar series which occurs here on our Facebook page every Friday at noon live today we have with us John's Leeson who is the director of future mobility planning at resource systems group in Burlington Vermont John provides professional engineering and planning consulting services to public and private clients focused on the emerging big issues in transportation his interest is on how we can leverage emerging technologies to improve our world with a growing population funding challenges aging infrastructure and the changing climate all while creating thriving and desirable places for us to live work and play today Jon will share with us the latest research on trends in telecommuting and on whether some part of it is here to stay and what impacts it could have on our transportation system so I'm going to pass it on to John now if you have any questions during John's presentation feel free to post them in the comments section and after he's done speaking we can go over the questions John thank you so much for being here great Thank You Brianna thank you everyone and so now that planning role suddenly means how to help communities and agencies plan responses around this unfortunate pandemic it's we'll be discussing some of the effects of the pandemic on transportation as well as in a conversation on the on the telecommuting or working from home and you can see I'm working from home today today I think as of this morning or yesterday excuse me there was a 1.5 million cases of the kovat disease and the u.s. is now the global epicenter of cases something around 460 thousand cases as the latest that I've kept track it has profound effects on our transportation system and social distancing that we call it our physical isolation has taken different forms in different places today there's a picture in front of you that shows the Rome the Spanish Steps in Rome and I remember being at this particular location and being overwhelmed with people and now you can see the stark reality that we have in front of us however there are some silver linings and benefits to the fact of reduced mobility and reduced travel is that this is an example just from the San Francisco Bay Area and there's numerous photos online of now the Himalayas become visible from parts of India that they haven't seen it for over 30 years and in this case we're seeing parts per million of co2 levels drop I don't know what percentage that was about 60 parts per million there in just a few weeks with a significant decline in traffic but there's a difficult reality to all this is that we have significant challenge or and I put quotes for Main Street for those of you in the Burlington area you'll recognize this street as our core shopping district as Church Street and it's obvious the lack of commercial activity socialization the restaurants everything is completely shut down to maintain the necessary social distancing that we need to fight off this horrible pandemic but the other reality is that offices are empty we have significant amounts of office space across the country that now are sitting empty and people are trying to figure out what to do and where are we going to go from here so that's gonna be the topic that we have some interesting data points to discuss today and I will say first and foremost I don't have the answers but I have some data points then in some ways that we can explore this and it'd be great to hear your feedback at the end of this to understand whether you think it's here to stay and what effect it might have on your industry as you as we have this Facebook live event we have this dramatic shift online platforms across the world people are experiencing new ways to interact and be social with each other through isolation other ways our life has dramatically changed in the last few weeks in New Hampshire Tollway traffic is down over 50% in just the last four weeks the airline industry has had significant changes in their demand down 95% in just over the last year our overall use of electricity is down which again has maybe some positive benefits not so much in New England because of our hydro demands but in other parts of the country you can imagine the climate benefits the oil prices now albeit OPEC I believe just was recently cutting back production again but the oil prices are at their lowest level in 18 years again though with a lack of demand for travel and this is recent news as of yesterday with 16.8 total unemployment claims in just the last few weeks few businesses are immune from this shock and it's estimated that the unemployment rate now is approaching 20 percent as a just a point of reference in 1933 we had a maximum unemployment rate of 24% in the the height of the Great Depression so we realized that economic activity is unfortunately it's linked to a lot of the ways we use mobility Google's coming to the fore with some recent data that's showing us how we're affected this is a u.s. country wide perspective transit stations are down 51% according to Google in this data work places alone are down nearly forty percent and by presidential travel and points have travel around the home about twelve percent so we still are requiring mobility we're out there doing our essential services doing our grocery shopping home repairs are up and so other other activities are happening google has a data point for Vermont as well and you can see our change in transit is down seventy one percent and our workplace is a little lower than the US just over forty percent and then the residential is near the same now this is another data point from unicast it's a big data passive data provider and aggregator they're using cell phones and every cell phone has a unique trace that these companies are able to aggregate so much like Google had this one this website provides a assessment of how your mobility has changed relative to your previous average the pre kovat situation and it also links it shows you on the next chart I'll show you is that the correlation with the kovat epidemic pandemic and so Vermont actually gets a grade A we're doing a great job in terms of the way that we're socially distancing ourselves that we have had over a 70% reduction in our non-essential travel and we know that it's had profound effects so that's what some of the other earlier data and the economic data we realized that that that this does have a negative impact on many parts of our communities but hopefully it means that Vermont can can prevail and move quicker through this pandemic situation and so this chart actually goes county by county and you can see that other parts of Vermont are supposedly doing better in terms of reducing their non-essential travel but Chinon County I think with their Hospital and the and the just the population that we have we have a little bit less ability to reduce that net travel and then just on this chart as I reference that we reference the COBIT cases on a daily basis on this chart and this website that's linked on the PDA on the PowerPoint you can visit after this presentation and you can explore state-by-state county by county and it does show that social distancing really does matter for the health of our community now public transit I'm not going to spend much time on public transit because I know that I believe Steve infallible is going to be speaking to you in another couple weeks and public transit has has a real difficulty right now we are seeing overall demand of down nearly eighty percent in travel and while that's good for social distancing and the health of our pandemic it is a real struggle for our agencies and I don't have the Vermont GMT data but I hope that maybe Steven might bring that to you all and transit for instance is just an application that they track worldwide transit and if you go to this website you can go to specific agencies all around the world and see how they've been affected by the pandemic now shifting into the online interaction we've seen that us remote work has gone up two to three times in just over two months zoom a common platform that's been used widely has seen daily average users increase from 10 million up to 200 million in just the last three weeks and then Microsoft through their team's program that's been their primary online interaction tool has seen daily record of meeting minutes so we go from 2.7 billion meeting it's in a single day and that's up again two-hundred percent from 900 million meeting meeting minutes in mid-march so people are overwhelmingly shifting to the online platforms another data point here is somewhat similar is that it again shows an increase of those using the Virtual Private Network the VPNs to connect to your systems remotely this shows the dramatic increase as the shutdowns start to occur people shifted to their BP ends this website tracks dates over time and there was a long term average of approximately 27% and then these Peaks before were holidays when people would would work from home on these government holidays but now you can see that we're up closer to 64% of people registering their VPNs working from home you can see how the points are starting to combine and call us around this number around 60 percent or so this is a poll recently released from Gallup that they have now estimated that about 62% of US workers are working remotely to some degree and this is the end of March early April timeframe and you can see the dramatic increase from just the mid March so we're just talking about just the latter half of the most recent month and the dramatic increase in working remotely so the question is are we changing our behaviors working remotely requires new behaviors to be learned talking like we are today is a challenge for many of us we're not used to this way to engagement we like I like being in front of people face to face and we're doing the best we can but we're also seeing that other behaviors are changing in this way Microsoft has released some data that they're trying to understand how the actual behaviors of meetings are changing and in this case they're saying that their product of teams is saying they're using it longer during the day and they say they may not necessarily mean people are working longer but that their people are breaking up the day they're taking more productivity breaks more flexibility it allows them to do the other obligations that they have within their day I think that's a really powerful benefit of working from home and others recognize that as well Jarrid have from microsoft mentions that the simplest example of how meeting have changed is that the chat function now where before those people on the remote end of any meeting there's always the people on the telephone you're Scratchy and you're saying what can you what are you saying can you speak up now with the online platforms and the video calls we're all at equals and we realize that it's video it's audio it's been also chatting everything has to be incorporated and then we ourselves are changing our behaviors to become more multimodal in the way that we treat our meetings and so this will be it will change the way that co-working happens it will change the way that - it will change the way that working happens and so that we will be looking at how to engage more online more interactively although remotely and this might then have profound ramifications for how do we facilitate public meetings how do we do other things in this new context so now jumping into is this behavior going to stick how is it going to change us these experiences will guide our expectations this is from a Politico magazine where they discussed big thinkers and this editor mentioned that not every job can be done remotely but people are learning and that difference is and they're realizing that now just with the ability to download an application and in the past it was permission from their bosses but now it's being forced upon them that they realize that how seamless this can be we realize now that Allah awful lot of meetings potentially doctor's appointments and classes can really be done remotely or in this case referenced by an email she said and now we realized that it can be this is going to be a bottom-up explosion and demand for this increased flexibility an example that there's not many that we can draw up on but there was a study in 2017 by Oxford economists that just pointed out that a simple two day London tube strike so we're already in a shutdown for I don't know how many weeks about a month in in Vermont and 5% of London commuters permanently switched their travel behavior after that to date to day strike you can only imagine what percentage might be here as we've been forced to explore other options and so the authors of that study posited that changing routes for those few days of disruption gave enough confidence that these new that these commuters found other desirable options so rsg expects that some degree a permanent shift will result from the köppen pandemic so a few more reasons for you unfortunately we're in this for the long haul this is a study from the Imperial College of Medicine in the UK and I've seen this discuss in many other literature's and online journals at this point but this is what chart that they put together in this research and what this chart shows is that we're going to have these periodic waves of infection that will affect our communities and what's going to happen is that we will have intermediate social distancing triggered by trends in the in the disease so that we can temporary relax and visit with each other maintain face-to-face communications but then we need have a plan put in place for when we need to introduce social distancing again there will be a new normal as of this China is our leading example of a country that's past the peak of new and actions for this initial wave Microsoft is still new team users everyday in the country compared to the end of January however it's still documented that travel restrictions are still in place they have temperature checks throughout their cities and their strict quarantine even those for returning travelers within their own country Singapore has implemented a circuit breaker circuit breaker model where they have now a defined set of responses so that if the wave of infection were to approach again they immediately can implement the circuit breaker and they are using testing to identify where workers and where students must be sent home if there's an outbreak in a certain part of the city and everyone is rethinking remote work the CBRE large industry company that owns and maintains massive amounts of commercial real estate they do research on this and this is a recent quote that remote work is something they're thinking a lot about and people are being forced to do it but we will think that some will in heaven please stick their question is for how many and for how long and that is the question for all of us but they're concerned about who needs office space in addition to the countless small retail and restaurant businesses that are unfortunately going to be permanently vacated after this economic situation there's going to be a growing number of corporate chains that may have more cash flow they're also beginning or unwilling to pay their rent as of today staples subway and madness mattress firm have also have all stopped paying the rent we work the massive co-working office space has stopped paying rent at some of their us locations and these are just the big firms you can let alone the smaller organizations that are that are going to rethink do we need to have that extra overhead and office space to bring us all together and maybe the answer is yes but it may a little smaller so what does this tell it working looking like the preak Ovid worked from home percentage Vermonter actually had a pretty high percentage of our working from home depending on which survey and how many years you're going back to Vermont was somewhere around six point five to about seven point four percent of your working from home percentage according to the American Community Survey some other data points here just throwing attaches that their global workplace analytics they're an organization that study working from home globally they estimated that this is pre COBIT estimate that fifty six percent of the u.s. workforce holds a job that could be compatible at least partially with remote work Gallup shows that forty three percent of the workforce works at home already at least some of the time and then according to the BLS the Bureau of Labor Statistics about sixteen percent of the workforce already work remotely as well so galloped recently did a poll for this Kovach situation as they said once restrictions on business and schools are lifted if your employer left it up to you what would you prefer to do fifty nine percent say they want to work remotely as much as possible forty-one percent said going back to the office as much as you previously did they made a pretty stark choice in this case and we know there's a lot of nuances but if fifty nine percent of people said we want to work from motely as much as possible and given the other benefits that we've discussed it's clear that we're gonna see some changes so to summarize why is this going to stick there's fears of poor work outcomes among managers and executives that are not coming to fruition for years people were not allowed to work remotely there either wasn't enough trust or just lack of experience with the technology or um just yeah I guess inexperience with with the experience to do that they are gonna see increased demand from employees for the reasons that we've just discussed now for this kovat situation it's apparent that there's going to be increased pressure for disaster preparedness we have a more resilient workforce if we can have more flexibility about where and when do we work there's the increased awareness of the cost savings opportunities from the organization's point of view let alone the individual if I'm not commuting and spending money on my commute my money will be spent elsewhere there's also the increased awareness of the potential impact on sustainability I mentioned the co2 impact and then let alone there's some other pollution impacts that are clear that if we reduce our travel the global workplace analytics that I mentioned before estimated that post COBIT they would see between 25 and 30 percent of the workforce working at home one or more days a week compare that to the 7% or so today in Vermont so this is a very approximate rough estimate and I'm sharing the assumptions here on this chart but this is work that I did - this is work that actually has done a long time ago that I've I've refreshed for this purpose today looking at what types of industries these are our 2017 jobs in Vermont by employment sector the big unknown is the economic shock that this is going to cause and we don't know which jobs are gonna shift that's one of the first unknowns here the second unknown is trying to estimate what types of jobs would be suitable to a remote working condition and certain industries are more flexible than others however even really manufacturing heavy involved personnel might have administrative jobs that they can move off-site so let alone I think every industry has an opportunity and that's where this chart shows for instance how forestry fishing and related activities I said maybe 20% of the staff could be remote maybe it'll oh you have 5% so by looking at that probabilities and the number of jobs I estimated that if there's a low uptake in remote workforce it might be 9% post kovat and then at a medium uptake it's closer to that to the other estimate that was put together around the 22% and then maybe based on our mix of jobs in this again this is pre Cova job mix maybe a high uptake of around 37% would be suitable for a work remote workforce so how much impact do we have here we realize though the work from home is only one part of the travel equation if we're concerned about vehicle miles traveled greenhouse gas emissions we have to realize that we still have mobility needs for essential trips if we're happen to be in a social lockdown situation or if we are not in a lockdown situation we're gonna go and do these personal trips the grocery stores the shopping the doctors the recreation and we realize that those trips actually meet 70% of our travel demand so we're still even if we work from home it's only going to be a fraction of our total miles that we could be reducing but we also see that the post pandemic some jobs and sectors might shift we the economic impact will be will be shifting this chart here in the bottom left just is a recent research from this RBC research organization that shows as of March because of the pandemic we actually now have a majority of people who have now purchased groceries online for the first time I have a situation with little kids at home and I can see the benefit of this so I think there's gonna be new people trying new things and some of those behaviors might stick so what where world look like but even more important what do we want our world to look like in a post pandemic situation a quick introduction to rsg and what we what we do professionally rsg is a firm over a hundred professional staff across eight offices across the country we are over 30 years in business founded in 1986 and our core markets and transportation namely behavior and forecasting we have these three categories of capabilities we have choice modeling travel forecasting and planning and these things are being brought to bear now as to forecasting what this kovat situation might might unfold for us in the choice modelling we understand what people are willing to pay what people demand and what types of in future scenarios in travel forecasting then we build the model to then say how are those choices going to manifest into a future situation when faced with all these other changes be it different land uses being different demographics and then planning puts them together planning is building a shared vision with different stakeholders and saying how would you want your world to look let's find the way to back cast and get there so the four things that are she is now doing is that we are quickly deploying surveys or targeted response monitoring we're doing observed cell phone response monitoring through smart phone and surveys and then doing scenario planning with clients and a quick summary of these is that we have some certain clients now that are that are asking for us to set up web-based panel surveys to track people's behaviors now and and then over the next few months as this pandemic hopefully moves out we'll be setting up questionnaires incorporating mapping and other child behavior suits Suites and then the big data passive data side is that this is a situation the data here shows Grand Central Terminal in New York City we're trying to track how many unique cell phone pings were being observed and we can do a day-by-day analysis and start to tell communities how their behavior and social distancing is actually happening and whether certain responses can be influenced happen tomorrow if we removed our stay at home order we can start tracking these with these cell phone products Archie also has a GPS phone based survey and we people can download this onto their phone you have full permission and you would be taking surveys to say why did you travel who travelled what precautions we're having interest from communities that are looking to verify that certain certain businesses and certain individuals are experiencing things the correct way and this kovat pandemic meaning we have a community in in the southern US that they need verification to say that our business is actually behaving appropriately in this COBIT so they want to get a bunch of people to take this survey go about their business and saying did you see hand-washing did you see disinfecting sprays did you see people wearing masks and you get this social surveying type of buy-in and so we're getting this type of information out there to our to our clients and then lastly what excites me the most is building the what-if scenarios is that if we can identify the goals and visions of what should be achieved in the future and identify the metrics to say are we achieving those then we can develop models and the type of model that I use is called a strategic model where we can test hundreds of combinations of various inputs and vary them to small degrees and so you can have hundreds of combinations being tested and we can start to evaluate what would happen with more people working from home and then you say how would it shift our employee makeup and then what happens if we put the rest of the people who are not working from home in high-capacity transit you can start to see the system and understand how much vehicle miles traveled might be impacted by these by these situations and then we also evaluate the effects of technologies and other external drivers on on behavior change so I've covered a lot and I really look forward to your questions and I hope that it covered telecommuting appropriately but also gave you an insight into some of the other travel pieces and and complexities of this horrible and so thank you very much and I'll turn it over to you Briana thank you so much Jonathan we have a few questions do you want to stop sharing your screen so we can perfect okay so the first question is are you concerned that after Kovan 19 public transit will not bounce back in the same way that car travel will and in fact how many in fact that many choice transit users those who have other options may have been in transit yeah I absolutely I'm having a conversation with a micro transit provider currently in the shared mobility space so that's not even the fixed route transit switch already were showing a decline in ridership and then I mentioned that shark from the Imperial UK which I have a high degree of confidence in that we're going to have some waves of infection until we can get a vaccine and shared mobility fixed route transit being the kind of the lowest priority of that is going to be the most affected those choice riders are going to have options to either share with fewer people so that's where the micro transit the small vans might be actually more preferable and you can maybe clean them better you'll have more accountability so I am I'm definitely worried about our fixed route transit system and and the role that choice riders have in subsidizing the financial viability of those services okay and on the other side of that might some people have learned that they can work from home be more likely to stay home and less likely to commute absolutely what do we the the stats were 7% today are people who are currently telecommuting in Vermont and if the data suggests that it may be upwards around 60 percent in this big situation I know many people this is suboptimal conditions you have kids in the background you have people at home you have housemates you don't you have premiere that are being used as your us so not everyone's interested or willing to to work from home so if that sixty percent can be more moderated down I think at 20 percent it all also depends on the time horizon that you're looking at yeah and so absolutely I think it's going to be increased above the seven percent for sure um do you have any thoughts about what it says about parking lots in highway infrastructure that's that's the interesting case that would depend on the amount of travel that's actually reduced and there's there's two conditions here one is are we in a stable condition but our behavior has changed meaning the dick Ovid is stable and that we're able to do our normal day and day business but we've now changed working from home that's situation one and then situation two is if we're in a social situation social lockdown clearly in a social lockdown we have excess capacity in all of our transportation infrastructure and we should be doing other things with it if we're if we're able to do so so the likes of New York City and Bogota and other communities putting in temporary bike lanes Burlington restricting parking on some streets and restricting maybe walking and biking those are the examples that we need now packaged responses if this infection were to increase again having a way of infection but that first situation I mentioned that the amount of working from home or the amount of commuting is only about 30 percent of anyone household travel if you then only take 50 or 25% of people working net now working from home it's still going to be only at five to ten percent probably of net vehicle miles traveled being changed and that may or may not be enough to significantly reimagine the existing transportation infrastructure that we have we need the other pieces that have been the focus of sustainable transportation Vermont for years that travel demand management you need the incentives for for not driving and we need to provide the other alternatives okay and what is your sense of how increasing grocery delivery impacts BMT efficiency of getting groceries to people versus folks going in person to grocery stores and our deliveries done per household are they delivering to multiple households per trip yeah that's a great question and I would be lying to you to know the answer the difficulty in this is all about trip chaining most people when they go to a shopping center either groceries or all whatever it might have been you don't typically just go for one shot and you're done groceries sometimes is a nuance in this case it could result in equal VMT if it's just a delivery from a grocery store to your home that might have already happened anyway so it's got a like-for-like substitution the worst case is then where you white you would have done two or three shopping trips together and then now you're getting individual orders from those three places and that's going to be only shown up in the details and the data that we want to collect we hope that that that our public agencies are very interested in these questions as well what if we wanted to help people drive less what will we do at this moment as people emerge from the pandemic it's a great question I think we we need to provide the alternatives in Vermont are limited if I can think about Vermont which our land use influences so much of our travel and that's not going to change there has been people surmising that the suburbs are going to be even more attractive in a postcode situation because it provides people more space where I am able to go outside in Vermont and go out in my lawn there are cities now across the world that are not able to go outside at all and so land use is so important to our travel decisions we need to either make commitments to either fund transit with a frequency that would work for people because we don't have the density just to get a few people on the few peak hour buses that occur and we are also in situations where the density that that is there just that the bus routes that already serve it don't go enough places so I think it's a political commitment to more frequency on our transit systems it's also then an ability to travel safer by other alternative modes and again it it goes back to things that this organization and others have been trying to do for years which are safer better protection for bicyclists and improved public transit I think those are those are fundamental thesis paint things from the transportation side but we cannot lose sight that that land-use really influences travel behavior and this question is also related to travel behavior do you think that people will change their behavior regarding transportation after some of this subsides or will they have to go back to their same old ways how can we leverage this to get people to actually permantly change their transportation behavior I'm a believer that once people try things you'll either agree or you'll disagree and I think there's gonna be a lot of people who have some positive outcomes from this working from home situation and I would imagine that there's going to be a groundswell of people coming up to your employer and saying I want flexibility to work two days a week from home there could be a government mandate as I mentioned about the the ability to respond to disaster and if we need to start having a prepared plan for how we can deal with social distancing if and when it's required again then companies might need to be more prepared with the technology infrastructure the VPNs the laptops headsets whatever it might be to work remotely so I think there could be an honest question to say as a government do we need to ask our companies to start being officially more prepared for this and then from a bottom-up point of view I'm confident that there's going to be a groundswell of interest and the companies who want to retain good employees and to and the companies that want to be responsive to their employees needs will start providing some options to work from home ok great thank you that was our last question so thank you so much for being here and thank you for all questions we'll see you back here next Friday
