continue to be missed by all who knew him and want to thank the board for the unanimous consent on this approximate degree i will now move forward again with the president's report i plan on keeping today's report uh short so that we can leave plenty of time for the restart report that comes up next and i'm also sure that you know this is an area that you're very interested in so i just want to make sure we have enough time for that i i would like to read a resolution though this is a resolution honoring in love um this is an opportunity to recognize the truly outstanding contributions of of the member of the wayne state university family ed love this year he has celebrated 60 years of being on air and sharing his love of jazz and music with all who surround them and we're very proud to say that 38 of those 60 years have been here at wdet i have a resolution like to read which encapsulates just how much it means to our campus community and um the resolution reads as follows whereas ed love has contributed significantly to the celebration and appreciation of jazz music and culture in the detroit area and beyond for 60 years and whereas through his program destination jazz the ed love program has served as detroit's preeminent jazz host on wet since 1983 and whereas his vast knowledge and deep appreciation of jazz entertained the national audience through his syndicated national public radio npr program the evolution of jazz airing on 150 u.s radio stations and two in puerto rico and whereas his efforts and commitment to celebrate and promote jazz musicians festivals and performances as recognized and appreciated by renowned artists and cultural leaders in detroit throughout the united states in the world and whereas while maintaining a standard of excellence in the art of broadcasting spanning six decades ed love continues to entertain educate and introduce a new generation to the art of jazz and the power of music now therefore be a resolve that i hereby piss off on ed love the president's award for excellence and service and recognition of and in tribute to his outstanding career and contributions to wayne state university the citizens of the city of detroit and to music lovers everywhere and therefore further resolved that this action is taken at a meeting of the wayne state board of directors board of governors to place this designation within the record of the board and be a part of the history of this institution assigned by me september 25th 2020. i think uh even though this is all virtual a uh applause will be in order uh while ed himself and many of his uh friends and colleagues may be watching us via live stream i hope that we can aptly convey our congratulations for this tremendous honor and extend to him our very best wishes as he celebrates this incredible milestone congratulations that okay moving on then i'd like to turn to um michael wright and interim provost laurie claibo for an update on campus restart um we'll start with michael thank you president wilson and good afternoon everybody and i would just add to the ed love celebration that if anybody feels so inclined wdet does take contributions 24 7 and and uh we would love to have one on behalf of ed or any other cause that you can think of so we have we've discussed the restart with the board on a number of occasions but we're now a month into the cement and it was all about getting the fall semester going restarting the campus and i think what um i would carefully say is that so far we've been successful there are things we could we keep uh watch on and we keep working on but overall it's been a successful semester so far and i think when you look at what some of the other universities are going through um we're doing okay it's not an accident we've had the restart committee together for a while and the members of the restart committee and each of the subcommittees have been meticulously planning and preparing for the fall semester uh with every aspect of the university with safety of course as the the top priority you heard this morning from dean of students david strauss from south end from the student senate that even beyond what we're doing in in virtual classrooms that that the campuses is the university is in full vigor and people are doing things david strauss talked about 424 i think student groups available to students which is a record and and they're finding many different ways to connect students and engage with students and although we're in a primarily virtual world we're trying to replicate as much as we can the university experience and and hope for that day when i think as david said the sun shines through again and we don't have to make uh lemonade out of lemons anymore but um i think that in our mission we talk about helping a diverse body of students thrive and that includes not just the academic part of their college career but all those other things around that that help them become rounded people and rounded citizens so it's good that all those things are going on during the whole restart we have attempted to communicate often and transparently and thoroughly and avail ourselves of every communication channel we have we've used video when we've used email and we use the web and we use social media and we continue to do that because as much as you say things to people they need reminders and we're trying to find new ways to tell people maintain your social distancing wear face covering when you're on campus anywhere on campus etc we've got over a thousand signs across campus to help people remind that we've got other ways to to remind people too but it's a it's an ongoing task until it becomes a reflex to grab your instinct and that's just not true with everybody yet so we're going to continue to be uh vigilant on that uh but overall i would say it's it's good news a lot of people have come together and worked hard and done a great job i think of putting a plan together that we're executing and we should be gratified by that if not proud by it by that i would say so far because we we have to remain vigilant um provost claibo who is chairs both the academic subcommittee as well as the public health committee we'll talk a little bit about that vigilance so right now if i could turn it over to you provost claibo and take us through both public health and i think academics and a few of your other areas as well thank you michael and good afternoon everyone um i do want to walk through sort of two broad areas of our restart starting with our public health measures and i'll remind you of some of the things that we began to work on late in the spring early and summer and then talk a little bit more about where we are today but one of the first things we undertook as a public health subcommittee of the restart was recognizing that there was a great degree of misinformation circulating publicly on social media around the virus the ways in which it is transmitted the ways in which one could reduce risk and some misconceptions about common therapeutics and so we developed the be warrior safe training module and it is a series of three actually virtual modules that are required for completion by every student staff and faculty member on campus we felt that it was really important that members of the wayne state community have a common lexicon and have access to very reliable information based in current science excuse me the second thing we developed over the course of the summer and really launched on july 1st was what we call the campus daily screener and the campus daily screener is a easily accessible web tool that's done either on the website or on the wayne state app on a smartphone or other device and uses a series of cdc derived screening questions to determine whether or not it is likely that someone is symptomatic or at high risk for covid based on exposure and we saw in the beginning of the summer a small number of people beginning to complete the campus daily screener they were largely our critical infrastructure workers in may and june we had about 400 people a day completing the campus daily screener so a very small footprint on campus to today when there are about 3 500 people a day physically present on campus and remembering that that includes the residents of our dormitories who live on campus obviously we promote safe social distancing and we require mass use in all public spaces this year for the first time we are requiring influenza vaccine for all faculty staff and students with a series of opportunities for people to decline for a variety of reasons as i said the campus footprint is increasing from about 450 people a day to about 3 200 a day the number of cases on our campus since the 1st of july is 34 and we have a positivity rate or the percentage of tests that test positive of 2.42 and that's very consistent with our neighborhood if we think about this the positivity in the city of detroit excluding not metro detroit but the city itself the seven day positivity rate in the last seven days is 2.5 our three day average of new cases per day on campus is 1.33 new cases per day and the seven day average of new cases per day on campus is 0.57 new cases per day this week so while all the data is very favorable today given the likelihood of a second fall wave we know that we could be facing a very challenging semester and to that end the public health committee has developed and published a series of what we call trigger point metrics that will guide our action should the public health status of the campus change we look at this as actions in a series of three points along a continuum what we're now calling new normal operations meaning continuing along with our traditional our fall plan and then a series of metrics that would cause us to take targeted actions meaning that we might do things like suspend an in-person class for a period of time close a lab close a wing of a dorm close a building and then finally the most serious end of the continuum and if we reach those metrics we would depopulate or close our campus we along with president wilson believe that it is incredibly important that those decision points were made in advance and so that should the status of health on our campus change we are not um conducting a debate about what we should do next that we have committed publicly that these are the actions we will take when we get to a certain point and we feel that that will help us move efficiently if the need should arise the metrics are published on the wayne state university coronavirus webpage and the status of cases and testing is updated every monday on the campus health center's website to reflect the prior week's data in effective saturday night at midnight we are very pleased to report as michael said that thus far the semester has been largely uneventful although we continue to be very vigilant and watch closely it's important i think that you know that we have essentially moved all lectures online about five percent of our classes are being held in traditional face-to-face methods and those classes include if you think about it our health profession students who are in clinical experiences includes some of the labs in physiology chemistry where there are needs to need to use shareable items that can't be conducted virtually and 2.5 percent of our courses are hybrid this semester those courses largely meet online and may have an in-person session for a necessary set of skills or for exams the rest of our courses are online about 63 or individually arranged courses those are things like directed studies and dissertation credits at about 30 percent um because we anticipate that winter again may be a challenging period of time we are already building the winter course schedule with an expectation that we will be largely in those same percentages for winter 2021 and if the public health situation on campus changes we will change that plan but that schedule is now being developed based on the same format we are managing issues that members of the board heard about earlier this morning related to exam proctoring both in person and via technology the academic services team has revised the final exam schedule so that there are no conflicts arising from what's been for us a dramatic increase in asynchronous online courses we have looked at examining changes to the availability of library resources as our online classes limit our ability to use things like dvds and we have also the academic restart committee developed syllabus language for covid precautions compliance available to faculty in terms of campus housing and retail as of census day this week we had 1521 residents living on campus which represents about 37 percent of our actual total capacity um the chatsworth suites renovation was completed in august of 20 but we did not need to open the newest facility for fall and the thompson and gafari hall housing are also closed this fall semester towers cafe and student center food court remain open for meal plan holders in addition to all other retail on campus our new retail on anthony wayne drive and elsewhere is admittedly struggling typical daily retail sales across those retail outlets are about 10 of their normal revenue the bookstore on the other hand processed a record of 9 912 online orders in the four-week period before census day assisting students to be able to receive course materials in a timely fashion for the start of classes you heard a little bit from the dean of students this morning but just want to remind you that over 4 500 wsu branded personal protective equipment swag bags were distributed to students on august 26 at drive up and appropriately social distanced events at schoolcraft the macomb center at atac and at massai and his students arrived to campus in the first two weeks every residence hall student was provided with one of these bags in their room at move in they included things like um wayne state logo and face mask as well as hand sanitizer free face master continue to be available in the w food pantry the undergrad library the student center and can be delivered by contacting the dean of students office there were over 1800 participants in a virtual new student convocation and virtual student activities program programming continues to progress well we're at about 425 registered student organizations and homecoming celebration as you heard earlier today is planned for next week virtually the wsu food pantry is also serving as the hub for distribution of chromebooks wi-fi hotspots and webcams for students who need them that distribution is going well and inventory is holding use of the undergrad library which is open with socially distanced protocols is going well face mask wearing is going well in building but we are beginning to see some challenges outside um we have encouraged uh found new ways to encourage both our student ambassadors and others to distribute available math to folks who are outside who may not feel who may not have a mask we are also working with faculty and staff to make sure that students and others are reminded each day of the importance of mask wearing and we continue mantra that until a safe and effective vaccine is widely available universal use of a face mask is our best protection against spread of the disease thank you you know before we proceed i just wanted to remind everyone if you could please put your microphones on you were getting considerable feedback and shannon can you tell who does not have their microphones muted shannon he obviously has his muted yeah okay well if you if you can just uh uh mute that that'd be great i i did um neglect to mention that michael wright was the chair of our restart committee you know so i want to i'll take this moment to thank him for his uh tremendous work as well as provost clavo who chaired the public health committee and i took over from um provost whitfield the chair of the academic committee so she's doing both now and and both have done tremendous work i think i can safely say that we've been a model example for for the country in terms of the way we've done things so thank you both very much any questions for for either of them from members of our board of governors i know we're probably pressed for time but i have more information if you'd like to share it well i'm not i'm not seeing any so um let's move forward then and go to the board committee reports from academic affairs committee i'd like to call on governor gaffney for a brief report thank you before i begin my report if i may i just want to complement the provost and michael wright and all the members of the committee i have as some of you know a daughter that's just begun college and uh i'd like to say to her mother our daughter moved away and has not come back but maybe she'll come back soon but my i tell you that because i track what's going on at her school i'm a graduate of the other large school in michigan and i track what's going on there and i track what's going on at the school that my daughter almost went to just as comparisons and i can tell you that we are far and away better than all three of those other examples that i watch in fact in in in one case not in michigan but it's really kind of appalling they managed to bungle a lot including what to do with students that did come down with with with colbit so uh kudos to you the numbers look good i think the whole board probably checks those uh regularly and uh i really like what we're seeing thank you okay academic affairs uh committee met this morning considered four action items and one information item the action items were listed by president wilson in the consent agenda so i'm not going to review those again the last item on this morning's agenda was a review of the annual status report on accreditation this report compiles information on all university accreditation programs uh including the ones that are underway including any areas that uh of concern that are identified last year 15 programs underwent an accreditation review i'm pleased to advise that no issues were identified for additional work seven programs are expected to submit materials or undergo site visit in the upcoming year and due to the pandemic accreditations for three programs have been postponed by those agencies that concludes my report thank you uh thank you governor gaffney uh can i ask governor stancado to uh report out on the student affairs committee certainly so the student affairs committee uh met this morning also and we had a fairly fairly full agenda we heard several presentations the first of which was about fall enrollment from don medley who's the associate vice president of enrollment management and among some of the takeaways um let me just say that first of all total enrollment is down of about two percent but really has remained relatively flat over the past several years and our fidiak enrollment i laugh at that because i i think i went through a couple of board meetings before i knew exactly what does that mean in this first time in any college um enrollment is up about five a little over five percent and the university really has seen its largest cohort first time in any college cohort in the university's 152 year history so we should really be uh really be proud of that um the new professional enrollment is up about almost 19 but graduate and new international enrollment is down and i think we know that just because of travel um issues that related to covet uh in terms of the uh fidiac cohort 97 almost 97 are full-time students and there's been a 44 growth in full-time first time in any college student since 2014 so that's going in the right direction in terms of looking at um that that's one of the goals that we have uh in terms of increasing that so we're pretty good now other numbers include about uh which we're really excited about clearly we still have more work to do about almost an 18 increase in the number of hispanic students enrolled this fall as well as a 55 increase in the number of african-american students those are good things uh following associate vice president mellie's presentation we heard about the ongoing projects and plans of the student senate this year from the new students and president ria chabra an update we heard an update from south end uh current editor and we have a look at how the pandemic has changed life uh student life participation from dean of students david strauss who talked about every cloud has a silver lining and one of the things that's happened i think you heard from provost claibo about the increase in the number of students at certain events around the campus in addition to that we also heard about the annual report from the student conduct officer on the adjudication and violations in the student code of conduct the committee also heard about plans uh from the student senate president for day of observance for juneteenth and way as well as um indigenous people today and ways that the administration and the students are considering uh recognition of this really these really important times in our history i do want to also say and sort of hitchhike on uh what governor gaffney said around the campus and the and and covert and how we've handled it and just listening to the numbers and reading the numbers i think i heard 34 here in terms of the number of new cases in the other major universities that i've read have numbers like 400 and 200 etc and this morning i was at another meeting before this meeting early and in that meeting where uh an individual who is a healthcare professional and and she's also a member of the governor's coronavis task force on racial disparities and um we're having comments about they were talking about university increases in university and the covet numbers and i said not not at wayne state we don't have that um we really don't compare to the other we compare favorably to the other universities and she said one of the things that she wanted to comment on was the fact that um president wilson really is wowing them on that um task force that statewide task force because of his knowledge um and because of his background and experiences in ethnic mediology and it really is showing up here at wayne state so i just wanted to comment on that but saying even in another meeting we're getting some kudos and i think we take a lot of time to talk about it's important for us to focus on what we don't do right because our job is to make sure we get things right but when we do some things that are right i think we should lift that up and talk about that too so um i think we can pat ourselves on the back and say that we are we are a model not just here but other folks from around the country are looking at us and what we've done here so that concludes my report thank you very much governor sancono uh now it's time for uh information reports from members of the administration uh when i call upon you you invite you to provide any highlights and updates as you deem most appropriate so our provost claibo academic affairs so i um you all have the academic affairs report and i won't belabor it but if there is a consistent theme throughout the report it is the use of virtual technology to continue to deliver a world-class education at wayne state from the development of a free app that allows students to in virtual reality describe how drugs interact with their targets on a molecular level to virtual advising to virtual orientation to virtual fulbright orientation to virtual study abroad the faculty and staff have moved effectively and efficiently to to continue to provide an excellent education in a very new modality for us thank you vice president lanier research awards quarter three thank you president wilson uh before i begin if uh if i may respond to a question from governor kelly early this morning governor gaffney had mentioned bringing it up this afternoon and governor kelly we had filed the report appropriately in december of 2019 so thank you for noting that and everything is uh on track there thank you so much yes uh and thank you for for your diligence on that uh i as you note in your report um just like you heard from um provost uh claibo and michael wright the startup during the summer we've also been working since june 1 uh to ramp up in a phased way research activities on campus which has been an experience for for all involved and uh heavily in working closely with the public health task force facilities uh finance it's really been a integrated team effort i guess we've operationalized now over 400 labs on campus across 30 buildings and done so with social distancing mask disinfectant etc and even though we have had the challenges of the pandemic and the pause in research activities for several weeks as you note in the report the research funding somehow these folks continue to work and get the grant awards in and the research funding for this year is actually up about 15 compared to q3 this time last year of course we'll see how it plays out for the rest of this fiscal year but we're getting pretty close so that's certainly a a good sign as we go through this challenging year the only as an example of some of the awards that have come in we actually received a one million dollar grant from national science foundation for equipment uh which is a very competitive uh proposal put forth by the folks in department of chemistry it's for high-end electron microscopy which will enable a number of things across engineering and chemistry and biomedical sciences my congratulations to that team and that will be coming to the board for their approval and formal notification as we go forward that's all i have to share president wilson thank you thank you question i have a question about um vice president lanier's report um so i did notice that the funding looks like the um corporate funding has increased uh a lot in 2020 is that correct the the corporate funding is pretty similar to what was in 20 uh 2019 so if you look at 2019 and 2020 so we have 64 and 69 and the majority of that is clinical trials uh activity governor thompson so it's pretty it's pretty stable from uh 2019 to 2020. so it's this other that uh where you have you have the increase if you look you'll see uh in most all categories the foundation's up a million the uh nih is up about 10 million compared to this time last year uh nsf is stable is the same others up a few million other federal funding is there and then state is up as well so it's a pretty balanced portfolio if you will okay and then uh again there's some of these increases as a result of funding related to covid19 issues and do you anticipate this um maybe dropping as a result of that funding you know i think that um the the funding during the the summer uh i don't think there's been a substantial increase in the coven 19 funding that fits into this per se the state actually the state some of the state funding has been directed towards some of our global testing initiatives you heard about those from dr levy i believe in an earlier board meeting but i suspect over the next week that we'll see a fair amount of money coming in from nih that's related to covet funding because they'll probably fund a lot of those programs before the end of this fiscal year okay um so then you're saying not the some of the increases in the funding for 2020 is not necessarily due to coven 19. i think it's i think i think it reflects um you know just a continued sustained effort to grow and that's i think it's a real solid platform i actually think you know with goat with vice president of health affairs dean of school of medicine schweitzer coming on board he's already starting to have an impact with recruitment that i'm actually very optimistic that this trend in nih funding will continue with his his presence going forward okay and that was going to be my next next question just about nih funding and um it has been relatively flat over since 2016. so you anticipate um with some of his changes that may enhance funding or what other strategies would you use to address that the the fact that the nih funding has been pretty flat yeah i think that uh you know we had a bump up from the first couple of years when we came on board and then we have remained stable despite challenging times across the school of medicine and elsewhere so i think one of the key factors there is recruiting and recruiting uh talented folks to come on board the other part of that i think is investing in enabling technologies that will further empower the folks here as well as the folks coming on board so i have just like i mentioned the nsf one million dollar instrumentation that's one example there are others that we've tried to put in place for the enabling technology platform uh and then to set the foundation for recruiting i think that with um my colleague mark schweitzer coming on board that it's just a sea change for momentum in the school of medicine and across the health sciences uh so not only will we see growth in nih but i suspect there'll be other areas relative to a cdc funding other types of health services research that may reflect cross integration across nursing pharmacy medicine in ways that we haven't done before okay thank you okay thank you very much uh near next we have five requests for approve of contracts in which the university employee has an interest these require roll call votes so i'll go through each one of them the first one is a motion i need a motion that the board of governors authorizes the president or doesn't need to enter into a contract with functional

uh mr lindsay good afternoon uh president after new members of the board just wanted to give you a quick update on the state budget which is not included in the written report the legislature sent over a budget to the governor for signature essentially the education omnibus included the budget for hiring it that is flat in other words there is no increase we will remain at the same level as we were in fy 20 which is 203.4 million dollars actually that's in in the context of things uh that's not a bad situation given the state budget woes uh there was a very slight increase of about 45 uh for 45 thousand dollars for indian uh tuition waiver but essentially we were flat uh there are no performance metrics because there's no new money uh there is a tuition cap of 4.2 but i believe you all have already acted on tuition and then lastly within the hhs budget there is 2.5 million dollars for that would benefit our frontline strong program which helps people on the front line in terms of providing them with mental health services my docs has 5.4 million dollars included grossly 1.4 of that is in the general fund uh 5.6 million for like khaki young which is always a program we have to fight for and keep money in and then the poison control center or the poison center 1.1 million there is no capital outlay recommendation of funding for this year our project state hall renovation did score fourth but there is no no funding uh that would be my uh update thank you um uh i'm sorry question oh i'm sorry no thank you um patrick i i've got a couple questions regarding some of the um house and senate bills that are going on right now uh in michigan uh uh two in particular look like they um have the possibility of taking some tuition dollars away from us in terms of revenue and what i'm uh what i'm talking about specifically is the house bill 4437 regarding the modification of the mortuary science requirement for a license not requiring a four-year degree um what is you know obviously we're i don't want to say we have the corner on mortuary science but we have well i think there aren't a lot of mortuary science schools in the state of michigan and ours is amongst the best if not the best so my question is um is this uh i don't i think it mentioned that you're working with the with wakeman um on who's the person who who's whose um bill this is and what are we doing and why you know why would we want we obviously i don't think we would want this to go through so what what are we doing here what's going on well my team in lansing and i'll have to go to the report my team in lansing works with dr eagley who runs our mortuary science program and we have been in close contact with him relative to all those issues uh and i can give you an update on where we stand with that one okay yeah because i mean you agree right that that's that that could take away some revenue from us if we if you're going to if that would if that were to pass then it looks as if there you're modifying the requirements for a mortuary science license so if you know saying that you could do it what if you get something lesser than a four-year degree so you know i don't want to say we have a lock on mortuary science again but we almost do so this has a possibility of taking money away from us so my thought is i you know it would be good to get an update regarding what our people in lansing are doing and who they're talking to and if any other people on the board need to you know make some calls to some folks um to make sure that you know this doesn't this is going to hurt us i think so i just want to make sure that it one it doesn't it doesn't pass so you know any update that you can give us um would be good anybody have any questions about this one i mean i just i this looked like to me it stuck out so i just want to make sure that we know what's going on um i you know we're already it's already a tight budget we don't have the you know luxury of losing any more revenue and then and then the other one was the um the uh the nesbit nesbit senate bill um 105.5 college nursing bill yes and um so allowing community colleges to to offer four-year degree bsn so um obviously that you know it's wonderful for the community colleges but i think you know takes away from our nursing school uh you know candidates who could come to us uh for their bsn so uh and i'm just trying to figure out why are we you know what is the purpose behind these uh is it because it's you know cheaper for people to go to a community college to get a four-year degree or you know i i i um i'm not real i don't like that one i don't think it's you know beneficial to us in any way in any way and i want to know that we are aggressively um pushing back as much as we can on that well uh that bill let me give you a just a quick uh summary since i've been here in 2012 uh a community college bill either has been proposed or has been threatened to be proposed and each year we've successfully fought it off the majority leader in the senate uh sherkey this has been a number one priority of his for the last several years uh zesbit has brought it forward in that committee uh and again wayne state is actually in the forefront of fighting against this bill uh dean uh provost playbo uh uh has a person who works very closely with my team monica minor who uh has been the leading voice against the community college nursing bill i can assure you that wayne state is not only in the fight but we're leading those efforts and probably been as much as anybody uh the reason why it has not yet passed good to know thank you okay thank um thank you mr lindsey um vice president burns development alumni affairs report yeah thank you good afternoon um since providing information for your board book i now have results for fundraising through august we continue to run slightly ahead of last fiscal year we've raised 42.4 million dollars ninety percent toward our adjusted goal that we set in i'd like to thank everyone who participated um in our giving day last week on september 17th we launched this annual event just three years ago and i'm pleased to report that since then we've doubled the number of donors participating this year an all-time high at over 1200 donors making a gift in a single day and we tripled our fundraising results to raising over six hundred and fifty thousand dollars um some of the gifts are still coming in because they did come in through the mail that were made on that day so we're still refining that but we expect to be just over six hundred and fifty thousand that concludes my report thank you uh there are some establishments of uh endowment funds that we need uh action on uh like a motion that the border governors establish endowment funds that total three hundred thousand dollars for the purposes are presented and they're listed um can i get a motion so moved okay um motion by our governor gaffney and stephanie seconded governor basuido and uh second that um excuse me this one doesn't require a real call right no okay um all in favor aye aye aye great thank you i think i skipped over um economic development report thanks president wilson i um i didn't know it was an oversight i thought it was intentional it's been a long day but um uh i do have two things thank you for for coming back because i do have two things i want to mention for the board the first is uh following up on governor stancato's comments that uh we're getting recognized nationally for some of the good work that we're doing here during this time of pandemic um i know that the board is familiar with a lot of the work that we've been doing with small businesses around the city uh in the last few months we were able to help uh more than a thousand small businesses 700 with cash uh aid and 300 more with technical assistance uh through the the difficulties of the pandemic um we've been getting requests from all over the country now to help out and consult with uh their efforts to do the same we just entered into an agreement with the city of honolulu uh to do some consulting work to help them with their small businesses especially with an equity focus because they were advised uh by a consultant that we were a national best practice in doing that and before anyone asked no there are no trips to honolulu that are available as part of this package i'm sorry i can't swing that for you and then the second thing i have uh to bring the attention is that next thursday october 1st is our annual toast to the town this year it will be virtual from four o'clock till five it's only an hour but it's also free so please uh it'll be a little different um not as much of a party no open bar although obviously you're free in your own home to do whatever you would like to be doing but it's from four o'clock uh until five o'clock next thursday october 1st uh we're also giving out we've renamed our small business champion of the year award in honor of marvel stottamer who passed earlier this year so his wife and some of his colleagues uh will be giving a video a presentation of that and memorial and then we'll be giving the first award to pam lewis from the new economy initiative who we think is a really worthy recipient of that award so i hope you guys can make it thank you going back to the endowment fund we also need a motion that the board of governors dissolve the dr mike stotenberg endows scholarship fund can i get a motion please okay i think i heard a um okay great um we have one other item the executive committee met uh earlier and um um decided on the action which and so i'm gonna turn the the meeting over to uh chair um kelly for that particular item thank you uh between the executive team met today and it recommends that the board of governors authorize the administration to continue operating under the 2019-2020 budget and focus time as it adopts the 2021 budget our council our legal counsel has advised us that absent action by the board on a new budget the 2021 budget remains in full force in effect the public meeting for the board to consider action on the 2021 budget will be scheduled for october 30 20 20. is there a motion on this recommendation second fourth anything else no i didn't hear any opposed is that right no opposition okay thank you no there's nothing else great thank you um great well thank you all very much there being no further business uh motion to adjourn would be in order some here by acclimation that uh it's time to adjourn so thank you all very much we're adjourned
