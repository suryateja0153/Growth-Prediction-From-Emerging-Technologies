 welcome everyone thank you for joining our second town hall for returning students we're happy to have you here this afternoon and to share a lot of information with you about our opening plans that are a mere 16 days away i want to first of all thank all of you for your flexibility and understanding as we've been working through an awful lot of uncharted territory writing the playbook as we go today we're going to share our current decisions and implementation plans and please know that we're going to continue with our communication just like we've been doing we have the website which i'll talk about in a moment give you specific updates on that we have faqs uh we'll continue to send you emails with respect to everything that you might be interested and curious about certainly know that today you've asked a number of questions in advance we'll answer all of those questions as far as an overview of what we're going to cover today we're going to go for about 60 minutes majority of the time is going to be spent answering your questions i'll make some brief comments then i'll introduce vice chancellor joan prince and then we're going to cover more than 50 different questions that you've asked and we will cluster those by category with over a dozen different experts subject matter experts that really have been working on these issues throughout the summer all of your questions as i mentioned will be answered and if we can't get to everything today we'll post these on our faqs also known as frequently asked questions and this is the website that you can find and i encourage you to monitor this all the time it's uwm.edu coronavirus slash reopening so that's the website where we continue to bank a lot of information hundreds of questions have been answered and they're uh right there as far as my comments go just briefly i want to again thank you for your patience uh and everything that you've done to adapt to this coba 19 world this is an unusual environment nobody planned nobody expected and your world was turned upside down your jobs your parents jobs lives and and family members that have been so unfortunately and adversely affected by what we're experiencing right now on behalf of all of our faculty and staff i want you to know that at uwm we care deeply about you every one of you there's nobody that's alone in this and i encourage you to reach out i encourage you to work with faculty your advisors all the staff with whom you engage as well as other students student groups and different different opportunities to experience uwm in its fullest even in this virtual environment of course we know things are different for the time being but there's one thing that remains constant and that's our commitment to you that's what we're here for and this is really what our academic mission is about we want to make sure that we can continue to have that academic continuity public education at its heart is about providing access and providing doors opening that that many of you will experience in so many powerful and positive ways i know i have i know that my son who's a graduate of uwm and many people who are on this call today can speak to that as we have been planning the critical foundation has been around your safety and health we have elevated this such that we have daily meetings with dozens of different individuals and this has been going on for many months across our campus sometimes people ask well if that's the case why are you opening it all why wouldn't you just have everything online first and foremost we've surveyed you our current students we've surveyed the faculty and staff and we look at how can we best continue with the academic education that is so important and many of you have said we want options and in that spirit we have created an environment that has about 25 percent face-to-face almost 60 percent that is hybrid and the rest is i'm sorry about 60 that is purely online and the rest is in the hybrid format so the majority of this is in a way that is not face to face but nobody should feel in any way unsafe you should convey this to your advisors and faculty we want after our months of safety and planning to put in front of you a lot of activities that you'll hear about today we're following best practices we're working with cdc the center for disease control we're working with local health authorities and our own campus health authorities to make sure that we're upholding the safest environment while we know there's no guarantees covet is out there it's likely to happen on or off campus we will provide a number of safety precautions i have a list of over a dozen i'd like to just give you a few samples we're requiring masks as you know we're asking you especially inside buildings but also outside to wear those masks when you're on campus maintain social distance wash your hands frequently there's clearly identified paths for ingress and egress how you exit how you enter classrooms where you queue up in advance the plexiglass in our classrooms in office areas wherever that's been requested throughout the summer i won't go through more details but i want you to know that it's up to you and it's up to us together for us to be able to maintain these health and safety standards and expectations you might think that you've got this uh incredible immune system and you might think that that that you are are going to be safe but you have to recognize um you don't know about that classmate next to you who might have an immune compromised system you don't know about that faculty or staff member so it's really a sense of togetherness that we want to create and build a culture around in in closing um we know that planning in this cohort world is incredibly complex it's dynamic quickly changing we will adjust as needed and we're watching the campus we're watching the community data we monitor this regularly and please know that because we're in this together we need you to do everything that you can not just on campus but off campus as well to keep yourself and all of us safe i'll stop here and i'll ask vice chancellor joan prince to share her insights about diversity equity and inclusion and the deep care that we share and convey to all of you on campus joan for years has been our vice chancellor for global inclusion and engagement joan please take it away thank you chancellor and hello everyone it has been a long summer and we can't wait to see you as we get ready to start our new academic year yes you are still the priority and that has not changed and will not change before we close campus in march and into this summer you have continued to work with us in two very specific areas so let me share quick updates on both of those let's start with dei diversity equity and inclusion during this time of national civil engagement and the raising of voices you our students joined in the conversation as a part of our uwm campus dialogues on racial justice that was co-sponsored by my division of global inclusion and engagement and the division of student affairs six of your colleagues led an authentic discussion around their thoughts of what our nation our city and our campus should do to see the positive change that diversity produces you talked about experiences in the classroom and even with others that you felt could be enhanced with more dialogue and action you spoke and we heard you because of your thoughts and many of your friends that called in during the dialogue or sent us emails you along with our faculty and staff will engage in training as we work together in a more focused and action-oriented way to enhance and sustain a bias-free and racist free environment the chancellor and i just received the report from a 17-member team of faculty staff and students that recommended the types of training that would be beneficial for each of us to engage in because of your voices we will all work together in every area of diversity equity and inclusion whether that characteristic relates to race to gender to religious beliefs to political and social freedom of expression and others your voice is needed in those discussions now speaking of freedom of expression you know that in partnership with the division of student affairs we formed a care respect and expression team last year representative of faculty staff and students the team was charged to make formal recommendations to the chancellor on how we could do better in fostering a campus culture where all felt welcomed and supported the recommendations from the report were accepted by the chancellor who then charged kelly hague your chief student affairs officer and me to move forward with the recommendations you guessed it as soon as we literally sat down to write the implementation plan kovit kit and campus closed so today kelly and i want to let you know that the implementation plan is ready to roll and you will see proof of that in the fall you will hear periodic updates regarding the work from us and your student team members we will continue to ask you for thoughts and ideas as we move forward to ensure your safety advance your opportunities to learn about ways to enhance how you express yourselves and engage with others of differing opinions at the end of the day just know that we value you and that we are excited to have you return to a university that will do everything that it can to maximize not only your learning experience but will offer action-oriented ways to help you and us become better individuals for having known each other diversity drives our world thanks so much and welcome back chancellor back to you that was wonderful vice chancellor prince i'm so appreciative of your leadership and your ability to articulate so clearly what the important activities are things that are going on our campus well done i'm now going to hand this over to our provost provost brits is the leader of all the academic schools and colleges across the campus so he's responsible for a lot of the work that you experience as students on our campus every day and in that spirit johannes will be moderating a group of deans and other individuals regard to fees the financial aid the class formats and a number of other things with a team that he will introduce johannes please take it away thank you chancellor mooney and good afternoon everybody and as my colleague joan and the chancellor said we're very happy to have you back on campus in either one or other way in one other form we can't wait to see you on campus and we work through all the questions that you had asked about the academic side the teaching and the learning and chancellor money you're right i got a team here with me who worked very hard over the summer on our academic planning and as you've eluded it is complex it's difficult it's changing but we care for our students we care for our employees health safety but also as a academic institution the quality of our instructions we have done a lot since march also for the continuous training of our instructors to really do the online education should it be needed the team that i have with me that are going to answer some of your questions are firstly dean scott grunert scott grant is the dean of leaders and sciences and he also led the scenario planning for the fall and the spring semester he will then be followed by vice provost dave clark who oversees our student success efforts on campus and then vice provost deveniga poland who is responsible for accreditation our academic planning the accessibility resource center will address related questions for example about accessibility to the team i will give it over now to scott uh to introduce the first questions from the academic side scott over to you [Music] well thanks provost brits and there were a lot of questions about the fall schedule and its structure the scenario planning work group drove those decisions that was a group composed of instructors staff and students importantly uh they surveyed the students and found that about two-thirds of our students wanted face-to-face instruction and about one-third one in online instruction so we worked hard to create a schedule that gave the flexibility to meet the student demands paramount all the decision-making was the safety of our students the safety of our classrooms and that led to social distancing being in all of our classrooms that led to a schedule that's mainly online as the chancellor said the parts that are face to face are aimed at areas where we can't put that online quite as easily these are studios labs interactive courses where there's a lot of experiential learning and so that's what's mainly in our schedule in terms of face-to-face we also recognize that some courses only needed a part of the class to be face to face and so we created hybrid structures so that the parts that need to be face to face could meet one day a week the rest could be done online we also had a lot of questions about students personal schedules the mix between online and face-to-face particularly students who wanted to have an all online schedule but had maybe one or two face-to-face courses they want to make that change for a variety of reasons and here's a recommendation we have for you work with your advisors one option is to move to an online section of the course we've already added more online sections particularly of discussions for that look for an alternative course that meets the same curricular goals for you but is online and third we've asked all of our instructors in seminars lectures discussion sections to have a remote access option in many cases has to be a lecture capture technology we're putting that in all of our classrooms general center classrooms on all of our campuses it might be another online option for you and very important we care about your safety and your education and so this semester will be flexible on attendance and will be no penalties for students who take advantage of these remote access opportunities that we're providing there will be some courses particularly labs and studios where there will not be a online option available to students in those cases students will have to come to campus for those courses or delay taking them to another semester that form of instruction just doesn't translate as well to the online modality i will turn it over now to dave clark our vice provost for student success talk about all we've been doing since march and through the summer to ensure the highest quality instruction whether it be face-to-face or online dave thanks dean groener i want to say a few things about the the things that we're doing to enable the kinds of flexibility that dean gronner was talking about the you know the mix of face-to-face and hybrid and online instruction is unlike anything we've ever done or any other institution for that matter so our center for excellence in teaching and learning has been working very hard this summer to prepare high quality experiences for students in all of those all of those different modalities uwm has long had a strong reputation for uh for high quality online and blended courses this summer an additional 309 instructors obtained our online and blended teaching program badge of completion so they went they went and sought out training so that they could do a better job of develop developing and delivering really high quality instruction that 390 adds to 700 instructors who had already received this this uh this training previously so we have well over a thousand instructors who have completed this training to better better prepare themselves for multiple flexible delivery of courses in addition i'd like to emphasize the the other kinds of things that we've done to keep that kind of flexibility available in all of our support services as well our writing center and our supplemental instruction and tutoring have always been available in in online formats but we're working harder than ever to make sure that they are available in the ways and where where students most want them face to face and online and in flexible ways our multicultural centers will be available in in multiple formats our career center will be offering virtual appointments and virtual career fairs in addition to some of our regular services and experiential learning opportunities are going to be available in multiple modalities as well so now to uh associate vice chancellor devin again pollen who's going to talk about accessibility and proctoring thank you very much dave um i'm i want to say uh um that uh assure the students that uh those who need accommodations uh the accessibility resource center staff stand ready to provide the usual range of accommodations and assistance to students who need them the chancellor talked about the mass requirement and if you for with your disability condition if you need an exemption from the mask wearing requirement you need to contact the counselor in the accessibility resource center uwm will be making available to you a alternate type of a face covering which is basically a face shield with a with a cloth covering around the neck uh and which would be acceptable for uh use in the classrooms and laboratories and so on there are some questions about student teachers who need accommodation in the field experience the student teachers will have their orientation on the 20th of august at that time the program directors and coordinators will provide the latest information about what the school districts are doing it's a very fluid situation as you can understand for example with the milwaukee public uh school system they're they're in phase one of the reopening and they're going to be in that phase for a while uh during that phase uh they have told us that the student teachers will be only joining will not be in the buildings they will be joining the teachers who are teaching the class in an online mode so stay tuned for that with your orientation on the 20th and we will get more information to you on that there's a question about uh proctoring and the online test uh faculty and instructors who are teaching online classes will have the option of using proctoria which was what we used in the spring semester after we went to fully remote teaching uh i'll be glad to answer any questions that come up later i'll now pass it on to chancellor money provost brits and team terrific job i think there was at least 15 of our questions that were answered if not more in that section alone so very well done we're now going to transition to issues that are in the broader student affairs domain our chief student affairs officer kelly haig will be leading this section with again a team of knowledge such knowledgeable subject matter experts kelly please take it away hi it's great to be with you all today i wish that we could actually be together um but this will have to do as we think about the fall i know many of you are wondering what is it going to feel like to be on our campus and i want to reassure you that while we did i think a great job of pivoting to a mostly online environment in the spring we'll take those lessons that we learned and expand on that and try to do a mix of in-person and remote experiences in a way that is supportive of your experience as well as social distancing some of you might be wondering what does the fall look like what does fall welcome look like we have really some traditional signature programs that we do they will have to take a little bit of a different form this year but rest assured we will have lots of time and opportunities for students to mix together um you know engage in new things we've got game nights comedy nights and many outdoor events we've seen some questions about you know in addition to what the experience will look like where do i eat what is it going to look like we've really made some major changes to our order food delivery and online ordering so you can look forward to that some people you know i know myself love my coffee there will be the grind open in the union and as we are able to phase in additional places to eat um or additional coffee places those will be in place as well another question that we have about is is about you know kind of where do i work out so i want to be able to answer that and say that while engelman gym needs to be closed because high contact activities are not permitted in our current health and safety standard approach their the clashing pavilion will be open um for a different type of experience a lot of things that maybe are more individualized where students can be separated um and um kind of some really um creative things i think that will be in place so um so that's kind of an overview just again to reassure you that the fall is a really important time as students think about you know what does it feel like to come back to campus and a lot of those things have been thought about as we planned for your return i'll now turn it over to carrie dawson our assistant director of university housing to answer some questions about the housing experience carrie thanks kelly good afternoon everyone we're very excited for your return to campus in the coming weeks housing has definitely been doing a lot of planning since march for your return and we hope that we make it your home away from home one of the first questions that came to us is when will we receive our move-in dates and time um this year it looks a little bit different and that housing will not dictate your move-in date and time appointment to you from for move-in but on tuesday august 11th you should have received an email from our department on behalf of mysignup.com where you're going to actually go in and schedule your own move-in date and time that works best for you and your family to come to housing the second question that we received related to housing um was from quinn sullivan in the college college of health sciences related to guests within university housing so within the move-in process this year you'll be elite will be allowed to have two helpers assist you in the move-in process to your room but please note that guests will not be allowed into campus after you're moving for the foreseeable future though that policy is definitely reviewed periodically we have to make sure that we're practicing social distancing and lowering densities with our community to make sure that you say stay safe but residents are free to come and go from university housing after completing the move-in process and then we recognize that campus will have limited services and options open until the start of classes i'm going to now pass it over to our dean of students adam jaisal good afternoon everyone um thanks for joining us so excited to be here and uh reiterating what kelly said just wish we could see all in person um i just have two quick questions that were directed to me um and the first is really relating to um how do i get assistance if i'm struggling this specific person um asked um they were laid off for their jobs and they need access to their their books um and first i'm just so sorry about that experience this is something that has impacted our students greatly which ones you know that we have systems resources and processes in place the first step is really just to contact our office the dita students office there we can connect you to community and campus resources but we can also um help you access the deena students emergency fund and the chancellor student success fund both were put in place to help students in specific circumstances like yours so we hope you connect with us another option would be to connect with financial aid especially if you've been laid off from a job they can work to either refocus your financial aid and recalculate it or connect you to various grants scholarships etc so two great resources there the second question was about how we're limiting the number of people in various spaces specifically this student asked about student organizations how are they going to be able to meet on campus and really simply on campus there are physical distancing requirements and our union staff has been really working hard to make sure that we have spaces available for students to meet while practice physical distancing so i would encourage students or get organizations to connect with student involvement there they can help you figure out various options both electronic and in-person to connect with your student orders because we know that is super important so that's the two questions i had and please contact me or my office if you have any questions outside this space and thanks for being here and i'll kick it back to kelly thanks thanks team um we're glad um these questions came in i think that they really indicate people's level of engagement and interest in our planning chancellor i'll turn it back over to you well let me just say thank you um for the great job these are critically important questions very directly answered on student life and services kelly this is just nothing but an intermission because i'm going to hand it back to you where you're going to be able to talk about with your team community practices for community health many of the uh practices behaviors uh and and uh issues that we have put in place uh building on some of the comments that we made earlier with regard to the importance of safety and health for our students faculty and staff so back to you thank you chancellor so um we've got a great team that's going to follow here that will really dive into some more of the details but i just want to highlight what you've heard already is how much planning has gone into preparing for your return and and i want to reassure you just at the tables that i've been at which has been a lot of the tables right now we really keep a student focus um to our efforts and all of our planning so um next i would like to turn this over to dr julie bonner who is our campus health officer good evening everyone and i am so glad that you're here and that you asked such great and thoughtful questions related to health and well-being and how things are going to operate in the fall as you can tell throughout this whole presentation when we've really been looking at health we've been looking at it across our institution with a lot of community members that have been very working working very hard in terms of planning and preparation when we think about health i do want to make a note that we in addition to some of the testing and contact tracing questions i'm going to talk about norse health center university counseling and our services when we think about how important during this time an individual's well-being is from their physical to their emotional well-being services will be available and as since we've gone remote um for some of our services not our medical services we've heard positive feedback from students and so we'll have individual and group opportunities and some new online offerings as well in terms of supporting your emotional well-being now moving on and talking more specifically and addressing some questions about testing i want to walk through testing what that looks like on campus so we have been able to throughout the summer work with the city of milwaukee health department and have testing readily available to the population on a drive up and walk in basis after a telehealth visit with one of our nursing staff this allows for point of care testing right on site as well as pcr testing and we've consistently been able to work with the health department and have results back for 20 in 24 to 48 hours a really good question came in related to testing and if they're going to be testing priorities one of the most important things again is that we follow our public health guidelines and that is testing for students that are symptomatic and testing for students that are asymptomatic individuals but have been identified as close contacts we're also working and continue to work to expand our testing through the health center as well as with campus partners an additional question was really related to whether testing is required prior to arrival back on campus testing is not required we do encourage students as we're getting close to move in time and time to be on campus to be really paying attention in terms of their social circles as they're moving in terms of their transition now into the classroom or into the residence halls there were a lot of very specific questions about contact tracing which were also really excellent and thoughtful we are going to be following the close contact guidelines from the cdc and those guidelines are individuals that are within six feet of an of someone for greater than 15 minutes now we've talked about in our classrooms how we worked really really hard in terms of that being an environment where it is unlikely that you would be identified as a close contact we are working very closely with the city of milwaukee health department as well as the north shore health department and waukesha and washington county health department and they will be the primary individuals that are going to be doing the extensive contact tracing that involves contacts both on campus and off campus we will however have some systems in place and when we think about systems we have those systems for both students and for employees where we'll be asking students to report into the dean of students office in terms of if they're covid 19 positive and that is to help facilitate when we're thinking about facilities and cleaning from an environmental standpoint as well as we'll be doing some initial contact with individuals that are identified by someone as a close contact in our communications and how we're working that will be in a de-identified way because there have been again important questions related to confidentiality as related to testing at the health center without release from an individual we will not be communicating specific results we are working and do have a release of information related to university housing because it's really critical as we're all working together and we're working through isolation and quarantine that individuals again follow the guidelines and the guidelines which again with some questions related to that will continue right now to be a requirement for close contacts to be self-quarantined for 14 days and that's regardless of whether an individual has a has a test or not if a test is positive they then will go into self-isolation for 10 days another question that was brought up was will it look different for off-campus students and and on-campus students and in terms of support related to having maths available that will be the same for often on-campus students there will be when we look at testing potentially additional testing in the larger scale residence halls we certainly encourage anybody who's living off campus to be thinking ahead related to the steps that they would personally take if they need to quarantine or self-isolate in addition there were some questions related to individuals that were in situations related to needing child care in situations related to having a higher risk condition and i think as talked about early it was very eloquently described that really the goal is for an individual to be comfortable in terms of identifying for themselves um whether being on campus or being online is a better combination right now our children's learning center is open in terms of the question related to an individual that is looking for child care and that would also be a possibility so that is just an overview of our testing and our contact tracing based on the questions that we received i'm now going to turn this over to our dean of students adam juessel to respond to a question or two related to students on campus thanks dr bonner um just one question for me um so i've got an easy lift here and the question is simple marissa davies asks um uh in april 2020 we were told that faculty will not be requiring um doctor's notes for excuse absences and marissa was wondering are we going to continue that practice and the answer is really simply yes that we are encouraging instructors um to not require those notes so if an instructor does require those notes that's not what we're suggesting that they do and we're also been really impressed with our instructor's flexibility in meeting students where they are so students come with various needs and individualized circumstances so we always encourage folks to reach out to their individual instructors if they have specific needs so thanks for the great question marissa and i'll pass it back over to julie okay we have a few more questions that are related to mass and other really key components in terms of our prevention plan in terms of slowing transmission on campus and i will pass it over to zach to answer those questions good evening everyone cloth face coverings and masks are provide a barrier when worn over your nose and mouth to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air when a person coughs sneezes talks or raises their voice and that protects other people that are within close contact within about six feet everyone at all uwm campuses are going to be required to wear masks and and maintain social distancing masks are worn uh are required in all indoor locations however there are a few exceptions where a student's own health condition prevents the wearing of the face covering and has received an approved exception from the accessibility resource center when in non-shared space or in your own residence hall room when consuming food indoors in a designated eating area with social distancing maintained one question we received was regarding drinking of beverages in non-designated areas students are allowed to lift their face coverings to drink from personal water bottle or other personal beverage containers when indoors do not share bottles to control germ spread and water fountains should be used to fill personal beverage containers but not to drink from lastly face coverings are not required outdoors in situations where six feet of social distancing can be maintained uwm branded face coverings will be provided to students at the beginning of the fall semester and distribution locations will be in the union at the info information center and the housing locations students should bring their own face covering to where on campus a student who cannot afford or obtain a face covering should contact the dean of students office as well as disposable surgical style masks will be available at central locations in most buildings if students forget their mask remember panthers protect panthers i will now pass the floor to rick thomas thank you zach a couple questions have come in relative to how classrooms will be set up or the environment that you can expect in academic facilities and so i'm going to respond to those uh one question specifically said will professors be providing information on how classrooms will be laid out uh and what i can tell you is the classrooms have already been laid out uh for social distancing we anticipate that faculty may provide student students guidance on classrooms and as you should be seeing on your screen right now here's a couple pictures of classrooms set up with social distancing in mind we're going to ask students to fill seats from the front to the back of the room or the farthest from the door uh uh to the the farthest seats first and then leave in the reverse order uh all seats are spaced six feet apart in classrooms where classes will be held and in lecture halls some seats will be covered up and marked to not sit there uh plexiglass will be installed at lecterns as needed and in addition uh all uh face-to-face classes will end 15 minutes early to allow for people to leave the building before the next class arrives uh likewise we had a question about that related to that egress between classes uh and some concern expressed about how we're approaching that what i can say is that each uh a lot of thought has gone into how each very unique building on our campus is being set up to promote social distancing and to limit close contact most building entries will be one way in and one way out by designated doors in some cases hallways will be one way in other cases that's just not realistic so there'll be two ways the rules of the road going forward will be stay to the right just like you do on the highway and that'll be the case for many hallways and stairwells that are two-way signage is being installed to show traffic patterns and remind people of these protocols the risk of virus transmission uh in the few seconds it takes to pass someone in a hall is already pretty low and we're mitigating that further via our mask requirement that you'll have to have a mask on when you're inside the buildings the last question kelly already touched on a bit earlier uh and it was with respect to food uh available in the the union uh and elsewhere on campus and she covered most of that but this question also said the union is huge and always packed around meal times if people are taking their mass off to eat cases will spread well that is true the union is a really busy building normally but with less people on campus both living here working here and taking classes we anticipate that the union will be much less crowded uh we are setting up all of the dining areas for social distancing and uh setting them up so that people will be spread out when they are in the building with that i'll pass it on to melissa to answer a question about cleaning protocols good evening so we want you to know that classrooms will be cleaned and disinfected each day before classes begin while restrooms and other common touch points such as door handles elevators and railings will be cleaned multiple times throughout the day by uwm cleaning staff to support the cleaning we are asking for self-responsibility and people to support cleaning of shared spaces such as desks and classrooms tables in the unions computers in in computer labs cleaning products and disinfectants will be available for use in these spaces students are going to be required to clean their own kitchens and bathrooms within their residential suites so you should plan to bring epa approved cleaning products that are effective against sars cov2 or the virus that causes covid19 some of these cleaning products include bleach or lysol products there was a question that came in regarding doors and whether they can be propped open or whether we have electrically opening doors so doors in uwm buildings that can be left open will be however due to fire code hvac considerations or other safety reasons we aren't able to prop open all doors but we will where we can with the large number of doors on campus we are not able to install automatic openers so we recommend that you either use door use paper towels or other products that can can open a door without touching it or when you touch these common points to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer and we have installed hand sanitizer stations throughout our buildings and in all of our classrooms so i will now pass it back to chancellor moani so that we can address uh questions that have been submitted during this time thank you well we're on that's amazing um we covered uh pretty much all the remaining questions that were out there that came in ahead of time i want to thank our chief student affairs officer kelly and the entire team that has worked so hard on a lot of the physical aspects as well as the behavioral aspects that are critical to everyone's safety at this point we would like to move into the first question and um what we have is a question for tim opkinorth that is from an anonymous person that says will there be alternative option in place like direct deposit to avoid the recent trying to get recent complications facing usps us postal service tim over to you please tim by the way is our director of financial aid thanks chancellor um good afternoon everybody um as far as the direct deposit is not an option for this current fall term the campus has not noticed any kind of disruptions due to the postal service couple examples of that in since march we've mailed about 4 000 refund checks room and board additionally in june in may and june we mailed about nine thousand refund checks for students who qualified for the cares fund so we have not seen any disruptions at this point we've had a few checks returned to us and that was due to a bad address being in the pause system so i would definitely encourage students to make sure that their mailing address is always updated and paused that's great tim that's great tim thank you very much the next question goes to uh adam jussel who's our dean of students you met earlier when students forget to bring mass to classes events and so forth will they be punished thanks that's a that's a great question um and first and foremost we are focusing on education so um you heard zach mentioned earlier we are going to have mass stations around uh various spots on campus and you'll get your own branded uwm mask and so that's the first and foremost is to educate so if a student shows up in class we are asking faculty to first remind them of the policy and then ask them to go get a mask and then we believe that we'll resolve 90 of the conflict if not 99 of the conflict if there are regular or egregious violations that put the health and safety of other students at risk we will use the student conduct process but that process again is really guided around education rather than being punitive so really focused on that proactive measure to help students align their behavior with policies rather than focusing on discipline or punishment i would use thank you adam i would use this opportunity to mention that all students will be provided with panther masks before the start of the school year so look forward to that we'll have a panther branded mask for you when you arrive on campus so that's a great thing we expect those to begin arriving next week the next question is for rick thomas who leads our union enterprise operations the question is uh the studio arts and crafts center website says it is still closed until further notice are there any plans to reopen rick thank you chancellor yes uh we are working on those plans right now the studio arts and crafts center is planning to reopen capacities will be limited but we plan a full set of activities and classes in that space that's wonderful thank you rick the next question is um for uh uh for a single credit this is going to be for um uh d e i'm pulling a blank i'm sorry i'm not sure who helped help me with de is but for a single credit segregated fees are nearly half the cost if campus becomes inaccessible becomes inaccessible due to copic shutdowns or other reasons will the administration guarantee a refund if not why should students trust in taking out loans and paying thousands of dollars for classes activities and resources which are largely inaccessible to them this is for dave clark or uh we could hand this over to kelly hague look at how nimble we are right this is um this is really kind of indicative of how we've approached a lot of our work with this um so i think i spoke a little bit earlier about the way that we have transitioned many of our services and support for students into an online environment and that will continue and we will continue to provide those resources and so and the other thing that i should note is that many of our segregated fees go to to pay for fixed costs things like buildings and staff and those are not able to easily transition and a lot of those staff members will continue to provide services to students remotely so i think with that i think our segregated fees are not able to be refunded thank you kelly i appreciate you stepping in and answering that the next question is for tim oppennorth from anonymous i'm becoming more concerned with potential delays in receiving the excess aid check that i depend on to pay many expenses and bills while in school is the school doing anything to help avoid delays in students receiving these checks prior to the first day of the fall semester a good question at this current time processing continues as normal we will disperse the first batch of financial aid funds 10 days prior to the start of school which is the same as in the past if you are registered have received your financial aid award and accepted all your awards you should receive your financial aid funds prior to the first day of school staff are busy reviewing and processing paperwork as quickly as they can to ensure all funds are processed or disperse the students as quickly as possible thank you tim uh we have one more question that's coming in i'd encourage you if you do have additional questions to use the email chat or listserv to submit your questions we'll go ahead with rick thomas the head of our union enterprise to answer this question the union library and klotchi are some of the most popular areas which are not necessarily dictated by scheduling how will students know if it's worth making the trek from the other side of campus or even the other side of milwaukee if they may be turned away on entry due to social distancing capacities rick thank you chancellor that's a really good question and uh what i can say is we don't have a perfect answer for that but i i believe it is safe to say that with less people living on campus less people being here in total it'll be well worth your effort to go to any one of those destinations there will be limits but there will be significant capacity in each of the spaces that was referenced in this question while the union will be set up as i described earlier in a socially distant manner there'll be ample places to sit plug in your computer uh log on to wi-fi and uh and things like that likewise in the library and in the cloche center there will be ample opportunities to participate in programs and to do personal training uh with uh equipment that will be spaced out in that really large facility wonderful thanks rick at this point the next question is how will the uwm shuttle be handled for people living in kenilworth and cambridge and i think this is probably going to go to either melissa or arsetta i'm not quite sure who can answer this one i will so thank you uh chancellor moani so we have worked out the details for the shuttle um related to cambridge as well as kenneworth so it is our plan to go ahead and support all those students that are living down at kenmore square apartments as well as cambridge commons and you just heard from our said announce who is our director of housing thank you arceda for stepping in and answering that the next question is for uh i believe rick how can large ensembles from peck school of the arts for example the orchestra safely rehearse so our building preparedness and operations team has been working closely with staff in the peck school of the arts to plan for these very activities they are planning to set up rehearsal spaces in socially distant fashion they are looking at bell covers for wind instruments that will mitigate uh airborne droplets [Music] leaving the instruments and for vocal ensembles they are planning to provide what are called a singer's mask which uh is a face covering that is structured to stay away from the face allowing the vocalist to still project uh and uh and move their mouth without interference so all of these things are being planned by our colleagues in the pec school of the arts and we believe we'll allow these things to continue to happen okay thank you rick the next question is uh my question regards the giving of instruction will instructors and teaching assistants be allowed to wear face shields instead of face masks so students may be able to read their lips if needed i believe that would be for either dev or dean gronner or possibly julie bonner our chief medical officer well um i can say that for what arc the accessibility resource center staff are doing is that where instructors in face-to-face classrooms where there is a student whose needs services uh the faculty or the instructor will be wearing a face shield with a covering in the neck so they can actually see the full facial expressions if there are interpreters provided by the accessibility so center they will also have such a face covering um so now maybe uh julie wants to add some more to it dev that it was a a perfect answer in terms of just one example in terms of how we're working out details that may again um be face shields or as an example related to orchestra um paying close attention and to every detail to be able to allow both remaining from a health and safety standpoint in terms of following best practices but also accommodating the needs of individuals so that is a perfect example of just one of the methods and strategies that we're using to try to balance this out as we prepare and plan for the fall well here we are we have as i mentioned at the beginning spent most of the time on your questions both those that were asked ahead of time where we received more than 50 uh and then the 15 or 12 questions that have come in since then what i would like to do as i wrap up is thank you all again for attending uwm and i hope you heard at least three things that came out of today number one our concern for safety and health how we really want to create an environment where you and our faculty and staff together can create an environment that really is among the safer and and more more welcoming environments which you can find yourself we think that through the social distancing mass the classroom uh in and out the plexiglass the dozen or more different behaviors um this is going to be the place to be um that is uh critical for your future in terms of continuing your education and being able to make that difference in the world the second thing that i think you heard is how much we care about you how important you are to us and across all our campuses across all our programs myself having been here for more than 30 years and the individuals who you've heard from today who have invested their lives and so much effort into caring for students and really wanting to to take care of and educate the future generations we know how important that is and i hope that that clearly came through uh to you and then uh finally just how many people have been involved with the planning i don't think there was any question that was asked or would be any question that we haven't really looked at um in in so many different ways i want to assure you we're going to continue to monitor we're going to continue to evaluate and importantly we'll continue to communicate with so many different elements that have come forward on the communication front you can find a playback of this on a youtube video that is available at uwm.edu chancellor once again the playback of this and uh share it with with others who may be interested is uwm.edu chancellor we will reinforce the questions that were asked today in our faqs uh that are at the website that i mentioned earlier which is uwm.edu coronavirus so at this point i want to thank you for joining us today hope we've done a great job answering your questions i want to thank everybody who participated both students our faculty and staff alike thanks everybody have a great rest of your week we look forward to seeing you in just a little bit more than two weeks take care bye-bye you
