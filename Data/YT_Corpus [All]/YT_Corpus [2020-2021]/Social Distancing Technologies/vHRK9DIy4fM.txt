 over the last couple of weeks hunkered down in our homes protecting ourselves and our families from a highly contagious virus we've stayed connected to family and co-workers over screens business meetings check-ins with Grandma and Grandpa and get-togethers with friends all conducted with a device a Wi-Fi connection and often with one platform suddenly booming in popularity NBC's Jolene Kent has our Sunday spotlight as cities go into quarantine and schools shut down across the country to help fight the spread of coronavirus our houses and apartments are becoming a new kind of home base with stay-at-home orders the new norm videoconferencing has become the gathering place for those of us craving a social connection a place for birthday parties and we can't get together a welcome window into the weddings and celebrations we suddenly can't attend future doctors find out are these matched for residency at the center of this new reality is zoom a nine-year-old video conferencing platform that was originally built for business meetings this month it's been downloaded almost two and a half million times in the US alone more than Facebook Instagram snapchat and tick tock this week hey Eric CEO Eric un founded zoom he never imagined his video conferencing startup would become the source of so much joy in a public health crisis it's become a part of the way that we socialize what do you think all this says about where we are as a society right now I think the community society is to become much stronger and as a truce like this zoom we know that and much better than just the audio conferencing because we can see each other that has catapulted zoom into the mainstream joining well-known competitors like FaceTime Skype and Google Hangouts its features like changing the background how about this way are a hit with Generation Z and in the future absolutely believe the video conferencing like a zoom can even delay a much better experience if you are drinking a coffee we can digitize the smell and for my side I even can enjoy the smell as well and it's not just zoom Skype says calls between its users have jumped 134 percent with so many people logging on from home all this videoconferencing and work is also raising new questions about how much the Internet can really handle Netflix YouTube Amazon and Apple recently decided to reduce the quality of their streaming services in Europe to help handle the demand a move that hasn't happened here in the US yet but there has been a surge in hard-hit Seattle the internet usage has skyrocketed 40 percent since the corona virus started spreading but FCC chair Ajit PI doesn't think the spike will break the Internet or slow it down if they're not capable of handling all of this traffic in demand thus far it appears to be and part of the reason is instead of going from point to point for example as the old telephone system did the internet routes traffic according to the path of least resistance so to speak so that if there's congestion in one path the internet trick can ship that traffic to another path and that's good to hear as we depend on the Internet to keep us together while we're a part [Music] so Joe we're all using these services right now we're all using these platforms I guess one question that's still out there is security internet security if you're conducting business meetings what exactly are cautions people should be taking what can be done yeah Willie you want to be watching out for weak passwords unsecured Wi-Fi connections and phishing scams we've also seen some cases where inappropriate content has been broadcast into these video conferences like on zoom so the bottom line is if your work provides a virtual private network a VPN use that however we don't know with so many people logging in for big government agencies and big businesses if there's enough bandwidth and if the systems can really handle all of this so the bottom line Willie is we just don't have a full picture just yet and all of us in the news business getting used to these socially distant interactions as well Joe take care and hope your family's healthy we'll see you soon you
