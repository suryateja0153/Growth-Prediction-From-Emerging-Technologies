I THINK THAT WHAT THIS COMPANY HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEY HAVE EXISTING PROGRAMS IN PLACES LIKE MILE HIGH STADIUM IN DENVER STAPLES CENTER IN LOS ANGELES BUT THEY'RE WORKING ON A NEW PROGRAM. IT'S SOMETHING THAT TO LOCAL BUSINESSES HERE IN SAN DIEGO ARE NOW CONSIDERING SOMETHING EVEN A LOCAL TOURIST HOT SPOT HAS ON ITS RADAR. AS WEEKS DRAG OR MORE PEOPLE SEEM TO BE VENTURING OUT. IT'S LIKE THE NEW NORMAL NOW SO I CAN JUST TELL EVERYBODY IS GOING TO DO AND THEY KNOW TO STAY 6 FEET APART IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT'S AN UBER BUSINESSES NEED TO BE SURE PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES KALEN WELL TO SAN DIEGO COMPANY FASTEN SIR HELP PRODUCE A PROGRAM CALLED ACTIVE DISTANCE ALERT AND MONITORING.
