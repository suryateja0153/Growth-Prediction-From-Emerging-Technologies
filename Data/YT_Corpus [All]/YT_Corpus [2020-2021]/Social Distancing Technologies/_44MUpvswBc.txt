you're doing that communicate with all of your vendors have them send you product photos and product images so you can get started on that if you need to find a new point of sale system you got to hunt that down to make sure that it's going to connect with your website great websites to look at would be websites 360 WooCommerce whoo three sixty Shopify these are all incredible platforms that connect with a lot of point-of-sale systems so that's another thing you can look at you've got to just make sure that you are online as soon as possible because that's really what's going to keep you around during this time you can't always rely on foot traffic sometimes it's a pandemic other times it's a snowstorm but if you're online then you've got a 24 hour salesman who's cell your product all
