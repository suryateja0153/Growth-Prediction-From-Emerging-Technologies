 entertainment venues are still closed under the governor's order that is hitting local companies hard but one is using technology to make sure their customers will follow social distancing guidelines News 13s Courtney Allen joins us tonight live from her home with details Courtney was only open for six weeks before the pandemic shut it down there now redesigning their experience to make sure everybody who comes back to play is able to do so safely new games designed to keep people apart very clear lines of sides and keeping people a distance with zero touch you don't have to touch any controls or any surfaces we're taking advantage of that as a very safe environment to get out of the house and still have fun or the new norm at electric play house an entertainment venue near Coors and i40 that just opened in February our space was kind of uniquely built for something like this with 18,000 square feet of playing space founder John Mark Collins says they're able to adapt to new kovat safe practices well we didn't plan for pandemic in terms of design but it's really actually something that I think we have we have that's a key differentiator in terms of finding a safe place to play with your family Collins uses custom software to create games software allows us to like make sure that we're hitting the requirements exactly or beyond for example they've reduced dining room seating from 24 at a table to 10 what seats 6 feet apart here we can coordinate exactly as opposed to kind of letting people to their vices and maybe getting too close or not knowing the bounds games track people's motion keeping players as far away as possible push them in an area that'll keep them at a good distance away from the other players they've also put up nets and are limiting families to one hour of play when they're allowed to reopen only your family can play one game for a little while and then rotate out with another family it allows us both to have a little better flow but also be able to sanitize in between so we really do have a staged experience now that before was maybe a little more freeform Collins says he's ready to debut their new approach yes I think people can have maybe even a better time than they did before while also being cleaner and safer colin says during the pandemic there's out there sales are down to almost zero when he's had to lay off most of his employees but he says that he is hopeful that they will be allowed to reopen fully by the middle of June Dean back to you all right Courtney thank you yeah wolf says it has also begun a series of upgrades sanitizing the entire exhibition and creating new themes they say they will announce more social distancing policies as well as contact free ways to purchase tickets check in and enjoy their exhibit closer to their opening date
