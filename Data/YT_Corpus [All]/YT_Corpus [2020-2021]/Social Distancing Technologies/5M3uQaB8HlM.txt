 welcome to the global pulse a short video series where our experts break down a trending topic in international business and why it matters to you as we all face the challenge this global pandemic has given us we think about kind of the role technology is playing and not only helping us be productive as we deal with this pandemic but what impact it means to having us kind of be more connected in a global economy so I think the first thing is to recognize that we've become increasingly digital this has been something that's been happening a transformation for many years but I think in many ways the ROO realities of kind of working from home and social distancing but trying to be productive and connected to people through technology has given us kind of just an incredible leap forward when it comes to technology adoption so any laggards that may have been kind of holding on to old ways of doing a business now find that they need these digital tools necessary to go ahead and stay connected not only with those across the globe but frankly even those that might live in their own neighborhood as they try to stay connected and productive while keeping social distancing so first thing is digital tools the second thing is these digital tools require us to go ahead and rely more on our global communications infrastructure to send information around the globe and our reliance on technologies like the internet and wireless technologies mobile technologies are no more important now than ever whether it's the data that's being collected to go ahead and help us identify and attack problems related to kovat 19 redeployed resources in the supply chain or medical personnel and resources we need this communications infrastructure to keep us connected keep us informed and for the lessons learned in one part of the world to affect and change the way we approach this pandemic in other parts of the world so because of that we have to think differently about the way we manage our global technology from a governance as well as kind of a resource allocation the internet for example streaming services have been downgraded in many countries from high-definition television to standard definition you know whatever preserve some of this Internet bandwidth so that we can use it for more essential communication needs and certainly this is a time where we need to think about the role that technology plays to help with public health and keeping us connected so being digital is one staying globally connected through networks is number two but I think the third and perhaps most transformative impact that this technology is playing in the space is just recognizing that we can form relationships and continue on with business across kind of geographic boundaries and kind of bring us all together so unlike you know maybe in times past where we can go ahead and focus on face to face communication we're now adopting kind of almost a level setting kind of playing fields of ways in which we can communicate digitally with our partners who might be down the street or across the globe I know in the quest program we have a collaboration going on with entrepreneurs in Africa and students have been working with them kind of internationally across boundaries using technologies like whatsapp and Google Hangouts and clearly those technologies that are used are now being used for us to kind of communicate with people down the street and not only people across the globe so again more globally interconnected means of technology as well so I think while this pandemic has so many negative implications and and my heart goes out to those people who are suffering or have loved ones that are suffering we do see technology kind of really helping us not only cope with the changes that are taking place but give us new and innovative ways to collaborate and be more connected globally through information technology
