 it's definitely being crazy to say the least captain Shaw needed the surprise it's just pure joy I love this place so much Chaza senior who cheered for 14 years with pro spirit a McKinney gym with 400 cheerleaders and 11 teams the posterior banquette has always been a really big deal when the pandemic cancelled their year-end banquet we love the kids the coaches still wanted to celebrate the kids they're our number one focus so they came up with this this is the drive through memory lane a drive through banquet looking back at memories from a successful season so we just wanted to be able to safely and award them and just shown that we love them and we're here for them I don't know how many times you get to drive through your gym Allison stank which is the parent of a cheerleader we've had a lot of parents come through who had tears of joy especially for the seniors they put so much work into that I can tell Camden Shaw says this gym taught her so many life lessons and her final lesson pulled up tonight after 14 years I'm so thankful that they did this for us there are still ways to smile even in the hard times maybe all it takes is a trip down memory leg I'm really glad that they did this and that I get a final last memory that's really positive here in the gym and that I'll remember forever in McKinney I'm Alex Rosie
