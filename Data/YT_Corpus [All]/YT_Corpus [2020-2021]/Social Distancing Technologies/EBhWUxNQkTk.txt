 So good morning we're gonna talk mostly today about herd immunity and get a little bit more into detail on that it is with discussions with Janice that I began to realize that all of us approach some of these concepts from very very different perspectives previous items that we've covered yesterday for example was heart damage direct versus indirect or both and what that means in terms of long term treatment and prevention with COVID-19 another one we've covered I think it was last week COVID silver linings we've talked a couple of times about telemedicine options and we've done other updates like ACE receptor inhibitors a receptor medication updates are about the New Zealand concept of squashing the curve with some very aggressive transmission and herd immunity concepts again which we'll talk about today in New Zealand there's their squashed squashing the curve with four weeks of lockdown including no hunting in the bush massive public response to a call in or call in of those that are not following a lockdown will cover we'll start with a couple of videos that have gone going gone viral pardon the pun but first Carl why don't you give us our intro so thanks Carl we're gonna do a couple of videos to start off this discussion the first one is the mousetrap transmission model it was developed by the Ohio State University and again went viral it's been picked up by a lot of news stations as well as the Dare BHO Carl do you want to show that one the next is a video that helps understand helps us understand a little bit more about droplet versus aerosol transmission you'll see at the end of this video there's some places along the floor next to the person where three or four feet away and that's droplet transmission the other part though is aerosol transmission where the person was exposed to the virus over in the other aisle I'm talking about grocery stores and somebody coughing in the next aisle this was a mathematical model Carl do you want to show that video next are we back on my screen Carl thanks so we're back on my screen oh yeah okay so we're gonna do our QA a little bit differently this time it's a little bit disorienting for some folks for questions to just come out of left field we'll do that but before but before we do that we'll cover a few questions while Janice is still here she's gonna leave early and I'll cover a few of the left-field questions but we want to start off with about 10 minutes of Q&A after our discussion and that Q&A should focus on things like okay who's in your herd what decisions are you making for seeing extended family like when you're seeing your grandkids or in-laws things like that what's the difference between disease and vaccine because these next couple of questions start getting into some understanding some of the concepts that were we've raised today with these two videos and we'll raise with these next couple of slides for example let's start thinking about that are not that reproductive index what's the difference in the reproductive index having the disease versus having the vaccine both ways you've got the the antibody right distancing versus vaccine medication versus antibody supplements versus antibody ventilators and hospitals versus antibody so again as we start thinking about all the different ways that this can be transmitted and more importantly all the different ways that we can slow down transmission to others these are some of the things that we need to think about the supplements slow down transmission well you could argue maybe both sides of that medications clearly don't distancing clearly slows down that and herd immunity yes that slows it down as well so you want to go that you want to take the first line yes so today I wanted to portray more graphic images of what herd immunity is we've heard this in the news we've talked about it ourselves but the more you think about the concept the more complicated it can get when you start asking questions about it so that these images I found on Harvard Health and so in this case these are pictures of vaccinations vaccination protects you from disease so in the middle in the gray area you see the herd and you see more of the dark blue vaccinated circles than the light blue unvaccinated and then this herd immunity also protects well it protects unvaccinated people in your community on the perimeter and I think this is kind of like the final picture that we're starting with you see a lot of sick people around the perimeter but we'll talk about how this halt how this all interacts in the next few slides before we do just a question on this why are you talking about vaccines there is a nice thing for COVID right so to translate that what we're going through right now with COVID-19 is we will assume that the vaccinated are the people that have had COVID have survived and have the antibody we don't have a current vaccine if that becomes available that would also apply ok so let's that gets back to one of the questions we talked about earlier what's the difference in terms of somebody having a vaccine versus having the antibody or having had the disease I'll let you answer that either way either way they've got the disease I mean I've got the antibody they've got adaptive immunity they're not going to transmit that to someone else now the big difference is somebody who's already had the disease went through this cycle of being able to transmit the disease I need somebody that's had a vaccine has not yeah and you can get even more specific in the past with flu vaccines we've had we've had live vaccines obviously having had the disease is it live occurrence but we don't want to go down that bunny trail I thought you were trying to hint that no not at all I'm just saying you know if somebody just dowels in and here's you're talking about a vaccine and COVID just like well what are you talking about yeah oh yes so now we're beginning to see how disease spreads without herd immunity our colors changed a bit didn't they from blue to brown but we start out with an unvaccinated population on the left then we have what should be now is portrayed as brown dots should have been the dark blue dots correct no no so what's going on this is how disease spreads without herd immunity and here's what we're talking about the group that we're going to be very interested in is this group in the middle as you see there's sort of a moat a barrier around the rest of this group so for example you could consider this to be your mother's nursing home that herd or you consider this to be you and me and Ozzie yeah you're our little family hurt or my family my extended family at home with my sister her husband my mom and whether or not you know the grandkids are joining and stuff like that now this is basically demonstrating what happens without herd immunity once these folks get infected they just continue to pass the infection right on around and these folks continue to pass the infection right on through there as well is the more isolated perimeter the circle in the middle starts getting conflated you know starts introducing illness from the outside correct because there is no barrier here in terms of you know the people that come in and work in the nursing home they go home to their own families they go home to their home their own families they go to shopping or whatever they get infected and then they bring it into the nursing home okay that's why we have a brownish slide I guess our brain is a blend I think it should all be red okay I yeah focused on colors there ya know so here's herd immunity you want to you want to take that you want me to um well so we have now we have the vaccinated largely vaccinated herd in the middle which is the dark blue and that's what I was trying to discern from the previous slide you still have some and unvaccinated folks think about your own family with the flu vaccine not everyone in our immediate family gets that vaccine every year so in our third we do have a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated but there's a protective some protection for the people that are even unvaccinated if they are just in their herd now obviously if they go out to work etc like right now you and I are in a herd of basically almost like a quarantine because we're only going out once every three weeks to pick up groceries we still have that potential exposure though we do have children that are working in the workforce we do not have a grocery store we do not invite them into our house nor have we entered their house we have only seen them from six feet apart which is now long no longer the safe distance according to the CDC they've expanded that distance to 12 or 13 feet so in this initial picture that's what you're seeing you're seeing a herd with the majority being vaccinated with some unvaccinated which is a true picture of reality why don't you go on to the next slide well before we do let me just make a couple of other comments let's go back to that original concept the herd that we're talking about is this group in the middle consider that an extent a family unit or a nursing home a herd a group of people or workplace or workforce now again with each herd we've got some potential ways of exposure to the rest of the outside world and in this group the herd was protected this time because the areas where there was any potential exposure to the outside world were already already had the antibody so they were not gonna get sick when the rest of the world got sick and so therefore they were not going to transmit it to the susceptibles that were in the herd so with herd immunity you've got enough people that are no longer susceptible to where they protect and create a barrier between those that are susceptible and those that are getting the virus out in the rest of the world okay and that's how you have you have it at the end where the rest of the world's gotten infected but not the members of the not the susceptible uninfected members of the herd because they were protected by those members of the herd that already had antibodies and then I transmit it and then on the perimeter the unvaccinated people for the people outside the herd getting sick correct which is why you have that growing red pattern so here's a critical question for COVID-19 or coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and that is how much do you need in terms of people with that are no with the antibody either vaccinated or having had the disease how many do you need in order to protect these folks and they're making a really good point here so again in this model the the connection point they're showing between the outside world and the herd is right here and here and they're showing that there's fewer vaccinated or fewer people with the antibody in the herd in this slide compared to the first slide correct so you see there's more people that are on it that don't have the antibody the potential three or four places that are hitting a connection are right here one of them is not does not the antibody in this case you had more people that had the antibody and all four of them had the antibody here that's a connection at their connection point so it stops at that connection point in this one it didn't stop at this connection point this person became infected transmitted due to this one they're transmitted to this one who transmitted to this one this one this one this one this one this one so now the ones that were previously protected by the herd in this lack of proportion or small proportion of people with antibody and they're interfacing the unvaccinated on the inside with the unvaccinated on the outside now there's transmission right now we begin to see the people in the herd in that center gray spot so one of the core concepts of herd immunity is this whenever there's an opportunity for transmission to enter the herd the real question is does that connection person already have the antibody or a bang not for the best thing yeah now we're talking a few minutes about how they how contagious a virus is and the more contagious that is the more it can jump you know the easier the harder it is to to maintain herd immunity and that's why I hear so many challenges about you know perhaps with some other diseases 20-30 percent might contribute significantly to herd immunity but not for this disease because it's too easily transmitted mm-hmm and that gets back to how many person each person infects once it enters the herd right that rate right and that changes depending upon so if you go back and you look if you've got this many people a large number of them are already already have the antibody then there are not or the the reproductive index is going to be lower can you give a quick definition of that for the audience it's very simple it's the number of people you infect on average so we've talked about an estimate for COVID-19 was 3 and the next question is within how many days and we can quibble over whether it's three days or five days but if it's a factor an index of three in a turnover time of three days then one person gets infected today three days later there are three more people and then it keeps building from there right and then three days after that there are three people for each of those so that's four times 3 which is 12 12 right I know a simple explanation so if you were to look at the last graph with the infection going on this one yes this looked more like a one-to-one or not of one like the you can arrow that first one for with the where it enters yeah we don't know the time span for this but there's not widespread infection in that herd so it looks like maybe that one infected one person and that one person infected the next one otherwise if it had a quick reproductive rate you would probably see get to this faster this last picture faster and we don't know what the rate is we have if it was two days very infectious three to five days and again three to five people and again so yes in it's an average so your point was in this first one this first one only infected one person but this person infected one yeah and then the next person looks like they infected four so so you know you draw the average of four and one and one and then it's clearly more than one for the reproductive index a lot of discussion obviously about herd immunity and you've heard multiple times again pardon me for even I won't even name the net but somebody who's been very involved and gotten a lot of press on this and said in fact multiple people have said it's gonna have to be more like a I heard immunity of 50% to start slowing down to get this controllable okay well 50% on infection rate for this before a vaccine before the vaccine 50% means in the US 150 million people becoming infected with this before we start seeing significant herd immunity any comments from public health change public health person you think that's realistic you think it's unrealistic well I was gonna say one way this plays out in what we're seeing in our states is like yesterday for the first time we had new deaths here in Kentucky now some people might jump to the conclusion that it's already flattening now but you explain that a little bit yesterday you want to take that on I don't remember well we're not having okay it showed a drop in one day a number of new cases and zero deaths that does that mean that that graph is on the downward trend at this point that's what I want me to address oh that's a really good point because all bears on whether the economy should open up we're gonna touch on next week so now let's have your input on that obviously there's a huge amount about the economy but on this trend there's a huge huge debate right now as we started to see some decrease or some slowing in the increase in some places like New York and maybe even a decrease in a couple of other places you started to get the perception that okay we're starting maybe we have started slowing this transmission the guys that get pinged on this Tony Fauci and I can't remember the name of the CDC director I mean both of them are saying the same thing and I think most of us would agree New York's not at the same place in this epoch as Kentucky so number one it's gonna vary quite a bit by geography now once you get involved once you start looking at that geographic difference in timing then there's there's simple there's some simple issues once you start coming back down you start realizing okay we have slowed down that level of transmission that outbreak but again you got to go back to this herd immunity thing do we have herd immunity is it going to crank back up are we going to see round two or not we don't know and there even within communities like Westchester was the first in New York to have that little epicenter in Westchester and a lot of people had it that had contact with that first person right I don't know if he had traveled now they may have a much higher antibody in that little small group but that's not like all of New York so even within groups or subgroups so I've early transmission and I know I guess what we're saying is you can't jump to the you can't jump with seeing a one-day trend of decrease incidences that we are coming back from this and we can make policy around that because even within a state there's all different rates of transmission well as it all gets back to that theme and theory that you heard over and over again at Hopkins and that is it's all denominator medicine and the group you talked about that was a synagogue their churches in South Korea where this virus got amplified dramatically so that specific denominator in that case that a place of worship that synagogue that that church they may have they may have developed some herd immunity within that population right but not within the whole country or in their state or in their state okay good again this starts to raise this whole issue of where it's becoming a political battle you've got regional governors being together and saying we're gonna have this decision made on science not on politics and then the president saying no this is a political decision we're gonna go ahead and crank up and for pure economics or this and you saying tons of this debate going on and and yet again the missing link here is testing without full-blown testing which they did do in other countries they knew who had the antibody right we have no information we're trying to gaze into the crystal ball and until we have and until we know see that's part of the problem to get back to your point the point you're bringing up we don't know whose dark blue and light blue we just know who's been sick and we just know who's been sick and so until we know whose dark blue and luckily yeah and right now that's what not even a tenth of a percent it's so small it's clearly not enough to create any kind of herd immunity no matter how contagious or infectious so until we start developing reliable available access to testing we're flying blind in terms of this concern we're not blind in terms of knowing we don't have herd immunity that is not out there yet have you heard about the Swedish experiment I saw that briefly I basically they're saying I'm not showing the video but basically they're tending more to say look you know what continue to go to school we're not closing anything we're just going to walk through this and develop herd immunity interesting concept okay so back to the questions we said we're going to spend about ten minutes while Janice was still here going through your answers to these questions who's in your herd what decisions are you making for seeing extended family what's the difference between having the disease and the vaccine in terms of herd immunity the disease in the vaccine distancing versus vaccine medication versus antibody again all of these are different concepts that impact slowing that transmission does medications slow down the transmission no no it's a medication is after you've already gotten the disease you've already knew you're sick you've already started spreading this long before you were sick well we don't even know what medication works people there's different trials going on well I mean and that's my point and we're so focused on what medications work whether or not ventilators make it worse or better okay and in terms of this issue trying to deal with you ask for Whom the Bell Tolls it tolls for you for all of us in other words this is a herd issue whether we want to deal with it or not or acknowledge that a lot treatments are not going to impact this the biggest thing that we're focusing on we can make sure the chat room is what choices are you making to protect your herd how are you do this how are you doing this in regards to seeing extended family a lot of people out there want to see their grandchildren or relatives they don't live with how are you choosing to protect yourself what choices are you making about going out in the public to shop so I think that's we're gonna choose those questions out of this and then later on address the other ones regarding vitamin supplements so we are looking for those answers okay let's clear this one out and Dave Murphy good morning to your daughter as well oh right so we saw our daughter this Easter ah you gonna tell him how we did that he is via site via Skype we maintained distancing so she couldn't transfer to us we couldn't transfer to her she's in Santiago for those of you who gotten that Bart Robinson good morning to all as well Dave Murphy thank you so much thanks Doc for keeping us updated and informed thank you again for your contribution to help us get that information out there Alan Crews super sticker thank you again I appreciate the again helping us make this information available folks for Fergus Courtney high doses of vitamin C being suggested to help limit the effects of the virus if infected and also something called serrapeptase proteolytic enzyme being suggested clear severe mucus in your lungs so we we brought that up supplements is a big big deal everybody so many people are focused on supplements what does supplements have to do with decreasing transmission not a whole lot not a whole lot they're certain they're more like treatments and again supplements and treatments are important but in terms of actually protecting us from transmission and prevention maybe it helps decrease it maybe it helps your immune system so that you're not as likely to get a significant severe infection but it's not going to slow down transmission Dave Murphy I don't know about COVID but I've had good results except it takes replacing my allergy meds would getting plasma from someone who's recovered the same being the same as having recovered yourself that's a good question okay so when we're giving yes and no here's the thing I don't see they're giving us antibody let me give you an example I think is it rabies that we do this with giving someone an antibody from folks that have had the infection is a treatment it's rarely if ever given as a vaccine itself because we clear the it if we get antibodies injected into us we clear those antibiotics within a matter of weeks even days so it's not gonna help us to get someone else's antibody we have to start developing our own antibody from a transmission perspective that was a great question C Lear Hydniq hi Mr. and Mrs. Brewer well Janice goes by Derrickson but thank you hello good to see you are totally asymptomatic people perpetually contagious or they quickly kill their virus and a little danger to others you want to go for that one you know me too well they're asymptomatic they have the virus they just don't have the full-blown symptoms you and I are asymptomatic but we're assuming we're exposed it's correct and I think that's part of the assumption that Joseph Paige is making here someone who is infected not just exposed but infected are they perpetually contagious or have they quickly killed their viruses and a little danger to others have you ever heard the term Typhoid Mary Typhoid Mary was a household worker a maid cook child care person in New York she had had infection with typhus or typhoid fever and she had not cleared it she had not developed a completely inappropriate antibody so she was still continually shedding that what is a cluster identifying the bacteria yeah so she could because of that a lot of her the kids and the families that she worked with and adults both died came down with the infection so that's where this concern comes from in it and also you hear this more recently even in this epidemic labeled as a "super spreader" now here's the question how big of this is how big a super spreader concept for this one we don't really know yet a few weeks ago we thought super spreaders were a really big deal now I'm not so sure you're not hearing or seeing a whole lot about it now  here's another point when you when you put totally "asymptomatic" it's sort of hits me that you're implying that if somebody doesn't have significant if they have no symptoms at all then they really never got infected the reality is that most of the Typhoid Mary types most of the super spreaders have had some symptoms at one point in time or another well at least with other disease we don't know enough about this disease to know for sure but again you'll typically see that maybe they had enough symptoms to think they had a cold or something so I don't really think that that it's a signal that this thing about having those symptoms is significant some of them have little to no symptoms at all most of them never noticed that they have symptoms there's a couple up there I saw where this the drollery page they know so we're staying this is Dave Murphy we're staying away from their extended family at this point did high risk people in extended family and my wife and I are essentials so still working every day that's a big deal I'm assuming your essentials I'm assuming you're working in that truck that rig we've had issues as people start to get their heads wrapped around this issue I've had family members where you had a 19-year old lady a 7 and 2 70-year-olds in two generations skip the generation the younger ones 13 and 15-year-olds to visit grandchildren ya grandchildren great-grandchildren came in to visit they had been living with the fourth generation in between those their father was going and their father was going to work and it's like wait a minute how airtight is that well and I do want to emphasize it's a very difficult choice and it's hard to wrap your head around this herd immunity and maintaining distance and you know there's people that don't have a choice they have young adults living in their house they were already living ours are living outside of the home and we've mentioned previously we met one at a empty shopping outlet and walked with him about 10 feet apart and then our daughter who lives overseas well we Zoom we act now we Skyped with the whole family on our celebration which is Easter over the weekend but it's a difficult choice especially if you live in the same town as for instance grandchildren or even children uh our son lived though this two years ago any work aggressive yeah what if he lived with us now and work at the grocery not put in that no and so I know when a be little was the the decision-making that goes into that  147DegreesWest there she's in Alaska by the way good good to talk to good to hear from you neat we just stay home I have a big yard my son and I are clearing to put a garden in this year that's a good project to be working on right now Kevin McChord Doc McChord's a preventive medicine doc just south of Cincinnati we've been staying on the ranch avoiding contact out in public we've minimized outdoor contact with others always maintain physical distancing observing the Kentucky Healthy at Home campaign in the comments about health and home gyms are Healthy at Home well that's what our governor put into place and you know each week things have tightened up you know I'm closing non-essentials closing the malls weeks ago to closing the arts tighter and tighter you know closing the schools with school year so they originally started calling it social distancing and then they recognized and they got a lot of pushback we're trying to increase our social interaction or maintain it as much as possible but we just don't we want to physical distance and so they wanted a positive term on that that's what they got Healthy at Home I think it's a great term James Kantor why did we call the title of the video mousetrap well that's not the title that we gave it we didn't come up with the video a high estate did and they called it mousetrap there you maybe even show it again okay let me see if because I know I don't think everyone okay can you see that Carl early there yeah do you want me to show the video or yes please I'll show it see these are mouse traps James those are mouse traps popping up into the air each of those is a mousetrap for the ping pong ball that in itself can open up discussion so James back to your point those were the mechanism there was golf balls sitting on top of a mousetrap I'm sorry ping-pong balls sitting on top of a mousetrap that's why it was called that now you said that brought up a couple of comments and some of the comments we discussed yesterday you want to bring that up well you know the obvious thing they were showing was the effect of physical distancing right but with the first one where there was no distance you know it was a rapid pace that all these ping-pong balls went up in the air right they interacted with each other very quickly got a little vibration and they all went up the question is the methodology they threw one ping-pong ball into the midst is that one ping-pong ball or infected person and the wrestler uninflected and then they explode but what we're living through net right now are many ping pong balls being thrown onto the mousetraps I mean that's one thing I noticed that makes it a little harder for physical distancing well you even have to you really just need to quarantine yeah it's unavoidable to me the biggest question is in terms of methodology and analogy and how well does that spread over is are we actually distancing as much as the distance between those the first one and the second in the first one they were adjacent to each other okay in the second one they look like they're only six inches apart which makes you feel like well you know that's not that far apart but the reality is nothing the beans yeah they're ping-pong balls and mousetraps and there was a significant amount of space between those it's probably more than six feet if you translated yeah probably that was part of my point the other part of my point though I think is actually more analogous than the Harvard slides and that is when you saw that ping-pong ball bounce through on the second round it clearly still could have hit but even hit it hit it wasn't likely to hit a whole lot of people and that's really much more analogous to what we've got going on here if there's no way we can totally protect ourselves if we don't get groceries we don't eat we'll starve them back so we've got we've got to have some way of getting groceries and the first responders can forget themselves at all the first is my understand particularly census all nor right well if you look at the pictures of traffic in New York today versus six months ago or the traffic in Wuhan China in February versus back less July totally different right so yes there was no way to totally assure that that ping-pong ball was not gonna hit another trap just the fact that we spread it out significantly greatly decreased that chaotic explosion that we saw never stir yes we art society has changed maybe not overnight but over the last two months yeah now then you get to the other side of that same question and that is okay let's say we do this how long can we keep that up and there we're safe dropping the ping-pong balls again or going back out or are we safe pushing all of the mousetraps right back together again that's what we're considering is right now that's the debate can isn't safe now to push all of the ping-pong balls back together well the other thing that we haven't addressed is they space those mousetraps equidistant apart right and that's not what's that's not the reality of society not there at reality among states it's not the reality within states or within families right so that is ideal it is and it's again assuming some things that are just maybe not realistic so Fergus Courtney in Ireland we're told stay-at-home only essential limited journeys must be made shop for food meds banking 2 kilometer radius from home for exercise is loosely monitored but widely appeared by the Irish physical distancing and good sense of sanitation sanitization sanitation I'm gonna bring up banks for just a minute I think more and more people are using at least what we have in this country is the ability to take a picture of the check button back with the endorsement and deposit instead of going to banks and you know lining up using the plastic canisters that every one cultures so again more here we go I wanted to go I tried e-gym out you're not a good job but yeah we never did that now you're doing it well actually Jane Jane making deposits around Slough time anyways like a drive-thru pharmacy versus pickup so then that is helping a little bit and Ferguson's mentioning another one of your favorite items proper washing of hands the soapy water is mentioned counsel and I do want to bring up the CDC now says take off your outdoor shoes it comes in on the shoes you know that's a hard one for Ford it's difficult man washing was hard enough all right okay Kevin Dr. McChord again concerned that many people may be minimally symptomatic and spread the virus without knowing fully expect to see some hot spots re-emerge over the coming months when people return to work no question and I think that is the major issue here and that is if you if the majority of cases don't have COVID my team they just have more of a cold to upper respiratory or minimal infections then there's transmission going on within all of these different places that we've seen even though we've shut down there's still some minimal transition a transmission all you have to do is push all those mousetraps right back together again and then we start seeing the chaos in the pocket Dave Murphy off to work stay safe I have to watch the rest of this when I get back good luck Dave good luck and thank you so much for what you do Hydniq I still think it's an airborne virus so six feet is fine as long as not facing each other try not to be in a closed space for a long time outside is best better if there is wind or air movement I would agree with a lot of what you're saying Hydniq but here's maybe you're not saying this I don't think I don't know the six feet is fine I think that baby sees nothing they're saying okay you want to take that yeah so like James to saying the CDC is saying look six feet and people are getting at 13 feet away so it's not just what we call droplet transmission droplet if I remember that video in the in the grocery store correctly the droplets were the things that were in the same aisle anyway yeah that was a good but the but the aerosol was it went to the next line okay Carl why don't you show that again oh which one the grocery here wait a minute okay go ahead so thanks again Carl and as you see Janice left but it was a good idea to go back and show that again I haven't reviewed the background on that video well enough to know this for sure but what struck me was it appeared that the blue was what we call droplets and the green was aerosol aerosol can travel throughout the air it doesn't settle out so much droplets on the other hand are much larger usually particle or water attention to water particles and they hit the floor they'll also land on the the cans of groceries you know the the milk carton the outsides of the cartons things like that so we have okay let me see if I can find this now sorry if I've missed if I've jumped your comments okay Reidar Andersen good morning Dr. Brewer at 73 I have two pneumonia vaccines ten years apart do they help if the virus attacks me never had pneumonia then no meds and in good shape 300 plus hours exercise yearly big fan well thank you Reidar Mr. Andersen how much will it protect you I don't think we know enough yet regarding the combination of this specific virus and the pneumonia vaccine my guess is it probably will because as we saw before and we've seen multiple times even if you have relatively few symptoms associated with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 you still tend to show what we call a ground-glass extra chest X-ray which means you're still getting inflammation in your lungs down into lower airways the alveoli the air pockets now that is a significant set up for pneumonia especially for 70-year-olds so 60 in a buck so yes I think it's likely to help but again just there's we don't know enough about it to have scientific evidence I'm clearly keeping mine Karen and we're recommending it Karen Black 51 year-old woman who had face shingles in March do you think I'm more susceptible to get COVID-19 here's the question shingles as you know is related to a very specific type of immunity breaking down as we get older it's from a childhood virus instead of totally eradicating that virus in there our body that virus gets beaten back into the what we call the nerve ganglia and as we get through episodes may be under stress for example that virus can replicate and go back out that's why you tend to see it in like along the face you know just a one area what's its called a dermatome where that nerve supplies it it grows back out that nerve sheath now the question is is that specific decrease in immunity going to be the same that impacts source could be and I don't know the answer to that if I knew a little bit more I might be able to make a guess but even then it would be a guess because again we don't know that's a good question just another point about that as you know immune system components the immune system one is adaptive where you've adapted and developed an antibody specific to an offending agent another is just I forgot the term I think maybe resistive in other words it's our body's way of fighting off any intrusion of a new a new invader at all so again two very different types then you have what's called cellular which would be T cells and immune cells that actually attack things that's a lot of what you see in cardiovascular inflammation inflammation in the arteries attacking plaque the other type besides cellular is antibody where we make little antibodies little proteins which attach to the outside of that offending agent that invader 147DegreesWest did you get a chance to look at the CD14 research showing COVID-19 hijacking the leukocytes I saw a little bit of it I appreciate you sending that to me I'm not I don't know enough about it to voice an opinion yet part of the problem part of what you're talking about or what what 147 is talking about is there's some potential and some people are thinking that this may be hijacking some of our immune cells the leukocytes are one of those groups of immune cells now if it is hijacking immune cells per se then the next analogy they've drawn is well that's part of the mechanism that happens with HIV and then I think it's a little bit premature to start making those connections because HIV has been such a devastating emotion emotionally laden type of pandemic and because of the lifestyle issues associated with susceptibility and transmission again you know ethics issues and they're just a bunch of other stuff I think it's a little bit early to link that and even if you do find that there are immune cells that are being hijacked it's still not exactly the same I mean HIV is a long chronic infection type of process this is very quick because it's quick it's much less likely well anyhow that's about as much as I've seen it's very interesting and yes I look forward to seeing future developments in this area of is COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 is it actually hijacking some of immune cells that we've been talking about looks like we had three copies of that question four copies Nick Christopherson you guys are talking about people's social distance helping well what about the major way farming has changed in the 90s factory farming has gone out of control well you bring up a really good point and if you started to watch some of the some of the videos about the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the meat plants the meat packing plants you begin to get a understanding I think of what Nick's talking about these people and I've toured these plants in terms of my occupational medicine activity these people are just right down the road each doing a single separate cut on the on the animals carcass and one of the pictures showed they had dealt with it what they had done is put a plastic piece of clear plastic this this wide this small this tall between the two people standing side by side go back and think about that image of the plastic strip between the two workers and think about the video the last video we just looked at the aerosol transmission with it going 6 to 13 feet in the air that's just not going to those plastic sheets are not going to stop transmission within a meatpacking plant and then you get into the whole issue of ok let's say somebody sneezes it gets on the meat how long does it stay on the meat howlings and infectious from the meat and is it infectious at all from food there's a whole debate around that issue Carl Jones what's your opinion on sunscreens low vitamin D poor soil health and low minerals such as zinc well that's that's a whole bunch of a different different topics and I have more than one opinion on multiple topics I will tell you this number one vitamin D is clearly an issue what you do need to supplement with it the vast majority of people do saying I live south of Seattle or Atlanta either one neither one of those healthy I've got people from all latitudes the husband who's playing two to four hours of golf a day has low vitamin D and the wife who stays indoors all day has normal vitamin D so relying on sunscreens are even saying that sunscreens is knocking this out this is just not true poor soil health poor soil is a big issue for magnesium I haven't studied the impact of soil health on things like zinc but again I have no doubt I mean people is conservative is the CDC have acknowledged that most of us have magnesium deficiencies and a lot of it's due to the soil would we say the same thing about zinc I don't know the answer to that but I wouldn't be surprised Joe Reilly Z50-Z6 in the grocery store situation to aerosol particles attached to our clothes where they could be transferred by our hands to our face that's a really good question that's you clearly wonder about that I haven't seen it documented yet but that's one of the perceptions and that's what Janice was talking about with CDC's now saying take your shoes off Janice when we go out to take a walk outdoors she changes her clogs she does a complete change of clothes and just to go out to walk one mile and then come back and as you can see she's question made to do that and I'm hesitant and a little bit grumpy about it Carl Jones Nick C. Indonesia said the US government was engineering H5N1 so they stopped sharing their H5N1 once well Indonesia said the US government is engineering China calls this virus the devil which means white devil or foreign devil Carl Jones it contaminates everything with every baring degree of survivable survivability I think that there is truth for that I think the issue is there clearly barring degrees of survival survivability whether its own of a piece of plastic whether it's on a piece of metal whether it's on a piece of clothing and the transmissibility from each of those again is a very very different thing Hydniq thank you for your time thank you for your time Hydniq and for the others as well appreciate your interest and we will see you tomorrow Thank You Carl back well have a good evening heated up
