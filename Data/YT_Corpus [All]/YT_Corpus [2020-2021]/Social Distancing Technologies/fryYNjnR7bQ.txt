Directors and also owner of Einhorn consulting Richard as a composer a record producer and audio technology expert Richard lost his hearing almost overnight in 2010 that's a huge blow to someone who depends on really fine hearing to do his chosen work I first saw Richard present at the hlaa convention in 2014 where he gave the keynote address on a life in music after hearing loss and I was awed with the tenacity at which Richard goes in search of solutions Richard takes his expertise in technology and he combines it with a doggedness to find solutions to help himself hear better and to turn around and help others with hearing loss so I'm looking forward to Richards talk today and his insight about what we can do at home thank you Richard Thank You Barbara present such a I hope that I live up to one tenth of this introduction thank you all of you for being here it's really a great pleasure to be here and I wouldn't be I wouldn't I would be remiss if I didn't immediately say to everybody please stay safe please stay healthy if you were sick please recover as soon as possible if you have lost loved ones the deepest condolences from all of us at hlaa and please all of us stay at home and let's get through this scourge as quickly as possible let me see if I have now on control over this I do I want to as said I want to give a talk to you about assistive technology and during the time of this pandemic I'm going to give you some general tips I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about adjustments and repairs I'm going to if you have adjustments and repairs that that need to happen to your hearing devices I'm going to explain a little bit about what to do in a pinch and then I'm going to talk about connecting which includes video calls and conferencing and I'm going to promise as much as I possibly can to speak as slowly as I can but given that I'm a New Yorker I mean I may need an occasional reminder somewhere please everybody don't use chat don't use hand raising your hands please put your questions in QA and I promise I will leave some time at the end for some questions to be answered you can see the Q&A down at the bottom of the screen okay before we even begin though I thought I would first give you a little bit of suggestions as to how to watch this presentation because I don't want you to get anxious because there will be a lot of information but really the slides will be made available to everybody after the presentation and this is also being recorded and it will be posted so you'll be able to re-watch it later so basically all you need to do right now is to just relax listen enjoy the show just try to get the general idea about what's going on um it really there's the the idea is to just give you an overview you can take a few notes if you want to but remember you're going to have access to the slides and to the presentation again and you can kind of use it as a guide and as a reference to do a little bit of exploration later and that's what you really should be doing consider is anything helpful in this presentation at all if it is then just kind of experiment and explore with it go a little bit deeper into it be patient don't get don't get you know upset if you don't immediately understand it some of this stuff can get tricky because it's you know weird technology use Google Google is your friend and use it to find out more information and feel free to ask questions including including to me I'll post my email at the end and although I can't walk you through step by step how to set up your equipment or or how to or to give you specific advice I can certainly give you some pointers as to where you look on the internet and some general ideas as to how to troubleshoot a situation so please feel free to write me I'm more than happy to hear from everybody so let's start with some general tips the first general tip I'm going to suggest is that you go to our website the hearing loss or hearing loss org is a web address and you look around we have tons of information on nearly every subject connected with hearing health and in specific we have information on coronavirus and hearing loss and all you need to do in order to get get it is to click the read more and if for some reason that screen isn't up just go to the little box for the search above the main menus for the hlaa website type in coronavirus and hit return and you'll get a very nicely organized single page with a lot of links to resources now there's also one more important button which I'd like to tell you about before going on to the main part of my conversation and that is the donate button in the upper right hand of our website like every other not-for-profit organization we are severely impacted by the economic slowdown at the moment and we can really use your help all you need to do is to click on this button you'll be taken to the donate page age please no donation is too small please consider joining it's only $45 a year if you're not a member and regardless just thank you for your support okay the first tip I'm going to give is a very very very simple one and it has to do with batteries most of us still use replaceable batteries in our devices some of us have rechargeables but if you have batteries then you're going to need a lot of them and you really shouldn't be going to the pharmacy right now you should be sheltering in place unless it's absolutely needed and so among the among the options that you can do in order to get batteries is to join a battery club and we have one that we're affiliated with at hlaa called the hero club and if you go to the hero club they will deliver a certain amount of batteries to you every month another option that you can do for batteries is to buy them in bulk and rather than go to your local pharmacy where you will pay typically a dollar 12 per battery you can go to an online retailer and the exact same battery will be available for under 30 cents each if you buy them in bulk so the question then comes up what are you going to do with all those batteries well even though you're staying at home you should be putting them everywhere you should put them in your medicine cabinet you should never be without batteries put them in your purse put them in your sports jacket put them in your briefcase also even if you're Columbo you should put them in your overcoats you should put them everywhere you should also of course put them in the glove compartment of your rolls-royce and if you don't have a rolls-royce then no problem just put them in the jalopy of your choice in any case spread your batteries around because you really really should never be without them and right now you should not be making special trips to the drugstore simply to get your batteries replaced they should drugstore trips should obviously be for prescription refills and anything else that's really you know that that you can't handle online if you have a cochlear implant consider getting an extra rechargeable battery or a third rechargeable battery again you don't want to be there again let me remind people not to use chat as it has a tendency to block the the the the captions so please put your questions in the Q&A box and leave chat alone thank you very much okay so now we're going to talk about adjustments and repairs if your hearing aid or a cochlear implant happens to go south and it might and so um there are several things you can do most audiologists are not working from their offices right now and are not seeing clients or patients there may be some exceptions but every single one that I've spoken to and I've spoken to quite a few is is sheltering in place at home and they're seeing patients remotely through remote teller audiology now you may not want to do that if you are overly concerned about privacy because the the HIPAA requirements the pry the strict medical privacy requirements have been relaxed so you can't depend upon the same level of privacy that you had before on the other hand everybody is in the same boat so you might want to consider relaxing your own concerns about privacy if you have if you have them it is entirely your decision if you decide to contact your audiologist I would suggest doing so first by phone or email if you need assistance in doing that use use your spouse or a partner or your your friends or other family members but contact your audiologist if you're having a problem now the other thing which is on this others other half of this particular slide is that your device may actually be set up to be remotely programmed if what you have is not a broken hearing aid but a message stood hearing aid you could possibly get it and if it if it's a fairly new device programmed over the Internet and this is an example from one particular manufacturer although many of them have this feature in so called made for smartphone hearing aids where you can fill out a simple questionnaire send it to your audio it will automatically be sent to your audiologist he or she will adjust the settings then send them back to you inside the app and then the app will automatically upload them to your hearing aid now this sounds incredibly complicated but actually it's quite simple I've done it several times and it really works beautifully as I said this is one particular manufacturers settings a particular manufacturers example but there are many others ivory sound has the modicon has them Widex has it I believe Phonak has it there are many of them that haven't just checked with your audiologist though to be sure that that your device can do it it could solve some problems without your having to return the device now if Tara audiology is not available as I said contact your audiologist describe the problems as clearly as you can and arrange a drop-off at the audiologists office typically they will tell you to just simply leave it at the door and they might meet you at the car wearing a mask cetera but typically it will be leaving at the door you can also check with the company that manufactures your hearing aid because many of them are allowing direct returns to the factory now this is something that I hadn't thought of but an audiologist told me about packing and cleaning your hearing aids the important thing here I don't want to go through this whole slide but the important thing here is to not overdo it yes we're in the middle of a pandemic and yes there is a tremendous amount of concern about contamination but your audiologist will or should be opening any box here ec or she receives from you wearing protective gear now if you're concerned about that consider placing a note in the box on the top so that your audiologist will know what you have done to clean it now I've gotten conflicting answers to the question of whether or not to use alcohol but please please do not use Purell or bleach to clean your hearing aids in order to return them you'll basically destroy them and then you'll have to get new hearing aids and it will just delay the process so please don't use Purell on them save them for your own hands after a supermarket run now in a pinch if your hearing aids go down what can you do here's a couple of suggestions the first thing is use a pair of older hearing aids they may not be as comfortable or as stylish as your current hearing aids but they will work in a pinch be sure to clean them thoroughly before using especially if they've been hanging around for a while and be sure to have the right size batteries which may differ from the hearing aids that you current that that that just broke another thing that you can do is use over-the-counter hearing devices this is one style of device and many people including myself feel that it's really an excellent choice again that's not an endorsement there are many other ways there are many other devices on on the market and this is one of them this is a very different style of device it's an all in the ear device and it actually is about half the price or two-thirds of the price of the previous device but these could work for you in a pinch they won't be as precise in their hearing fitting as your hearing aids but they can be adjusted by you and they can work pretty well another thing that you can do if you don't want to spend the money on those over-the-counter devices is use your smart phone believe it or not as a hearing amplifier these are three programs that that that I've used and which work reasonably well in a pinch if you if your hearing aids go down petrol X is has a lot of interesting features and allows you to really customize the program it has in-app purchases which add additional features to it ear machine which is very simple to use and which was actually partly designed by an HLA a board member Kevin Frank is a very very simple and very popular app and finally there's listen app by jacoti full disclosure I consult for jacoti this isn't currently on the market it was on the market it protectable reasons it was it was taken off the App Store it's going to be returning soon and it features an opportunity to enter an audiogram your own audiogram into the program and then it generates a hearing fitting that's very similar to the kind of fitting an audiologist begin it's an audiological a valid fitting so those are three of the smartphone apps out there there are others out there but I would be very cautious in using an app that isn't specifically recommended here I'm going to show some more in a moment the reason is that some of them may be too loud for people to use and could it could be harmful these all are safe and I think that you could use them as well now smartphone apps when you use them one thing is you'll need to take your hearing aids out and used a wired headphone Bluetooth will have too much delay and won't work well another disadvantage with them is impossible disadvantage is that they are suitable only for mild to moderate and possibly moderate severe hearing losses if you have severe to profound problems hearing issue hearing losses then you may not really receive much benefit from this but especially the apps are basically free so what's the harm in trying okay here are some more apps that could be useful I'm not going to go through them all this list was generated by Eric Nelson an audiologist at Wilde Cornell who gave us who yesterday gave a talk and listed these apps as additional ones and I think that you can you can safely go through this list at your own pace and to see if there's anything there that could be useful to you an additional device perhaps even useful if you have a severe hearing loss is a pocket talker which is which basically does exactly what those apps does except it does it in its own handheld and very simple fashion now let's talk about connecting in general and I'll be talking about video conferencing and video calling in this section as well but before we do that I just like to talk about things that in case you don't know about these there are amplified landline phones you can buy clarity is one brand Panasonic also has an excellent one capture there are also caption phones that you can get caption call is one brand I believe in O caption is another one and cap inter caption I guess as a web-based one but CapTel is another brand of caption of caption phones just be aware that when using a caption phone usage is very high so it may be a little slower than normal another thing that you can do to connect is to if you know American Sign Language ASL is to use an interpreter a video relay service just go to a website or do a google search and you can find ways of connecting for this now finally we get to video calls and conferencing and as you can see hlaa is in the forefront of this here we see Barbara Kelley talking to longtime hlaa new york city member ruthbarz teen yeah and I bet you thought this was Jetsons no it's Ruth and Barbara talking over the latest technology the only issue that you can see here is there's no captions but we'll get to that later on this was an early version of the technology then we're going to be discussing so I'm going to be going through some general set up ideas and also going to tell you a little bit about how to make the most of your video calls general setup every video call conferencing service does have a different way of setting it up and I'll show you a few in a moment the set up is often needlessly complicated but just be patient with it we're all getting used to this including actually the designers of this of this technology it's kind of extraordinary technology and it's amazing that it works at all so just be be patient especially in these early years as we get used to all this and once you've gone through it a few times it can be learned and it just you know becomes second nature so as I said I'll show you a few steps and in general if you're using this for family and friends if you're using it for virtual dinner parties which many people like to do then just settle on one or two video services say it's FaceTime say it's you know say it's hangouts whatever it doesn't matter just do those and get to learn them very well and take the time to learn as many features as you can but go slowly on that and learn slowly on it get it up and working reliably first and then find and add additional features okay a general set up some video apps we'll just open for example this is what when I click FaceTime on my computer this is the screen I get and all I need to do in order to speak to my daughter is click that little icon that I've circled and it calls my daughter and then we're connected and we're good to go apps for video apps will sometimes send you an e-mail like Zune does and here we have a typical zoom letter and you click that link and then you walk through a rather incredible process you're asked if you need to want to open up an app it will ask you also to download the app if you don't have it once you do that you're going to then have to click through a whole bunch of completely unnecessarily unnecessary in utterly unnecessary steps and then finally after all that Rella you're here in your conference and you can set up again be patient with everybody the nobody knew Rock was necessary or not necessary to set up a zoom a video conference and this is the way some people do it some companies do it other companies do it a different way so I'm just going to go through a couple of troubleshooting basics for you I can't go through it all it's way too complicated and besides there's no way anybody could possibly know all how to troubleshoot every given program again Google is your friend YouTube is your friend you can find ways of troubleshooting just simply by asking Google the right questions but when in trouble the first thing to do is go to the settings or preferences for the program you're using where is that just click anywhere that you see on your program that looks like it might reveal the settings to you click everywhere that it will eventually eventually you will come to a Settings panel and when you get to that settings panel you'll be able to look for the video and audio settings and adjust them but by far one of the most common mistakes that people make is they simply forget to turn the volume up on their loudspeakers or on their headphones so go to your computer go to your phone and make sure the volume is up before before driving yourself crazy with something else oops let me went a little bit too far there let me just go back so I'm just gonna walk you through zooms video settings once you get to vote zooms videos video settings you'll see a screen like this hopefully with a better face and you'll see the and that will tell you that your camera is working if it isn't then just simply go to the camera and click on where click right next to the word camera and choose the camera that you want to use it typically will be the camera on your on your computer that you want to use but if you have an external camera choose that once you have the video settings going correct then go to the audio settings and here you'll see you have an opportunity to test both your speaker and your microphones if you click on the test speaker it will play a sound and you can see whether or not you hear it you can hit click here and test the microphone and if you speak into it it will actually record a little bit of what you say and play it back to you so that you know that your sound is both happening and that it's clear that it's clean and here I have here I show where you need to where you need to click to select the speakers that you want to use or your headphones and down here you can select different microphones again typically you'll be using your computer microphone but there are options that you can use all right so now tips for better video calls and conferencing ok I'm going to go through some basic tips first sit close to your computer or phone of course why it's easier to see you and it's a better sound pickup the closer you are to your microphones the easier it is for the sound to be picked up speak in a normal tone maybe a little bit slower maybe maybe not depends on who you're talking to certainly ask people to slow down if you are having trouble hearing and adjust the lighting for clarity I have no visual sense whatsoever I'm a musician so the best I can suggest is that you google how to light a video call I've done so and you'll get a nice bit of different options that you can choose from all of whom who can guide you how to light your video call better be patient with technical problems if they're really really bad and sometimes that happen it's perfectly fine it's perfectly fine etiquette to just say sorry I'm having problems I'll call you back hang up and reconnect it's not a big deal now I'd like to give you some advanced tips because that's what grandchildren are for to help you with these with these advanced tips and I want to say first again that that you shouldn't necessarily worry about the details here just think of this as a general overview again you're going to get access to the slides anybody who wants to will be able to download the slides and anybody who wants to will also be able to to listen to this this webinar again at a later date so just don't sweat it you know there is a lot of detail here but just sort of listen and absorb what you can and don't worry if you don't get it all the first one is something that's really kind of cool that very few people know about and that is that you can blur your background and this turns out to be very useful for people with hearing loss here here is here I am on skype and as you can see you can see my my studio and right here and it can be distracting if you if you are trying to listen to my voice there are all sorts of things in the background including a keyboard that might be interesting so instead just blur it if you're on skype and it looks like this and if you talk and if the other person talks with blurred screens it's surprisingly easy to concentrate on somebody's lips and and body language and it really really does help it's a tiny little thing but it really really helps and it's not well known I know that Skype has it and Microsoft teams has this other services may have it if you know about that I'll include it in a revised version of the slides before they're posted okay another thing you can do is you can improve and personalize the sound of your audio using an app like sonic cloud and just give me one moment I want to check this time just make sure I'm on time so sonic cloud allows you to personalize the sound on your computer and also on your phone but here we're just going to talk about computers and what it was actually Co designed and founded the company was Co design found by another board member Larry Gutterman and basically what you do is you take a you take a quick hearing test and then it automatically creates a hearing profile which you can then twiddle and adjust and tweak as much as you like so that the sound is for is is good for you it's designed for people with hearing loss and honestly I don't know anything else on the market that does what sonic cloud does you can actually use it on phone calls um there are some professional audio apps that person that would allow you to personalize the sound but it's not a cloud is very easy to use and so it's definitely worth checking out if you go to their website another thing that you can do is you can stream your with some brand new hearing aids at least one brand new hearing aid the Phonak Marvel you can stream directly from your computer directly into your hearing aid now some made for smart phone hearing aids allow you to stream audio from your smart phone but don't allow you to stream audio into your into your intent allow you to stream audio from the computer the Marvel allows you to do that and there may be others if you know of others please send me a link and I will update this this this slideshow and you can find instructions to do that easily on the web another thing you can do is what on the great Roxanna rotundo of our Board of the hlaa board is doing here Roxanna has cochlear and what she is doing is she has connected her computer to an accessory device that streams wirelessly into her cochlear implants what she's using is what she's using is called a mini mic and she has it connected directly to the computer here you can see that a cable is connected to the audio out of the computer and the other end of the cable is connected to the mini mic that that that Roxanna is wearing and this is very very easy to use and although this particular device is is compatible only with resound hearing aids and cochlear America cochlear implants other manufacturers have similar devices either mini mics or television adapters that you could easily connect up to your computer to do exactly the same thing that Roxanna is doing here another thing you can do is you can use your TV loop system but instead of connecting it to your TV just connect it to your computer and sherry parrot Sully yet another hlaa board member this morning sent me this slide which I'm not going to go through because it's a little too geeky to go through but it will show you exactly how to connect to your computer a typical television loop amplifier you'll need telev kyle equipped hearing aids and you'll need a TV loop and some sort of loop perhaps a loop pad you can get all of this easily online just just look for TV hearing loops and you should be able to find find some pretty good devices that way all right now I am going to go a little geeky but don't worry it's only for a couple of seconds that I'm only going to give a couple of tips that are either for really really optimizing for squeezing the best quality out of your video that your video calls and conferencing the and the first thing is use an Ethernet cable for your computer that is B wired don't go wireless don't use Wi-Fi if you can if you don't know what an Ethernet cable is then this tip is not for you and just ignore it you can also use the 5g if you are using Wi-Fi if you are using Wi-Fi use the 5g option for it when you select a Wi-Fi network to connect to most modern Wi-Fi routers give you a low quality a low speed and a high speed use the 5g it is usually much faster another thing you can do is to do what I'm doing here it's not very difficult to do as a matter of fact it's very simple to do but it does make you look like a geek and that's to use a headset with a boom mic this is a boom mic that's what she's wearing here and the only trick I can say is put the microphone a little bit below your mouth because that way people with hearing loss can still hear you you can get these microphones very inexpensively for about 35 or 40 bucks you can also pay more money if you'd like and they dramatically reduce the background noise which enables you to hear better and personally I believe all audiologists and all hearing health professionals should be wearing these all health professionals should be wearing these when they're giving when they're doing video calls so now we get to captions and let me let me preface all this by saying the following captions I'm going to limit myself to captions for video conferencing and video calls only and I just want to check my time again I'm doing pretty good the I'm limiting that because that is a major use case which we have to contend with right now and to be blunt it's kind of a mess if what you want to do is to call your nephew or your or your grandchild or you want to call your mom and you have a hearing loss and you need captions and you just want to do an informal call it's a mess okay the the caption calls are over are difficult to synchronize with video and all all of this is in shall we say an early stage of development the gold standard of course remains Kart and will for quite a while which is captioning by a live person like Whitney today but automatic captioning can be very good however at the moment in general you have to pay for the good ones and I'm going to go through a little bit of detail on this so you get a flavor and a feeling for how crazy it can get how difficult it can get each video service handles the audio captioning differently and some don't offer it at all and so use google to find out and now we'll go through a few examples FaceTime apple's product a video calling product doesn't offer automatic captioning at all as far as I know if I'm wrong please send me a link and I'll correct and I correct my slides but I couldn't find anything there and there's no options for adding captions of the image Skype does allow you to cut to turn on captionings you can do it within a session but you can also do it from the settings by going to the calling menu and choosing call sub click on call subtitles and then go there and turn on captions for all phone calls skypes captioning is a little weird but it works quite nicely it captions all at once in other words you will say a block of text and pause and ding all the words that you just said before the pause will appear Skype also has a very amusing feature which I found out when I was skyping a friend of mine in Australia who has shall we say an extended vocabulary and certain of the words that my friend used Skype thought was inappropriate and so they appeared in the transcription with asterisks which is very amusing and loads of fun to play with if you have that sense of humor zoom it's a little complicated I'm just going to show you what to do I'm just going to show you what the options are the instructions for live cart captioning is just simply not ready for primetime you would go through hoops trying to set it up again please correct me if I'm wrong I did try to figure this out and really the instructions I saw were not really for a consumer that just simply wants to talk to talk to an a grant a grandchild it's just too difficult however autre which is a much loved transcription program by many people in the hearing health community does work with zoom pro business or enterprise plans but translated what that means is you have to pay and you also have to pay for order unless you are only using it a little bit setup however is relatively straightforward if you're willing to pay for it now Microsoft teams I've used a little bit of Microsoft teams the captioning there and it was terrific other people I know have also used Microsoft teams and the auto captioning is equally terrific but we don't yet I haven't used it enough to be able to say for certain that it's it's it's as good as it appears to be we need just like we need to test to make sure that a vaccine works and that that a treatment works for for Ovid we also need to have reasonable testing to make sure that these captions work and they at the moment we don't have that I'd have not done that gap that kind of testing yet however teams free the non-business version of captioning of teams does not offer captioning at least it didn't when I used it and upgrading teams has both complicated and expensive over a hundred and fifty dollars a year and there are additional expenses and an additional geekiness in order to do it so one thing that you can do is just use a captioning app with your computer you they might work for you there is free captioning available on all new Android devices and it's pretty good I'm just checking my time again but the good auto captioning that I'm aware of requires payments for video calls and conferencing you can use your computer for video and audio but then get one of your get one of your apps working get one of your captioning apps working and place it near your computer's loud speakers and while that's happening your the captioning app will pick up the sound from your computer loudspeakers and transcribe it for you and that can actually work fairly well here are some options all of them all of them for real usability need you need to pay for live caption which by the way is doesn't appear to be the same as Google live caption which is a free completely free service live caption will cost you thirty six dollars a year otter will cost you a hundred dollars a year but you have ten hours a month for the free version which might suffice for some people Ava which is another very very popular captioning app will cost you one hundred and eighty dollars a year or you can if you only have light use of otter you can you can use it for free the otter however has very sophisticated display so if you're on a large conference call with a lot of people odd or maybe very very helpful to you so now the real question though I think really needs to be asked though the solutions are not are both are both piecemeal and they're in all sorts of different kinds of pay levels of payment and the question I have for everybody and please write me directly if you if you have an opinion about this is for people with hearing loss shouldn't automatic captioning even if it's not perfect even if it's sometimes far from perfect it'd be free and easy to access on all videoconferencing and video calls especially now I think it's a question that's worth asking especially of this group but we call what we call in my in my online audio form forms we call asking the hive mind what what what the opinion is you know we all want to know what what whether or not we think this is a good idea it seems like it might be in any case that's all I have to present right now I appreciate your taking the time to go through this again we had a lot of information but it will be available to you on the website at some point in the future this slideshow will be available for download or for viewing on the website and you will be able to listen to the recording again I will update the slides if they need to be updated based on information that I get from you I just want to thank a whole bunch of people who helped me with this especially Carla Baier Smolin and Whitney Riley who is our card operator thank you Whitney I hope I did not go too fast for you today and finally I would like to thank all of you for joining us today I'm going to start looking at the questions right now again please do not use the chat I am NOT going to look at anything in chat it blocks the use of them.the of the of the subtitles I have 73 questions right now in the QA I'm going to start I'm going to start going through some of their bill Iverson asks are there any wireless earphones with low enough latency to use with smart phones and sound amplification apps the answer is no there aren't they're they the it is not that the wireless earphones have low and have high latency or low latency it's that Bluetooth itself has has too much latency latency by the way is just a fancy term for delay in this context there are no Bluetooth headphones that I'm aware of that that can be used productively as a hearing device now there is an exception with made for iPhone hearing aids which can be used in the live listen mode the sound quality is not ideal but that is the only that is the only one that I'm aware of with hearing aids you can use them with made for smartphone hearing aids and made for iPhone hearing aids but no I'm sorry that that can't happen again I'm gonna have to go through these questions a little bit how is it that you can wear Viki Pacheco asks how is it that you can wear a headset without your hearing aid whistling that's a very good question and honestly I don't know if I can answer that exactly you can there are two there are basically two styles of head they're basically there with this headset what I've done is I've turned down my hearing aids turn down the volume on my hearing aids and turned up the volume of the sound going into the headset so with the volume on my hearing aids down it is less likely that you will get rissalah or feedback and more likely that you will be able and because the volume is turned up going into the headset it is more likely that you will that you will not get that you will not get that you'll be able to hear it loud enough in your hearing aids but you need to adjust the volume of two things the volume going into the headset and the volume going into your hearing aids and I'm wearing hearing aids right now with this headset and I'm experiencing absolutely no feedback no whistling again I'm sorry there's no way that I can answer now 92 questions but I'm going to do there Kim Walker asks thank you for the presentation to Zoomer FaceTime have closed captioning options zoom does but again it is too difficult for a layperson to set up you really need somebody who is prepared to really go through some complicated setup face time as far as I know do not does not okay Carol agate has two questions I have Marvel hearing aids when I put otter on my iPhone it shuts off the hearing aids I haven't been able to get an explanation from my audiologist or the Phonak rep I'm sorry I can't help you with that I would continue to write your audiologist I would continue to write Phonak I would see perhaps somebody at hlaa if you write hlaa perhaps somebody at hlaa can connect you with somebody can can pass the information on to Phonak so that they can be they can look at the problem I would also write otter and I would tell them how you're using their product and ask them to contact Phonak as well do you know how to make the otter captions crawl no I do not but maybe somebody else does here and if they do please write me with how to do that and Carol I'll make sure that somehow or another I get the information to you David lands Berger hi David asks have I tried verb it any opinions no and no let's see how somebody asks how can you get captioning when there's an important video on cbsn I can't answer that question about CBS News videos in particular but I can say this that at least on the Mac and I'm sure it's also true on Windows computers as well you can go to the preferences go to accessibility and turn on subtitles and this will I believe give you cite subtitles on any audio and any video that with audio that you see if it doesn't there may be a closed caption button on the video for CBS News and if there isn't there should be and I would write CBS News and insist that they do that it's also possible that the CBS news broadcast may be on YouTube and YouTube does have captioning I'm not an expert on this I'll be very honest with you on captioning in general and however I do believe that for most news broadcasts captioning is available how how good it is I don't know and regarding this presentation this presentation was not about broad captioning it was about captioning for video calls captioning a pre-recorded video or other kinds of broadcast is a completely different use case I have trouble using my Roger pen Elaine Braz Berger writes FM with my cochlear implant on streaming shows any suggestions the best suggestion I can give you at the moment and again please do not use chat anybody I'm I'm ignoring it and please it blocks the captions so please don't use it I'm having trouble using my Roger and FM with my cochlear implant on streaming shows any suggestions yes get it as close as possible to the speaker's as you can if that doesn't work and you can precisely explain what the problems are please write your audiologist please write Phonak which makes the roger pen and ask them for help there is very little else that one can do it without without getting in touch with the manufacturer the roger pen is actually a fairly simple to use device in the sense that you basically you just hold it and you point it you can turn it a few different ways to get different kinds of features in it but aside from doing that and getting it close to a loudspeaker I don't know what more else we can give you yeah I can give you for help Robert broker says that this information is overwhelming I totally get it that's why the material will be available later for you to look at he suggests a conference call related to the issues of seniors who even have difficulties with hearing aids I agree I think that's a great idea it's now officially passed on to staff what is your opinion of using bows here phones for a one-sided hearing loss says Claudia asked Claudia Cullen our I have a one-sided hearing loss it is us and I have used bows here phones they work reasonably well as long as you can return them as long as you there's a return policy what's the what's the harm in picking a pair up if you can afford it they're available online I believe from Amazon but definitely from the Bose website Eric Nelson is very I'm very honored that Eric who's an audiologist at Weill Cornell is on this call he says that he has given out the email of his Phonak trainer so if you have a Phonak marvel question i've now copied the email of the Phonak trainer that eric has posted and if anybody wants to if anybody has a Phonak marvel and has questions email me and I will send you her name her name and contact picture I just need your money there's five more minutes okay sure um eric has said eric has also updated me with some information on the Roger Fenn the Roger met the Roger pen can be connected connected directly to the TV for streaming to patients hearing aids so that means that if you have a Roger pen and you have a compatible hearing device for the Roger pen you can connect it directly to your TV which means you can also connect it directly to a computer you need to have the proper cable but it can be done let's see yes Peggy Ellickson says the same thing so she has done exactly the same thing Peggy is another board member of our HLA a board member and she is a very very enthusiastic user of this question of this technology let me see if I can go back again and do another pass or the questions for some of the ones I missed and I'm very sorry Adelaide Zabriskie says can I put an app on a laptop Columbia doctors do tell a hat path on my iPad or iPhone but I use otter and also the iPad does not have as good a speaker as my laptop the answer is yes I don't see why not Columbia doctors however Columbia doctors may use a proprietary telehealth system I don't know what they use I would ask them if you can do that I would say almost certainly the answer is yes but I would definitely check let's see Judy Freeman asked me if I can recommend one two three online retailers for hearing aid batteries plus quick and reliable service I think I feel a little uncomfortable saying that because there are many that are competitive but if you look at the obvious choices for online retailers of devices of of merchandise there are some obvious names that come up immediately and just search for hearing a batteries and search for bulk hearing aid batteries and sooner or later you'll come across ways of of having of ways of finding ways of buying batteries in bulk of 80 or more crisp attorney ask how do you use the app if you have no hearing aid on I assume he means the hearing amplifier apps you need to use wired headphones you need to use wired headphones you could also try there's no real other way to do it actually if you don't have wired headphones earphones you can pick up a pair of excellent earphones for about $30 these days you can even get them cheaper if you know where to look and how to look there are some really good brands that are cheap there are again how do you know where to look you do Google searches and you need to just continue to do Google searches until you understand that there are a few recommendations like sites that might be useful for you in your search CNET that's C and et might have some good recommendations for headphones and earphones so might wirecutter which is the New York Times website so my Consumer Reports all right let me just see if there's one more question and then I think we should wrap it up I think it's three o'clock so shall we so Carla G shall we shall we stop kolja hello sorry about that hey thank you Richard for thank you so much for your time today and your informative and very humorous presentation we definitely needed it in this pandemic that we're going through apparently this is a very hot hot topic and there's a lot of questions I think we had 125 questions on this webinar so I have a feeling that we may need to do some follow-up or do another follow-up webinar just on questions and answers possibly so something to think about I just wanted to thank you for the presentation has been reported and I thank you all for joining us today we will be posting it to the hla website on hearing loss org probably within the
