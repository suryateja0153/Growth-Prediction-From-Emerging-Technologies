 with a covert 19 pandemic disrupting daily life we've been adjusting to this new normal using digital platforms and videoconferencing to make up for face-to-face interactions telecommuting increasing delivery services and even deploying robots where we can as this pandemic stretches on this becoming clear to us that some elements of this highly digitalized lifestyle are here to stay but that means the role of big tech will be expanding in our lives and also compromises jobs for thousands possibly millions of people around the world to discuss what this new normal could entail we connect with Jeremy Kaplan editor-in-chief of Digital Trends joining us from New York and dr. kim byoung-joo professor at Hamburg University of Foreign Studies and so my first question to mr. Caplan earlier this year when we spoke at CES you said you were excited about the wave of digital healthcare devices and solutions this year as well as the acceleration of AI technology but since then we've seen the situation change with this pandemic what are now some digital trends and services you expect to last beyond the virus and become part of the new normal yeah I'm glad you said that part of the new normal because I keep hearing that phrase thrown around as if we're in the new normal right now I think we're in the new abnormal this is a very weird time for all of us and I think what's going to be interesting is how much of what we're doing today carries forwards into the near future so I think there's some obvious things the videoconferencing for example people have realized how useful this tool is not just high-tech industries not just certainly white-collar companies but a lots of companies are going to find that to be useful going forward I think education is going to be profoundly transformed as well a lot of easy things it's also very clear that online shopping has become massively pervasive most people in fact several people had been doing this before personally I was doing almost all of my shopping online but that was not the case for the bulk of people and I think going forward online shopping will certainly become an enormous transformation and I think the biggest thing we should watch for is what we call the sharing economy right there are companies will let you share your car share your house share your bicycle in this world we're in right now and no one wants to do any of that it'll be very interesting to see how many of those companies actually survive the sharing economy is still a thing six eight months from now so you're saying that we could possibly see the decline of the sharing economy while we see increasing use of online platforms and services well dr. beaton or perhaps you can come right well dr. Vijay Kim in South Korea we're calling the use of these digital platforms and non-contact services and payments as the intact economy do you think these services will continue to grow even when the pandemic and social distancing measures are over and which companies do you think will have actually gained the most during this trying time yeah my answer to that first question is definitely absolutely that's the case you know people as mr. Kaplan said people had shown their preference of staying out of contact if possible even before the time of Crona virus and we've seen some of the industry's growing based on that trend and mr. Kaplan was saying they're talking about his ordering things to Donna even before Crona came here the thing is yes indeed that trend has been with us but it has been very dramatically accelerated because of the coronavirus case here and I think people are discovering some of the advantages of using taking advantages of this you know technological foundation that we have had so far so even after the corona virus peak is over I'm sure a lot of people will choose to stay with the technology and options and the companies also they might find it advantageous to let in you know encourage people to telecommute if possible because we have now strengthened our basis for you know like going with this kind of economic activities we are without face to face contact so definitely the trend is going to continue there's a second question about the companies I mean I'm staying in Sejong right now and in Seto city in Korea because it's a diminutive city government officials stay here but they have lots of things going on yes also all the years for the past about five six seven years our government officials here have been using these technologists like messaging services and document sharing services on the go back and forth between Seoul and Sejong these technology companies in Korea that have been developing these kind of options have been doing pretty well and they are doing even better because of the virus case right now and there are the companies they are going to face brighter face the brighter future as we move forward so it seems that you were expecting this transition to a highly digitalized lifestyle to happen anyway but this virus has really accelerated the process well then with the growth of these remote services and automated business solutions as well how are they going to affect people's jobs and livelihoods in the future dr. Kim I mean more than twenty-six million people in the US have already lost their jobs in the recent weeks and worldwide 75 million are expected to be laid off over the course of the pandemic we have to be clear about the what's happening in terms of unemployment situation we we have to be mindful that the unemployment itself is taking place because of the economic downturn because we cannot you know go shopping face-to-face we cannot gather around I cannot go to movie theaters for instance and you know because of the virus I saw its economic downturn that's causing the unemployment I don't think actually the the rise of the services and technology that's offering like option for us to do things without face face to face contact with other people I don't think it's it's the case so the economic downturn itself is an issue and the technology itself some of the currents will say will create even more jobs who knows I mean you know like delivery service for instance in Korea delivery service has been quite active because of the virus situation here and so it's a hard call to make at this point whether the technology itself will cause you know or keep the unemployment numbers in a in a large scale or not certainly I can see certain aspect to it but I don't think it's major one D the recovering from that kind of downturn is the most important task that we have to undertake in order to deal with the unemployment situation that we face at this point so we can't really rule out the endless possibilities that tech might actually bring well mr. Kaplan's some companies like are helping their employees find other work in the meantime over the course of pandemic to keep that income level steady will large companies are like Hilton be expected to play a greater role in society especially in terms of providing a safety net for our workers yeah it's a really interesting question certainly amongst our readers we've noticed that the younger audience is looking for companies to have some sort of a social good component or element or message even to what they do and you see that across a broad spectrum of things you have companies like toms the shoe company that gives away a pair of shoes for every shoe that it's sold that has done very well with consumers because people like that we've seen that increasing with the bigger technology companies especially the companies like Intel IBM Ford have been retooling factories repurposing engineers to build ventilators just seems like the kind of thing that is important to do at a time like this but of the message from some of those big companies has been very clear that they feel a need to become a part be a force for good here and we see that the need for that or the desire for that kind of a message from consumers I think increasingly there is an important role that companies like this have to face especially among larger Teknik now have technology companies which have seen a lot of blowback in the larger population in the press conversate across the globe because of concerns around privacy so any effort that they can they can take to mitigate that I think is gonna be very well received these days so speaking of privacy issues tech giants though also playing a very big role in facilitating the health and safety of the public during this pandemic as well as enabling telework and communication of course but this really involves using location data from smart phones to contact tracing to do contact tracing and they're also needing a lot of health information as well and this kind of surveillance would have been rather inconceivable a few months ago there have also been privacy concerns with video conferencing platforms like zoom what could be done then to protect our privacy and security yeah privacy feels sort of like a moving target sometimes I remember reading a study of years back after a major hurricane looking at the information that people were willing to share online before the that's nobody wanted their location information out there there is terrified that it's going to be available and then during the hurricane you're madly typing I'm in the exact here's the exact room that I'm in at this exact address because it feels like a different amount of information is acceptable I think right now this broad sweeping collection of data aggregation or a for the good of the public is meaningful and useful but there's two key watchwords here right it's going to be transparency and accountability so we need to know exactly where the data is going and as long as that is revealed and clear I think it's fine and if there's abuse of that data of that information of that confidentiality companies need to be held accountable for it as long as we can meet those two standards there shouldn't be any problems right so a county and transparency just before you go dr. Kim then how can we make sure that these companies do practice transparency and accountability as that daily as their presence really continues to encroach on our daily lives yeah somehow interestingly today I find myself agreeing a lot with mr. Kaplan's points here and the government's role rather than you know regulating other aspects of the you know the business activities it needs to be focused on disclosure of the information you know how they are using the client or consumer data that's being aggregated and it's always kind of technically really challenging for ordinary citizens to comprehend you know when such information is released just offhand so government should take an effort to make the information easily comprehensible and make it simple and then let people know how the data are being collected by these big companies and tech companies are being used or for the for the purpose of their business profit and that's going to be a really key role for the government so that we can have a better decision collective decision-making in this system of democracy are going forward yeah dr. Kim makes a great point because it's too easy for a company to put out a 40-page disclosure statement that no one can read that's a huge problem especially in the technology industry so it's up to governments to ensure that those of that information when it's disclosed is actually digestible and meaningful so really improving the literacy of everyday people to be able to understand and digest these privacy terms I'm afraid that's all we have time for today but it's been a wonderful discussion thank you thank you dr. Kong to kim and jeremy kaplan for joining us from new york Ansel thank you this is also where we end the show today thank you for watching we'll be back at the same time tomorrow we hope you join us then bye-bye
