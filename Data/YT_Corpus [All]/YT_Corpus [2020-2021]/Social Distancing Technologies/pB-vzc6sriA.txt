ensure that he or she has the backing for both management and ownership first regulations and recommendations that are being issued by local national and international bodies together with brand guidelines and a variety of of documentation and you really will need to have somebody that keeps a full view of everything that needs to be complied with and that is able to access that with time new changes are mode or modifications are published is able to understand how this impacts your hotel and where you need to apply some adjustments second there will be moments where the decision needs to be made and corrective or preventive and in some cases even you may find you hotel in critical situation where it's very important to take a quick decision it is important that order staff know clearly where is visible hand who can take these kind of decisions finally and most importantly all your staff have to be trained and knowledgeable of all the changes that are coming to happen in your hotel and somebody needs to ensure that all these trainings are both taking place reaching everybody and as well being effective and resulting in all the measures and knowledge implemented and executed by your team as well as there are a lot of documentation and records that need to be kept both of preventive measures but also of dogs and even information related to traceability that at

with the use of kiosks for room card distribution and even better if you can implement a mobile key solution by which yokas can directly access the room without the need for any interaction also relevant is automated checkout the technology that has been around for a few years and with the need of displaying sorts of distancing norms and corridor modifications there's also a role for digital signage in the hotel as well finally all the information about your health and safety program is normally required to be displayed to your guests and your TV system may be a perfect one to perform

of those places such as for example the ones that we have been discussing in pillar two third and very important will have to reconfigure the disposition for your public areas we will have to look at every state and prevent every table and make sure that the way they are placed and a distance of one-and-a-half to two meters is ensured between each guest and for single person use of elevators and wherever there is frequent contact between guests and stuff use panels to separate and provide some extra level of protection finally make adjustments to the room space the common way through space is
