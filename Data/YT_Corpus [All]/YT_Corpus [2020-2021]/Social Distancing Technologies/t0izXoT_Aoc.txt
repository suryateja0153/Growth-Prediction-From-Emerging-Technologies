 [Music] communication between humans and machines is hindered by a lack of shared awareness to bridge this gap Mitsubishi Electric has developed new AI technology refer to a scene aware interaction based on its proprietary mice art AI technology by analyzing the scene based on multimodal sensing information the system provides intuitive interaction using natural language to illustrate this technology we demonstrate a system that provides route guidance to drivers based on awareness of the scene using vehicle mounted cameras microphones and lidar measurements this system recognizes objects and understands events in the scene based on multimodal information it then generates natural sentences for guidance based on those objects and events a conventional navigation system would tell the driver to turn right in 100 meters this is not very informative since drivers may not have an accurate sense of distance our scene aware interaction technology enables the navigation system to behave like a knowledgeable passenger in the car describing the route intuitively using other cars and objects in the scene follow the black car to turn right turn left after the black building follow the black car to turn left turn left at the building with a billboard [Music] watch out for the oncoming bus in the opposite lane our system can also generate voice warnings when nearby objects are predicted to intersect with the path of the car a gray car is merging from right [Music] watch out for walking person approaching from left [Music] our scene aware interaction technology is also capable of adjusting its output based on a spoken response from the driver for instance if the driver indicates that they cannot see the given landmark the system will quickly identify alternate landmarks or improve the guidance sentence to provide a more detailed description follow the silver car to turn left I can't see it okay follow the silver car in the leftmost lane these advanced capabilities are enabled by recent breakthroughs in object detection and recognition semantic segmentation motion analysis of dynamic objects and natural language processing technologies our system also makes use of high precision maps that were captured using Mitsubishi Electric's mobile mapping system the AI technology underlying this system enables machines to understand their surroundings and interact with humans more naturally and intuitively it can be applied in a wide variety of situations including interaction with autonomous robots in hotels or factories elevators that wait for approaching passengers and surveillance systems that understand complex scenes and interpret them for humans [Music] we believe our scene aware interaction technology powered by my side' will fundamentally change the way that machines communicate with humans in the future enabling more natural and intuitive interactions [Music]
