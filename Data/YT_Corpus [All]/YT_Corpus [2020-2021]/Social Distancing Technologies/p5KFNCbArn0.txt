 hello everyone I am Linda Burton the Dean of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California Berkeley thank you all for joining us this morning I'm here to welcome you to this conversation on the roles of digital technology and telehealth a Miss like Ovid 19 and Dimmick please enjoy thank you good morning everyone this is David Linderman I'm director of health at citris program here at UC Berkeley and delighted to have you with us today and you will shortly be hearing from several of our campus experts who have been working in the space of telehealth and remote monitoring that has become critical in this area at this time of kovat we're very fortunate that we have this type of expertise because we are now seeing tremendous changes in the way we obviously have to socially distance how we get services and how we need to support each other what we have noticed in the last two months is a tremendous change in the way we use technology in this space particularly in terms of telehealth our University of California campuses have seen literally 1,000% increase in the amount of telehealth we are seeing new ways to reach people at their homes in the community we're also seeing new ways to collect information and for people to share it with each other and to support each other as we deal with mental health issues and other types of service needs so today you are going to hear from four of our experts a little background we will in addition to hearing from these faculty and individuals who are working in the community we will have an opportunity for not only them to share their information but for you to ask questions so as we get to the end of the program we'll be turning to the chat we would look forward to you sharing your questions with us and we will wrap up before the hour with a few ideas and examples of what's coming next so without further ado I'd like to introduce our for we're gonna be having Heather lead off who is a LCSW and a mental health supervisor at the clinic out here in Oakland she's at Casa de Sol right here and she will be followed by Elaine Koenig a physician who is a general internist assistant professor of medicine at the zoo clerks San Francisco General Hospital following that will be Courtney Lau's who's associate professor at UCSF and the division of general internal medicine again and at General Hospital and she's also at the UC Center UCSF Center for vulnerable populations and the Department of Epidemiology and biostatistics and finally we will hear from Adrienne Aguilar our colleague from here at the School of Social Welfare who's associate professor and he's also at the department psychiatry at UC San Francisco we're going to ask each colleague to spend a few minutes talking from their specific area and then we will hold for questions until we've heard from all four of them and then they have we have a few general comments that we'd like to share with you around the importance of this area how people will be able to work and anticipate telehealth and remote monitoring going forward in the future and as I said we will entertain your questions at that point so without further ado I'd like to turn the program over to Heather I'm Heather I'm a social worker clinic at Casa de Sol outpatient mental health clinic in East Oakland and we provide mental health services therapy case management psychiatry peer support individually and in groups formally and to primarily Spanish speakers from Mexico and Central America and the majority of our population are newly arrived and have this is a first experience engaging with mental health services so just to kind of set the stage for the work on the ground that we're doing luckily Nika so I'm just going to go over some notes that we have taken in over the last two and a half months of moving into telehealth to note this challenges and struggles and then I'll talk little bit about what we've learned and sort of how we've adapted we have really struggled with video and technology and it's sort of both the technological piece of downloading the apps and entering in the meeting code and doing all of that and I think resistance to video in general and it's sort of interesting because you would think that teenagers have more technological savvy then than we do but even there is some resistance there around the video around the video chat I would also say that we haven't gotten a ton of clarity from the board of behavioral services as well as our county in our clinic around moving beyond zoom in to whatsapp that was a recommendation on another webinar that I was on because a lot of our population used what's up to communicate with people internationally but in terms of confidentiality and how that works we haven't moved past zoom at this point and again I'll say that using zoom has been challenging so that we've mostly done telephone in the way for telehealth um struggles that we have had with our population particularly around children and play therapy trying to do that over the telephone is really challenging and services that are really around engagement particularly for younger children have been really hard and for people that have negative symptoms of schizophrenia or depression people that really struggle with communicating or have thought disorders transitioning to telehealth it's been really hard another element would be privacy our community really live in small spaces with many people and so trying to carve out space to get on a video chat or to be on the phone has been really really challenging um especially when people are looking at more deep level issues related to trauma or things that they don't want to be shared with the rest of their family which is the majority of therapy really we really had a hard time finding space and privacy confidentiality to make that happen I'll also say that for clients that we've had for a long time and have existing relationships with I think that the transition to telehealth has been easier we continue to open up new clients every day and when we're just meeting someone over the phone or by video again I'll say that much less by video it's really hard to build a relationship when we haven't have no physical context for someone I know that this week this last week I opened up two young men 19 and 22 with very similar stories and I'm having a really hard time differentiating each person what their story is how to write the note because they're getting very jumbled up in my mind when I don't have those physical traits to marker them for me so moving into lessons learned I think that flexibility has been really important for us we are flexible in general with our clients that have work that come up or different contexts that make a specific appointment every week hard but even more now we I know my colleagues are calling people throughout the day so we may have had an appointment at 9:00 to speak with someone but we're really trying to engage them throughout the day calling them over and over again to see if they'll pick up when they'll pick up how we can find them so really having therapeutic flexibility and in structured flexibility so that you can roll with it if someone's not available the time that we set um really trying to move beyond just the check-in around what's going on with their shelter in place or how they're doing with the quarantine that is a more easy way of engaging people but we're wanting to do deeper level therapy and get into the issues that are beyond just what's happening in this moment whether it be previous trauma or other issues that have been going on for a long time and so trying to push beyond just the hey how are you how are you doing right now has been something that we've been really working on I think that what we found to be helpful is to have some plan in place around an activity or some structure for the therapy as we're going into it thinking about it creating a timeline together using a memory from the past to delve deeper into to try to whether it's a positive and negative and neutral memory to try to build in that into a session so it's it creates depth and goes further I also think that negotiating the time with our clients has been helpful to say that I'd like to stay on the phone with you for about 30 minutes today would you be willing to do that and so we find that in therapy when we have a container whether it's the 50 minute hour or something like that that more comes up when you create more space for someone and so if we're just like hey how are you doing on the phone that could be really quick but if we can negotiate for more time and really allow what comes up in the silence or in the space we've found that there's more opportunity there I also think it's a very you know simple therapeutic technique but validating that being on the phone or being in a video chat is challenging and just naming that that we're struggling we know they're struggling but this is what we have right now and so to really name the name the struggle and be able to talk about that to create some more some more communication and more acknowledgement that this is a hard time but we're working with what we have thank you very much other wonderful start to share with us the types of issues and challenges but also your ability to connect with your population in your clients now like to turn to Elaine Lyn Koenig who will take a different perspective and share with us their work at UCSF thanks David so I'm Elaine kung I'm a assistant professor at UCSF a health services research and I'm a primary care clinician at Agra fort in San Francisco General Hospital which is the county hospital in San Francisco I also have a role as an informatics astaire and some doing some quality improvement work for hypertension diabetes and what I'd like to cover today in my introductory remarks are really just give you an overview of really what type of remote care we were doing before kovat and then how things have really changed since coated and then also the challenges that we've encountered with with some of that changes I'm just to get us started you know when I think about remote care I think there's been a lot of focus on telehealth and how clinicians have changed how they delivered pair to patients I think another aspect of care that I want to touch upon as well is actually on the remote care that happens between between clinicians and that's actually um initially before we started to a bit back in you know January this is really the primary way that our health system was doing remote care so we were actually one of the earliest health systems to use electronic consoles which is actually when I as a primary care clinician have a question about a patient that I think might need specialty input we can send the consult to the specialist and they'll review the patient's chart in advance and look over the chart and decide if the patient maybe needs any type of imaging or additional labs before the patient actually comes in for that in-person appointment and really that's primarily the extent of the type of remote care that we were doing in our health system beforehand in terms of interactions with patients remotely we had a patient portal which dr. Lyles will cover in more detail later but that's where patients have the ability to access their online medical records and that really had pretty low adoption option in our health system I think similar to what how they're touched upon our health system primarily serves a really large and low-income immigrant population and specifically in our clinic about 50% of our patients have limited English proficiency and so accessing information remotely can can be difficult by the middle of march into the end of March and we really had a huge change in how we delivered care and I think the really biggest change and that the thing that sort of a lot of people have focused on is really that instead of having patients come in in person for care we're really delivering a lot of our care remotely so you know in January I would say probably you know like less than 5% even even that of our appointments were done remotely very few people in our health system are doing that and by the end of March really over 80% or 90% of our care was delivered remotely and within our health system that primarily was through phone and I'm really the main reason for that is that um one a lot of the clinic's actually didn't have the infrastructure to deliver video visits so even for those of us who are doing video business right now we're primarily doing it through our own smartphones or own dove Isis another barrier that came up is that you know initially we actually didn't have a contract with zoom or some of these other software tools that allow for safe HIPAA access to to do video visits so that was another barrier as well and then I think as Heather mentioned as well you know a lot of our patients struggle with you know access to the devices or the ability to actually navigate navigate video visits but so that was sort of the biggest one of the biggest changes is that we move for in-person care its remote care I think another big change that we noticed was actually just in the number of appointments that we had so in the very beginning actually there was a huge drop-off in the number of patients that were seeking primary care and I think a lot of it was actually there's a lot of confusion about what type of care was being offered and how they could access it I know that a lot of my patients would get reminders about appointments and they actually thought that was a reminder about an in-person appointment not realizing that they could actually have the appointment over the phone and so there's been a huge drop-off in appointments that have now really picked up and and personally now we're close to where we were before probably 80 or 90 percent of this is but again that's because we're doing phone visits I know when I speak to colleagues at UCSF Health where they've done a lot more video visits they've actually continued to see that drop off in the appointments because of the type of paper patients who are able to access video visits and so I think the third thing that I want to touch upon in terms of things that have changed is really the type of patients that have been able to access care so I think there's definitely been barriers for some of our patients so thinking of patients who don't have phones who don't have a safe or private location to do a phone visit or a video visit but for some of my patients who actually have mobility issues who actually live pretty far away from clinic I've actually been able to access them a lot more and check in with them a lot more frequently than I was able to do so before I think the second thing that has really changed a lot is the clinician the clinician interactions so one of the primary tenants of high-quality primary care is actually co-locating the clinician in the same location as the nurse the medical assistant our pharmacists our behavioral health colleagues so that we can think about patients in really a multidisciplinary way and not a lot of people are working remotely from home and also because we're trying to avoid them having a large number of people in clinic it's actually been a lot harder to have that type of multi-disciplinary I'm conversation about our patients and how classes support our pair and so I know as a clinician now we're you know I'm personally checking in the patient's myself I've had the reschedule patients myself these are sort of just putting a lot more burden on the clinician and so I think as we've changed some of our care there's been a couple of challenges that that you've have come up and that we've started to sort of think about addressing and the first is really the shift in how we think about team-based care we had really developed a good team-based care for an in-person model and we still haven't quite developed power going to move team-based care into a digital digital approach I think another issue that's really come up is how do we provide high quality remote care so you know for my patients with a lot of chronic diseases really checking another blood pressure and diabetes can be difficult if they're unable to if we're unable to measure blood pressure and this is is um this is a barrier is not every single insurance company reimburses for blood pressure and so I don't I don't actually know how some of these blood pressures doing and then I think a really large issue that a lot of us have stress upon is a concern about equity so who's accessing care the type of care they're accessing really being able to communicate to them how to access care in in remote ways and also really providing them with resources to be able to access video care which we do know is is is better than phone business with them to get that get that done Elaine thank you so much you've really taken us through a number of specific issues related not only to the client perspective but also the multiple challenges we have from the provider perspective and we'll want to come back and visit those as a group shortly like the next turn - Courtney dr. Lyles who will speak from another perspective please thank you so much David good morning everyone icicle tea at UCSF with Elaine and the Center for vulnerable populations and they also AM a adjunct faculty in the School of Public Health in Berkeley and I think I'm gonna I really love starting with the on the ground experiences of clinicians I think that was a really important way to start our conversation today I'm not a clinician so I'm gonna potentially zoom out a little bit and give you some of my perspectives and the broader work that we've done on diverse patient engagement with digital health which i think is really relevant for thinking about telehealth from the time of covin and I'm hoping emphasized I think some of the points that both have their end healing and just me I wanted to make the point and I think one other thing I'll say is the equity focus i just am very honored to be on a panel while all of us are so focused on the equity point of telehealth in this time of covin so thinking nationally about patients and how patients interact with digital health tools I just wanted to ground the conversation to say that before kovat it was pretty well known that the digital divide in smartphone ownership or high-speed Internet at home we're shrinking for some categories like many many people are now owned smartphones but there actually happened persistent gaps in smartphone ownership and in high-speed Internet at home especially for low-income individuals rejecting Elaine and Heather really spoke nicely about in older Americans and and I think a lot of times in my work it's come up a lot especially in urban centers like San Francisco where I think the assumption is that almost everybody is connected that when you think really granular about the data of who's accessing tools to actually be able to do a video visit or even a phone visit as Elaine mentioned having owned and owning a phone and there's been some pretty good data from something in the San Francisco mayor's office for Housing and Community Development within our city in County and the digital health that rather the digital equity initiative sounds pretty big disparities that mirror those national trends so among low-income San Franciscans for example only 59% of them report having both high-speed Internet at home and basic skills and being able to use that and basic skills with something like searching for information online or text messaging or sending an email so it's a pretty big gap and compared to that group versus you know over 97 or 98 percent of higher income san Franciscans who are able to do all of those tasks easily and I think this pandemic has really shone a light on some of the digital equity issues that we have in our country and some of the strategies that we need to think about across when we think about health that's a really front and center issue now but we also have seen it in education and employment and all sorts of other domains and it's I think we need to be more unified and how we think about some of those underlying categories of how people use technology and how they're able to access them the second thing I wanted to speak on briefly which is just that we don't know actually that much about video business in the context of ongoing primary care or even mental health care I would say there's a lot more literature and thinking about that modality in different systems like Kaiser who have had that for a while and also for a lot of asynchronous care like specialty care telehealth and things like that there's actually less evidence or information out there about video visits of a platform for ongoing relationship building that I think will appeal and Heather both also touched on but we do know about patient portal use I always say as a proxy for some of that so when you think about patients being able to access their own medical record information and logging into a website to download their recent visit summary or to be able to send an email to their doctor or things like that we've been studying that now for over a decade and I would say a lot of the same issues come up and so when we think about racial differences and who's using patient portals or health literacy or language barriers those persistent patient portal use and I say we have to be very aware of that in this world of telehealth so that we're not exacerbating existing disparities of how we think about care and then the other final point about patient portal research I think might be relevant for us is um people are really interested in that modality although not everybody might be able to engage in those technology tasks or to be able to make a secure password to log onto patient portal website there's actually pretty high interest in being able to do that as long as it can preserve in-person relationships and as long as they have the technical support and to be able to ask questions and to be able to use it and stay using it on an ongoing basis so I think those are things to think about and then language barriers is the last point I wanted to make about there's obviously some significant language barriers that come up with patient portal use for things we push out in terms of health tech for our populations and we need to be thinking about I would say use of interpreters via telehealth and how to do that effectively for all of our patients either by phone or by video visit and how to do that in a more seamless way so they're not again not meeting people out or exasperate anything that's existing healthcare disparities in our system so I wanted to close by saying I hope that this time this moment in time can maybe bring forward access to technology and access to both devices high-speed Internet and the skills to be able to use those with digital literacy skills as a moment that we can maybe unify across domains to support unified policies and programs to bring us into the future so that everybody has access to these these services moving forward and I wanted to end by saying that there are many many community-based partners I think that are out there ready to partner with us on this work outside of the healthcare space I mentioned the SF digital equity initiative and the government there's also many nonprofits public libraries and that focus on supporting people and learning how to use technology and managing it and I think that's a new possibility potential that we should probably be making more bridges moving forward thank you very much Courtney appreciate your starting us really just keep focusing on the issues of access and the again the very great differences we have in terms of accessibility to these programs and some of the other barriers and we'll come back to that in our discussion section I like to turn now to Adrienne Aguilar who will take us through one more program that he's been developing with colleagues both at UCSF and UC Berkeley thank you David so I wanted to start with just giving you a little bit more context around myself just a frame of more about my work so I was mentioned I'm a faculty member in the school Social Welfare where I lead the digital health equity and access lab and I'm also the director of the LA fênix Center of Excellence which seeks to Train behavioral health workers in mental health work focused on la fenix populations at UCSF I'm in the department of psychiatry where I lead the Latinas mental health research program and I'm also part of the Center for vulnerable populations so as you probably noticed issues of equity issues of access focuses on populations of color are very important to me and I may or may not have had a hand in putting this panel together so that we can focus on those issues that I think are very important so I want to give you a little bit of frame about some of the work that I've done and some of the lessons that we've learned that hopefully will lead us in to applying the principles into this new time of covin so I focus on developing text messaging interventions for people with mental health problems I started developing a texting platform where we set in messages out to folks who were in cognitive behavioral therapy for depression we've started this around ten years ago and we found that by sending messages to people during the week while they're in treatment we were able to increase engagement in the live intervention so we're not doing live interventions anymore at the moment but one of the key takeaways that we found from this research is that as much as we focus on technology a lot of the success around digital and telehealth is around people and the relationships that patients have with their providers when we ask for feedback around how did these text messages help you people mentioned that they felt connected to their providers they felt cared for and supported so it's really important that we not lose sight that it's not technology first it's people first and the technology enables those relationships that's what patients look for when they're trying to get high-quality healthcare we also along with my colleague dr. Lyle's we recently developed a intervention to improve physical activity for folks with diabetes and depression and one of the things that we found obviously to be challenging is how do you engage in physical activity in the time of social distance we would often encourage people to walk with others or to go to parks or things like that and we're realizing that the limitations that people have particularly in urban environments where there's less space when focused on focusing on people with chronic illnesses and their exposure and so we really need to think about how we can still encourage people to maintain healthy lifestyles while limiting their risks of exposure and that's something we're actively working on and I think we're using technology to try to help relay this information to people so as you've noticed one of the things that we've also learned is to start with some of the basic technologies at the very least and utilize those as much as we can to engage people in terms of the area of mental health broadly kind of stepping back a little bit we've relied a lot on face to face as a standard form of intervention and in a lot of ways we've been hesitant to integrate technology but now we've been thrust and do it as a colleague mentioned the genies out of the bottle we have to do this and the reality is that in some form or another this is going to continue to be the norm so we have to find ways to make this work there's a saying and there P that patience cannot fail in therapy and I believe that we need to modify this a little bit and say patience cannot fail in telehealth or digital health the systems the providers can fail and the onus then is on us to ensure success and what this means is that we need to stop improving along the margins then instead innovate with and for those with the highest needs we need to do that by starting with the basics as was mentioned before by dr. Lyles we need to provide access to high-speed Internet via hotspots or any other methods that are possible we need to provide training tutorials we can't emphasize that enough it's not enough to throw our hands up and say this isn't possible but we have to find ways to do it because Kovac 19 is exposing existing disparities as we're seeing the disproportionate impact on communities of color we're also seeing the impacts of policy and that policies can make can speed these things along HIPAA was softened and allowed the use of various video platforms and I think that that showed the way that we can speed this along and instead of focusing on their barriers and the reasons why we can't do this we need to really put our heads together and figure out how we can do this so thank you very much for joining us and I look forward to continuing this conversation well thank you Adrian and thank you to all members of our panel as you've already seen we have an amazing set of experts and deep experience and particularly looking at some of the issues that kovat is starting to show in terms of challenges with accessibility the issue of disparity and how we'll have to address those but let's start quickly we've now like to have our panel has some interaction and share some points we have a few questions for them but we invite you to send us via the chat some questions that we can have you have a few coming in we look forward to more but let me start on a positive question for everyone you have all expressed some of the challenges but clearly some of the benefits not only for your clients but also for the provider community and how those have changed but back to the individuals who are now seeing this for the first time and or experiencing telehealth or using remote technologies what would you each say and again put this out to the group are some of the most impressive changes and benefits that you're hearing from your clients we heard a few but could you each share your perspective on what this is doing to change their outlook in terms of their health care their engagement their satisfaction please the floor is open I just wanted to start with some conversations with colleagues that I've had we have noticed that for some people this is actually improved access with a colleague at a clinic at the General Hospital mentioned that there are no show rates for their appointments that have actually decreased since starting telehealth and I think this type of information shows us that telehealth is here to stay and we're gonna be doing more of this even if Kovan somehow magically disappears because it can be a tool to remove access barriers for some folks so it's important to focus on that that being said obviously there are the barriers that we talked about but this really makes us realize that there are no one-size-fits-all approaches part of this approach can help many people and we just need to make sure to keep expanding that pool yeah I would just add to that convenience of care is obviously a potential real advantage of telehealth and they be not having to take multiple forms of public transportation or drive across the city to an appointment obviously that's an advantage of these kinds of modalities and I would say the second advantage is really about the support for managing whatever condition or issue closer to the time and you wanted to do the behavior so if you have a chronic illness like Alain was mentioning and you want to think about it if you should talk to somebody about their blood pressure in their everyday life you probably have a better chance of maybe making some adjustments than only seeing them every three months and maybe not being able to be closer to that to that behavior so I think those are some advantages I think adapted the ability to do that and still keep those interpersonal connections and to really to drive the the relational and then the continuity of care I think it's this flipside that we've been spending time on but there are obviously advantages for all people to do more convenient things through through virtual modalities telephone or video I I just want to sort of echo I guess everybody's comments definitely I've had patients who I've been unable to see why one patient who basically no-showed for like four or five straight appointments with me lives about an hour and a half away but made it to our first phone visit right that's like very accessible for that patient I'm another patient who requires oxygen and therefore leaving the house is um quite difficult and we've been able to check in much more frequently and so I think telehealth definitely has a role for certain types of patients and daydream mention is just maybe not the best for every single patient you figure out which ones are best for in-person care versus telehealth I want to think a vide on for that kind of pep talk because I feel like you know just acknowledging that no one no one fails and telehealth is really I don't know it really helps me to frame where the work that we need to do and I think they were all slow to change and slow to adapt some people are like let's get on board with new technology and let's do this and other people are like whoa and we see that with our clients and we see that with our colleagues right and so I've watched that in our clinic around some people are like let's get everybody on Zoom and separately no zoom doesn't work so I think that having this kind of pep talk like yes you can do it yes this is here to stay it's not about it's not about creating it's like not about necessarily knowledge in the barriers oh that's but also figuring it out and I think some of us have just hoped that this would go away and that we would get back to normal maybe all of us but acknowledging that this is here and that we have to figure out ways around this feels really important just in the idea of how change happens and so I do think that for mental health it's a bit more challenging because our our contacts are longer but I really appreciate the effort that's going into building more capacity for clinicians and for our clients to make this work and thank you Heather and Adria I appreciate how you reinforced the point that this technology again is it is here to stay but on the other hand it's based on fundamentals technology is only an a supplement it is not taking the place of good clinical care good support good ability to communicate with people to reduce isolation now if we could quickly switch to some of the challenges many people you've heard it already shared by our panelists and many of you already know that there are several fundamental system and system system systemic issues that are barriers to moving forward first and foremost broadband the lack of broadband we have we actually have to be considering how broadband could become a utility in this country secondly the issue of affordability the cost of different types of technologies and finally the issue of how will we use these connectivity to reach different population groups and have issues such as did a digital literacy particularly older adults when we look at other populations and even language barriers and health literacy issues so could each of you again share some points about what some of the biggest barriers you've already shared a few wonderful examples of how you've taken these on and looking for new solutions but what do you still see are some of the barriers that are still in front of us that we have to tackle some right so many of them David so I really appreciate that in terms of the the basic fundamentals device ownership and broadband and skills to be able to use technology even I would say to do the phone visit modality just pin making people comfortable with technology smart phones things like that I'm across the population and not sort of the quote/unquote worried well who would be able to quickest to engage with any new Modell we roll out so that's one I would say but maybe the flip side of that though is that technology can offer things to customize things so I think we you should also be thinking about the personalization that we might be able to offer so maybe I'm going to turn it into a positive I'm Steve and I think there are some big fundamental barriers but I do think there's some opportunities to use technology also to address some of our language barriers and to think about it more systemically and deliver things to people that are customized for themselves and maybe this is an opportunity to embrace some of those big barriers and head-on rather than sort of pivoting and saying that it's an adjunct to care only an adjunct to care and not one of the primary ways and we we would deliver things so there's just some few thoughts but you really highlighted a lot of big ones in my mind um I think in addition to sort of the device piece and the data piece I think on a system side thinking through how do we actually make care accessible to everybody so it doesn't lot of focus on like the digital limitations but there's like a whole workflow place related to actually supporting different types of care for diverse patients and that's something that I think that hasn't really there's not good data on it's really something that people are just figuring out as that as they go I know our clinic and when we first came out like every single day there was a change in a workflow responding to a challenge that we had before and so I think that's an additional challenge is just thinking through you know I think there was a question related interpreter use you know that's something we thought about through about in person care but as we roll out you know phone visits or video visits incorporating our workflow for how do we schedule interpreters or how do we bring interpreters into that visit that's just sort of a man aspect of care that that we need to be thinking about so I think it's it's not only the digital device piece to actually be able to do it all the service and the wraparound and all the workflows to support equitable care in telehealth did not pick you back on that yes technology is key here but the issues that have been in play for a long time related to access continue to be barriers insurance and knowledge of resources stigma around mental health in particular I mean we saw a huge drop-off of people requesting new services at the beginning of covin and there in early March where we would have five or six new requests for services a day we were getting to zero or one or two a week and so I think that people were really oriented to what is still happening out there like what services are still available and as was shared before us that people don't didn't understand if the telehealth if the reminder was in for an in-person appointment or for a telephone appointment I think we're really having to to provide information in a lot of different ways to our community about what still exists what people can access given that many of the things that services that we access before have been shut down and I'll just add this is a slightly shifting gears but because I focus a lot in the research world and this is kind of thinking the development of new digital tools or telehealth and so on one of my concerns is now that we have to increase the remote connection with folks that we recruit for our studies we still have to do things like recruit remotely have people sign documents via DocuSign for example and that's something that we've really had a big challenge doing so we've had to exclude some people from participating in our research studies because of that and that is that's a huge problem because those are likely the people that we need to have as part of the conversation the most I mean this is another example of one of those kind of policy type issues that we need to figure out oftentimes the things that we put in place protect folks are often the things that end up hurting them the most so they have a negative side effects of not allowing them to access these things so we really need to be mindful about how we can reduce some of those think this softening cover the HIPAA privacy barriers while we still need to keep that front and center but we saw how how we do seing that has been able to open up access and we need to think about different ways to do that in other areas thank you for taking us into some of the practical issues and what we have been seeing we have several questions coming in and I think it's time for us to take a few more from our audience some very concrete issues as well as some of the philosophical points of how we will maximize the use of these new tools particularly when we get past coated situations so the one key issue that has been raised by a number of folks on the call is specifically can you people share some of the issues around the actual costs the payment structures the mechanisms how different has this been and what are some of the issues that could still be a barrier or how do we anticipate the costs of paying for this type of new telehealth and remote care it hasn't impacted our service delivery the costs I mean if we serve people that are uninsured and have medical or some version of that and so when people sign up quote-unquote to receive services from us it's whatever is whatever is offered for a calendar year so we are offering telehealth in the same way and costs mostly dead no costs to the people that that we're providing services were I think because practice in a pretty large healthcare system and you know I'm not I'm not trying to make the budget balance I also am NOT seeing a lot of the cost related issues um but we do know sort of overall I think this is something that is definitely put on our radar so initially when the cares Act was passed they initially out pay parity so allowed video visits to really be at the same reimbursement structure as in-person visits and this was something that was really helpful for I think for a lot of clinics who really do rely on and sort of their weekly intake to be able to reimburse reimburse their staff but this was something that was a large concern I think for the clinics who had lots of patients who either maybe would be unable to access video visits because of a lot of the digital infrastructure issues we brought up before as well as clinics who actually didn't have their own digital infrastructure to provide video visits and so this is actually a sort of a huge issue I mean it was something that a lot of various medical organizations actually advocated for to try to get pay parity also for audio visits which I think was recently passed but is only applicable to some clinics and not to every clinic and those and the reimbursement for that is all in a CMS level so that's the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services so that only controls reimbursement from Medicare and lots of you know private insurances have their own policies as do each state's Medicaid Medicaid insurance as well and so I think sort of to answer the question it's sort of a it's it's in flux basically reimbursement is pretty much all over the place I think it's a huge issue for a lot of clinics that do primarily outpatient care and that are very much worried about how they're gonna be able to keep keep their clinic doors open and of course that's sort of from a clinician side I think from the patient side they're probably my senses they're probably not going to see as many differences I think this is a lot of the pay structure has really impacted systems systems a lot more and I would just add that on the patient side one cost that we need to be aware of is the use of data so if people can get on to a video call you know folks with less means often have plans where you can't just use all the data you want right because you're gonna use up all your data for the month so those are you know going back to David's point about looking at internet access and Wi-Fi as a utility I think that that's definitely somewhere we need to be going if we're gonna be doing more of this type of work and for those of you who aren't familiar the real change that's been occurring in terms of reimbursement and a the the ability to pay for some of these servers has been a very recent phenomena with covin 19 we're now seeing some dramatic changes in that direction we have a few other questions regarding different populations and both the way to inform individuals would love to hear your our panelists perspective on how do we tell people about these new opportunities how do we inform people about telehealth and visits we heard a few examples but also how do we then deal with some of the reservations how do we some of the natural barriers for example our older adults who may not be as comfortable with some of the new technology solutions or how to access them etc so love to have different perspectives shared now with how do we inform people more about this have we seen changes in it and then how do we address the specific needs yon language beyond the other barriers that are there to really make people comfortable with this space maybe I'll start really quickly and from the perspective of I do think people older adults and people who aren't as familiar with video visits and things like that I think we have to be aware that they're gonna need more time to be able to think about it and more time to try out a technology and use it but I just wanted to think about that training and support piece that I mentioned briefly ahead of time I just really think we need to think about sanitizing that I know it's a it can be a very big burden on the healthcare system so the last thing I wanted to mention about that is there are a lot of community-based organizations how can we think about better partnering to get patient support and using these things and without sharing you know health information personal health information but really getting them to be able to download an app or to be knowing about where the camera is on their device things like that and those does have existed for a long time in the past and I think we need to be and the same way that broadband might be utility I think we could do referrals out potentially from the healthcare system for digital literacy support the same way you might refer out for other services like bolstering that as a part of our system especially when we want to be doing this more at scale so that's one point and then making sure people know it's an option offering it to more people talking to them about it communicating about that it's really about trying to preserve their relationship and and those kinds of things I think we need to thinking about both of those together for my perspective and I think part of it is about expectations I think sometimes we have low expectations for clients that we work with and we say well they're not gonna want to do it or they say no thanks and we just take them for their word one of the things that we've learned in doing our texting program for some years now is we taught people we sat with people and taught them how to text message how to respond to messages and that in and of itself was an intervention exposing them to technology and then that allowed them to use the technology in many different ways so I think a big thing is just trying it trying it at least once and no it doesn't work for everybody but for many people once they try it and get one experience then it kind of sets off where they're much more comfortable doing it going forward and if I could switch us quickly because you are experts in so many areas but particularly also in mental health and a few we have a few questions related to how do we see even deeper support for those issues we know that while we have some benefits some people would say as people are learning how to telecommuting used news services such as telehealth we also see an increase now in potential for isolation depression etc so could you share again some of the ways you envision we can support people and beyond the projects you've described what we'll need to do in the area of mental health I'll speak today I want to just back up a second to answer the question before and there was a question also around having a telehealth technologist and I think that that also would be helpful if we could dream about what would be available to us because I I struggle with technology and so then helping my clients to to to download it and to do it it's also a challenge for me and for many of my colleagues and I guess that would be my question for other Dion as well as if someone says no do we take it as a hard no or do we keep asking them and offering over and over again because we really want to be patient-centered and we really want to listen to what our clients have to say but in this in this time we really we want to push too so I think it's that fine line of pushing and accepting when it's something that's just not gonna work for right now and I would and other dad and I worked together at San Francisco General and I can I can remember that feeling of building capacity around technology with you know a lot of older patients that we would have that are spanish-speaking that if we sat down and really gave them like really one-on-one attention around technology you can just see their face light up and the way that they experience learning something new was such a gift for them and they really believed that we were sending them those text messages that like Abba Dionne and I were sending them text messages reminding them to go for a walk so whether it was a machine that was sending out that message they've really interpreted that as us so that to speak to that last point I may be either and you could just can speak to that piece around the push tension related to technology and sorry we'll move on to the next question afterwards yeah definitely I think that you know I think particularly from a mental health perspective I think a lot of the work we do is push people into uncomfortable spaces right you want to nudge people to kind of improve and better their lives in different ways and I think this I see a parallel in this way I think a lot of us particularly during these times that are you know stressful somebody talked about um the impacts of this whole experience on mental health and I think what we are seeing is that yes all of this anxiety and fears interacting with what people have been dealing with to begin with particularly when you think about anxiety disorders PTSD you know obsessive-compulsive disorders things like that this is magnifying those types of issues feelings of stress and anxiety or magnifying and I'll take this moment to plug a program that we just developed kind of related to thinking about what are we going to be doing going forward we developed a program called stay well at home it's a texting program and in Spanish being a studying gasa and folks can sign up to receive text messages every day on coping strategies during this time they you can type the word well wel L in English or BnB IEM in Spanish two four one five four eight zero five two one one hopefully this will be posted somewhere else but to say that I think that particularly would we're thinking about mental health going forward we're gonna see mental health probably lag in terms of how kovat is impacting folks right now the focus is on physical health as it should be but I think we're gonna see that the mental health of the population is going to be impacted not only by the disease itself goodbye all the economic and social consequences and I'll say that many of our clients that were in services related I'll say this more for teenagers and for kids that there was a big relief when school was out so we saw a lot of symptomology decrease or made it related to bullying or academic stress or conflict at school so there was there's some silver lining not really but I think I agree with you at the end that this is its we're gonna see a big balloon starting to happen and coming forward as this shelter-in-place continues and as economic stress increases that we're gonna have to be really ready and increase our capacity as as we go into into more of the summer months these have been fantastic points we're getting approaching the end of our our what I would like to do is again share with all of you that we were not able to get to all of your questions we do see more we would like to be able to respond to those if possible later also colleagues that are on the line today have shared with us several resources we have a great deal not only at Berkeley but within here in California that as you want to explore this further or looking for more specific information we'd be happy to help you find that I'd like to close with asking each of our panelists to share one more point and we're going to do this very quickly but I would like them to each say once we get past Ovid 19 what do you envision for telehealth moving forward because this has been a game changer will it stay will a change will it change the way we look at health care in the way we interact with each other so I'll let each of our panelists respond what will be coming in the future how are they gonna start it um I definitely think telehealth is here to stay I think you know health care unfortunately has always been a little slow to adopt um changes in technology but this has really pushed us forward and I think now that it's been here I don't see clinicians or patients saying like we don't ever want this back I think the big things for but really for us to sort of try to figure out right now is is one like who is who's best served by telehealth like what are the best use case scenarios for it and and you know some people are still better served by in-person care but really thinking about patient convenience and patient centered care like there's definitely patients who felt health is better for and I think the second piece is if we're going to support it I'm really thinking through the reimbursement piece the pavement structure building in the infrastructure so that if we're going to support it it is accessible for all right I think there's a lot of attention I'm devoted on this now and we really have to use this time now and attention given in telehealth I think about you know making broadband a utility I'm building an infrastructure not only for patients but also for on the clinician side as well enough CC had a grant to support clinicians purchasing devices to actually be able to provide to help telehealth services and then I think the reimbursement piece not just specifically only for the he'll on telehealth visits but like the remote monitoring tools all the other types of things that we want to be able to deliver remotely to deliver high quality care Thank You Lee Gordon back on that yeah maybe I can keep going David and I think this is a unique moment in time and doing this work and thinking about uptake of tools for both providers and systems and patients prior to this I think a lot of the things have been removed in terms of some of the policy barriers and some of the initial resistance to trying out some of these tools and in real life care and so I think it's a moment for telehealth to stay and I hope we can do it right with respect to equity I think and I think we can think hard about it and maybe at least track numbers be really careful about how we think about it rather than throwing up our hands a year from now and saying oh it increased disparities and oh we can't we can't keep doing this hopefully we can think about it more proactively and since they're just there's a light on that in this moment into something different it's not gonna be perfect but now is the moment to try out some things and to see see what's happening and to try to get more people using it and see what's working with not working another I hope that those of us that have been listening today feel a bit more motivated as I do having listened to my colleagues around adapting and I have heard the message loud and clear that we can't just say it doesn't work that we have to find workarounds and we have to have to make it work so I hope that we continue to have technical assistance and quality assistance may that be from the people doing the research for people that are that know about the technology and continue to have support trainings offerings for clinicians around how to best build interventions build activities build ways of connecting with our clients and patients around that so I think building skills building both on the patient and the clinician side I am really gonna be important yeah and I think from the field of psychology we know that the best predictor of a future behavior is a past behavior so I think the fact that world that a lot of folks are doing it means that we're gonna keep doing it we need to now focus on where for where and for whom it's going to work the best and integrate it within kind of good stepped care models and then I think finally really trying to reach out to our partners particularly in the Bay Area in Silicon Valley folks in digital health to really think about how you can make an impact in reaching out the communities of most needs well we couldn't ask for a better summary from the four of you this has been fantastic in terms of what you've shared with us how you pushed us to think about the future and again very encouraging word about what we've seen in in in a time that's been very challenging for all of us so your speakers today as you've seen were Heather let off Courtney Lyles Elaine cone and Adrienne Agri liya and I would like to not only thank them but thank Dean Linda Burton and the school social welfare for allowing us to put this program together and again for what you're seeing how our colleagues here at Berkeley UCSF in the community are all working together in this time to advance we can help individuals and come out of this even stronger and better thank you for your attention today we look forward to hearing from you and please participate in future conversations with Janssen
