 hello hi good evening I'm dr. Gary hassle and I'm the vice chair of External Affairs the Aussie GP and I'd like to welcome you all to the first in a series of like panel events that will be holding from RC GP for our membership we wanted to be able to speak to you directly about what the college's been up to and what we're doing working on behalf of our members and our patients during this difficult time you'll have heard some of what we're up to through our media work but we really wanted to take in it an opportunity to to discuss more directly with you what we've been doing and tonight's discussions around the topic of innovation and technology each week we'll be broadcasting a discussion on a topic that's related to coded with some leading figures from the college and you'll have the opportunity to ask us your questions you can put those to us through hashtag RC GP together live on social media or if you write them in our online four and then we've got members of the team scouring that to make sure we pick those those up from you during the session if there's any questions that we don't manage to answer during the question or during the session then we'll try and get them posted in a blog afterwards if you've got any questions that aren't about technology for instance on training testing mental health or anything else that you think is really important please do let us know and we'll try and cover it in a relevant Q&A on another occasion and if you'd like to use the same hashtag to suggest other topic areas then we'd be delighted to hear from you so I'd like to start off with very brief introductions from the other people who are on the panel tonight and then I'll ask them to take an opportunity when they first speak to introduce themselves a little bit further but we've got professor Martin Marshall who's the chair of Aussie GP UK Council - Lawrence Dorman who's the chair of RC GP northern islands council and dr. Steph Coughlin who's our clinical league for innovation they'll be able to tell you about different areas of work that we're doing within the college as we go through the course of this evening I would like to take the opportunity at this point just to say thank you for the Aussie GP health informatics group which is chaired by dr. Marcus Bohr they've been an absolute driving force in the college's response around technology for kovat and I'm sure some of the work that they be doing will come up during the course of our discussions this evening they've been absolutely pivotal in feeding back to the government's and the NHS on data sharing arrangements data extraction in primary care research and the NHS contact tracing app a special thank-you to Marcus as well for setting up the college's online members forum which has been a hugely valuable resource for us as a mechanism for communicating with our members so Marcus thank you particularly for that bit of work so we've had a couple of questions come in already so what I'll do is if we go straight to the first question and as I say if when the panel speak for the first time make it perhaps give us a little bit of an introduction of what we do for the college but also where they do their GP practice as well so the first question we've had in is from Chris by the forum and he's asking given the advancement in need and availability of video consultations and other technologies to supplement the consultation and DP so she's more broadly for example people sending in photographs of lesions and things is this a priority for the college or simply an interest of the college and how will we be pursuing this going forwards because it really has been fundamental to the change in the way we're practicing at the moment and perhaps I can go to Martin first please so thanks very much Gary and and welcome everybody thank you so much for joining this event it's really excited to have this opportunity interact with you and to respond to you and hear what you have to say and so I'm Martin Marshall I'm chair of the college and I'm a GP in East London in Europe I am an academic at UCL a Health Service researcher so I think this is this is a key question so as a college we have always made it clear that GPS embrace technology I remember in the practice that I trained in down in Devon quite a long time ago that practice had gone paperless in 1974 with record systems so Jerrod's has a long track record of embracing technology and we've been very clear as a college that we feel that patients want and deserve and will benefit from a range of different ways of access accessing care face-to-face of course telephone of course but also online text-based asynchronous care whole range of different approaches and we've really welcome that and we see that online care as being absolutely key to what we want to deliver there are pros and cons to all different approaches and to accessing care but we think as a college and promoting and encouraging the right use of balanced use of technology is actually central to what we do so I hope that's a helpful introduction at least Kerry okay that's great Thank You Martin Lawrence perhaps I can bring you in here please thanks guy and my name is dr. Lawrence Norman and the chair of throwing quantity peace in Northern Ireland and I'm a GP principal and Coquille in Northern Ireland and for those of you who don't know our geography and Norton Coquille it's a small fishing village and the east coast of Northern Ireland and just between the Martins of Mourne and the more in mountains form a lovely shielding area just between them and this stays with the beautiful part of the world identity after lock don't get to visit it so our survey we were very keen to push our survey hard we extended our serve because we really wanted Northern Ireland members to feed into it and our results former very closely to what you guys have been finding and we've been finding that 40 percent of GPS have not been able to work remotely during the pandemic and we think this is very important because what this will allow us to do it allows to utilise our work force to its maximum so people need to work at home align them and enabling them to work at home would be really important and what we did find was that network issues were a problem with about 40% of those working at home and about 52 people who were working at home we're having difficulty getting a laptop and we knew this because we speak to our GPS on the ground as as you do Gary and as Martin does as well and then we speak to our colleagues on the ground they were telling us at the start of code there was a rush for everybody to rush I can buy things enough so we're really using this survey to engage with our government and to get them to go to work with us to give us the resources that we need and the texture has been really helpful because it allows us to open up this big discussion more widely and we find in Northern Ireland the text survey was was quite focused on working from home but as we all know that there's much more to this so we're keen that this opens a bigger discussion I think we were wise as the ecology and to have the you have quite a clear focus within this discussion because if we just opened it up for everything it would be a very big discussion indeed we're really keen that this opens up more and we can talk about more of what technology can offer us okay that's great Thank You Lawrence and perhaps Steph I can come to you and maybe just a lot of people out there might not know that we have a clinical lead for innovation so maybe you could tell us a little bit about what your role precoded was inside the college and we've been the last couple of months as this has really come to the surface yeah well thanks very much Gary and it's great to be able to join the panel this evening I'm Stephanie Kirkland and I'm a GP in Hackney in East London and I'm clinical leader for innovation here at the college actually the innovation team would have been working precoded on a whole variety of projects and some particularly relevant ones now doing some work on continuity of caring what that looks like and also some work around digital therapeutics so thinking around well-being apps and what evidence and standards look around that but really now focusing and with the college team on what what a transition and recovery post kovin looks like and just going back to there what Lawrence was talking about about the survey done in Northern Ireland I'm actually the donor own so they're here in England actually had an amazing response and over a very short period of time a lot of similar themes around technology came up it's a really exciting time actually for some it's a burning platform we've been waiting for to make some changes but actually we know that basic IT and hardware and access to those are a challenge and we know that you know mirroring the Northern Ireland results about 50% haven't been able to access remote working because of Technology and VPN connections have been a really big issue so actually thank you to everyone who's responded to the survey and actually it really gives us some incredibly valuable on-the-ground information to take forwards ok Thank You Steph so I think what your answer highlights is that the innovation and the technology arena is one that was a priority for the college prior to kovat and I think you know there's the old adage about not wasting a crisis and actually a lot of people who'd been reticent about taking up the opportunities to use some of these technologies in their surgeries have been had their arm twisted if you like and forced to embrace them it was really important to us as a college to understand the barriers for our members and I think both Lawrence and Steph you've touched on some of the issues that people had around the hardware around broadband connections and it was difficult enough to instigate this when we were all working from our usual buildings and with the added challenge of having to be working from home as well that that's just added a different angle we've got a follow-up question from Chris who's asking what efforts are being made to avoid any element of perceived bureaucracy in supporting this position within teaching assessment and maintenance courses he says ultimately I'm asking can the college roll this program out within a year now what I haven't mentioned is I'm a GP off in Peterborough but I also chair a Clinical Commissioning group and a potentially small amount of investment in in this this technological equipment the laptops the webcams of speakers the headphones and things like that as absolutely revolutionized the way we're able to to deliver things but that's because we've been given the special coded budget lining and a green light to invest in in these things so how are we going to make sure that we don't let bureaucracy get in the way Martin or Caesar as the policy leader for the college is that something that you're considering and do you have any answers the members who might be worrying about that yes I think it's exactly the right question isn't it because we have to move really quickly in order to maintain the benefits that we have seen but also to push back on some of the me and technology related covert changes that we perhaps don't want to see embedded in the service long term so as far as the college is concerned I think our general response to the cove aid pandemic has been has been really quick I mean I do understand that the college is sometimes criticized for being a bit stodgy a bit slow to move I think over this Cove in crisis if you look at what's been developed in terms of support for our members and support for general practices in particular I work with bodies all four governments for example in order to get changes has been phenomenal so I think the college has demonstrated its ability to work at pay so we must continue to do so but this is about more than the college the college can produce learning materials it can lobby governments it could Lobby online bodies in order to facilitate these activities but it's also about those bodies themselves acting quickly and during the cobra crisis they've demonstrated their ability to do so as well I have to say and some of the as gary says the funding that's gone into technology just in my local area in in Niram I'd not done remote consultations in my practice prior to this kind of crisis within about two weeks of the crisis happening Numa provided me with a laptop with records on it with a secure VPN connection and I was within a week up and running and doing consultations that's the kind of thing that we need to do and it was actually as Gary says it's a tiny amount of money to provide those kind of extra technologies for GP I don't know how much it was 1,500 grid you know when you look at the overall cost of healthcare it's a fraction of what we're spending and yet it gives us flexibility it introduces new people into the workforce wouldn't it be wonderful if we managed to retain some of the retirees the returners in the workforce do I think the potential is just okay sorry can I come in there guys right in Northern Ireland we're doing things differently as well and so some of the enhancement programs you know such as accurate sand zoom that are attaching onto our computer systems it's really important that we utilize these one forward and there's definitely a big role for the college in Northern Ireland to provide training for people I think all of us have learned on the job how to use these functions and most of us if we're honest were only using them that the initial bit of the function you know we learnt the easy bits but to get an expert to really show us this Filip capability nation between time I can definitely see a role for the college thank you thanks Lawrence I mean step we've had discussions previously in other areas where we've said that if you give GP a challenge to fix if you give them some time and if you give them the freedom to innovate then they will come up with a solution that suits them we often get tied up in saying you know have we got the evidence have we got the proof that this is good but people have innovated and tried different things and we move very quickly and the stuff that's not worked we've turned off but we held on to a core of new technologies over the last couple of months what do you think about the challenge that some may be saying is that we should be blindly adopting it without having a research base to justify its use it's a really good question I think one thing that the last couple of months have really shown is the the process of rapid test and learn and so actually how local areas have used that cyclic all approach to start something very quickly but actually then if it's not working stop it and change and so I think that there has definitely been a culture change into how we can adopt and innovations and technologies and actually giving us the confidence to quickly identify if something is working or isn't working so I think the culture change and I think you need to credit to GPS across the country actually flexibility and adapted app ting very quickly and and being open to new ideas and open to new ways of working very quickly I think all of those together I think they've definitely changed the landscape going forwards okay thank you obviously whenever we bring in a new tool like this to facilitates us with our interactions with our patients not everybody is going to be able to adopt it at the same pace either because of logistical reasons or maybe they haven't got the broadband connection so what's the colleagues done to highlight areas of inequality where that technology isn't accessible maybe Lawrence can I ask you for your view on that one please okay so we have used the survey team to highlight things that that we don't have so there's areas of inequality and we are worried about people you know in 2013 I think I mean the college showed there was a survey done that children already had presented appropriate digital skills and we were very worried about people who are older who are homeless and who won't have access to digital digital services it's also have highlighted inequalities in Northern Ireland and what we can offer to these that maybe people would have in the mainland so other GPS would have me mad I mean inequalities between GPS so for example in Northern Ireland we don't have electronic prescribing which i think is more widespread over in Wales and in England and using things like the server we have been able to bring this up to government and to our permanent secretary and highlight this to highlight how investment in an electronic prescribing and if it's not only that all Health Service it makes my prescribing to see effort towards the chemist but it helps our host sited reduces footballs and more practices it helps reduce you know carbon dioxide levels it keeps people's off the roads so there's there's big benefits for society but only if I having these data and by getting good GPS to participate in these these surveys come we become we bring these two governments ok and Martin have you had the opportunity to speak to anybody in the ministries or the Department about any of these short fallings in the availabilities of technologies really to have to pay for those colleagues of ours who are really struggling to get on board with what we can see has the potential to be a very new way of working yeah so I think the issue of inequalities unequal access is a is a massive one and as Lawrence says it relates both the GP if you like you know our provider role inequalities there but also in terms of patients as well so from a GP point of view yes the college has been lobbying for a long period of time and to improve our access it's about broadband availability we know that that isn't available in many parts of the country particularly in remote rural areas that can sometimes be a problem it's about the availability of the equipment it's about the availability of the skills so we've been lobbying for a long time to ensure that everybody comes up to a reasonable level of provision and a reasonable level of training and skills to allow them to use er technologies I think neither college is a patient Buddha you are really important to us because one of the things that that we do as jeebies is is is hold a kind of community health public health type responsibility excuse me and and we see the inequalities there and in the frontline technology has the potential to exacerbate those are the qualities but it also has a potential to alleviate those technologies and you know as an example of that we know there are some people with mental health problems for example who would much rather access care through technical solutions rather than traditional face-to-face we know adolescents are often an underserved group they're more likely to access care through using technology as well so I think there's we have to think really carefully about the inequalities agenda but we have to actually utilize technology in order to address these long-standing deep you see thank you and I think it's often very easy to jump to stereotypical ideas of those that might be struggling with the technology sort of the older patient population but I think when we've had discussions beforehand anecdotally we're finding a lot of people do have access in it it's not usually just based on age we've got plenty of older patients who are able to use the technologies and finding it particularly helpful especially if they've got mobility issues so we'd struggle to get down to the surgery and now they can use these technologies going going forward it might actually make it easier as well as those other groups and mental health patients and the adolescents that you mentioned Martin that's right right Gary but it certainly about having the technology and being able to use it but it's also about having the health literacy literacy in order to be under us to understand what it means and that and we mustn't forget that step because it's really a central part of it yeah I was just wondering fun to pick up on something that you were talking about earlier on because you mentioned you're doing some work around continuity of care and obviously that's a massive issue for us when we were sort of consulting you know in all the other ways if you like can you tell us a little bit more about that work you've done and how you think that might be changed by the changing the way we're interacting with our patients now thanks Gary so here at the college we are working with the Health Foundation and a number of pilot sites across the country to look at what continuity of care looks like and what works both from named GPS relationship based care but also micro teams so actually the the change over the last couple of months I think from on the ground perspective actually continuity of care in lots of ways has become even more important than it was before but actually your continuity is happening in different ways and actually does the does a change in technology you know do the questions that we're asking is that making continuity easier and how how is continuity impacted on it so I think it's really great that we've already got this projects happening now and then actually and as we start to get into into the autumn we can think about how some of the digital solutions and tech solutions that the sites have been utilizing as well as other other ways of working have been impacted by by the coded pandemic and actually what's the learning so there will be information and learning that we'll be able to share and towards the autumn that's been thank you Marty I wonder if I could pick up on on to elements of the new ways we're working when when you became chair of council you you're very interested in workload and also relationship based care you know we hear from from other areas of the health arena that perhaps now do you please are doing less face-to-face consultations that this has generated a large amount of capacity but that doesn't feel quite right to me when I'm sat in my prime so just wondering if you had any reflections on on that day and then perhaps in a while we could pick up the relationship-based hair part yeah so the the figures around how general practices of changes the consequence of this crisis are really are really dramatic so we know that prior to this crisis these are these this is data that comes out of our research surveillance center which is based in Oxford pretty reliable data prior to this crisis around about seventy seventy-five percent of consultations were carried out face to face now it's around about 15 percent according to their data actually my experience in East London is even less than that in terms of activity we know that the number of consultations has dropped by about 25 percent and of course consultation numbers there's only one thing because we're only cheap he's doing other things as well but we know that the workload sorry the nonon non-clinical workload administer responsibilities have dropped by 28 percent now some people are saying so general practice is quiet and it isn't it seems to me that we were working at 120 130 percent of capability and capacity prior to the crisis and we're now down to something that that actually is doable I think we really do need to see technology as one of the ways of ensuring that we address the workload crisis and we keep the workload in a manageable level that's gonna require to differentiate between where we could really add value as GPS away we can't wear it said doctors business and where it's on the members of primary health care team so I think there's lots of really big strategic issues that the Cova crisis gives an opportunity to address okay thank you perhaps Lauren so I could ask you a question around that we've obviously got the technologies in our surgeries now can you see any roles for these technologies for the way we interface with secondary care and oh you've done a lot of work from Northern Ireland around sort of communicating with colleagues in secondary carry the more traditional routes but I wonder how that's going to look now with using more tonight technology or options say that more advanced technological solutions yes so in Northern Ireland we have done a lot of work between the other royal colleges we have our principals document which all those 14 royal colleges in North non-degree - and it was it was about how we got back to basics of IT courtesy and respect and everybody signed up to that but I we need to take it to the next level and I'm actually delighted that through this work it has should through the best of us so things like ambulatory units are being opened up in Belfast and they're being opened up as a partnership where everybody recognizes each other's roles and untie we can best come together to serve our patients better and focus on our patient's journey and how that relationship between each other it's just so important but the use of technology can be really important and in all of this do we need to be communicating with videoconferencing has been very helpful and we find learning through video and through technology very helpful as well our secondary care consultants that are you know are very keen to be involved more now in our teaching sessions but we all learn together and Northern Ireland has run the Portugal project echo which is a national service which recognises that everybody is a teacher everybody is a learner and those sessions have been very helpful and one of the big things that we've come up through this is that with there has been a developed acute website in Northern Ireland and country BNI and that's been a multi-agency website the colleges had represented into it between the college our postgraduate departments unit through Queen's University and RTP federation's and it's been a really good example for harnessing you know technology through website learning through webinars and so so the communication is a lot of ways through that with our secondary care colleagues as narrator and this is really in an opportunity that we we've used okay thank you I'm doing a piece of work with the Royal College of Physicians at the moment which is looking about how we use this new technology around referral and bringing me an expert opinion when we we've got issues with our patients and one area that our patient group at the college actually flagged up was the potential for a sort of three-way dialogue between the patient the secondary care specialist and their GP all being able to be on a video consultation at the same time has anybody got any experience of trying to do that sort of thing in the past and can see any benefits and how that might be easier going going forwards so Martin you're not in your head yeah so um so yes some experience I mean it seems to me that the traditional outpatient model is the most unreconstructed part of the NHS having to refer somebody in too often a nameless service nowadays an anonymous service and then having to wait for weeks or months in order to be seen and then having to wait for several weeks for a letter to come back is just crazy and the opportunity to use technology to replace a lot of the waste that goes on in outpatient services I think is phenomenal so in each lender we have access in a range of different ways to to our specialist colleagues using telephones using online using three-way video based consultations between the patient the GP and the specialist we have really good ways of transferring data between the different sources and it just works phenomenally well I don't see any reason why that that can't be rolled out across the UK I think we have to remember that the general practice does by and large have better technology and better understanding of technology than a hospital colleagues have so it's going to require a significant investment in in hardware and soft that must be the future okay thank you and Stefan something if I can ask you a question please on a theme that that's starting to emerge in is you said earlier on that we've been trying to get these changes to happen for a while we've kind of reached that burning platform that that's given us the impetus that that slight nudge off a cliff edge which has really promoted the change in the way we're behaving as we look to the future I think it's also probably a good idea just to look back and try and reflect on some of the barriers to change that were there before have you got any any reflections around that what may have been stopping us previously so we can learn from that so we don't sort of sit too tight on other opportunities that might present themselves in the future yeah Gary and so I think thinking about barriers what have been barriers in technology and innovation I mean in actually a Marten talked about one of them earlier around workload actually when you are working at one hundred and thirty percent having space and capacity to think about change change takes time it takes investment it takes energy and actually when you're flat out it is difficult to be able to find the capacity to do that so actually our workload has not decreased it's just that it has become to a more manageable level and a more appropriate level which has given us a space I think the other is around workforce as well and you know there are there are differences across the country and that those sometimes it doesn't matter how much technology you have not having a stable workforce in order to implement technology is a real challenge so actually there is lots of work that we need to be thinking around supporting those areas just struggling with time equivalence of GPS because actually we still need work force in order to be able to implement it so you know I'm really interested to understand how those areas who have you have less hold time equivalent GPS have managed throughout the past a couple of months and then I think the other is you know Lawrence talked earlier about a cure it's actually quite an altruistic company who have got what we needed who have been there who have you know they're one of several but actually it's one who were there when we needed them and actually were able to support us with very quick rollouts from actually listening to what we wanted and needed so I think I'm having more having companies who were there has also been incredibly helpful and perhaps didn't necessarily have the impetus or well there wasn't the need for it before and to support us in these different and more altruistic ways yep so Lawrence and then to Martin please yes so so some of the warm up working hasn't actually increased our capacity it's just allowed me to work out my desk from a different place so it's very important to staff stairs that we keep you know focusing on workforce we will need you no more GP so you know when the workload comes back to normal again but also weren't quite reliant on my desktop being open for me to work remotely so if somebody else is taking up my slot as aware and the practice it doesn't put any extra capacity into my work so that's really important that I've seen in a bigger picture okay thank you Laura Martin yeah I think I was gonna say the same of ignorance is exactly right that I'd do 50 minute consultations and if I'm doing a proper conversation on the telephone or a proper consultation on video it still takes me 15 minutes so whilst policy makers think they're going to get enormous efficiencies out of using technology i think me the main advantage advantage but one of the main advantages accrues to patients because it's more convenient and that's fine that's important that's what that's what we're here for so I think that's a key issue I think Stephanie is exactly right in her description of the of the kind of facilitators and the barriers one of the important services I think gives patients willingness to engage with technology which has happened as a consequence of this crisis they've had no choice in the same way as we've had no choice and patients have discovered that both telephone and video technologies can be real good ways of accessing care so I think that's important but we do have to remember that and this isn't the death knell of face-to-face consultations consultations are just fundamentally bored but I'm sure Gary you're going to come back to that yes I will do and I just want to pick up on one point you've made there because we've had a question coming from the Northern Ireland council patient group saying the mounting piece of embracing new technology in their surgeries you've highlighted a couple of the advantages are around convenience and we've talked about people who have mobility issues perhaps not being able to get to service but being able to access doctors better now with the technology and but can you think of any other advantages from from the patient's side of the consultation perhaps Steph can i ask you that one first please I think there's I think just going back to a mountainside I think there is something here about placing value on remote consultations and actually both across a primary and secondary care and actually these aren't triage these are no less value than a face-to-face consultation and while so face faces is crucial and you know some are you know I imagine some surgeries out there also reaching the point where they've been trying to manage some patients remotely for a couple of months or seven weeks or so and now at the point where actually I think I think we need to have the face-to-face at this point so I think we need to remember the remote consultations and virtual consultations are one part of a whole package in general practice and I think from the patient's perspective the advantages are convenience actually some patients find it easier to talk to us remotely and to build trust and to testers and and to find out whether we are the right you know the right kind of doctor for them I think that one thing that will be interesting to see is that um using remote consultations has been easy during a lockdown period so one thing I'm quite interested to see is that as we move away from lockdown and people start to do their normal normal activities and aren't quite as home-based I'm interested to see how remote console patient's possibly come into their room there are people able to fit them in better in their lives as well so I think there are lots of advantages you know for the patient but we need to make sure that we recognize it so one and that we don't get into a position where actually technology is a barrier to us then actually bringing somebody in to see us because that face-to-face contact is incredibly important for a whole host of reasons yeah I think that face-to-face contact and that relationship that we build with our patients is something Martin that is very central to the work you want to achieve over the next few years is that something you could just give us a a bit of an update on and sort of video consultations are of the future of general practice do you think that's true or and how would that impact on relationship based care yeah so this concept of relationship based care which is a slightly clumsy term but I haven't got a better one at the moment I think it's fundamentally it's a foundation on which our practices bill so we know that some of what we do in general practice is relatively transaction it's relatively straightforward it may or may not require the skill of the GPD expert medical generalists but but it's pretty straightforward and tech is really using technology is a really good way of achieving it relationship based care into the difficult bit of general practice it's a bit where we really add value and I would say it's a defining characteristic of what we are asking piece it's what differentiates us from from many other other branches of the medical profession and I think it's important we start only probably starting to understand what the elements of that relationship based medicine is we know it's important and there's growing evidence that relationships are as important and as powerful and intervention as prescribing drugs often the things that we could do when we know somebody and somebody trusts us in terms of not over medicalizing a problem prescribing social interventions rather medical ones of not doing excessive interventions not doing it investigations not doing excessive referrals all of that is a fundamentally broad what we do and it's absolutely called to us in general practice so I've always believed that the face-to-face interaction is an important part of that building relationship and building of trust which allows you to be effective as a doctor and you know the elements of that I guess are and the different kind of relationship you have when you're in the same room with somebody the ability to shake hands with somebody and hold somebody's have the ability to see the nonverbal communications the ability to lay on hands some of its symbolic some of it is is very practical it all seems to me to be a really important part of the of the interventions that we use as GPS now what I so that's why I think we still need face-to-face consultations well I don't know is how much of that we can deliver remotely to what extent can you develop meaningful relationships sometimes over a short period of time and using technology and teenagers might have the answer to this might there because they develop technologies very quick relationships rather very quickly and very easily or denied it did even some older people used to with their pen pals there are ways of them interacting with people that don't require a face-to-face contact but I think we need some evidence to guide us there as to how it possibilities and in the meantime I think it's GPS we need to hold on and in a very kind of precious and defensive way to the face-to-face consultation because it is what we are if you'll excuse my terrible use of the English language there okay I'm just gonna bring in one other question we've got here because you've had one from Sapna who's a GPS T three who say that the change is not increasing capacity but it allows more flexibility and time allocation for each patient so it can be quick for simple cases and longer for more complex patients so patients aren't hanging around in the waiting room unnecessarily if someone's running late and therefore not getting upset so that sounds as if it's beneficial for some of our patients but also beneficial for for the doctors because we know a lot of them find it very stressful if they're running late and that concept of stress for doctors is one I just like to to touch on here because some people are such think that actually if we all start working remotely and we're all hunched over a laptop and a webcam then how are we going to make sure that we sustain those relationships with our teams and within practices and I just want to step is I know you've done some work around micro teams if you've got anything you can can say on that area yeah I mean I think very similar principles apply to those practices that have very large teams who may not work on similar days and actually so don't necessarily see each other so how do you establish team and a sense of team around that and in the micro teams making sure that often a micro team may not always work on the same day to provide continuity across the weeks of how you use technology in order to find a way of communicating with each other and making sure that you'd be taking the time to share learning and actually not not meaning that remote working or working in large teams means that people can feel quite isolated and actually remembering their peoples home situations can also have an impact on stress levels and remote working whilst for some and maybe blissful Atris actually for others can be more stressful than being in the practice and so actually I think again it's just not a one-size-fits-all and then thinking about remembering how we create a sense of team is important how we do social activities together having lunch all those sorts of things you know the coffee the chats over coffee and actually how much we all value those so actually it's really important points and can technology support in that in that technology is not just about the remote consultation but actually can be used you know just as people are doing quizzes and although they P some people are getting quiz fatigue and zoom but as people are doing quizzes actually how you might use technology to create that sense of team and belonging which we all know is incredibly important part of of morale amongst our staff and teams okay Thank You Steph I mean one of the discussions we're hearing more and more is that we're talking about these and illogical tools for facilitating a consultation in a different way and the impact that that might have on on workload and workforce numbers but there's a group of thought that it's very much around we need to employ if you like non human digital triage at the front end if we want to make any actual capacity for doctors to spend time with their patients Lawrence have you have you got any user around that aspect of of using maybe more advanced technology not just as a tool to do things the way we we've been doing them in a different way but gradually to to signpost or triage patients out so the ones who really need our skill set have more time with us as their family doctor we're very lucky in Northern Ireland and that we've got a very active patient group and they've been very good about doing various campaigns and one of the campaign's they ran last year was the campaign called three before GP which you mean the college runners well about our vision group in Northern Ireland really helped to promote that a promoter fight you know patients accessing other things like pharmacy and online resources but the problem with that areum's did was to get trusted online resources and so our patients were we're guiding people towards that in terms of things like artificial intelligence and it's it's a tricky one because we all know that so much of our job is is based on the whole person and there's not just a straightforward disease that always how that disease impacts that person and impacts that person in that stage of their life so there's there's some things that can be done with with with artificial intelligence and so on but I think that the rule of the generalist has to take in a lot more different things okay Amati he wanted to come in at that point yeah so we use them a package quarry consult as as impart at least our front-end in our practice and it and it's quite a good kind of stepped triage approach so and a patient goes online if they want to and the first question they are there are stairs and have you got a kind of problem you know you put your cincin haven't got the kind of problem where self-care is fine in which case here's some resources that will help me to do that the second question is have you got the kind of problem that could be dealt with through other resources like a community pharmacy for example and then the third question is do you need to see someone in the general practice team in which case you've been triage to the right to the right person so I think that kind of system could work quite effectively I think we have to be really careful about downgrading triage to meet realizes is the moat one of the most sophisticated things that we do and if you watch the experienced GP triaging they bring a very different approach particularly in terms of managing risk to somebody who's relative really experienced or perhaps who hasn't got the same level of training so I think that's important and as far as AI is concerned of course it has potential I think a learning system that will help - and they take on board different symptoms different sides and and come up with diagnosis it's going to be helpful I still think we're a long long way away from that actually being useful and in practice and and anybody who reads dr. Murphy online will see lots of interesting examples of where some of the current chatbots triage type systems have made some pretty easy sometimes embarrassing and sometimes dangerous mistakes so I think we need to be very careful a little bit cautious about how AI can assist through us okay thank you Martine and I think he wanted to come in on that point - yeah just what I wanted to talk a little bit about the work that we're doing at the college around digital therapeutic so Martin talks about he consults using and signposting to other digital solutions and we know that I'm sure many of you use things like headspace or other such similar digital solutions and actually we're looking at putting together some resources to support members around understanding regulations evidence validation because actually we know that if as a GP if we are signposting someone to a digital solution that's implied trust that we know that we're where we are sending the person to that we feel that this is a good place to go to and rather than perhaps are a patient doing a Google search and just finding something themselves so we are doing some work at the college and to think to support and GPS around evidence and validation of that and I think that's a really good work which will be helpful going forwards okay thank you so I mean we've talked about a lot of the changes that are happening and I think over the last eight weeks and certainly in the first couple of weeks the the consultations were so centered on on Kovach symptoms and whether someone was running the risk of having caught cold lead that they became very transactional and very doctor centric how are we going to make sure that we maintain learning and from the experiences we've got over the last few weeks make sure that we go back to being more patient-centered because I think Lauren T you've talked about it and the technology might be very good for the medicine bit of it but we pride ourselves as GPS as seeing people's woes illnesses disease in the context of their lives and that their psychological response to that and how do we make sure that we get back to to that element of what we know is a specialty we do best so in the College in Northern Ireland we're opening up a bigger to be at about this yeah so we want to see is what what the GP will look like after this and a Monday night we're going to have an extended council meeting you know for we get everybody's use it's going to be an extended course or not in terms of time so people don't need to panic about that but it extended in terms of the people we're inviting into it's we're inviting our entire Council our entire executive for inviting all the Federation chairs we're inviting her head of appraisal because we want to know all these great people about their views about how we take what's been the best bits of this what's that haven't helped us so much do you like any things that any able us to get to the crux of not just what's the matter of people what matters to them and how we can best support them you know in in their lives and the Haiku but has affected them and their knows what we do anticipate is that there's going to be a big mental health need coming from this and we are seeing already patients with anxiety and patients with existing mental health conditions you know getting those exacerbated so by the social isolation and social distancing this may be quite good for preventing the spread of viruses it's not very good if you have a significant mental health illness and quite frequent things I've surveyed that in Northern Ireland one of the plans for us to remove our house service forward was to a multidisciplinary team model where we would have had mental health workers in place and social workers in place and we've me didn't direct opinions that we feel this but could be accelerated and and the benefit of having a mental health worker and a social worker embedded in our teams it could do a lot of work you know when we do come out of pandemic with that population of our patients that really need a lot of work and actually who need a lot of proactive work at the moment at the moment we're sort of cautiously waiting for people to get sick and people with mental health illness to get sick we feel if we have these teams embedded in our practices we can get used them to reach out proactively to see how people are doing rather than just waiting for a crisis to occur okay thank you Lawrence and what I'd like to move do now is move on to another question we had in and this comes from one of our trainee community and I'm going to ask you Martin it's from a trainee who's in their final year haven't sat the examination yet to get their CCT and they've heard that that's going to be replaced by video and audio consultations they're asking how how it's gonna work but I just wonder if you could give a general update because there's a cohort of colleagues who are very worried about how they're going to get to the end of their training in the necessary time frame and I know you and an office of colleagues have been working really really hard around the clock to get a solution on this yeah so thank you for that question and it has been really tough for for our trainees particularly st threes during this crisis because I guess most people on this webinar will know that we had to cancel the exams in early March because of social distancing because of the crisis and that left around about 1,500 trainees who would otherwise have taken their akt MCSA in order to get into independent practice pass our exam get a CT get a bit of practice by August September time so it's created I'm something of a significant challenge for the college but not only for the cat for the college because it's required clothes working with the GMC my clothes working with the Health Education bodies with governments as well and with others in order to find a solution the college foot forward the college is responsible for setting the exam and we put forward a number of solutions to a wider partnership group a couple of weeks ago and the preferred option by the whole group was to replace the CSA which is very difficult to do at these times of uncertainty when when we still have social system failure but we still have concerns about being able to travel so to replace the CSA with videos essentially and those videos the process is currently being designed at the moment and the expectation is that trainees will records a range of videos from their surgeries of course in the current environment they won't necessarily be they probably won't be face to face they might be online video or might be telephone conversations but they'll record those and submit them to examiner's who then will independently examine them and and make an assessment so the the idea is that the quality of this assessment should be similar to the CSA which is a tried and tested examination with good reliability and of course it will be delivered in a different way it will be it's it's a real challenge to deliver it has to be said but the exams team is working incredibly hard in order to get the process right and further details about the number of videos how they'll be assessed what types of videos will be forthcoming very soon we hope at the moment we're taking the proposal to the General Medical Council which is going to make the decision about whether it is acceptable as a form of assessment once we've got their approval and then we'll be on get going and inform trainees as quickly as possible what we're hoping is that that examination will be available from late June into July and so that people will be able to take it and get into the services quickest okay that's that's great thank you very much for that Martin I hope that's provided some reassurance for that cohort of colleagues out there that we know have been particularly worried about what will be happening with their assessments and their ability to get their CCT we're getting towards the end now but what I would like to do is just ask you Martin again sorry just to talk a little bit about one of the other initiatives that the college is run which is being absolutely it's been normally successful and and we were worried about those people that weren't going to be able to access work experience prior to application for medical school and it's another of the offs the colleagues here who set up observe GP I just wanted if you could briefly mention that please yeah so so Mike Holmes has done a phenomenal piece of work with our membership team on observe GP gives an opportunity for people over the age of 16 who might be thinking about studying medicine to experience general practice to get a feel for what it's like and then hopefully to get into Medical School to choose general practice as a career and we've had amazing take-up of it and phenomenal level of interest maybe it's because there's lots of 16 year old sitting at home now what do what do themselves I'm not sure but actually phenomenal and an incredible sense of excitement about how general practice is when I start decided to study medicine I was probably 14 or 15 my view of medicine was general practice that's just what I thought medicine was but I know a lot of people think that medicine is what you do in hospitals it's becoming a surgeon becoming a physician whatever these people who are being exposed to general practice and seeing what a fantastic job it is the variety the challenge and have become very excited by it and and we've had so much positive feedback from these people who now want to not only study medicine but getting to general practice as well which is just brilliant excellent thank you and we've had another question who's coming around what's the role of local faculty boards in this crisis and from which and what innovations have the faculties come up with now I know that you and Mike again have been having discussions with the faculty chairs and we've got meetings in weeks coming up and hopefully there'll be an area we'll be able to discuss so the roles of the local face of the college out in our faculty Network and the contribution they can be making we've already seen some changes with with we had a council meeting or pre council meeting last night by zoom with almost 70 of us on there and I know a lot of faculty boards are meeting by soon but there's opportunities around sort of Education and CPD being delivered in the same way wonder if any of you have been any comments on on that at all perhaps and go to Lawrence on that one okay well we require in Northern Ireland we're quite unusual and that we're a devolved nation plus were a faculty as well so we actually at least we sit on both camps so we do and like I say we're still reaching out to our members we haven't been able to unfortunately to do the educational events with a lot of educational events like a lot of people have had which were due to be face to face to have had to put the pause button on those but we're still there very much for our members and we still feel you know phone calls and so on that the normal office would and reaching out to people through social media and so on and we're still very much behind the scenes involved with government and trying to shift the agenda trying to promote the value of general practice and just to bring back Martin back to his points there you mean about observe GP and also through our ask you three colleagues it's very important that we raise the profile of general practice and show what a great career and professional is and later on the area you mean I'm very much looking forward to welcoming rst three students whenever they they do pass their exams to come and join our workforce excellent Thank You Lawrence and we're into the last few minutes step I was wondering if I could ask you what one thing haven't you missed about the way you've been working in the last eight weeks and and which do you really want to keep tight hold of an amplifier as we move forwards the one thing I haven't missed I haven't missed running an hour late and I think that's the one thing I haven't missed and the one thing I want to hold onto is the sense of camaraderie and a sense of coming together and that's the and actually how we've embraced technology to do that so actually how we've utilized remote tech solutions to involve our wider practice team particularly those who are shielding we've lost a number of pregnant members of staff and other people who haven't been able to come into the practice but actually we've managed to get them they've been keen to continue to work and keen to stay involved so I think they're the things that that's definitely thing I want to keep okay thank you and Martin perhaps I could ask you what what's the most exciting thing you think changed over the last few weeks either in terms of opportunity or stuff we're already doing that that you can see us carrying forward in the future oh I thought you were going to ask me the same questions you're out there give you the same answer excellent because one thing I haven't missed and the most exciting thing I think is the space that's been created for general practitioners to to do the job that they want to do to provide the quality of care that they want to do that's partly a reduction in number of conversations but a lot of it is a reduction in administered tasks and an unnecessary bureaucracy and again the research surveillance said to suggest a 28% reduction in bureaucracy and none of that is about a removal of contractual obligations some of its about reduction in regulation about Professional Regulation and organizational regulation that's incredibly exciting and general practices borne or had done even better stuff as a consequence of not being bound down by unnecessary things that don't add to to patient care so I really love to see that continue and I think general practices almost rediscovered itself there's a consequence of that happening right okay Lawrence thirty seconds from you on what you want to keep out of our Peter the same question this time reducing the bureaucracy and that ministration function husband has been great to do in Northern Ireland we've set up cooling centers and actually in GPS in Northern Ireland really showed themselves to be true innovators like we are and this we managed to set up corporate centers in a matter of weeks and have them open and rolling and this has been terrific ly positive for general practice and has been seen by government in a very high light so it is that it shows that we can talk quickly if we're given the resources so that's a very exciting develop a thank you and I'm being told I'm getting the two-minute warning which means I've got to start to wrap things up so just a couple of quick plugs first of all I want to say thank you to everybody on the panel tonight for your time and more importantly thank you for everybody out there who's been watching and sent in your questions we we've really relished this opportunity to hear from you and get your reflections on the work that the college has been been doing please don't forget we've got our Co big resource hub which is available on our website I think one of the things that's changed over the last few weeks thirty euston square our headquarters in London has been shot so the threshold to college really has become a digital threshold through the website and we've been absolutely fantastic team we've been working around the clock for the college to make sure those resources have been up there and we've had loads of feedback from the membership to say how grateful he that's being received so thank you for the team for that if you keep on an eye out on social media for our RC GP together campaign that's celebrating the outstanding contributions that everybody's made to get us and our patients through this crisis and we're asking people to send in a photograph of them at Woking in whatever way their new work is appearing but just want to wrap up and say how proud we are of the membership and general practice our teams or staff at the college for the way they've handled these things thank you ever so much enjoy the rest of your evening and we hope to see you next week on the next one of these these events thank you ever so much take care
