 welcome back to inside marketing design a show where we take an in-depth look at how marketing design works at various tech companies today on the show i'm speaking to emily kelly who is the creative designer at surrey satellite technology so this is a space company people it was really fascinating to talk to emily about how marketing design works within a space company but it was also really interesting for me to just hear about how the space company itself functions and uh yeah what it does what they aim for how they work emily has been at the company for three years and she said she sort of stumbled into the space industry she was working at an agency but then saw this job listing and just thought she had to go for it because she already had an interest in space but that's definitely been very solidified in the past three years at the company sorry satellite technology itself is a company that designs manufactures and tests satellites so it also works with other companies to get them launched too they've been around since 1985 and emily said in the past few decades they've launched 69 different satellites in 22 different countries so we're talking very large scale in terms of this company's outputs i chatted with emily about how marketing and marketing design in particular is used to help win contracts for these satellites that they're building testing launching but some of the things i learned in my chat with emily was that although the scale of what our companies do is very very different a lot of our day-to-day work is more similar than i expected so without further ado let's get into my chat with emily kelly and a look inside marketing design at surrey satellite technology so emily welcome to inside marketing design i'm so excited to have you on the show thank you for having me yeah this is very cool i got very excited when you applied and saw you know there's a space company and i was like whoa how does marketing design work at a space company and then my second thought was great now i get to find out i've got emily on the show so that's awesome let's start by hearing a little about how the marketing design team at sorry satellite technology um how many other marketing designers are there and uh do you sit like within the marketing team or a design team tell me a little bit about the team structure okay so i'm a solo um designer in-house so it's all up to me i do sit within a marketing team so we have a pr manager who i report to and an events manager um so it's just us three within the marketing team and then we recently have got a head of marketing so we all sit underneath him and he then reports into the directors of the company so that's our kind of sort of weigh-in in terms of kind of getting things signed off and bits and pieces like that um so nobody i lovely reports to me directly i just report into the pr manager so it's just the three of us it is quite a small team considering how many people we have so what sort of like what are you marketing um i know that sorry satellite technology your your main thing that you offer to customers is manufacturing satellites like helping with launches too so is that uh is that why you're marketing what you're putting out there and what sort of materials you're usually making so um yeah we're usually kind of marketing in terms of doing satellite missions for um countries we do like a know-how sort of like training mission training for people in country so we're always keen to do like customer training and get kind of countries building satellites in terms of kind of what we use to market um stuff there's there's really like all sorts i do a lot of print and digital design a bit of everything this is really interesting for me because you're like a hardware tech company compared to what i do and what a lot of people do which is software technology and so the main things that i design as a marketing designer are well the website is the main thing the website is kind of like the path that leads to sales um i'm imagining for hardware at the scale that you have you're not expecting people to come onto a website and click buy now and like yes so yeah what's what sort of things do you focus on designing um and what's i guess the mix between digital and print that you have i mean it would be great if people came onto our website and just bought immediately but obviously our satellite missions are you know tend to be millions of pounds um so um yeah we do have um a real mix of kind of print and digital and at the moment i'm doing a lot of digital stuff i work on the company's kind of website um which we sort of redesigned when i started we also rebranded when i joined the company as well so that those were kind of two big things that i had to focus on as soon as i started i mean in terms of kind of our website and stuff like that we kind of we have to show a kind of range of platforms and different orbits that we can put satellites into we're obviously trying to attract quite a big audience in terms of kind of international customers and partners so it's it's something we have to kind of keep on top of and we have to keep in touch with our engineering teams to make sure that we are putting out the right information and the right figures all the time um obviously things get updated quite a lot so we have to make sure that we're kind of quoting the right sort of numbers all the time i prefer digital design in that respect to print design because things change so much within our industry yeah so otherwise kind of digital design i've been doing a lot of like social media stuff and i do a lot of video editing as well is that mostly for social media videos yeah mainly and for our youtube channel um but also for like international conferences as well we tend to do um sort of large-scale exhibitions and stand designs and they usually have a sort of video running on them as well in the background and then that kind of leads into print design so the large scale exhibition sort of stuff and merchandise um also sort of design posters and stuff i do what i find quite interesting is i do a lot of internal and external designs um that is interesting yeah so i'm not only sort of you know decorating our buildings but i'm also kind of decorating you know externally and marketing stuff so it's it's quite interesting because our company's mostly made out of engineers and they think very differently to a designer and i really want to get across how you know amazing their work is and stuff like that it can be quite hard to translate you know some something that's very technical into something that's really visual right yeah i can't imagine that would be quite a challenge that's cool though that's a fun challenge to have and it sounds like you've got a really good mix of lots of different materials that you're designing where would you say the marketing team mostly focuses their efforts like for me for example it is our website and then um also uh social media i suppose in content in general is what the bulk of my work is around it sounds like you've mentioned events here is that quite a big focus for you yeah we have quite a few there's some key events for us during the year um there's a couple of small satellite conferences that we really focus on and there's also something called the iac which is the international astronomical i think um congress so that's just a large kind of gathering of kind of space industry and that's always a big one and moves around the world every year so um we like to get out sort of like key messages we try and work out what we're really trying to say and what we're really trying to sell usually there'll be like a specific platform or a specific mission that we really want to take ahead and that will be something that we try and kind of market specifically at events and things we like to sort of submit papers and posters and things like that that's like a real space industry thing having like white papers and technical papers um so it's alway it tends to be up to me to make them look good um so there's always quite a lot to focus on i find that my workload it does really like change throughout the year depending on whether we have events coming up i think in terms of social media since having me on board it's been more of a focus because we can put out more stuff we can i can quickly design things whereas before my manager was having to outsource all the design work to an agency so now she can literally come up to me and say oh i need this and i can just like quickly put it together so i think without bloamer and trumpet they benefit from having me in-house of course they do they definitely do yeah because i can you know quickly whip something up whereas you know an outside agency was struggling to understand what they wanted right it's such a technical and like in-depth subject matter to understand that having someone in-house is probably really powerful here because you can get to know the space industry and get to know uh the engineering speak i guess a little more than an external agency coming in could there's so many sort of acronyms and things like that when it comes to engineering and sort of technical things so my um my knowledge is is you know furthering every day tell me teach me an acronym what is a cool space acronym that like what's your favorite one that's a really good question i mean even just there's lots we have like a whole kind of list on our portal of acronyms that we use but um even things like we have an ait hall and that's an assembly integration and testing hall so that's where our satellites are built and so you have to completely gown up to go in and i always find that really fun because i get to go and take photos of satellites and build and it feels very kind of special to see something in person that's literally going to be you know taking pictures in space so that's always interesting i do have to remind people that i don't have an engineering background it's just a design background i think a lot of engineers think i have some sort of background knowledge but i don't but i'm learning you're just learning there on the job yeah exactly let's go into talking about um you mentioned before that your was it your your manager the head of pr would come to you and like be requesting something is that the normal way that a project will start for you that your manager will request it from you and i'm assuming like maybe someone else in the company has requested it of them is that sort of how the flow works yeah so i sort of have two avenues and my manager will come to me and either someone's spoken to her head of engineering or something like that or a director has come to her specifically and wants something specific done or i'll have an engineering team come towards me or just a single engineer who says you know i'm working on this can you help me out but a lot of the time it is through my manager and we tend to sort of sit down together and try and work things out rather than just me going solo and that's the one thing i find hard because i am the only designer that i don't have anyone else kind of to bounce ideas off but yeah i think having my manager and the events manager they're from different walks of life it's good to bounce ideas off them as well but yeah a lot of the time it's just an email that comes directly to me and if i need to i'll go to my manager and say i'm not sure where to start with this or i'll just kind of do it myself i'm quite used to working independently so um that's something i can kind of usually get on with i think that's something that we learn as a because i'm also a solo marketing designer there are other designers in the company but they work on very different things to me um so yeah i'm i'm also just used to like hearing of a need and figuring it out myself it's just what we do i'm guessing you or like me don't get like a fully fleshed out brief for exactly what you need yeah that's pretty rare isn't it yeah it tends to kind of evolve and you say is this what you're looking for and then kind of like not quite and you go back to the drawing board so yeah i think in terms of problem solving i've definitely i'm definitely getting better at that because people don't always know what they want do they so right yeah it's working out what what's best for them and when you work in-house as well you get to know what people mean when they say certain things too and then you can get it right the first time more often than not i think once you've been there as you have for three years which is cool who signs off your work is it your manager so you'd they'd ask you to do something you design it you bring it back to them for like a final sign-off i suppose yeah it tends to be my manager um or it will just be kind of our head of marketing now that we have one if not it will be um the director who sits above our head of marketing but for things like a rebrand or when we redesigned the website so i kind of designed the front end of it to get sign off for that that went to our executive team and then it went to the sort of founder and the kind of managing director so there's definitely different levels of sign off depending on how big the project is but yeah usually it will just be kind of within my team and the director above me and is that who gives you feedback as well on on work and um is that who you go to to to get yeah get advice get feedback yeah i think um because we're all in usually in an open plan office i will kind of go to the sort of director and say this is what you're looking for um and if not we will just kind of sit around a table and discuss it so everyone the one thing i do like about my company is that no matter what level you're at it's very much an open door policy and we have good open plan offices so i could go and talk to anyone at any level and not feel you know um that i was much lower than them or anything like that there's no kind of hierarchy in terms of who you can talk to so that's quite good in terms of figuring out what people really want i feel i can talk to anyone yeah i think that's the best way to get things done i think that tell me if you agree that feedback on designs can get sort of like warped if it comes through too many people and it's just so good to hear it from the source especially yeah so let's talk about the website project in particular uh you got the brief that you needed to redesign it who decided on the content for it like who decided this is what's going to go on our homepage and who like wrote the copy for the website how did that all work yeah so um initially we had a sort of sit-down discussion with an outside agency that are local to us just in terms of them hosting it and the back end and things like that so at the moment um it's a cms that we can both me and the pr manager can go into an edit the pr manager wrote all the copy for it um we had a look at our old website which was i think it was it was pretty old in terms of like sort of 10 to 20 years old and so it wasn't quite responsive it wasn't responsive at all and it was more of a kind of i don't know it was almost like a site where all our missions lived on and it was almost like a kind of history um rather than innovative kind of feel which is what we've definitely got now it's much more modern and you can see what we're we're doing now rather than it was almost like an archive i think right archive rather than a marketing piece of marketing material to like show things in its best light yeah which i think until i came in we didn't really you know they didn't realize it had become like that until you get someone else's view um so obviously heritage is a really big thing to us because we've been going for over 30 years so we definitely still wanted that so we've managed to kind of have a section for kind of past missions and i think that's that's one big thing about our company is that we would like to focus on our heritage because a lot of the companies in the space industry are startups they haven't been going that long they don't have that experience so that's something we really tried to focus on in terms of the website in terms of the design we've got more of a uniform look across digital and print now than there was before because outsourcing it was all kind of different styles and things like that um but yeah we kind of add and take away from the website all the time i think initially we tried to kind of pair it back a bit because there was so much content we really worked on a kind of mega menu style of things because it was just so difficult to navigate so who was making those decisions about what content to pair back and how to arrange it all was that you doing doing that work i think it it was sort of us as a team in terms of working out how to navigate to things and how far and like away in terms of reach they were so um more kind of our innovative stuff and our more recent missions are more at the forefront of our website whereas before it was uh you could see kind of everything and there was just menus upon menus and drop-downs and so much so we definitely simplified it and uh did those decisions get made like were you all in a room together having a meeting do they get made by email how does that work these conversations that you're having i guess a bit of both i mean us as a small team we'd every so often kind of pitch what we've done so far to the exact team um and our kind of director and just say look this is the way we're going do you like the feel the look and feel of this before we go any further before we spend money with the agency so um between us as a team we kind of exchange emails and have weekly check-ins as to what you know are we going in the right direction with this and then we'd kind of go further and you know kind of pitch it and hope that they liked it so that we didn't have to go back to the drawing board um yeah but yeah it's kind of there's there's lots of back and forth um but mainly it's just between me and my team what does a normal day look like for you you go into an office i'm guessing when it's not pandemic times yes yeah take us through like a rough outline of the day in terms of meetings that you have when you get your work done all that sort of thing i usually work a nine to five day and i go in and initially just kind of scroll through my emails to check and see what what's kind of going on and then i have like a kind of running to-do list of bits and pieces we usually have a weekly catch-up with just kind of my team but um because we kind of all sit near each other we tend to kind of go to each other's desks anyway so my manager regularly pops to my desk to ask for like social media posts and stuff like that and says you know i'll send you the copy via email so i'm used to kind of getting a lot of my work via email i don't tend to have a huge amount of meetings and when i do they're usually kind of an hour nothing more than an hour sometimes because i'm part of the business development and sales team so um our marketing team sits within that so sometimes i'll go to sort of business development meetings so that we know what we're going to sort of push later in the year or what sort of missions and stuff we're really trying to um sell so that's always good for us to know in terms of like event graphics and stuff yeah how big is that team the business development and sales team that's a really good question i mean it's made up of a lot of bids and sales sort of managers and um i have quite a few colleagues so i'd say maybe like probably maybe 15 of us maybe okay so it's still like not huge in terms of team size no no but yeah other than that in terms of work it's really it's quite random at times um so i can be video editing doing kind of branding digital print design internal design so posters interior design so i helped redesign our cafe um so people come to me for everything i mean photography of missions and stuff like that i get to do um mission patches so when we're launching a mission i get oh my gosh fashion touches it's great fun all the way to designing stickers for um rocket nose cones so yeah it can be it can be a poster for you know a corridor or a sticker for a rocket yeah so it really varies which i kind of love because i don't now that i've kind of got into this job i don't think i could just be a graphic designer even though that right i have a graphic design degree i think i love being a kind of creative marketing designer because i can do a bit of everything yeah that makes sense and it never gets boring all of these projects it sounds like there's a lot i mean obviously the rebranding the company and they're doing the website those are big projects that take a long time but um what's the timeline look like for something like a mission patch or a sticker for a rocket nose cone what's the timeline between when someone asks for it and when you're expected to have it done and finished by usually in terms of a mission patch sometimes it can be quite a last-minute thing um just because you know the project's been really busy or it can be something that they think of um right at the start of the project kick-off because they want to have that kind of look and feel they want to have a logo for documents sometimes they want to do merchandise and things like that a lot of my mission patches are made into merch so things like stickers like lunch boxes things like that um that are like given away at events or given to our kind of employees so i do usually have to think about it like a couple of months in advance just so that we get that stock in but how long do you get to design it even if it is a couple of months in advance like how long are you able to spend on it usually it's not that kind of restrictive so i can cool i can kind of spend like a week or two on it if i need to i kind of bounce ideas to and from via uma to my manager before i would go back to the project team and say i've got this one and i know not to give them too many options to kind of give them two or three options um just to kind of narrow it down a bit because like i say like engineers think very differently and i think it's better to give them a kind of like smaller range of things how do you know when you've done a good job at your work like um how's your work measured or i don't know yeah how do you know when you did well on a project that's a really good question because a lot of the time i don't always know and it kind of it's kind of accepted and moved on and people are like yep great thanks um right but a lot of the time i manage i will kind of sit me down and say thank you for doing this you know i think if i'm doing something for engineering they're very busy they're building satellites they're building things that launch into space so i don't always get that sort of feedback but usually it's quite sort of positive if i'm doing merchandise for the company people will come and they'll email me and they'll say like thank you for things like that so it just depends what it is but people are always like really positive towards anything i do so posters in the corridors and things like that people come to me and say they like them so that's always good yeah that's always really nice what about in terms of is is there any how do you set goals uh within the team is do you sort of just take on the work as it comes and that's the goal is just to get the work done or like in my company we have every quarter different goals of like things we need to achieve that are set at the start of the quarter and then you know at the end we measure how they went do you do anything similar to that we do have um like performance reviews every year like um like once or twice a year i think okay um so i'll sit down with my manager and we'll discuss sort of bigger goals so in terms of like software i want to learn training i want to go on that sort of thing so that's more personal to me which is quite good so some of my performance reviews have been you know this year we're focusing on the website and that becomes my main goal the past year we haven't had one big thing to focus on so um that's when i kind of look into training and things like that so if i do have any quieter periods i can kind of film my time it's a real mix of stuff that just comes in and then becomes a big project so sometimes a video will become a big project because it's something we're trying to market internationally um or yeah it's usually things that just come in that we pick up is the marketing team held to any like particular number of um like new satellites launched or something new customers coming in um is there anything like that that the or the business development team needs to meet that you're aware of i think it's difficult to have to have targets in terms of kind of selling satellites and things like that because it can take kind of from kickoff to launch it can take between sort of two and five years to get something up there in space yeah so it is difficult i mean as a business obviously we have you know financial targets and things like that but i think within our teams and things we're just we're always trying to do the best that we can we don't have kind of set figures just because it is it's a really weird industry in terms of kind of going from a contract signature to launching something can take you know a really long time um yeah it's very different from my industry whereas you know we offer free accounts for our software and so there's like we're expecting to be getting thousands per day sort of thing yeah it is it's it's weird in that respect because i think the first year i started we had a few launches whereas this year we haven't launched anything yet so right it in terms of workload it really does does change um yeah so that's something i've had to get used to yeah interesting you've talked a little bit about what some of the main challenges are for you and your role in marketing designer sorry satellite technologies you know being the only designer there um that can be tough what are some of the other main obstacles that you face in in your role i think i do struggle a bit with sort of imposter syndrome because there isn't any kind of you know anyone else i can compare myself to if that makes sense yes that doesn't make sense yeah so obviously i have to stay inspired myself i have to kind of look online and things like that so there's is that why then getting feedback internally like when someone sees a poster and tells you that they liked it but it must mean a lot it does yeah just because that's all you can measure it by right because exactly you don't have someone else to compare to yeah so it's i've learned that i can bounce ideas off other people and actually you know engineers are really creative and they have you know their minds work differently but they can still like visualize things um but i think the challenge is that you know if i don't know something i can't there's no one to go to um so i have i'm very good at looking at things online i think a lot of designers are aren't they you know if you have a query in software or something you don't know how to do something you just look it up um so there is that it would be nice to be able to go to someone but you know it's it's something i've kind of learned in terms of problem solving that i can usually you know sort things out myself yeah google is your co-worker literally yeah i i know that feeling all too well yeah i'd love to know what the because you have this agency background and now you're working in-house so that in itself is different but um what are some of any differences you've noticed between the kind of projects you worked on the agency and the the work itself for a space company i think i mean i was i was a junior designer at that stage so i didn't have as much responsibility as i do now but i think within an agency i didn't have as much of a say and i was very much moving logos around designs and things like that i wasn't really creating i was just kind of making for the sake of making a graphic sort of thing um so i do think i am more listened to and i am more kind of heard i think it was really good for me to work in an agency and just see how that worked and see i think there was definitely more of a hierarchy and it would have been difficult to talk to different people whereas now i think people appreciate that i have design skills and they don't so they'll come to me and ask me something so right i think it's definitely been like a learning curve in that sense i don't think i would go back to working in an agency now that i've worked in-house um i quite like being the kind of go-to sort of person sounds like you've got quite a lot of autonomy in terms of you know people trusting you as the designer you are the design expert in the company you know can you come up with your own ideas for projects too like i don't know say there's a new a new poster idea you've got or you've got an idea for a social media post do you have the autonomy to just go ahead and make that yeah i think i do i think that's something i've kind of grown to you know when you initially start you're like oh can i make suggestions but um yeah i do i think when we reached like 10k followers on twitter i was like can we do a little like social media post about that can i do a graphic for that and she was like yeah sure go for it do it cool so it's very much if i see something and i think oh we could hop on that she's very much like yeah go for it send it to me i'll i'll put it on social media so that's quite nice i feel like i can say oh i've got an idea and people will listen so that's good that's cool i feel like i'm like a little surprised to hear how similar in a way our roles are being from completely different industries um in terms of like out the way we do our work and the workload and all that sort of thing i just kind of feel like i expected the space industry to be much more strict with controlling your designs and like i don't know many levels of approval to get something out there because it feels like the stakes are just so much higher than what i do but it sounds like your company like just trusts you and your marketing team to to get the work done so yeah that's really cool i think if i was working in a bigger space company that would be much different but i think we're just you know 350 people were at that nice size that we're not in the thousands so i think yeah we are very trusted which i do appreciate yeah that's really cool there's a lot of people out there who love talking about design tools and so i've got to make sure that i include this in the episode um what what is the main software that you use for designing in um i use um adobe cc so yes they're creative suite all of the things yeah all day every day literally live in that so um yeah i'm the only one in my company who uses that that software so it can be a little bit difficult sometimes to say oh i want to design it in this um because everyone's used to microsoft office oh fun yes i mean yeah that can be a little bit difficult let's end by talking about what you love most about your job specifically about you know working at this company that you're at what are some of your your favorite parts of what you do i think my favorite part is is being able to work on something different every day and having that variety every day so i'm not just kind of sat in one program i'm doing lots of bits and pieces all the time and constantly kind of picking up requests from people to do you know videos and graphics and things like that so i don't feel like i'm just kind of stuck in one right you can never get bored yeah exactly um and i think also one thing i love is being able to talk to engineers and just having that input because it's it's something i'm always i can always learn about so i really love kind of having that sort of interaction with people and hearing about what other people are doing every day and that sort of inspires my work at the end of the end of the day i'm really just here to make them look good and their work look good i think right and some of the stuff they do is insane so i do enjoy kind of marketing something totally different totally you know something that people aren't used to so i like getting creative with that yeah that's awesome how does it feel when you see something you've designed on like a literal thing that's going to be sent to space weird in a nutshell and just seeing images from the engineers who have taken them at the launch site and being like oh emily your sticker and i'm just being like whoa that is you know in sort of india being launched right now and it's in like low earth orbit or something and i'm just like oh my designs in the atmosphere that is so cool i know i've got somehow put out on my cv i think yeah i think that might be needed to be the headline on your website yeah maybe i should do that maybe you should um well thank you emily for sharing all this information it's yeah been really interesting to me and like i said to hear that the differences aren't actually as extreme as i expected between software and hardware and you know software tech and space tech where can people go to find out more about you is there anything any social media or website you want to pitch so my website is emily and space.design and that has my social media links and you can also see um some of my work so some of the stuff on the rockets i mentioned and things like that just so that yeah if you're interested in having a look and i'm sure everyone will be i'm also going to leave a link to the article that you wrote on medium about your job because i think that was really interesting read and people should go and check that out too so yeah thanks for being here emily thanks for giving us a look inside marketing design at sorry satellite technologies thank you thanks for having me thank you for listening to this week's episode i still can't quite get over the fact that somewhere floating above us is a design that emily made on a satellite that is that's very cool if you enjoyed this episode i would really appreciate you taking the time to go over to apple podcasts and leaving a rating and a review it helps us get the show out there in front of more people
