 [Kelvin Erikson] I jokingly call the lab, "We get to play with the toys." You can try and run it again if you want to. Because you actually make it do something. It's not pencil and paper. You get to watch and see what's really happening out there, versus just all on a computer screen Let me get started here. We can do a lab online. The equipment can be run remotely and you can view the results or the equipment working remotely as well to. We will have to help it along here. I've been teaching this class for a number of years, and knew that we could teach the laboratory portion of it "distance," because all the equipment is accessible over the Internet. [Timothy Cochran] I have started recording, so keep it PG. [Other students] Always! We always are. What we're doing was basically going in with a program that we had already written, and just trying to test out and see if that program worked properly. [Kelvin Erickson] So we outfit three stations here that allowed us to teach the three groups of students at the same time. We were not able to actually see that we are programing kind of move and operate. So instead, we had cameras that were in the lab already and we were just able to use those two kind of pan around and see that our machine was doing what we wanted it to do. [Kelvin Erickson] One of my TA's is actually in St. Louis, so he remotes in. He has one computer but a couple of virtual machines on it, so he can join two Zoom meetings. [Remote TA] Tease it a little more. A little more. Little more. Little more. [Timothy Cochran] There is a little bit of a delay, I don't want to overshoot it. You know, if something were to go wrong, then the TA or Dr. Erickson was able to just go in and, you know, fix the machine, and set it back to a default condition. They have the programing software. They download it to the controller. They can monitor the operation from the PC on the controller. But they also typically work with a small panel. So then you click on the button with your mouse and be just like you were at the station in Rolla. [Timothy Cochran] So, how have all your days been? [Other student] Good! [Timothy Cochran] I have been up since lecture, actually. [Other student] Oh, wow! They seem to be way more serious about it. [Timothy Cochran] And then I upload or download? [Other students] Download. Do not upload! Upload is "Danger Will Robinson!" They are going beyond what I typically laid out for them to do. Well, they are putting more effort into it. They are actually doing two weeks worth of work in the first week is what I noticed. [Kelvin Erickson] Very good guys! You are ahead of the game! The biggest change in the lab, it's just having to get the technology going. After that, the interaction is still pretty much the same. You can pretty much help them with the technologies now as if they were sitting there. We can basically look over shoulder, just like it was in the lab. In fact, it is a little more convenient with the large monitor you can see it better [laughter] than looking over their shoulder. I think Dr. Erickson was very prepared for the transition to all online. And honestly, for me personally, the transition was very smooth. [Timothy Cochran] If any college were to adapt the quickest, it would be S&T, just because of the nature of the students. I think the students are getting little more used to, you know, just viewing it just, "Okay, we're just next to each other, but just not necessarily, personally, but we are definitely virtually in the meeting. They prefer to be in lab, but we try to make it as easy as possible to do it remotely. [Kelvin Erickson] Will, you doing okay over there? [Will Zenk] We are all done here.
