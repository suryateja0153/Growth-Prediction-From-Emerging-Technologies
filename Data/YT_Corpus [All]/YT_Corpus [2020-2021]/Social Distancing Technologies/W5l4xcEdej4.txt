 it demonstrates the impact that engineering has on an ever-changing world this is really acting the minds of young potential engineers it's a showcase of what Illinois has to offer and this one-year blip is not going to end it it's not going to change it this is what they're dedicating their lives to to inspire people from the community that maybe don't feel like they can do it too historically speaking there have there were a few years where it was just the electric show so we don't know how long it's been called engineering open house but the event itself I've been involved in EOHfor 22 years now but you always find some really fun exhibits that the students have come up with and it varies from year to year there's so many amazing exhibits that happen during EOH like the concrete crusher Tesla coil it's been around for a while last year there was a talking dog there's all of these things that students have been working so hard to produce there have been lots of exhibits that I just think are really neat I feel each year has gotten better just giving people opportunities to see those things before they are mainstream the cave back in the late 90s early 2000s was you know virtual reality was budding it was that they were showcasing the initial technology of being able to walk in with a headset and look around in 3d the same thing with the internet yeah in 1997 I was a student here and I was actually involved in engineering open house basically what we did is we studied localization let's take this this marker if you have a building that's shaking in an earthquake you don't want it to shake this is gonna fall down but if you take a secondary mass and put it next to the building and catch it to the building with a complete coupling and that earthquake is designed properly the building's not gonna shake but that secondary mass will shape and the building will stay put and so we did that with some steel beams as the engineering open house project not much sleep going on towards the end but I had a lot of fun and have a good experience of my college it was the annual U of I engineering open house the largest event of its kind in the country John three students who takes us to one of the most popular competitions the creative design contest it had all the elements of an Indy 500 the cars the crew tensity and the speed the first kind of memory of EOH that I have is actually coming in high school with my like science club I came and I was like okay engineering is like cool whatever I don't think I'm gonna ever really do that and it was something that really opened my eyes to kind of the world of possibilities I actually started going to each when I was about five years old my experience has always been kind of just being introduced to engineering through EOH that was really my big kind of introduction into what I wanted to do so it's really cool to be able to kind of give back and be on the other side of God yeah so actually twice when I was in high school my brother was a student here he's a couple years older than me so EOH was a good time to come visit and see my brother so I went to EOH for the first time my sophomore year of high school and then also again my senior year and my sister was an exhibitor yeah over the last few years have you had any favorite memories or standout years oh well so many people are dedicated to the fact that EOH still exist every year they come back just for EOH just tease the fact that they experienced that in college and they might not have kids and they want to show from what engineering is to their children I just love seeing the crowd seeing those like the faces of young children come through an amazement at at what engineering has to offer kind of inspiring the next generation to come and be like oh I'm interested in doing that when I get to college I want to show all the things that I can do I think sometimes there are some schools that don't always get the chance to have the resources to be able to do a lot of really cool experiments or have classes or demonstrations I think don't make EOH a successful is something that you don't even realize really when you're visiting is you don't realize that all the exhibitors or students in the whole committee that plans it is all students and like it's very stressful it's very busy but it happens every year because people are passionate about it I think that's why it's been going on as long as they really are able to achieve a lot when they're here and they achieve a lot and they grant and so I think that's one of the keys I always say that it's a very friendly atmosphere here at the University of Illinois for students it's one of the things we pride ourselves in and it really comes out in EOH from the administrative standpoint we just come into play if there's something that that goes wrong all right all right it's 1046
