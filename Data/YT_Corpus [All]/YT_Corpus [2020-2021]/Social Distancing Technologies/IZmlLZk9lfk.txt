you hissing she made a mask adage new followers aquino canal kill check out the system anchors a total sage who would assume a mash Camuto laid out a strategy to a moon to moon Tokra God Dhamma today I'm gonna speak with Tudor Martin and we're gonna speak about the use of technology during social distancing hello Martin hello so could you introduce yourself to us please absolutely so my name is Martin I am a PhD student studying philosophy and philosophy of artificial intelligence at the University College Cork in Ireland I'm sort of a lifelong student I've been in school for a long time studying things like biology and philosophy so I'd like to think I'm I'm pretty good at being a student and studying and learning on my own so it's really happy to sort of be here and sharing my thoughts on technology during social distancing I think it's it's quite an interesting time ever living in so I hope you know we can have a great discussion we can generate a good discussion going talk about all the things that are happening right now and how has it been so far the the social distancing in Ireland yeah there was actually report in the news the the RTE which is like the they are sort of national news and they suggested that for the most part the majority of people in Ireland do seem to be observing social distancing measures so that's that's really fantastic I know Ireland is quite a small country so that might play a part in it I think as of right now I think big total cases of the virus are around 9,000 and so they're growing a little bit but I think for the most part most people are observing social distancing you know they're worrying a little bit about this weekend because it is the Easter weekend and people I think do want to see their their families and their loved ones and their friends but the government is encouraging people to stay at home and practice social distance very much so do you think speaking of that that the technology how people during this different Easter weekend yeah absolutely so I actually my roommate pointed this out to me they have an article so they this RTE the Irish national news had an article pointing out that for example the musical Jesus Christ Superstar was sort of streaming free on YouTube and you know celebrities have been posting things on YouTube and there's been a lot of sort of you know online private concerts or things like this so I think it's really interesting to see how people are trying to use technology to to get people to stay inside or to get online right so to get online and sort of stay inside and watch these sort of concerts or watch these movies and it's it's really cool how you know these companies that sort of own these things or how the copyright hold the copyright to these things are are putting it out there at least for the time being so that people can enjoy these sorts of things without feeling the need to you know illegally download them or stream them or or what have you yeah I have a question here from one of our viewers Wallasey is asking if you study in an island no I think I've misspoken that right I had typed here the two words I think he he misunderstood so Ireland is the country Ireland Ireland is the country yeah the Republic of Ireland yes another thing all right well Ireland is an island yeah but yeah there are two different words that in your case can you can talk about the same thing so island is the country and islands like the piece of land surrounded by water right exactly exactly and it's actually really interesting in the case of Ireland the country and the island it's on because Ireland the country shares its island with another country Northern Ireland which is technically part of the UK the United Kingdom so so I it gets quite complicated actually when he really started to think about it and Cristiano is asking me to ask you to talk about the attitude of the people in face to social isolation in your country how does that go and how are people reacting and how are they yeah I mean so I I have heard a lot of people say that the important is getting to them there they're itching to get outside especially we had we had really nice weather here in Ireland or at least in Cork City where I'm living the last couple days so I've seen people outside and things like this and one of the restrictions that the government had in place was to encourage people to if they're going to go outside and exercise for example stay within a certain distance of their home like two kilometres or something like this so when I was out grocery shopping I did see people sort of out on the at the park you know sort of on the grassy hill I'm just hanging out which is nice if you're enjoying the weather and I think it's okay you know if the weather is nice and there's a park close to where you live that's that's fine to do something like that but of course you should be keeping your distance from other people I know I know it's it's hard to stay inside for such a long period of time but there are tons of things that you can do inside and on the internet for example so talking about you know the use of technology when you're when you're so isolating there are a lot of really cool websites and things you could be doing online for example so that's I know why I for example don't really mind staying inside because I can always find something to do on the internet or something to entertain myself yeah yeah if you look I'm sure you'll find some improve your English in cambly improve your English on cambly absolutely or teach other people your native language so there is actually quite a few sites where you can sort of sign up to teach other people your native language for example so people are interested in learning Portuguese you could totally sign up for these off these other websites and become a tutor yourself and earn some money while you're in self-isolation it's great Louise is asking if you have if you want to come to Brazil if you wanted me get to know Brazil I've ever been here by the way I've actually I've actually never been there so you know I mentioned I'm quite happy sort of staying home and and that sort of extends a little bit more broadly to travel and fortunately I I'm not I don't really have the travel bug I haven't really travelled that much in my life as I grew up in Canada yeah just a second I have to do the announcement Posada Shakira TV company I just find it hard as me so Aguada ya think is a calm quiet conscience you know a life new YouTube that won't be godly I'm sorry no worries no worries I was just saying yeah so I grew up in Canada and southern Ontario close to the city of Niagara Falls and I never really did that much traveling just to the United States maybe to Florida for a for a vacation or something and then now to Ireland and I've been to Germany and Belgium for some conferences and things like this but you know I'm not against traveling and I would definitely love to come to Brazil here you guys have some fantastic ijen so I would definitely like so I wanna get back a little bit to your your field of study about er yeah artificial intelligence let me write that or a I write you say and how do you think this technology is gonna can help us during the this this moment now how do you think it affects us and how do you think it's good for us yeah yeah absolutely so well I mean first of all one really cool application of artificial intelligence is crunching through large amounts of data efficiently but also intelligently in a sense and so there was actually a company based in Tehran - in Canada they uses artificial intelligence to track diseases and they actually picked up on the corona virus and how it was potentially a sort of a pandemic like disease or or the fact that it was spreading so quickly using artificial intelligence that's that's one of the really that's sort of one of the strengths of artificial intelligence is that it's able to take a large amount of data data that no human could ever sift through and find the patterns in that data sort of analyze that data intelligently so one really cool way that we can apply AI technologies is to understand or predict for example the spread of diseases through populations because these kinds of technologies and systems are able to work through that data and much better you know and much quicker than any person or any team of people really good or think God always asking what are the most interesting or unexpected uses of technology you've seen so far during this period yeah so one of my favorite or one of my favorite uses of AI technologies is to play games so I'm not sure how many of you may have heard of deep blue which was a computer system that was developed way back in 1997 to play chess but the way that they built it to play chess yeah the way that they built to play chess was basically trying to code in knowledge about chess so you know if the board is in this position then this piece should move here in this patient were there more recently google's deepmind so deep mind is a company that works on with artificial intelligence they created a chess playing AI that learned how to play chess without any input from humans so it actually learned how to play the game of chess by playing against itself so it would it would play the game again and celled and it would it would do this millions of times and eventually it would sort of teach itself in a way the best way to play the game of chess and it is currently the best chess playing entity in the world no human and in fact no other computer system can beat this system it's called alpha 0 alpha 0 is what it's called so that's something that I'm really excited about Nai and they've actually also applied a similar technique to video games so if any of you have know the video game Starcraft 2 so Starcraft is a is a real-time strategy game so it's like chess in the sense that you have sort of pieces and you try to defeat your opponent yeah Starcraft exactly yeah so you see you it's like chess on the Cynthia of pieces and you try to move your pieces around the map and defeat your opponent but it's also a lot different from chess and a lot more like the real world because in this video game in StarCraft you actually don't see the whole board you don't see the whole map you can only see places where you have buildings or where you have units or things like this and it's it's a game that takes place in real time right so chess is turn-based I can't make a move until you make them do right so it's sort of you make a move and I make a move but in this video game both players are trying to sort of move their pieces and build their sort of armies as fast as they can and there's there's no turns it's it's just all sort of happening in real time and so sorry sorry it is it it is available and it's actually free to play it's free to download and free to play so again if anyone's looking for something to do now that you're stuck in self-isolation it's a fantastic game I know it's maybe not for everyone because it is quite a quite a complicated game but but it is it is a fantastic game myself and and Google developed a bot again this one's called alpha star using similar techniques that they used to train their BOTS to play chess to play this video game and the results really are quite impressive it's able to beat about 99% of the human players that it plays against because it was actually sort of unleashed on the online servers where where humans play against each other this was in Europe so yeah so have a fantastic I have a question from NASA she's asking what is the most difficult thing that the citizens of our country are living with this quarantine the most difficult thing yes um I well I think probably similarly to most other countries is the fact that most people are sort of being laid off or on them you know they're being I guess not fired but but most people are unemployed at the moment right as a result of the closure of pretty much all non-essential services um yeah job loss so I mean that's sort of just the tip of the iceberg too because as you can imagine that's going to to cause the economy to go into a bit of a depression or recession or quite a quite a big one if if you are following what the experts are saying so at the moment I think that is what most people are struggling with yeah three says asking she would like to know about the struggle between Ireland and England because of Karuma fires do you think that has stopped it has yeah I am I am probably not the person to be talking about this mostly because I do I you know I know a little bit of the history between the two countries but but definitely not enough to say to say anything with any authority what may be I can say is that I don't think coronavirus has exacerbated any tensions or relations between the countries the the thing that has caused a bit of concern between the two countries is breaks it because since Northern Ireland is part of the UK if the UK leaves the U then that would mean establishing an international border maybe between Northern Ireland and Ireland again or something maybe this would would cause Irish reunification we're really not sure what is gonna happen mostly because who knows what's happening with breaks it at the moment anyways yeah yeah don't get enemies st he wants to say he wants to play but he doesn't know where to go for Starcraft you know for StarCraft you should just be able to go to the Blizzard website so Blizzard is the company that runs or created Starcraft so so Blizzard yeah what Blizzard Entertainment and you should be able to just download it for free Starcraft 2 I believe it is free to download it should be free to download um yeah yeah play play free now so you should be able to go to the Blizzard website and at the top there should be a tab for games as an ahjussi Starcraft 2 laser comm Blizzard come yeah buzzer doc tell my things the website okay let me see here yeah brother calm yeah and you should you should get to the website you know great thank you I have a question from Pablo he's saying unfortunately we can't celebrate Easter on traditional way this year but how do you usually celebrate nor how do you celebrate normally yeah yeah great question normally actually I get together with my I have a nice big family and we normally all get together at my uncle's house and we have you know we eat that stuff and drinking stuff and and unfortunately none of that's really gonna happen this year one thing that is going to continue this year though and something I kind of already mentioned uh usually we watched Jesus Christ Superstar every year so that's that's something that I'm gonna be doing this afternoon is I'm gonna sit down with my roommates and we're gonna watch Jesus Christ Superstar and I'll maybe call my my family what's a phrase we use technology to to say hi and wish everyone a happy Easter and things like this so I'm keeping the tradition a little bit alive and maybe eat some chocolate I think I already ate all the chocolate eat chocolate they're two very very large tradition by very common tradition too to eat chocolates very big here absolutely yeah it is that's one of my my favorite parts of Easter as well getting lots of chocolate and I think my parents said they were sending actually some chocolate in the mail it hasn't arrived yet but fingers crossed delivery you can't ask for chocolate delivery to send them - right exactly yeah so I think you know oh I didn't ask for it but I I'm certainly not gonna say no to it when the right always asking I'm talking about delivery how are you using delivery apps is that like saving your life yeah so I haven't really used any delivery app so I we were when quarantine or lockdown was first announced we did look at getting groceries delivered but the the wait time as you can imagine is just sort of it's it's a long really long wait period I think if you if you order groceries or something the delivery won't come for like a week or a week and a half yeah so I haven't actually used any any delivery service for groceries I haven't tried yet just for ordering food although those services are still running I believe mostly what I do is is I I try to only go to grocery store once a week or so and sort of stock up and get enough to last for a week and you know limit my exposure to a sort of other people in that way yeah I have a question from model what do you think about the technology security in these times when lots of people share their personal information in the internet yeah yeah really good question I so I personally I try not to share my personal information if I can because that can be that that is sort of a hot topic today so if if you've been following any of sort of the technology news a lot of companies have been shunning or not using this platform called zoom because they think that there is a sort of backdoor access into into into the platform for people to you know access your videos and your personal data and things like this so I do try to limit the amount of personal information that I sort of give to companies or to after things like this unfortunately I think it's becoming increasingly difficult these days I was mentioning Gustavo before we sort of got started that you know if any of you have a smartphone or a cell phone you know it's sort of collecting information on you anyways even if you don't necessarily give it a lot of your personal information most modern smartphones track your location for example things like this and and companies can actually infer a lot just from having sort of your location history right you can imagine that you go to a store or a certain place and you're sort of there for a while the company might infer oh you're in a shop what shop is there on that Street this is all sort of public information and then they know oh you're at you know this kind of store for this amount of time and and then I don't know if any of you see this but I actually get notifications from Google saying oh you're at this restaurant would you like to rate this restaurant or you were at this place you know would like to rate your experience at this place so so it is it is becoming increasingly difficult to limit you know the kind of information that companies are getting from us but I I would say try to be you know try to be safe and and in general don't always give out as much personal information or personal information if you can help it like I said unfortunately I think that's becoming increasingly difficult to do that Patrice is asking do you feel more approachable from people during social distancing any changes of people's behavior not sure what she meant here but if you like you more maybe closer to people doing social in a way because like you can reach people well I've actually had some kind of odd experiences out on the street so like when I was getting groceries with my roommates where we're living together so we were just sort of walking together and so we're not really practicing social distancing but you get some odd stares from people who think that you're violating the social distancing rules I mean sure you know they're allowed to think that I suppose but you know we live together so if one of us gets the virus then I'm sure the rest of us are gonna get it anyways and even just topping it I'm sure you guys have seen like the memes or the jokes now right you know when it if you're if you even coughed once or something everyone sort of turns and stares at you and so that actually sort of happens to me I I just like I swallowed some water or something and down the wrong pipe and I started just coughing a little bit and some woman was walking by the sidewalk and she actually sort of ran out onto the street and like giving me a wide berth and gave me his kind of a stare because maybe she thought that I was coughing because of the virus um when I'm sort of at home I actually do find that I'm reaching out a little bit more to people that I haven't necessarily talked to in a little bit I think maybe yeah because we're all so in lockdown and nothing else he was you were talking I was thinking about what she said because from the time you were forbidden or it's more difficult to meet people people tend to to reach out more for others right just because you can have in person maybe people are talking more and doing like hangouts maybe I think that's what she meant do you think that's not that's happening nowadays like people because they can't they start like looking for people more absolutely yeah I think well I think you just have to look at if you know the popularity I think there's an app called house party that's been gaining in popularity a lot but for cisely I think because of this sort of idea yeah I mean I think it also depends maybe on you know where your self isolating if you're sort of alone in your apartment then definitely you'll probably look to reach out to people I'm not sure if you're self isolating with your family and you you get along with your family that may be you know it's a nice time to reconnect with your family but if maybe that relationship isn't so nice then you look at online for other kinds of relationships but but definitely I think I think you know just the fact that people are sort of inside more right and probably not working as much is causing people to to reach out and in various ways unfortunately we're gonna have to end our class in a few minutes but so I have my my last announcements to make this Wow muevete obrigado bella places that you thought this was a is a tennessee do me when I said my energy to me would you pass for a Buddha shock you but a king and anong sabi treatise
