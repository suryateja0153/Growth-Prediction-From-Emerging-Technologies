 there's two sides to every story and the 5g story is no different on one hand there's a lot of excitement about how 5g can open the door to more wireless innovation but on the other hand US politicians worry about privacy and security as China positions itself as a 5g superpower all right let's talk about the positives of 5g first so 5 G's slogan is basically high speed low latency so a prime example of how powerful 5g can be and what it could mean for wireless innovation is autonomous vehicles so you're walking down the street you're in a crosswalk and an autonomous vehicle is driving towards you that autonomous vehicle is going to be equipped with tons and tons of sensors and all of those sensors are gathering information and sending that information back to a cloud somewhere so you want that autonomous car to be able to send that information back to the cloud super fast because you don't want to get hit by the car and that's a really great example of where 5g will have that strength because it's wireless it doesn't need to be connected to a Wi-Fi router somewhere it's just connected all above you in the air it will be able to send your information the fact that you're walking in front of the car in a crosswalk back to the cloud and the car will stop for you 5g also will have the potential to serve currently underserved communities so if you think about those coverage maps that you see in commercials for big wireless providers looks like they cover most of the country but there's still some noticeable spots that aren't covered those places right now are usually served by rural telecom companies that are sometimes operating much older networks 5g could make wireless more widespread and serve these underserved communities now let's talk about the other side of the story politicians all the way on up to the President of the United States worried about risks associated with 5g hardware made by Chinese tech companies one company at the center of all of this is Huawei I've done a bunch of videos breaking down the proposed Huawei band and how it can affect business so I'll link those below so whole reason that Huawei and some other smaller Chinese telecom companies that are sort of huawei's competitors are blacklisted by the commerce department is because of this huge push for 5g and 5g infrastructure president Trump wants to ensure that Huawei can't have its hardware used in the building of US 5g networks because allegedly while we could plant sort of backdoors in its equipment and then use those back doors to then spy on consumers we don't know this for sure it's all alleged but this move was sort of done out of an abundance of caution like I said earlier politicians on both sides of the aisle are concerned about China's growing influence over 5g tech mark Warner who is the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee is one of them he's a senator from Virginia he also coincidentally is a former telecom professional so he's really well-versed in wireless networks and how they should be regulated and protocols because 5g is more decentralized it requires a lot of maintenance and security updates so for example if your tech was made by a Chinese telecom company there's essentially what he's arguing is there's no reason that the Chinese government couldn't pressure Huawei or another telecom company to send out malware to its users and then spy on them so it's possible that if the u.s. used Chinese made Hardware in its networks they could at one point become insecure so Senator Warner is a little bit concerned about China becoming the de facto regulator and setting the protocols for 5g because of its growing dominance in the market that being said here in the US we'll probably never see Chinese made or Chinese backed Hardware in our 5g networks that's because there's this huge push for the smaller rural telecom companies that may be currently using Chinese made hardware to completely rip it out of their networks and replace it with something more approved by the US government and the reason that these smaller rural telecom providers had Chinese made hardware in their networks to begin with is because it was cheaper they didn't have the money to invest in non Chinese made we're which is now why the US government is going to give them upwards of 700 million dollars to rip and replace for when it comes to 5g so that's where we are in the u.s. widespread 5g networks are not yet a reality so it's good that these concerns are being addressed before 5g becomes an integral part of our lives and once I've G rolls out globally expect more IOT sensors than you can count plus super fast speeds for streaming and stuff like that so what do you think are these concerns warranted or are politicians just being paranoid let me know what you think in the comments below and thanks for watching if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe
