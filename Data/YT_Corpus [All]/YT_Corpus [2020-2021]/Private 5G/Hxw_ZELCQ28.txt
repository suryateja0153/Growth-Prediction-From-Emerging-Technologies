 FILED AN OBJECTION SAYING THE DRILLING WE PUT WILDLIFE IN DANGER AND DAMAGE THE CLIMATE. THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO NOW DOING ITS DAILY CORONAVIRUS UPDATE MAYOR KEVIN FAULCONER NOW SPEAKING LIVE SECOND. I WILL GIVE AN UPDATE ON OUR BEACHES. A 3RD ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL EXPANSION OF OUR SLOW STREETS INITIATIVE AND LASTLY OF COURSE HIGHLIGHTING THE WORK OF WE'VE DONE ALL THIS WEEK ON SAN DIEGO BUSINESSES THAT ARE OPENING UP AND STEPPING UP AND DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY. A TOPIC NUMBER ONE BRINGING FASTER WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY TO SAN DIEGO. YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK EACH DAY ABOUT WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS DOING TO BRING RELIEF. THE SAN DIEGANS AFFECTED BY COVID-19 WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IMMEDIATE NEEDS LIKE OPENING THE CONVENTION CENTER TO GET HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS OFF THE STREETS NOW. WE TALKED ABOUT SHORT-TERM NEEDS LIKE DIRECTING MORE THAN MILLION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND EXTENDING THE EVICTION MORATORIUM. FOR SAN DIEGANS THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO HELP PAY THE RENT AND LONGER TERM NEEDS LIKE PUSHING FOR A SAFE. AND RESPONSIBLE REOPENING STRATEGY THAT PUTS SAN DIEGANS BACK TO WORK. THIS NEXT ANNOUNCEMENT A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ACTUALLY MORE THAN A YEAR. IN THE MAKING. BUT TODAY WE ARE LAUNCHING A CITYWIDE EXPANSION UP NEXT GENERATION, 5 G WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY. AS SAN DIEGANS ARE TURNING TO THE INTERNET TO WORK LEARN AND ACCESS HEALTH CARE. THIS INVESTMENT REALLY COMES AT A CRITICAL TIME. THIS IS A GAME CHANGER. AND IT'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF OUR CORPORATE PARTNER HORIZON. A SAN DIEGO IS AMONG A SMALL HANDFUL OF CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE LAUNCH. THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND WE'RE GETTING IT AT A TIME WHERE DEMAND FOR RELIABLE INTERNET ACCESS HAS NEVER BEEN GREATER CONNECTING WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILIES AND ZOOM. THE STUDENTS ARE NOW CONTINUING THEIR EDUCATION WHILE STAYING AT HOME. A BUSINESS OWNERS BOLSTERING THEIR ONLINE ORDERING AND DELIVERY OPTIONS. THIS PANDEMIC OF COURSE IS TRANSFORMING EVERYTHING WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT. SAN DIEGO CONTINUES TO LEAD IN THE FOREFRONT AND ADAPTING TO THIS CHANGE. 5 G TECHNOLOGY IS GOING MAKE EVERYTHING WE DO OVER THE INTERNET FASTER AND MORE RELIABLE. IN FACT IT PROMISES DELIVER DOWNLOAD SPEEDS UP TO 10 TIMES FASTER THEN THE CURRENT MOBILE NETWORKS. THIS IS A RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY AND HER EYES AND TO ACCELERATE 5 G AND ENHANCE WIRELESS SERVICE. WE STREAMLINED THE PERMIT PROCESS OVER EYES AND GET THE 5 G INTO THE HANDS OF SAN DIEGANS FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, I DON'T THINK THIS REALLY COULD HAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME. OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS CARRIED A TREMENDOUS BURDEN RECENTLY RESPONDING. THE COVID-19 THIS HAS MANIFESTED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING A DRAMATIC INCREASE. I'M AN ONLINE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS AND TELEHEALTH CONSULTATIONS RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL HAS GONE FROM A 20 TELEHEALTH VISITS PER WEEK. TO MORE THAN 4,000. 20 TO 4,000. AND OTHER PROVIDERS LIKE SHARPEN KAISER ALSO CONDUCTING THOUSANDS OF CONSULTATIONS EACH DAY WITH A SIMILAR INCREASE. THE CUSTOMER DEMAND. SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET A FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT DURING TODAY'S UPDATE ON WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY MEANS AND THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. FROM DOCTOR MAGIC IN JUST A SECOND WAS WITH RADY CHILDREN'S. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT 5 G IS GOING MAKE IT EASIER FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS TO STAY CONNECTED WITH FASTER AND MORE RELIABLE INTERNET ACCESS THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ARE PROUD OF THE CITY TO PARTNER WITH HORIZON TO MAKE 5 G AVAILABLE TO THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY TO BUSINESSES AND OF COURSE OUR RESIDENTS ALIKE. SO NOW FIRST UP IT'S MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE THE WEST COAST. WEST AREA PRESIDENT FOR VERIZON JONATHAN KARL JONATHAN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELL THANK YOU IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY TODAY, I'M EXCITED ANNOUNCED THAT SAN DIEGO IS THE LATEST US CITY TO HAVE RISES 5 G ULTRA WIDEBAND MOBILITY SERVICE. OUR LAUNCH OF 5 G MARKS AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE FOLLOWING THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WAS FORMED BETWEEN VERIZON AND THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR. OUR PARTNERSHIP IS DESIGNED TO CREATE A MORE CONNECTED AND FORWARD THINKING CITY WE'RE BUILDING A ROBUST AND RELIABLE NETWORK THAT WILL GET CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGIES IN COMMUNITIES FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN EVER BEFORE. 5 G WILL CHANGE HOW WE LIVE WORK AND PLAY CITIES THAT LEAD IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL BE FIRST TO ATTRACT AND KEEP TECH SAVVY BUSINESSES AND CREATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND HIGH PAYING JOBS. CONDUCTIVITY AS THE MAYOR MENTIONED IS MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER WITH THE REALIZATION THAT LIFE DURING A PANDEMIC REQUIRES DISTANCE LEARNING AND THE ABILITY TO WORK FROM HOME FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME AND WE'RE DOING THAT AND MAKING THAT HAPPEN RIGHT HERE IN SAN DIEGO. OUR 5 G ULTRA WIDEBAND SERVICE WILL BE INITIALLY CONCENTRATED IN PARTS OF MISSION VALLEY. LINDA VESTER KENSINGTON AND BAKER'S HELP. BUT WE WILL BE RAPIDLY EXPANDING THAT FOOTPRINT THROUGHOUT 2020 AND BEYOND. WE APPRECIATE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BRINGING VERIZON'S 5 G ALL TO WRITE DOWN SERVICE TO MORE NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU. THAN UP A THANK YOU AND NEXT UP IS MY PLEASURE TO DO SO RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN UNTIL A HEALTHY LEAD. A DOCTOR ANTHONY MAGIC AND DOCTOR MAGIC CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TELEHEALTH AND HOW PORT IS FOR THIS THAT NEW TECH CONNECTIVITY DOCTOR MAGIC WELCOME. THANK YOU MAYOR VERY MUCH. IT REALLY HAS BEEN IMPORTANT IN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS RADY HAS GONE FROM A HANDFUL OF TELEMEDICINE BUSINESS TODAY. TO OVER 600 PER DAY REALLY INVOLVED IN ALL A SPECIALIST AS A DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND OUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. IT'S REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE THE PARENTS CAN BRING THEIR CHILDREN ONTO OUR CAMPUS REALLY THEIR ROUTINE CARE URGING CARE. IT'S A IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY A CRISIS AND ONE OF THE REAL CONCERNS IS THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING A ROUTINE CARE DEFERRED BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN ABOUT LEAVING THEIR HOMES. SO THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE INTERNET IN REAL TIME AND RELIABLE NETWORK IS CRITICAL BECAUSE DURING THE EXAMINATION A DISCUSSION WITH THE FAMILY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TECHNICAL ISSUES BECOME A PROBLEM SO WE'RE REALLY SEE THE TELEMEDICINE IS BECOMING A SIGNIFICANT PART OF HEALTH CARE EVEN ONCE THE PANDEMIC HAS DISSOLVED AND HAVING RELIABLE ACCESS TO IT IS CRITICAL, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE BROADBAND TO RELY UPON SMART DEVICES SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY WORK THE SAN DIEGO AS A COMMUNITY AS YOUR PEDIATRIC SAFETY NET.

WE HAVE TO TRANSITION TO STORIES OBVIOUSLY ABOUT FOCUSING ON BUSINESSES THAT ARE DOING IT AND DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY. EARLIER THIS WEEK OFFICES BEGAN TO REOPENED AND THAT INCLUDED THE DOWNTOWN WORKSPACE THIS COMPANY IS A SHARED WORKSPACE THAT OFFERS OFFICES AND MEETING SPACES FOR SAN DIEGO'S THE LIGHTS ALONG WITH ACCELERATORS ANOTHER BUSINESS NETWORKS. THEY CREATED A COLLABORATIVE AND A CREATIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR ENTREPRENEURS WRITERS FREELANCERS AND STARTUPS WITH MANY WORKING FROM HOME RIGHT NOW THE FOLKS AT DOWNTOWN WORKSPACE KNOW, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOVE A CHANGE OF SCENERY. I CAN SEE THERE ON THE ON THE SCREEN THERE TIM KEANE IS TAKING ALL THE RIGHT MEASURES. TO GIVE THEIR EMPLOYEES AND MEMBERS SAFE. REQUIRE TEMPERATURE CHECKS AND FACE COVERINGS PLEXIGLASS TO SEPARATE OFFICES. A REGULAR SCHEDULE CLEANINGS DIRECTIONAL SIGNS AND DISTANCE MARKERS TO HELP PEOPLE MAINTAIN PHYSICAL DISTANCING. IN GROUP AREAS.
