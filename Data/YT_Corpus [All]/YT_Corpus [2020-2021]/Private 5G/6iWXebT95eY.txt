 now a lot of our forecasts are dependent on weather data from weather satellites but Storm Team meteorologist Lindsay Rachel tells us about an emerging technology that has the science community concern Verizon AT&T we've all seen the commercials 5g is the next generation of mobile broadband and it will be making things faster and it has the kind of types of applications and expand the types of applications that people can use there there is my devices for more data and faster - that sounds great but the science community is concerned about its location on the electromagnetic spectrum it happens to be right next to the frequencies NOAA and NASA satellites use right now to sense water vapor in the atmosphere and that's really important for tracking storms not only is it close but scientists are worried that 5g is going to be a noisy neighbor Lindsay could you kind of keep it down that's kind of interfering with me making the forecast oh so sorry Jen Thanks according to studies by NASA and NOAA this interference could degrade forecast up to 30% Neil Jacobs the head of NOAA told Congress that could set forecasting back to the 1980s reducing hurricane warning time by two or three days the effects won't be noticed immediately the rule out of 5g is going to take time that space was only just auctioned off by the FCC for nearly two billion dollars this past March it's a lot of money for the operators to build up upgrade their 4G networks to 5g and so they're going to be kind of smart about their investments where they get the most return and most users meanwhile scientists continue to perform studies and push for stricter limits so 5g doesn't bleed into their weather data some of these opportunities innovation opportunities that 5g brings are so transformative and revolutionary that it will be a long term process to figure everything out and we have to design you know new laws and new regulations to to enable some of these things so that both life-changing technologies can coexist in the long term Wednesday Rachel News Channel nine
