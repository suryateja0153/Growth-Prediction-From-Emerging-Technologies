 Cecilia can you explain in just a few words what is the state of 5G at the moment? First of all we are just in the first phase in an early phase of this next-generation mobile technology and we expect it to take off for the next year we are still waiting for the Swedish authorities to release some key spectrum and here we are a bit behind our neighboring countries in fact. Could you also explain what the purpose of this 5G ecosystem is why Tieto is part of it? key thing is that you can't realise the benefits of 5G all by yourself and therefore I'm grateful to Telia for having put this ecosystem together and Tieto's role in the ecosystem is both to help our customers to innovate and to find ways in this business transformation and also for us to realize this as a systems integrator. Gunnar, you have vast experience of commercialization of new technologies and untapped markets. what can companies do now to prepare for a leverage 5G technology? 5G is a technology that will enable new services and new markets that don't really exist yet and then it's hard to predict what will be demanded or not so then our advice is taking a portfolio approach trial and error test many things evaluate closed down things that don't work. Secondly, we really believe in teamwork both in the small teams but also in large ecosystems and last but not least focus on end-user values and what's the problems of end-users and what new problems can be solved with the new technology. Any final words Cecilia? well my message to you guys is start now start wrapping your head around 5G and what what the new technology can do for you and and we are absolutely happy to help. you both in that innovation part but also in the process to make it real as a systems integrator and  these things take time so why wait. I would just concur here and say that we can support in knowledge about technology about businesses but also about driving innovation and we're happy to help.
