 Hey what’s up everybody? There’s always something to celebrate, and always something to be thankful for. Today we’re celebrating one year of 5G. Now a new ad will debut this Thursday, Thanksgiving Day, featuring technology leader Nicki Palmer thanking the hard working men and women on our team who brought 5G to life. That’s 5G Built Right. You stick around and you get to see the full thing. Now speaking of Thursday, my favorite day of the year, Thanksgiving Day. Make sure you tune into the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade at 9 AM ET, where we will be bringing our 5G technology to this year’s parade. Parade-goers can stop by our 5G portal in Bryant Park to get transported to the grandstands in Herald Square. Now if you can’t make it to the city, you can join online, where the 360-degree 5G Portal experience will put viewers in control of how they view and focus on the balloons, floats and performers. What a great way to see Tom Turkey courtesy of 5G. But that’s not all, we want to see your 5G pride. We’ve got a link to a website where you can share a custom video with your name on social media. No matter what job you do around here, we all play a part in building 5G. And that’s something to brag about. Now here’s Nicki to say thank you. Have a great meeting. Alright, thank you. Hi everyone. Today is a big day. We just passed the one year anniversary of our 5G launch. So let's think about it. While everyone else was talking about the future of 5G, you have been doing it. We were the first in the world to launch 5G mobile. We launched 5G home, we're already in parks, public spaces around the country. We flipped the switch on 14 NFL stadiums. And with 5G Ultra Wideband, we hit 2.35 gigabits per second. Insane. And just like we said we're going to be in 30 cities by the end of this year. So I just want to personally thank you. We set some very big goals and like you always do, you delivered.
