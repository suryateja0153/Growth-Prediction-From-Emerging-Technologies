 A huge part of Ericsson's booth at Mobile World Congress is dedicated to consumer 5G use cases. I'm here with Peter Linder, North America's head of 5G marketing. Peter, we've done some research about what consumers want from 5G. Can you tell us about that? We've done a study right now,  we started last year. We investigated ten use cases, and we looked into three more cases on what is the potential. This year we have deepened this study. So we looked into 22 different markets and we looked at 30 different use cases, but we've tried to find answers to three different questions from what consumer interests are: What are they interested in and how interested are they? We're trying to understand what are they interest in paying for and we are trying to understand when do they think they would buy something like that. So for these thirty use cases where we have done a study, which is just we're presenting here this show, which is ending it about where do we think consumers are going. And where do we think they're going? I think we've seen them going in a couple of different directions. This is very much a study that gives you a bit short, a broad range of different opportunities. We see they're going in the direction of enhanced mobile broadband, so a better mobile broadband service where you can see higher quality video get that down to your phone and you can also share more video, live video, in places where there's a lot of users at the same time. So that's what's going on the mobile side of the house for broadband. On fixed broadband we see it's very much about going where there is not fiber yet but there's unlikely going to get fiber, so eliminating the digital divide in urban areas but also on the countryside where a mobile infrastructure can serve both fixed and mobile applications. Great, thank you so much, Peter. Stay tuned: we will take you to show you the fixed wireless access demos and a consumer demo.
