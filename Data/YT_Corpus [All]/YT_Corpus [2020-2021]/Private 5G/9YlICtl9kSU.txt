 washington correspondent for bloomberg television and for bloomberg radio we're here with the under secretary of economic affairs keith crock mr under secretary you just returned from europe and met with various counterparts as it relates to 5g technology what happened the tide has totally turned kevin um i was it was eight countries uh 10 cities you know the big news is the integration of the clean network with the eu clean toolbox and you know the countries i went to luxembourg now has picked nothing but clean vendors in 5g this morning belgium announced it the big one was germany and that is where they they're about ready to issue regulations that in essence will exclude huawei and then we saw the same thing with regard to austria portugal spain estonia albania so now uh the transatlantic alliance in 5g is secure so it's about 25 of the 30 nato nations let me press you on this why the shift specifically with germany it seems that in recent weeks there's been a shift with germany what changed by the way i i really think it's a combination of three factors um the first one is and i i spent a lot of time with nato with deputy secretary gionna and he said look we can't afford to have a fractured nato we we need the 5g civilian networks in peace time and wartime we can't have some that have trusted vendors and some that have untrusted veterans so that's factor number one the second is the 5g eu clean toolbox and i met with my old friend terry matone who's the eu commissioner and and a lot of people don't know this but uh he announced it that the board of directors for the telcos in the eu have to make the decision and if they choose a high-risk supplier which is basically the chinese suppliers and something goes wrong they are personally liable that's huge and then the third thing is that that integration with the clean network and they can see that momentum all around the world even you look at some of the economic data of some of these chinese telecommunication firms whether it's huawei or whether it's even supply chains like zte and whatnot and they're making a lot of money even despite europe moving elsewhere their profits are booming does that concern you how does the u.s diminish some of the the clout of these companies well by the way i i think you're going to see it show up in huawei's numbers uh eventually you know they're private companies so who knows uh with these guys but uh i mean you can see their deals are evaporating all around the world in february last february they announced they had like 95 g contracts the most we can count outside of china is seven and meanwhile going back to china you were just in taiwan i want to ask you about that in a second but specifically on chinese payment digital payments you look at alipay for example what is the administration going to be doing or what are you and your team doing about many of the national security economic concerns pertaining to these companies by the way i can't talk about our internal deliberations uh you know obviously it's a cause for uh concern so that's about all i can say at this point meanwhile you were in taiwan you were attending a funeral uh and tell us what happened how was that well i i went over for uh the funeral for president lee he's the father of democracy it's like he's like their george washington um i was the highest ranking uh state department official since 1979 when i went over there uh the the the chinese sent 37 fighters and bombers to break taiwan uh airspace um and uh but i can tell you i had such a great meeting with president tsai and also many of the ceos we had an economic dialogue on many they are a great partner a great friend they're a role model for capitalism and democracy in that part of the world mr undersecretary thank you so much sir for your time thank you kevin i appreciate it
