 Moving on to some other conspiracy theories Now let me guess 5G Now there's a lot going in this, there's a lot, there's a lot of people who have said a few things about it, and I mean, for me, coming from a tech background, I literally, I do have an issue, but the point there is quite a lot out there but, I mean, don't get me wrong I want superfast broadband when I'm using my phone, I want, you know I understand why it's all out there, but there is there is this issue and what I can see is with this 5G, I mean, from every two to eight houses there's gonna have to be some kind of have to be some kind of responder on there, or transponder, which literally it is gonna be full of, I mean, think of 4G when that was going and they started to hide it in certain, remember the false trees and everything, we're now gonna have this for 5G, do you would you remember that with 4G? Yeah. You know people were really worried back then and I mean we did talk about Wi-Fi back in the 90s last time, now with 5G I mean they are saying that insect populations are going to be affected by this, scientists are calling that 41 countries 147 scientists, my main question is, has the government done an independent survey into the effects of 5G? So, everything I have found on this is that 5G has passed, or that the equipment that is being installed in the UK at the moment for 5G, is all compliant with the various regulations on radio waves and the technologies it uses, so it is all compliant with the rules and regulations that surround these things, which of course actually, probably most of them still come from Europe, so whilst we're in the transition period we are still beholden to the rules and regulations that come from the European Union which, actually on these sort of things, are normally quite quite strict, so from that perspective, the answer is, do they meet every standard that the UK and the European Union has set, yes they do if you're asking for any more in-depth studies, you know there is always scope to do more study, more examination on any new technology But there hasn't been one then basically so they just tick the box there, I don't know, this certifies that, fine Well, again, but yeah you have got to remember a lot of these standards that are set by national governments or supranational governments in the case of the European Union, again they are not a bunch of politicians sat around a desk saying what should we make the regulation on this be yes politicians make the ultimate legislation, but you know it is all scientifically led and so, from everything I have seen 5G meets the standards that governments all over the globe have set for it, including our own Okay but in a square, again the standards could be passed for, for instance, one transponder being in one location against you know a certain distance apart, I mean how far apart, I mean this is what I'm saying about, has an independent study been done? have they put somebody in front of one of these transponders or a group of, for instance, a cell load let's say a block and seen the effects and tested that, which I don't think they have. I mean, for the stuff that's on there, I mean there are tos and fors against against this, but it's about changing people's DNA and causing headaches and doing lots of things, it is a bit of a scary one Well I've seen no evidence of DNA being changed, yes we had at the very start, at the early, and we talked about this last week, at the early Wi-Fi networks and so on people getting headaches and so on which doesn't happen anymore, but you have to remember  5G is live in the UK right now, this isn't something that's going to happen, it  has happened and just because Apple haven't produced a device that works on 5G yet doesn't mean some of the other, some of the other manufacturers I think Samsung have got devices out there I think Samsung do, I keep seeing the various networks advertising 5G plans and so on now, certainly the big networks have all got 5G for those parts of the country that have the infrastructure, so it has happened, it has passed the various tests it needs to pass to to be allowed on to the UK solar grid Great okay, we'll keep this question open Ok
