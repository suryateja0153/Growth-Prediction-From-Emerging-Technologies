 [Music] Pete szalinski with modern machine shop magazine I'm here with Matt Danford senior editor Matt writes about digital technology for the monthly data matters column and mono machines Matt thank you for talking to me my pleasure I want to talk about 5g we all kind of think we're familiar with this term we see it in the corner of our cell phone screens 5g has implications for manufacturing and I want to talk about that what is 5g 5 G stands for 5th generation and basically that refers to you know like 4G and 3G before it just the latest generation of wireless infrastructure if you will and so the great promise here is from in my understanding the ability to move more data at a time faster and more reliably so data speeds we don't really appreciate the extent to which limitations on data flow inhibit and define what we're able to do in manufacturing would you agree with that sure a lot of times examples are hard to come by because so much of the coverage is sort of from a 50,000 foot view but I think a lot of the promise of a 5g is gonna be on the shop for a level doing things that you wouldn't even think of doing because it's just it's not feasible today and perhaps the best example I've come across comes out of a research institute in Germany where they were doing a they were looking into BLISK milling this is a really complicated process of bladed disks for turbine blades and these are these are thin you know sculpted blades they're getting thinner all the time it's just a really difficult operation these things take 2025 hours to the mill there's a lot of value in them by the time they get to that stage and you don't want to scrap one of these parts but due to the nature of the parts chatter is a huge problem so what they did in Germany they mounted a sensor directly to the workpiece inside the machine tool an accelerometer to measure vibration and thanks to a 5g connection provided by Ericsson this is the Fraunhofer East Research Institute in Germany they were able to monitor vibration in real time and have the CNC compensate for that with without 5g this just wouldn't be possible you wouldn't be able to have that near real-time feedback loop between the sensor on the part and the machine to compensate for chatter in this way so what would it look like for a capability like that data capability like that to go more mainstream what would it look like for for manufacturers today to begin to implement capability like that sure so once it's ready my understanding is it may look a lot like implementing a 4G wireless network today and so if you if you go into any facility with a private 4G network I you know they'll have a it'll be a central hub with you know antennas strategically placed placed throughout this facility to spread the wireless coverage okay so when we get to the point where more facilities are using this capability with shops are using this capability what might that mean well III think it means where we would be there so to speak in terms of realizing the promise of the so-called industrial Internet of Things or industry 4.0 and when you talk about a fourth Industrial Revolution that's characterized by cyber physical systems and greater interconnectedness and this is a key part of the underlying infrastructure that that will make that possible so but I think by the time you know these networks are installed and and and manufacturers you know around the country and around the world you know maybe we won't be talking about these buzzwords anymore this will be the new the new norm [Music] you
