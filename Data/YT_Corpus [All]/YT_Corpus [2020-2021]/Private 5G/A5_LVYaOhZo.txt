 [Music] hi my name is Rosario cuy I am PLM at Nokia I'm responsible for carriers in solution for 5g network a slicing in today's talk we are going to talk about 5g network a slicing and how carriers and solution can be used for automation assurance and optimization of transference lysis network a slice is an end-to-end concept as it shown here operator why the has three customers BMW Fiat and public safety and each one needs and the multiple end-to-end individual the independent logical networks each of these networks are called network a slices the color represents the SLA requirement for each of them in this example operator Y created five networking slices it contains ran a slice each of the network a slice container and a slice which is a context in Iran chorus life which is a context and personality in core and transfer slices which are the connectivity between ran and core each individual domain has a controller and controller core controller transfer controller and we have an end to an Orchestrator let's get back to the network and see how for example the green infotainment a slice is created in this network the logical flow is I have a customer Honda who needs as an to answer network a slice for infotainment and the budget for SLA is 10 megabit per second customer portal sends a request to operator an operator uses its network a slice blueprints or templates to generate network a slice profile and after that it goes through various decomposition and the triggering various action in the network the first and it does it sends a request to n feo which is creating virtual run visual call or both is needed the second portion is it sends a request to run controller to create run a slice give the personality to run equipment by the same token it sends a request to 5g core controller to create the chorus slice which is a personality in the core and blood last but not least it sends a request to transfer a slice controller to create the connectivity between this ran and core at this point as teaching all these slices creates a single end to a network a slice for a specific customer which is founder a service type that is explained before the role of carrier istrian solution from Nokia is to control for the transfer slice as shown in this picture interface for our five are defined in 3gpp and interface six that is not defined in any sto yet and Nokia is working towards to make that one standard as well this is a network that I'm going to use for a portion of the demo I have a transport network which is connected directing grant to core NSB as a transverse slice controller used for three different use cases automation of transfers lysis monitoring of the transfer slices and optimization in the demo I just show the optimization but these are the three important use case that should be addressed by any transfer of sliced controller during the demo NSP receives various connectivity api's from the northbound during the demo postman is simulating those api's transfers control intelligently receive that message and create services tunnel and lsbase which is needed in the network let's get back to the demo this is an SV launchpad service fulfillment and IP MPLS optimization a service supervision application are used in the concert transfer slices the first rasterize is created for the honda infotainment a service timeline NSSI is 10 and and we showed the optimization how NSP is useful the monitoring of the transfer slices when we inject the latency of 20 millisecond for IGP link we will see that latency is changed and we will see momentarily that reroute happened in the network and other words NSP intelligently monitor transfer slices and we do the reroute if I put the latency back to 2 milliseconds again nothing will happen because in this case that path is still valid unless I go to the reader and after we wrote we will see that NSP again brings back the original path of the LSP in summary couriers in solution from Nokia is addressing the 5g transfer slice in three important areas automation or creation of the transfer slices assurance or monitoring of transverse slices and closed low optimization these are the three main important aspect that should be addressed with any transfer a slice controller thank you for attention hopefully I see you later [Music]
