 hi guys Omarr here with yes 10 plus and if you're receiving nuisance calls and you're blocking the numbers and you think that you caught someone and you want to hide your number just in case or you want to call someone without giving them the opportunity to know your number you're gonna need to hide your number and with yes temp this is how you're doing that this might be the same for other Android users so do check your phone and your heart your what version of Android you're using before you do this it might be the same so you can might be able to use this method as well before I forget subscribe and also hit the bell icon to be notified of any new videos that I post so you go into the core settings supplementary service is what you need and then from here show call ID obviously when you select it is Network default which probably will be to show your to show you your phone number if you hit hide then that will obviously stop people and knowing your number but the thing is that if that other person that you're calling has the function on their phone where if I show you here block numbers block unknown callers so if they've got this function on there properly your phone call won't probably be able to go through because they've blocked unknown numbers so do keep that in mind but thanks for watching guys and I'll see in the next one you
