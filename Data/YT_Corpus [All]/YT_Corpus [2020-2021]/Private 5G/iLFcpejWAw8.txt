 good afternoon good evening depending on where you are I'm really happy to be here I'm currently the director of the Commonwealth cyber initiative and the Bradley professor of cyber security at Virginia Tech and it's an enormous pleasure for me to introduce Linda Doyle because we've been friends for ages and Linda was the person who first invited me to go to Ireland and I ended up staying there for ten years after that so that says something about the country and and in the power of Linda as a colleague and as a friend so Linda was the director of Connect which is the Science Foundation Ireland funded national research center on future networks then when she stepped down from that role she became the vice president of research for Trinity College Dublin she is a huge advocate for spectrum management changes so changes in the way that we manage spectrum and she's currently the chair of the Ofcom spectrum Advisory Board a unique thing about Linda is that her expertise also extends to the creative arts practices so she is the professor of engineering in the arts at Trinity College she's also the chair of the board for the douglas hyde gallery in Dublin she's also the director of to startups and that started with Connect SRS and accelerate so she has a huge in diverse resume every time that I listen to Linda I'm both surprised and inspired so I'm really looking forward to your talk so you have the floor ended thank you very much Luis I'm just going to do a sherry screen and can everybody see yes we can see it okay thank you very Louise thank you very much for the lovely introduction and we miss you very much in Dublin and wish you were still here wish we had the power to keep you here longer than 10 years and and thank you very much also to Vincent Chan for asking me to do this keynote and so it's actually a real treat because in my current role I actually don't at the moment get to talk about things engineering as much as I would like and so before I start I just want to say that I am sorry like Brendan that we weren't able to personally greet people here and this is a picture of front Square and Trinity and when we had an installation there and in the installation you see Samuel Becca's a past student and Leah Kenny a current student who studies Becca's and it's a picture I really love so I put that up there and it is an awful pity we weren't able to meet but the conference seems to be going hugely successfully and I believe there's well over 2,000 people registered for it so and while being online is a second best it's still great that it's gone ahead and there's been so many wonderful speakers and I very much enjoyed Max's talk just now as well so you know sometimes when you get asked to do a keynote you kind of think about the things you know and sometimes I can be a little bit silly and think about oh well I'd like to use the keynote to think about the future and maybe some of the things I don't know enough of and in fact that's what I want to do today and I want to look a little bit beyond 5g and ask the question what should that look like and I know there have been plenty of people this week who've been looking at that and but I want to suggest a different way forward and what I'm suggesting is this idea of 0g so I want to try and persuade you all but you should think about a thing called zero-g whatever that is so and your immediate reaction might be science one second and might be what a Luddite I'm totally against any kind of progress I'm talking about going backwards I'm not interested in technological progress and that would be completely far from the truth I think all of the ideas that are coming up see see are just so interesting and I suppose I want to say to people I'm not talking about going back to the 1980s this is not what I see 0g as I see it as going forward in a very different way and what I'm asking people to do really is to kind of press the reset button and to maybe stand back a bit and to think about what kind of world that we want going forward and and you know when I was thinking about this keynote I think it's a very opportune time for us to say okay where are we now and where would we like to go and to ask that question technically to ask that question in the context of ICC and to ask that question in the context of engineers as engineers computer scientists physicists working in the area of communications and the reason and I suppose it would probably come as no surprise to people that the reason I think now was a very good time are very very obvious reasons you know so the first of that is is of course related to the pandemic and on the one hand you could say scary and difficult as the pandemic has been that the pandemic has been brilliant for networks and connectivity and to a certain extent it's really really really showcased why connectivity being online and being interconnected is so important and of course in showcasing that that's also exacerbated the digital divide and I've been on other panels and ICC where that's come up and I think a key thing has come out of it is that while technology has been a huge help it's not the full solution that we think we get a better sense of how the social cultural and technical all matter and I think a really really good reason why it is to kind of reflect and think is because we are hitting a big recession and we have to understand what a recovery would look like and where we would go next so coupled with that the world is at a very crucial juncture due to climate change and there's extreme climate justice issues high polluting inequalities even more the younger generation I think are leaving us in the pale place by demanding better of us for them and essentially I think we have no choice but to kind of pause take breath and you know think where we to go so what I hope to do in this talk is to persuade to you that we should look at 0g and what I mean by 0g I'm kind of evolving and developing so you could say it could be something about doing zero harm it could be about a carbon neutral footprint it could be about thinking about more than technology but I've kind of been working through what I think the ideas are and for the moment I think it's based around these four things so I'm going to talk about making a material difference using what I call a new Systems Theory doing more with less and driving a new economy and and I'd like to be really interested to hear what people think so making material difference I mean that this this actually is very much when it sounds it's making telecommunication systems materials and resources which are sustainable and this is a really really tall order and I don't know whether people are aware but last year was the year of the periodic table and we actually had various celebrations infinity this is one of the another building and Trinity where there was a periodic table night and this happened around the world and many people may have seen this it's I think it's a very lovely version of the periodic table but it's very much produced last year to emphasize elements that were in limited availability or there was a rising threat or going to be in short supply over the future so I think that really got me thinking and I've been thinking about this a lot in the last while and of course I suppose it's really really well known that a mobile phone contains a huge number of naturally occurring elements including ones that are authorizing threat from increased use so um in thinking through this and in thinking about this and looking at the work that's been done in this area I'm influenced by I suppose a very very wide range of kind of them as sources so one of the people I'm quite influenced by is a guy called OCP Rica and he is this very nice book called an ecology of media and he looks at all of the media and technologies we use and in a much much different way than we do as engineers and computer scientists and and in this particular thing he relates the media to the kind of technological sorry to the geology of the earth and tracks the chemicals and metals and minerals that were in in our media so so I find he came to Trinity a number of years ago and gave a very very compelling talk about his work so find the way he thinks really really interesting and you see that way reflected in the next thing I want to show you which is currently I've been using this and in a few presentations but it's one of my favorite pieces of art that I've seen in a long while so it's you will be able to see it fully from looking at this this is the the complete vision if you were looking at this in real life it's an enormous piece of work that's a you know it's usually in a museum or art gallery and it's called and asked me of an AI system and what Kate Crawford and gladdened jeweler have done is they've taken the Amazon echo and they've broken down every single fish almost every element that's in it every piece of work that goes into it how its trained the work that's done professionally the work that's done kind of maybe a little bit more invisibly and it's an amazing I just think it's beautiful to look at and it's amazing to explore and there's an essay that goes with us and there's a couple of things that they bring out in the essay and I just have some of the comments here you know so they talk about each object of of the extenders a eye system and from network routers to batteries to microphones is built using elements that require billions of years to produce and I think it's really powerful the way they express that and and they really talk about time in an interesting way and and they say looking from the perspective of deep time we are extracting Earth's history to serve a split second of technological time in order to build devices that are often designed to be used for no more than a few years and I think this is just a position of these timelines is really really interesting so the essay is very very beautiful and I'd recommend that people would read it and and I've just zoomed in to a number of points here and they to bring out this thing of using earth's resources and you'll see how we have a used more rare earth elements over time and in a single iPhone there's five elements and that the current citizen uses way more than in the last entry you know the kinds of things that we know and and if you zoom in in other bits they also go into the detail of what's involved in extracting those elements from the earth so what they do is they painted a really powerful picture there you see parikh and many many others of I suppose the supply chain and what happens along that supply chain in developing the materials for all of the media that we use so if you look around the world and you ask what's been done in this third third there's a number of different examples one of the one that I find very powerful at the moment comes from a company called fair phone and fair phone actually you know tries to live by a set of principles that allows us to create more sustainable devices so as this diagram shows at a very simple level you're able to take this apart and fix it they focus on recycling but they also focus on the supply chain and how sustainable that is and I was really struck when I looked at one of the projects they did through the EIT raw materials kick and with other companies and that even in just taking one element where they looked at in there were so many different nuances and understanding how they could actually source that and use that in a in a sustainable way but it's really really it gives you a really deep understanding of the depth of complexity that is involved and even aiming to do something sustainable there's many other projects that they've done and this is very very interesting where they look at all the different materials and a phone I've just blown up the head the headlines there where they look at you know whether it can be recycles the estimated depletion rates its association of water our so in pollution and they raised all of the elements and they've done a lot of work would they take each of these and they dig further and they check whether there's potential for you to do different and new things and I just put up one of there and this is about M cobalt and it's from one of their reports and where they look at how sustainable it is and where does that come from and really really dig deep so I think the whole point of this is to just give you a sense that and you know making a simple statement like I want to look at the Tyrion's at which telecommunication systems are made from and I want to move towards a place where they're sustainable is hugely an overly complex and just like our networks I suppose are connected connect the universe and connect us in so many different ways this is a highly intricate web of how we're doing things of the way things work and you really need to get into all aspects of that web to really I suppose make progress and change there's lots of other ways of doing this and I came across this interesting paper where it looked at whether you could actually take the materials that were really rare and you could use advances in material science to actually replace them so in this paper that I've referenced here it's by a group of researchers and Chalmers and they study different metals and then they look at nanomaterials based on carbon and carbon is in abundance and they look at things like graphene and carbon nanotubes and they've asked the question is it possible to take these materials that we see in phones and use alternative materials that are made for things that are more available and it's really really interesting they're fun 14 different metals where there's potential and there's a lot more work to do in this area and there's also a lot more work to think about and when we design things how we actually stop using particular things and I suppose just don't use metals in the first place so bringing this section to a close and taking a material difference it is without a doubt and that if we wanted to look for it and create a 0g that we felt was about sustainable materials that it is exceptionally complex it really does up and how we do business it requires enormous transparency and enormous cooperation and you'd have to ask you know kind of world cope with that but I do think it's a noble goal and and it would be interesting to think that something we're talking about if the future would be synonymous with kind of sustainability and I think it's also throws up many issues around what does it mean to talk about the physical layer I know the physical layer has a very specific meaning for us and in an ICC and then come suck but I think the physicality of objects need to increasingly feature in our discussion so that's the first first thing so the second element of 0g for me is using a new Systems Theory and what I mean by this is I want to take a systems approach to thinking about how telecommunications infrastructure sits within the built and natural environment so I'm just going to take a little while to explain this and come at this from a few different angles so essentially and when we create infrastructure and especially if you look at 5g I mean the infrastructure penetrates the city is on every piece of street furniture and we also have them for structure obviously in rural areas and so I want to think about that more I suppose holistically so what I don't mean is the following and I came across this very funny picture of a fake tree and antenna so I'm not talking about thinking about how infrastructure and the natural and physical world come together because we want to hide things I want to stand back and ask things a little bit more systematically so what I mean is something like this so this is a very inspiring piece of work by an architect called Larry Lister and Alex I thought as a Symetra and they actually are using basically a big large hole in the ground for a data center to that heat water that's a public resource as well and they they have this kind of architecture of ecology where they think kind of more holistic the-- so this kind of hints of the kind of thing I'm thinking of and another interesting example I came across this young researcher in Trinity Cody and Donna who and now he's working actually as it turns out on wind turbines and he comes from a biodiversity background and rather than think of the wind turbine as something you just plunk on a landscape he thinks of the landscape completely and he thinks about the opportunities for carbon sequestering pollination wide life biodiversity etc etc and looks at all of the holistic lis together and he makes really really strong arguments about how you can design a system the system being the wind turbine and the land and the spaces in and that actually has mitigation options for a species habitats and stability and I think this kind of systematic way of thinking is very very interesting and something that doesn't currently exist when we think of telecommunications infrastructure whether that be in the city or whether it be in roarin areas so to stress the point further what I thought I would do is I would take a little step backwards and I know people are probably going to think I'm about to overthrow capitalism at this point but I just I just give the next example so this is a very very interesting cyberneticist because I Stafford beer when Stanford beer was popular he was he worked in the 1970s and he the diagram on the right hand side is called the from a book called the brain of the firm and Stafford beer and I think a very very interesting character but one of the most interesting projects that he did was he did in Chile and Allende actually and together with an engineer called friend Fernando Flores advice of him to Chile to help them manage and Chile's economy economy and he created this project called cybersyn and what you see on the left-hand side there is the control room that was created in Chile to manage completely the economy of Chile and 99% invisible it's one of my most favorite podcasts and there is a fantastic sort of listen and hear a bit more but what's really really striking about his project and I've taken out these points from a really interesting and paper about it is that in Stafford beer if you look at the points that were in his system I just go through them a little bit so first of all he had a thing called cyber stride it was a system to collect performance indicators from production plants he did thing called cyber net which is about communicating with everybody and he was talking about communicating with individuals with companies with governments with everybody and he had a thing called I think checkol which is some kind of model to model the Chilean economy and then he had the operations room that I just showed you and they were trying to do all of this and I believe there are only two computers in Chile at the time and they were using lots of telex machines and but what you actually really have here is an Internet of Things explanation where you want to get in from Asian from something you want to control this in some kind of productive way and you want to kind of take action and accept what we have here is somebody trying to do this in a much wider sense where you're not just thinking about the technical elements that we normally talk about but you're thinking of the kind of wider landscape you're thinking about the wider society and you're kind of working from that perspective so what I want to conclude from this is that I'm not suggesting because I don't think and you know it's no surprise that the cyber said never took off and I'm not suggesting we completely model telecoms infrastructure in nature and society in fact actually lots of times when I feel engineers are computer sciences they're mathematicians suggests that we can model everything or suggest we can the modeled motions I would be very very skeptical of that but I am suggesting that we need to move to a more holistic way of thinking about how we conceptualize and design telecoms infrastructure and I am suggesting that we need to bring different disciplines into that mix and that's exactly what I mean by a new Systems Theory that the systems go beyond the telecommunications networks that we know and increasingly edge into the other spaces and think more holistically about that and the Stafford area I suppose I was using it provocatively to say ok here is a way of thinking and can we even use some of that to think about how we think about telecommunication systems going forward so that's the second second element of 0d the third element the 0g is about doing more with less and and and focusing on making more with less resources and especially in s data as I suppose what I want to say here so we've all done here in this conference and there are many many papers that exist already and there's many projects in the past like green touch where there's been huge focus on how we do more with less how we reduce energy consumption and I couldn't pass up putting in a spectrum reference because you know you can't have a presentation with that picture of this oness as as we all know if you're into spectrum I mean my entire interest in dynamic spectrum access and spectrum management is all about something that is a scarce resource and making it go round more making more out of the resource by treating it as dynamically and and you know and working with it that way so as engineers and computer scientists and researchers this is all from what it's about and and again as I said there's just tons of papers that could fall under this heading in this in this conference but I think where we're at now is very much about doing more with less data and this is really really challenging and even when I was listening to to Max's talk just before mine and the types of applications he was talking about in the 5g space and the way they use data I think we need to think very very seriously about this now I I'm hugely influenced by a book called the age of surveillance Catalan capitalism by Shoshana Sabbath and many people here will know this book this book and this term surveillance capitalism I suppose it was she introduced it in 2014 and but it's garnet I suppose a lot more chat and discussion in the last year's and I've just put down a few points but surveying his capitalism here for people who might not be familiar with the term so you know she talks about surveillance capitalism unilaterally claiming human experiences for your raw material you know for translation into behavioral data and creation of often without our explicit consent new products and I think this is really really really important and surveillance capitalism it draws attention to different things I mean it really really I suppose makes the point that data scan gather gathers in exchange for services we get you know it is not free to Google something you're actually exchanging your currency is the data and it seeks to draw attention to the fact that the data gathering happens at a massive scale and as a systematic scale and and for things that were not aware of and many people here will be familiar with this in the context of elections and the manipulation of data and the understand kind of at the patterns of behavior we have in order to kind of influence us to vote from particular ways so I think a loss of the challenge around understanding the data that has been gathered by people and the scale at which has been gathering it's been gathered at and there is a kind of growing awareness of this and if you look at even the covert 19 situation and the track and trace I suppose discussions that are happening a lot of those are influenced by people's attitude to data even if they know that ultimately there's something kind of good that could come out of a tracking train system so I think we really do need to think about the amounts of data we're gathering and you do see lots of research now where people are looking at AI and actually trying to use ma AI techniques that require less data I just put a few here and it's no means the case that these people aren't necessarily motivated by the same reason I am by the surveillance capitalism they can be motive buy motivated by many many other reasons but here for example there is a catch by and technique that's able to use you know that by comparison if you use the convolution in neural network you need 50,000 more and larger data set so you see this everywhere you see great examples about you know robots can use and can learn from generalized sorry can learn to generalize from a few small examples and there's opportunities in many many areas where machine learning is applied not least because often times people don't have the datasets they want but also motivated very much by this kind of questioning of the data that we give up and issues around privacy so the conclusion I draw from bass is doing more with less as a natural part of everything we do but more with less data is needed more than ever and given that data is such a currency in the world that we use this also really opens the world Rinne and is majorly disruptive and if we are going this route of 0g is going to be about this or if I can persuade you that it shows you know there's a lot love to look at so the final and the fourth element of the 0dg is what I'd called driving a new economy and I've labeled this an industrial technological ethical and ecological revolution and I came across and you'll see I suppose through this I have used some aren't examples and here is another one I came across the same this little installation and it's called welcome to the Museum of the fossilized Internet and I'm going to gonna read out some of the things that are written here in case people can't see them and it says the museum was founded in 2050 to commemorate two decades of a fossil free internet and to invite museum's visitors to experience the coal and oil powered Internet of 2020 gasps but the horrors of surveilling capitalism not knowingly at the plague of spam be baffled at the size of AI training data and lament binge culture of video streaming and I think it's a really really interesting way to kind of put yourself into the future and to kind of look back and question what are we doing now so I bring that up in that context and so the way I kind of I'm looking at things at the moment we're at the fourth Industrial Revolution and when you look at all of those industrial revolutions those industrial revolutions even though the fourth one attempts to a certain extent to bring the human into the space and thinks about the human and even though the fourth Industrial Revolution includes the kind of internet of things and you see the embedding of instruments in the environment around us so we better understand it it still is very industry oriented and that's what I really mean by you know I suppose going further and pushing towards this industrial technological ethical and ecological revolution so a question I think that would pop up when I say that is the following and I thought this was a funny and newspaper about Theresa May and where they asked was she desperate deluded and doomed and I'm sure that many people listening to this could ask me the same a my desperate deluded and dooms to think that the kinds of things and I'm bringing up here which very much challenge how we build that works the materials we use how we use data and thereby challenge everything that the economy is based on is this a completely stupid idea so I want to try answer that and in the last few slides and the first thing I would say with that is if you look around the world at the moment you see many people interested in this notion of ESG so ESG is a thing called environmental social and governance and basically what happens in this context these are a set of criteria that companies can and metrics have been developed so a company can say how good they essentially are at ESG and there's lots of interesting things to read here is one that was developed by a particular company and and they actually created a kind of ESG understanding in the context of sustainable sustainable development goals and and companies are able to get rated on this basis so I thought it would be good to call the Financial Times as a reference here and and I read a really interesting article actually during the week about how ESG passes the Cova challenge and and the point that they're making in this article is that a lot of companies that very got a boost in investment because they scored well on this ESG level and and people would have expected those kinds of companies and to not continue to do well in a you know global pandemic in a recession or where things were challenged and in fact actually they're appearing to do really really well and the ESG labeling has not actually lost it's kind of I suppose attractiveness now that the article also like any good article points out the things that are challenging about ESG and I think it's good to read that but ultimately I think what it's saying is that even in a traditional world of stocks and shares of of investment that the kind of notion that something is striving to have better environmental societal and governance type behavior and matters there's also a lot of carrots to play for and you'll also see things like the European Green Deal investment that is really really pushing and a kind of new way of doing things and kind of new I suppose new businesses a new green economy and things like the just transition mechanism which is all about making sure that when you actually change and your behavior and move I suppose into a different way of doing things and might be penalized but there's a way of kind of helping that in that context as well so and of course there is the voice I suppose from the younger generation asking us and pleading with us and begging us to make sure we're not destroying their future so um my conclusion on this bit is that I'm not saying ESG is the way to go and the CSG labeling or that it's without flaws or that can't be manipulated by people to get what they want but I am saying that the fact that people actually use ESG metrics to influence investments shows that a zero g concept could have a future even with in conventional markets even though I also think there's plenty more for us to think about in the circular economy and in terms of moving to new directions so I'm very nearly coming to the end of this I just have a small few more points to make I thought I might just briefly say what we kind of infinity are trying to do in response to this kind of an approach not not to do with telecom specifically just to mention so we are currently working on what we call the grand canal innovation district which is developing a part of our campus which for us is in the heart of what we call the silicon docks in Dublin so in Dublin there is lots of companies from around the world lots of multinationals lots of headquarters and part of Trinity is based in the center of one of these districts and our plan is to build this out and answer to divert to develop this this whole district and at the centre of this district one of the things we're planning is a new research institute that would kind of drive a lot of the I suppose innovation and the collaboration and the deep partnership about that might happen there and Institute and I just have one slide on this is called the engineering environment and emerging technologies institution and it's very much based on this all idea that we can make technical progress we can focus on the next generation of whatever technical areas were looking at while at the same time not destroying the natural capital of the world we understand that the natural capital delivers ecosystems goods and services that keep economic activity going but we also understand that economic activity and how society thrives can have impact by from natural capital and what we're doing here is we're trying to I suppose cut the divides between some of the areas that I spoke to you before so one of the things we're doing we're bidding researchers from Natural Sciences from zoology and botany together with engineers and computer scientists and social sciences we're taking a challenge based approach where we look at problems from a challenge perspective we're working in deep partnership and we're creating a lot of shared resources that that industry academia and others can use and that's our attempt I suppose to break down the barriers between what we eat and what I may be described here are kind of slightly different worlds that need to come together more so then just to summarize and I think the way I've described 0tr my version of zero-g here is daunting there's probably many people here who think that doesn't make any sense or you know you know who might not agree with the proposition or where we're going I think though even if you don't agree with the proposition I think it's really time for us not to let 6ji just be everything we promised in 5g and didn't get around to delivering plus a few more things so even if you hate or disagree or contest anything in the proposition of zero-g I think it would be really really good to think and what we really want from the next generation I think the other thing that I think is really really important is and it's something that I struggle to fully understand and how we can cope with so it's really important that we continue to have engineers and computer sizes and physicists who are all good at those discipline but increasingly it's the case that the kinds of challenges we face are so complex and require so much different input but I think it asks us to question where we are and where we are as a communication society where we are as group of people interested in communications and the kind of an additional input we need from my perspective can't be tagged on to the end it has to be interpreted so thank you very much for listening and if anybody has any questions I'm happy to answer if they want to get in contact I'm happy with that too so thank you thank you very much Linda as I mentioned in the introduction you as expected you inspired me and surprised me at the same time as usual we have a few questions and then starting from this question of how do we get there right so this is a call to arms and you you address a little bit of that but there may not be the financial incentives for telecom operators for example to go in that direction there's a lot of inertia towards 6g being what you describe that it shouldn't be so do we need more regulation or is what what are the stakes to get us to 0g so it's I mean that's a very hard question and I think it's complicated and I also think it's different in different parts of the world I think there's a kind of different European view then there might be a u.s. view then there might be an Asian view and so I mean the view in Europe is very much that they try to incentivize us by you know ensuring that for example when horizon horizon Europe the framework that follows horizon 2020 is very very much focused on things like this it hopes to incentivize I'm not saying Serie G specifically but hopes to in said incentivize this kind of behavior and the kind of research that it supports and a kind of the funds that it has for the green economy and I certainly don't think and I certainly don't think people will do this if they can get away with not doing it so I do think increasingly there has to be a bit of a regulation role in this as well if you read I mean I suppose I would say I am a disgrace myself in the sense that I haven't bought a fair phone yet but if you do read and deeply read and the practices that lead to the the material goods are there the phones and devices we have now we should all that should be enough to make us take action but it doesn't so I think regulation will also be needed as well you mentioned that your thought that maybe the audience was might might disagree with some of this so I'm going to share with you something that was shared only with the panelists by one of our audience members who said goodness we need more women in engineering and Sciences to save man from self-destruction so that you know the kind of reaction that you're in Gendry so there was also a question about the pandemic so isn't the lesson of the pandemic that data usage is exploding for more services but two main deeds needs 10 times more data and rather than once so it's that's a very good question and and it is a double-edged sword so I fully believe for example you know in personalized medicine that the more information you get about more people that the more precise diagnosis that you can make and you know individual treatments that you can get and but so it's all it is challenging I think what has to stop happening is without a doubt the use of your data without any awareness of what it's going to be used for I think that happens through numerous different ways it happens through education and greater awareness and you know the phrase surveillance capitalism is now much more common usage phrase then it had been so those kind of things helped but it also happens through true technology and through technology you know controlling use of data and I think the challenge is and I can I am I know Declan is on the panel as well but the challenges so if you look across the the world there the areas in the world that are tighter about data and where for example GDP or exists which I actually happen to think GDP are ultimately has a lot of and are the ones that sometimes then end up innovating less because they don't have the freedom in areas where there were people I suppose are allowed take more liberties with data and I think we do actually have to get that right and you know it's a tricky question so I I certainly think I mean I suppose for me and maybe there is no way around this because you can say you can only I mean creativity and innovation comes by people appropriating things but for me for example I wouldn't want to give up all my personal data to have a better shopping experience but I would be interested in it in the context of a medical experience and we don't currently have a way of being able to say yes or no to that kind of thing and we should and I think there are technical solutions there as well um I want to touch on this cross-disciplinary aspects of what it gets to to get to zero dream there was a question around that so the question was what are some of the the skills the cross-disciplinary skills that are needed to get there and I meant that question with them we've been talking about multidisciplinary in transistor energy for a while and I think it's more and more clear that we need it and again how do we get to that as a scientific community so I think I think so I have a couple of suggestions and I'm sure there are many more so if you look at the I Triple E let's just take that as an example so the I Triple E has a publication of you know and engineering and society or I can't actually I might have the wrong name of it there but you know it's something separate it's something over there it's not something that's that that's part and I certainly know that Vincent Chance planned for contact is it is to integrate things more and I think that is really really powerful so first of all things can't always be separate however the big challenge is that it's very hard you can't have everybody like I sometimes think I'm you know I am a jack-of-all-trades and I'm a master of nothing because I have an interest in a wide range of things and this is the challenge with this always how do we still have the skill and the deep knowledge that we have and at the same time have the breadth that I think is needed for the future of communication systems I'd say there is no shortcut to spending time with people from different disciplines there's no shortcut to that having to be informal as well as formally organized and I think some of it might might mean you'd say okay what should other societies and the I Triple E look like going forward or should there be something else in Comstock that allows this kind of thinking in more systematically and maybe I'll add one of the things I used to be very involved in in I Triple E dice van and I've brought together regulation and technology and and I really like this at the beginning because sessions have both regulation and technology and as we say the mainstream sessions but then what would happen is they'd split into two and all the regulatory people who go into one and all the technical people who go into the other and they wouldn't be talking to each other enough when they were both in their separate sessions so I think you actually have to orchestrate the coming together of the different disciplines much more constructively much more formally much more regularly if you want the kind of dialogue to happen and you also have to I think work on how people speak the vocabulary they use and how they understand each other oh maybe one very quick last question from the audience do you think that making wireless networks more intelligent so in bed amore I will actually worsen their environmental footprint and not necessarily so so I think I think there are lots of examples so when people talk to about smart homes are smart to anything or smart cities first there's always an environmental bitterness and there's an AI a bit mad as well and however what I think would worsen it is if you go away in your own box as an engineer and you come up with an AI solution and you've never spoken to somebody who's an environmental scientist or who is you know a botanist are who is from a different discipline and only at the end you go over to that person and say look what I've done I think that'll worsen it but if you actually from the beginning kind of understand because I think there's all sorts of really colorful things that I can do and if you understand the root of the problem more clearly and the various impacts you can you know AI can do what we wanted to do and it reminds me I was on the synergy panel with Vincent and and it is you know you know it is about different voices working together and we were talking there about industry and academia coming together but it is about the different voices listening to each other at the right time and in the research process and not at the end and I suppose that's what I would say so AI has huge amount to offer but we need to think through us or mystically thank you very much Linda we have more questions but we're out of time I'm not going to offer like Brendon usually does to take you out for Guinness because I know you don't like it but then I see you we have a I usually go bright Reds in front of an audience when I'm giving a talk and I've now discovered even when I can only see five people I still go bright red so I have the experience of feeling I felt like I'm talking to loads of people one way or the other so thank you very much Lisa and thank you for this everybody explain that and back
