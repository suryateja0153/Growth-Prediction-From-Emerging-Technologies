 welcome everyone I'm Ricky fan TechTalk and this is an important video that I always like to make I have a passion for technology as you know and being visually impaired accessibility is really key to me having the accessibility features on a device to use at all times is fantastic so today we've got the brand-new Huawei P30 Pro and we're going to put it through its paces making sure it has all the accessibility features to make sure it's possible for you to use no matter your ability to sit back and enjoy and if you have any questions drop a comment down below to start off with you don't actually need to even go into the menus even before actually using your first accessibility feature so what you need to do is press and hold both volume keys and talkback will turn on and you can use that service so let me show you so down the right-hand side first of all you're going to notice you volume keys are at the top and then you put your power button in the middle the power button does have like a red shine through it which is nice to identify that there is no textual difference which is a shame so if I press and hold both these volume keys here together okay that's how simple and quick and easy it was to use so talkback it's a great feature when you first do this for the first ever time it will take you into a tutorial so you can learn how to use talkback the navigation the tap system and how it works but what it will do is actually read everything out aloud to me now so if I want to know the time touch to our city current temperature so I know the time I know my location as well if I wanted to put in the web app you could also do this for your widgets up here at the top so I have my network ones up here at the top I have all them up there I also have my battery battery 70% and also again 30 10 I can get the time up there as well also for all of my applications and I can go into an application gallery double tap to activate double tap and hold to long press so you can either do a long press or you can double tap trail a gallery doesn't have to activate and as you can see you can see all of my photographs in here I want to go far to activate double tap and hold to long press so you can navigate through your device with two fingers screen two of three then I've got all of my applications here Instagram screen one of three then to power off just press and hold them volume keys again talkback is now on but then you can use that device as much as you want also you've noticed as well the gesture control system has come back when talkback is on you get your three dedicated buttons down here at the bottom so that's a really good feature and I really like talk back again you can go into the menu as I'm going to show you now and it's in the accessibility menu but you could use that quick shortcut if you wanted to and I think that's a really great feature that they have on these devices now so to find all of your settings what you need to do is tap on settings which is the gear icon go all the way down to the bottomless they'll put it near the bottom which is a shame so if we go down here bottom and can't fall from bottom one two three four it's called smart assistant it's orange in color tap on this this is where you get a whole range of options but the one we're gonna mainly look at is accessibility I'm gonna go through all the options through that menu but my main focus is accessibility as you know so at the top is talkback and I've already gone through that but you can go through that you can set it up and use it how much you want to underneath that is a select to speak feature so if I toggle this on I'm gonna hit okay down here at the bottom and you will need your menu options up for this to get this icon because you need this little accessibility man I press him here then press play navigator select your speed select to speak more settings about when selector speak is on you can tap specific items on your screen to hear them aloud so it will read through things that you pacifically want it to read through so if I press it again and then press up here selector speak it's just spoken what I've actually wanted it to speak again if I show you again and then go up here 13:40 it will just tell me what I'd want you to do instead of navigating and speaking everything back to you like talkback does not visually impaired people that do have a little bit so I use this more than what they would talk back again another great feature I'm really pleased to see it's on this device underneath that is text-to-speech so inside here this is where you can change your speech rate and your pitch and can make it a little bit quicker here if I wanted to I can change the pitch here it depended on my choice also you've got google text-to-speech engine then you have other options down here as well that you can change and adjust if you so want to depending on your choices well it's all about your choice of making it your device underneath that is the ability to use mono audio if you prefer to listen in mono audio or that is all you can hear underneath that is captions and this is where you can caption certain stuff so if I turn captions on here you can see the subtitle box come up here you can change and adjust your language obviously you can then change other bits as well you can have a small you can have large depending on your choice and then you can have style as well so a lot of people prefer this option again very nice to see that inside here given people the ability to use that underneath that is color correction so you can turn this on then obviously you can go through the different color options here depending on your difficulty in seeing a color again it's really nice that they have these options inside here and then it's press cancel okay underneath that is the magnification so if I turn on magnification one two three three quick taps brings up the large display here and I've got actually white text on a black background because I've darkened the menu options and that's a really good thing and I will show you how to do that so I can navigate around my device here very simple I can pinch in as far as I want one two three and I'll come back there is another way of doing this as well if I do one two three and then hold on third one I can then just never go very quickly jumped in for you when releasing it'll jump back again good options to have there underneath that is a large-mouth pointer so you can use a mouse pointer with this device if you struggle to use your fingers or hands to interact with your device I think that is color inversion so color inversion will take you back this way but it will totally change the menu as well so it makes the menu look very different here if we come back in go back here and then if I juggle that off it makes it a lot easier for me to read underneath that is high contrast text so it makes the text a little bit older and a little bit easier to read as well you'll notice there the actual underneath text is a little bit easier to read which is the plain thing here underneath that is advanced visual effects so if you toggle this off when you get something it just does it automatically there's no sort of shuffle or no massive dramas about it but turn it on and then you'll see there's nothing different but it can produce the flash or like the pop of the device so it can help you if you want to do that also so coming into interaction control options here you have switch access this gives you ability using switches and other devices to actually interact with your smartphone which is a great option and I'm really pleased to see that on here so you could use game controls you can do different interaction devices to interact with your device I'm so pleased to see that on here that's coming on to majority of devices now you got accessibility shortcut which is set to talkback and I showed you how to use that you've got touch and hold delayed you've also got click after cursor stops moving as if you were using a mouse or using an interaction device then at the bottom you've got power button to end full serve by ten rounds to the right-hand side that's the one that has the read sort of mark through it and that's where you can use them to angel pools which is a great option to coming back so underneath accessibility is high touch so what this does it gives you the ability to do shopping either double tap on the screen and it will read the image that's on the screen and show you where it can be bought on Amazon only works through Amazon or you can use the camera as well and it will go and find something for you you have one hand you I so want a bold on you can have one hand you I if I swipe down here at the bottom there we go it's down this side right this white and then go the other side as well and there's two different options there to use but obviously if I go home here you can see I've got one hand UI and I can navigate majority of my screen here and move around if I so wish to which is really nice and easy to do to underneath that you've got shortcut and gestures so you've got Google System which you can toggle on or off here and that's when you press and hold the power button you got take screenshots so inside here this is where you double tap you knuckle there we go you'll take a screenshot for you quite cool gesture then you got record screen as well as when you use two knuckles you've got split screen this is where you draw a line draw a line like that I can then choose an application here like Facebook and then that will load my Facebook for me there then I can change and adjust the size of the grid as well again very simple and very easy to do you've got wait screen here so this is where you raise it up and it wake it up to pick up and also doesn't tap so that will then wake up the device for me so mute ringtone or reduce volume this is where you flip over and flip over to reduce which is a really cool feature and then once you pick it up it's gonna reduce the volume as well and it's awesome you've got answer calls so take it you're here or actually answer your quote again good options to use if you don't want touch your device all of the time underneath that is voice control so with slim voice control again you got quick call in articles with voice control you've got a point for passing call so it will tell you speech commands language down here at the bottom and offline broadcasting as well if you're in the area without the signal the loads of different options on here and that really like that underneath that it's a smart cover so if you have smart cover for your device you can use a smart cover you have miss touch prevention so it will try and detect when you miss touch something up here that's not as true as what I am doing gonna touch down here again good feature to have on in case you accidentally touch your device and you can mean to also you have glove mode so you can use gloves with your device that's a really good thing bottom you have scheduled power on and off if you want to schedule a dedicated time for powering your device on and off but you're actually powering it on and off all the time then at the bottom you've got system navigation I talked about this so I like the gesture suggest your control is really good and you can shows you how to use it so you can swipe to go back here they'll say swipe to go this way which is good but if you want to use any of the actual features I showed you an accessibility you do need the three capacitive touch buttons along the button to pull and how old that'll take you in to open applications so it's quite easy to use if you actually want to use any of the accessibility options you'll have to use the three key navigation down here at the bottom you can actually go in here and select which ones you want to use and obviously when you need a certain feature the accessible man will come up so loads of options on here and I'm so pleased to see that there's one final feature that I just want to talk about and I have previously mentioned that is the ability to dark and the menu options inside your menu here as you can see mine is black with a white text and then obviously I've still got the same color app icons which is really good and I really like that is just a shame again it's in a different location so what you need to do is go into battery and in battery if you come down here to the bottom you've got darken interface colors so once this is toggled off if I toggle this off it's just gonna then go into this white and very bright and very vibrant sort of background which is okay but to be honest I prefer the darker mode it just makes it easier to use it makes easy to read as well and it really works really well and you get to see the same colors and those colors have distorted either you get to experience your device how while wait wants you to experience and enjoy emui and obviously Android as well I just want to thank you into one other section and that is display so insight display which is here there's a green one this is where you can change your brightness or you put automatic brightness you've got color mode and temperature sir you can change an adjustable color mode near so it's a vivid at the moment or you can go normal the choice is yours and you can change and adjust this depending on what options that you want also inside here is sleep so if you need a long time looking in your device set it to 10 minutes and then obviously that will impact on your battery but you can let it look around with vitamin actually going to sleep which could be a little bit annoying also under here is eye comfort as it has been to broil and actual certification use that it helps with your eyes and you can have the night mode as well where it really dims the blue lights and you can enjoy your device then you have text and display signs I've really wished that this was in the accessibility options the text size and then you have windows up here at the top where you can see and also you have display size which could be a little bit bigger as well and you can choose which ones you want to use and again you have presets here to look at before hands so I could take text down really small you can go smaller as well if you want if you want to make it smaller you can do the choices are yours and I really do like and give you so many choices so screen resolution so I've got mine set to smart you can have it set to HD Plus or HD plus choices are yours to choose from also one other thing to just finish off is simple mode so you can have simple making if I am neighbor so it makes it very basic and very easy to do making the icons a lot bigger takes away a lot the applications as well it's makes it quite simple and very easy to use again a good feature for people that who are elderly and maybe wanting a more easier device to use through and move through but to turn this off we're going to go into settings come down to the bottom zoom or setting to go back into the display or in simple mode and exit we're gonna exit out simple okay now we're back into our normal accessibility options here that we can use so let's go back in we're gonna go back into display you've got an always-on display which is really good so finally not for my device here you can see the time I see my battery percentage and also I will see notifications to come up so quick tap laughing for in sensor which is light
