 as 5g becomes a reality it's critically important for operators to evolve and develop their network architecture to one that is containerized flexible and fully cloud native this 5g core network architecture can't just be a one-size-fits-all network it needs a tailored approach for each use case such as network slicing or fixed mobile integration can have its own performance attributes latency throughput availability on-demand scalability and use these attributes to match unique business models mavenir's 5g core addresses carrier-grade requirements such as high availability security quality and performance while running on open source cloud native software components in public private and hybrid clouds unlike traditional hardware based networks all mavenir 5g core functions are implemented as micro services running in containers using a service based architecture to achieve web scale agility with 5g enabled control and user plane separation operators can deploy the user plane closer to the edge which uses distributed architecture to enable flexible network deployment and operation this makes the network highly flexible highly scalable and highly programmable enabling distribution of services to the edge for low latency applications and offload of high bandwidth applications the Mavenir 5g core combines a fully containerized 4G EPC functionality and offers a converged mobile core solution support existing 4g subscribers while deploying new commercial grade 5g use cases with the right platform the possibilities are endless and mavenir is leading the way
