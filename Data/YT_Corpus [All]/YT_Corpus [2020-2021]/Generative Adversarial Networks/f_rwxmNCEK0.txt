 [Music] deep learning has become a phenomena which we cannot ignore so a lot of an empirical success which brings up the interest of understand from in the fundamental way wireless network why they did extremely well so many applications so to answer this question we feel that we look at this problem from different angles and most likely the brief su is coming from the interdisciplinary activities so those area include the statistical thinking of include mathematical thinking like a vaccination theory in the comments and maybe involve a lot of computational thinking like a computational mass the organism designed algorithms why some of it is a gradient based method people are very very interesting the scientists you know and the pharmaceutical companies the biotech companies they are developing several methods for example for our data analysis for finding biomarkers or you know like designing novel drugs that could be more targeted more personalized more precision medicine right for those to happen efficiently we need to develop lots of times so what husband has happened in the policy yes he is there were a lot of trial and error methods just because there were nothing better than that but people have understood the value of the information they understood the datasets that we gather from different passes from different experiments are extremely useful to guide us towards the right direction we don't have to throw you know turn in the dark anymore we can use those data to essentially help us move towards the right path the best thing about this conference was that I heard a lot of speakers from a lot of backgrounds so I understood some topics from the statistical background some from pure optimization background and also computer scientists who are in extensive image data sets so this was the best thing to look at it from different kind of point of views I've been able to while I'm here just learn more about deep learning in a more theoretical sense that GTRI we do a lot of Applied Research but that doesn't mean that you still need that theoretical foundation and so there was basically just like a research retreat for me I had the opportunity to go deeper into the theoretical aspects of some of the algorithms that I will be applying what I returned to it and I'm also really excited about the working groups I signed up for the teaching working group so teaching deep learning I think that's really important is being able to teach something before you apply it and I think that the deliverables that we have from this particular working group will be something that will make a long lasting contribution to the literature so when I look out for the program I was more interested in the interpretation of the learning because I work as a graduate assistant where I lead consultant lab and most importantly I need to interpret my models and we know deep learning is more about more or less a black boss model so interpretation is what attracted me I stumbled on a deep learning meetup group actually and I signed up for that and they sent me the same C link a few weeks before the program started and I signed up for I thought my purpose to be of create opportunity because it's right here I have a couple of people I knew at UNC I talked to them and they have done in Sam say before great forest is one of them who is been I think in organizing 3d as well so I talked to him and he said it is a great program and I said okay I want to learn about the fundamentals of the program because so I signed up the reason was to understand the basic methodology part because we know that data that we get from patients from drug trials are not homogeneous they are not you know always simple and linear so I wanted to first understand the methodologies so that I could actually apply it according to the problem the question they're asking yes I think I'm I think it this is a definite productivity Kanaan you have three days of the lectures I think of those lectures are really high quality they are very clear and they represent the other advance the research of the frontiers or say research areas and also at the same time because the speakers are saying intentionally also thinking about how to apply the seraphic development to towards generating a solid foundation for the deep learning so they also have already started crossing the disciplinary boundaries to try to connect with a lot of disciplines so I I think the the the thoughts are very inspiring and kind of pointing to the direction with any edge and also I interact with some of the participants so so far the responses I got a very positive I think this is a productive so this workshop is very good workshop its sigh I was so happy to see more statisticians have been on board to contribute to the D plan in action I will encourage everybody who is interested in the different of Marceline to come on board and let's join hand hostage it's here to stay and we have to make it have to make sure that it's going to be more efficient and how do we make it more efficient if the statisticians yes come on board I think we can all make it [Music] you
