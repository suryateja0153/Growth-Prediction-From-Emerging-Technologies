 we propose v2v a comprehensive pipeline for variable selection and translation for multivariate time varying data our approach contains feature learning translation graph construction and variable selection to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach we compare histogram matching pixel to pixel and cyclegan to evaluate variable translation in addition we also compare an information aware framework to evaluate variable selection
