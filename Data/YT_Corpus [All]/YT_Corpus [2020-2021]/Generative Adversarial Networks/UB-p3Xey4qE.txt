 [Tiffany] Hi Oliv', how are you doing? [Olivier] Hi, great! [Tiffany] I brought some croissants [Tiffany] Do you want some? [Olivier] Sure! [Olivier] I'm gonna put them in here [Tiffany] Ok! [Olivier] Hi Tiffany! [Tiffany] Hi Olivier! [Olivier] Well, if I am actually talking to Tiffany... [Olivier] I am asking as you are going to talk about a complex topic today on how we can mislead Machine learning algorithms to make them think things are something different than what they actually are [Tiffany] Exactly, well, to be more precise, we will actually be talking about Artificial Neural Networks and GAN, Generative Adversial Networks [Olivier] Ok [Tiffany] Let's start with GAN [Olivier] Ok, GAN, get it [Olivier] First things first, there were several complicated words Artificial Neural Networks, could you tell me what it is in a few words? [Tiffany] Yes, well, Artificial Neural Networks are Machine Learning algorithms which will allow to calculate mathematical models to recognize patterns  [Olivier] Ok, I think I can work with that Technically, could you tell me how this works? [Tiffany] An Artificial Neural Network? [Olivier] Yes [Tiffany] Ok, I have a schema to explain how an Artificial Neural Network works for image recognition in particular is you have an image as input that you will give to your Machine Learning model which has been trained to recognize here in this case dogs and cats and the model will recognize patterns in the image so, either a shape of an ear, whiskers, eyes and depending on these pasterns it will have identified it will be able to give a confidence score on the presence or the absence of dogs or cats in the image [Olivier] Ok, I'll take a bit of sugar so I can process that. And so, you were telling me before the video What GANs do is, we can make believe as Machine Learning algorithms don't understand concepts, they don't know what a cat is, it recognizes whiskers, ears as you mentioned we can make the model believe that something is something else that it is for example we could make believe that this croissant is a cat [Tiffany] Yes if you take a picture of this croissant and change a little bit the values of the pixels in your image in a certain way to include patterns, that the model would recognize, then you could make the model believe that your croissant is a cat [Olivier] Ok and, it's still a little bit vague to me. What can I do with this? [Tiffany] Well, GANs can enable the generation of very realistic images. Do you want to see an example? How do you do that? You start with your model and make a copy of it so a generator and a discriminator. So these two models are exactly the same at the begining and then, you will make them play a little game to teach the generator how to generate realistic images. So what you do at first is, you take a real image of a cat for example and you send it to the discriminator and the discriminator will tell you I recognize this image, it's a cat, it's a real image and then you reward your discriminator for having successfully been able to recognize the real image. And then, round 2, it's the generator that will generate an image of a cat but as you said earlier the concept of cat does not exist at the beginning for the model [Olivier] So it will generate random things? [Tiffany] Yes it will generate noise as you can see it here, except that the discriminator is not better than the generator to generate these images and so it will believe that there is actually something here and it will think, "hey, it's a real image and it's a cat" and so, you, you know that it's a fake image because you generated it. So, you punish, in a way, the discriminator for not being able to see that it was a fake image and you will reward the generator for being able to mislead the discriminator [Olivier] Ok [Tiffany] You do that several times. Thousands and thousands and thousands of times until when the generator will become very good at generating very realistic images. And so, today, here we are in the progress of image generation of humane faces. So here you can see the progression between 2015 and 2018. It has been very fast. GANs are fairly recent. [Olivier] I see a picture of me, is that normal? [Tiffany] (laughing) Indeed, you must have been in part of the training dataset. [Olivier] So, to make sure I understand correctly none of these person is real [Tiffany] No, all these images have been generated. [Olivier] Except me [Tiffany] Except you of course. All these images have been generated using Artificial Intelligence [Olivier] Ok [Tiffany] And by the way you have this website which is pretty interesting called thispersondoesnotexist.com where every time the image loads, this face if generated on the go [Olivier] So this person does not exist [Tiffany] This person does not exist and it's the first time it has been generated and it will never be generated again. Each time you refresh the page you have a new face that is generated by this Artificial Intelligence [Olivier] Wow, ok, it's very realistic. Ok so, it's awesome, we generate human faces. But, are there real interesting and useful applications? [Tiffany] What is interesting with GAN is that before we used to ask models very simple questions we were asking to identify cats of dogs in images but a human could do it. We don't need an Artificial Intelligence to do it. However, what GANs give us the possibility to do is to ask much more complex questions to models. We can ask them draw me a cat, draw me a human face. But we can also ask them to extrapolate on other things for example if you train your model on a dataset of structures of pharmaceutical molecules, molecules that can cure cancers and others that are toxics and others that are not, you can ask your model "draw me a molecule that could cure cancer while not being toxic" [Olivier] Waouh it seems fantastic! So we are going to save the world. It's all good! [Tiffany] GANs are very promising for a lot of things we can explore things that have never been explored with humans. [Olivier] Ok, where is the catch? [Tiffany] Well, yes,it's not all good things. With Artificial Intelligence, we can do a lot of good things but we can also do a lot of bad things with it. It all depends of the ethic of the persons that uses Artificial Intelligence. What happens with the Deep fakes is that, we can take a picture of a person film another person talking and apply the movement of this person to the picture. Concretely what I can do is that I can take a picture of you and make you say anything I want. Here for example, we have this person who is talking to the camera and the Machine Learning model will identify patterns like the edges of the eyes the mouth, the nose and will be able to apply this face landmarks to the picture. And then here what we see is this person who was only a set of pictures at the beginning, now the Machine Learning model can apply movements to this person as it was actually talking. [Olivier] It's a bit scary [Tiffany] Yes and it can have a huge impact on for example political speeches or fake news we could release on the internet and this is why people should be aware that we are capable of doing this kind of things and it is important to spread the message. I am going to show you a funnier application of Deep fake. We can make dead people talk. [Olivier] Ok! [Tiffany] Is it actually fun I don't know but you see here, we have a picture of Einstein we can apply face landmarks of people speaking to his face. And for me, what I find impressive it to see the Mona Lisa talking. [Olivier] She is alive! [Tiffany] So I find it both fascinating and creepy. [Olivier] Ok Well Tiffany, I learned a lot of things and I will have to process all this but it was very interesting.Thank you very much! [Tiffany] Thank you very much for inviting me! [Olivier] See you soon [Tiffany] See you [Olivier] If you want to know more about Artificial Neural Networks and GAN, we will put a few links down the description below the video. Go check them!
