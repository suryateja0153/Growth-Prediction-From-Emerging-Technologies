 clock from Las Vegas it's the cube covering AWS reinvent 2019 brought to you by Amazon Web Services and in care along with its ecosystem partners hey welcome back everyone Stu keeps coverage here live in Las Vegas or reinvent 2019 this is the cubes seventh year covering reinvent the events only been gone for eight years it feels like a decade so much growth so much action I'm John for as my co-host de Villante here extracting the signal for the noise in the Intel ad of the studio of the cube thank you for that sponsorship Mike Miller is our next guest director of AI devices at AWS super excited for this segment because deep racers here and we got some music hey I and Linda great to see you again thanks coming on absolutely thank you for having me on again I appreciate it alright let's just jump right in your choice developers are geeking out over deep Racer and the toys you guys are putting out there as a fun way to play and learn absolutely getting it getting hands-on with these new broadly applicable machine learning technologies let's jump into deep racer right so first of all give us a quick update on what's happening between last year and this year in the deep racial communities but a lot of froth competitiveness Street battles and then we'll get an update we launched deep racer last year as a 1:18 scale race car designed to teach reinforcement learning so this thing drives by itself around the tracks you know we've got an online experience where customers can train models so we launched a deep racer League where we plan to visit 22 sites around the world at AWS summits where developers could come visit us and race a car physically around a track and we had online contests so every month we had a new track for developers to be challenged by and raced their cars around the track we've seen tremendous engagement and excitement you know a little bit of competition really gets developers juices going it's been a lot of fun congratulations by the way absolutely let's get to the new the new choice so you deep-freeze are 2.0 whatever you're calling it just deep razor Evo Evo ok sir Evo new new generation so we've basically provided more opportunities to race for developers more challenges for them to learn and more things more ways for them to win so we integrated some new sensors on this car so on top there's a lidar which is a laser range-finding device that can detect other cars or obstacles in the rear of the car and to the sides and in the front of the car we have stereo cameras that we added so that the car can sense depth in front of it so with those new sensors developers can now be challenged by integrating depth sensing and object avoidance and head-to-head racing into their machine learning models so currently it's not an obstacle course it's right oh it's a it's it's or correct it's a race try it we call it a time trial so it's a single car on the track at a time how fast can you make a lap our world record actually is seven point four four seconds set by a young lady from Tokyo this past year really excited she was holding up the trophy and so this is basically a dream come true and so what are they trying to optimize is it is it just the the speed at the turn is it what what do they sort of focused on yeah it's a little bit of art and a little bit of science so there's the reinforcement learning model that learns through what's called a reward function so you give the car rewards for achieving specific objectives or certain behaviors and so it's really up to the developer to decide what kind of behaviors do they want to reward the the car with whether it's stay close to the centerline reduce the amount of turns they can also determine its position on the track and so they can reward it for cutting corners close speeding up or slowing down so it's really a little bit of art and science through some experimentation and deciding so we had Intel on yesterday talking about some of their AI naveen route great guy but he they were introducing this concept called ganz generative generative adversarial networks which is kind of like neural network kind of technology a lot of computer science in some of the tech here that's right like kitty scripting kind of thing this is like real-deal yes so ganz actually form the basis of the product that we just announced this year called deep composure so deep composure is a bored and a cloud service designed to work together to teach developers about generative AI and Ganz are the technique that we teach developers so what's interesting about generative AI is that machine learning moves from you know a predictions based technology to something that can actually create new content so create new music new stories new art but also companies are using generative AI to do more practical things like take a sketch and turn it into a 3d model or autocorrect you know colorize black-and-white photos Autodesk even has a generative design product where you can give the an industrial designer can give a product some constraints and it'll generate hundreds of ideas for the design now this is interesting to me because I think this takes it to I call basic machine learning to really some more advanced practical examples which is super exciting for people learning AI and machine learning can you talk about the composer and how it works because pretend I'm just a musician I'm 16 years old I'm composing music I got a keyboard how do i how can I get involved what would be a path sure do I buy a composer device do I link it to Ableton Live and these tools that are out there there's a variety of different like techniques they can you take us through using so so really our target customer for this is is an aspiring machine learning developer maybe not necessarily a musician so any developer whether they have musical experience or machine learning background can use the deep composer system to learn about the generative AI techniques so ganz are comprised of these two networks that have to be trained in coordination and what we do with deep composer is we walk users through or walk developers through exactly how to set up that structure how these two things train and how is it different from traditional machine learning where you've got you know a large data set and you're training a single model to make a prediction how do these multiple networks actually work against each other and how do you make sure that they're generating new content that's actually of the right type of quality that you want and so that's really the essence of the generative adversarial networks in these two networks that work against each other so in Cagayan musician who happens to like machine learn like you this is my kid he'll get hooked on machine learning plug it is looper and you know sit two systems working together or against each other when we start getting to visualization that's gonna be very interesting when you start getting the data there at the fundamental level now this is early days and I mean some would say day zero because this is really early how do you explain that to developers and people you're trying to get attention to because this is certainly exciting stuff it's fun playful but it's got some nerd action in it it's got some tech what are some of the conversations you're having with folks when they say hey how do I get involved why should I get involved and what's they really gonna be the impact what's the result of all this yeah well it's it's fascinating because through Amazon's 20 years of artificial intelligence investments we've learned a lot and you know we've got thousands of engineers working on artificial intelligence and machine learning and what we want to do is try to take a lot of that knowledge and the experiences that those folks have learned through these years and figure out how we can bring them to developers of all skill levels so you know developers who don't know machine learning through developers who might be data scientists and have some experience we want to build tools that are engaging and you know tactile and actually tangible for them to learn and see the results of what machine learning can do so in the deep composure case it's how do these generative networks actually create net new content in this case music for deep racer how does reinforcement learning actually translate from a simulated environment to the real world and how might that be applicable for let's say robotics applications so it's really about reducing the learning curve and making it easy for developers of real world applications and all this oh absolutely learning linchpin absolutely and you just look at all of the kind of innovations that are being done from Amazon and from our customers you know whether they're based on you know improving product recommendations forecasting streamlining supply chains you know generating training data all of these things are really practical application so what's happening at the device and what's happening in the cloud help us understand sir so in deep composure the device is really just a way to input a signal and in this case it's a MIDI signal so MIDI is a digital audio formats right that allows machines to kind of understand music so the keyboard allows you to input MIDI into the generative Network and then in the cloud we've got the generative Network takes that inputs processes it and then generates four-part accompaniments for the input that you provide so say you play a little melody on the keyboard we're going to generate a drum track a guitar track a keyboard track maybe a synthesizer track and let you play those back to hear how your input kind of inspired the generation of this music so ganz is a big deal with this absolutely it forms the basis of the first technique that we're teaching using the deep composer alright so I got to ask you the question that that's on everyone's mind mine what are some of the wackiest or and/or coolest things you've seen this year with deep composer and deep racer because I'm gonna Majan them developers creativity straying off the reservation a little bit any cool and wacky things you've seen but we've got some great stories of competitors in the deep racer leagues so we've got you know father-son teams that come in and race at the New York summit you know a ten year old learning how to code with his dad we had one competitor in the US was that our Santa Clara summits tried again at our that our you know Atlanta summit and then at the Chicago summit finally won a won a position to come back to reinvent and race you know last year we did the race here at reinvent in the winning time the lap time a single lap was 51 seconds the current world record is seven point four four seconds and it's been just insane how these developers have been able to really optimize and you know generate models that drive this thing at incredible speeds around the track well sure you seen the movie Ford versus Ferrari yet you got to see because this JP spray sir you have to need a stadium soon with eSports booming this has got its own legs for its own big well we've got six tracks set up down at the MGM Grand Arena so you've already got the arena set up and that's where we're doing all the knockout rounds and and competitors that you mentioned father-son you remember when we were kids at Cub Scouts I think it was or Boy Scouts remember always you had the Pinewood Derby all right you take a car and you know file down the nails that you use for the axles and taking it to a whole new level the modern day all right Mike thanks for coming on appreciate let's keep in touch if you can get some of that b-roll for any any video would love to get some b-roll of some deep racer photos send them our way super exciting love what you're doing I think this is a great way to make it fun and instructive and certainly very relevant absolutely that's what we're after thank you for having me all right skew coverage here here in Las Vegas for us our seventh Amazon's a three invent we're documenting history as the ecosystem evolved as the industry wave is coming IOT edge a lot of cool things happening we're bringing it to you the back of more coverage after the short break [Music]
