 [Music] hi I'm Nicola Ravi I'm an engineer on Facebook's AI team working on computer vision and 3d understanding my team and I built an open source library called pi torch 3d to make 3d d planning easier with pi torch it contains reusable components that can be useful for a wide variety of 3d tasks and that are optimized thoroughly tested and well documented one of the major limitations for advancing 3d understanding has been the lack of sufficient engineering tools to support the complexities of combining deep learning or 3d data unlike 2d images that can be represented as a single tensor 3d models require us to support operations on batches of complex 3d data like triangle meshes which are composed of both vertex XYZ coordinates as well as space connection patterns this can present both memory and compute challenges this includes operators and loss functions for 3d data such as Tantalus and meshes a data structure with methods for manipulating batches of variable size measures for example calculating the chamfer loss between two meshes requires two intensive operations first we need to differentially sample excessive points from the surface of each mesh and second for each point we need to find the closest neighboring points in the other point cloud this can be a memory intensive computation in pi torch as we need to calculate a pairwise distance matrix and then find the minimum value in comparison a fused CUDA kernel enables significant speed up and reduced memory usage using graphics operators such as rendering where deep learning is an exciting research area we created a modular differentiable renderer implementation which can be easily incorporated into a deep learning training it has composable units to enable researchers to access a wide variety of intermediate variables and extend it to support custom lighting or shading effects [Music] accurately predicting and reconstructing the 3d shapes of unconstrained scenes in the real world is an important step towards unlocking and enhancing new experiences in several domains in the future we could enable AR and VR applications such as virtual Tryon for clothing or visualize furniture and enhance robotic navigation by improving understanding of a 3d scene and objects within it our goal with Pytor 3d is to help accelerate research at the intersection of 3d and deep learning and reduce the startup time needed to work on 3d research and by open sourcing the code we hope that the wider AI community will leverage Pytor 3d to help press 3d research forward we welcome contributions from the community to build this resource father feel free to try it yourself a pilot or 3G org or on github you
