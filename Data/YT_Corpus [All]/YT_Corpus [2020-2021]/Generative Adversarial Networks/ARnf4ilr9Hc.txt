 hello and welcome to a new tutorial series on the coding train using a piece of about a piece of software called runway so what is runway how do you download and install runway and kind of tinker around with it that's all I'm gonna do in this particular video now let me clear runway is not something that I've made a runway is made by a company a new company called runway itself it's a piece of software you can use you can download it for free you can use it for free there are aspects of it that require cloud GPU credits which I'll get into later and you can get some free credits and a coupon code that you'll find in the description of this video but really I want to just talk about what is kind of so excited about it I'm planning to use it in the future in a lot of future tutorials and coding challenges and teaching things that I'm going to do and I also should just mention that I'm an advisor to the company runway itself so I'm involved in that capacity all right so what is runway 2 right here it says machine learning for creators bring the power of artificial intelligence to your creative project with an intuitive and simple visual interface start exploring new ways of creating today so this this to me is like the core of runway I am somebody who's a creative quota I'm working with processing and p5.js you might be working with other pieces of software that's just commercial software coding environments you're writing your own software and you want to make use of recent advances in machine learning you've read about this model you saw this YouTube video but this model can you use in your thing well before runway one of the things you might have done is find your way to some github repo that had like this very long readme of about all the different like dependencies you need to install and configure and then you've got to download this and install this and then make build this library and you can really get stuck there for a long time so runway is an all-in-one piece of software with an interface that basically will run machine learning models for you install and configure them without you having to do any other work but press a button called install and it gives you an interface to play with those models experiment with those models and then broadcast the results of those models to some other piece of software there's a variety of ways you could do that broadcasting through on HTTP requests through OSC messages and all these things might not make sense to you which is totally fine I'm going to poke through them and show you how they work with an eye towards at least showing you how to pair a runway with processing and how to pair a runway with p5.js and I'll also show you where there's lots of other examples and things you can do with other platforms and stuff like that so the first step you should do is click here on your download runway beta it will automatically trigger a download for Mac OS Windows or Linux I've actually already downloaded and installed runway so I'm gonna kind of skip that but skip that stuff and just actually now run the software ah and now it's saying welcome to runway sign in to get started okay so if you already have an account you could just sign in with your account I do already have an account but I'm going to create a new one just so we can follow along with the process so I'm gonna go here create an account I'm gonna enter my email address which is Daniel at the coding train comm then I'm gonna make a username and password now that I've put in my very strong password I'm going to click Next and I'm gonna give my details Daniel Shiffman the coding train create account ah and it's giving me a verification code to Daniel at the coding train comm account has now been created and I can click start so once you've downloaded installed runway and signed up for an account logged into your account you will find this screen so if you've been using runway for a while you might then end up here clicking on open workspaces because workspaces are a way of collecting a bunch of different models that you want to use for a particular project into a workspace but we haven't done any of that so the first thing that I'm gonna do is just click on browse models so the first thing that I might suggest that you do is just click on a model and see what you can do to play with it in the runway interface itself because one thing that's really wonderful about runway is as a piece of software and interface you can explore and experiment with the models to understand how it works what it does well what it doesn't well do well what it does it all before starting to bring it into your own software or your own project so I'm gonna pick this spayed Coco model which I have never looked at before it's very legitimate me I have no idea what's gonna happen when I click on that and now here I can find out some more information about the model so I could find out what does the model do it generates realistic images from sketches and doodles I can find out more information about the model for example this is the paper that describes this model semantic image synthesis with spatially adaptive normalizations trained on cocoa stuff dataset remember when someone asked is this big is this is this tutorial for beginners well it's for beginners in that you're a beginner you can come here and play around with it but there's there's a lot of it you can go very deep to if you want to find the paper read through the notes and understand more about what this model how it was built what data it was trained on which is always a very important question to ask whenever you're using a machine learning model so I can also we could see there are attributions here so this is the organization that train the model these are the authors of the paper we can see when what the size of it when it was created if it's CPU and GPU supported we can also go under gallery and we can see just some images that have been created so we can get an idea this is something this is a model that's themed around something called image segmentation so I have an image over here what does it mean to do image segmentation well this image is segmented divided into a bunch of different segments those segments are noted by color so there's like a purple segment a pink segment a light green segment and those colors are tied to labels in the model essentially that know about a kind of thing that it could draw in that area so you could do image segmentation in two ways I could take an existing image like an image of me and try to say like oh this I'm gonna segment it this is where my head is this is where my hand is this is where my hand is or I could generate images by sort of drawing on a blank image saying put a hand over here put a head over here so that's what a big segmentation is at least in the way that I understand it what if I had so far I've downloaded runway I've poked around the models I've just clicked on one now I want to use that model I want to play with it I want to see run so I'm gonna go here to add to workspace it's right up here add to workspace now I don't have a workspace yet so I need to make one and I'm gonna call this workspace I'm gonna say coding train livestream so I'm gonna do that and hit create now I have a workspace and you can see this is my workspace I have only one model added to this workspace over here and it's kind of highlighting up for me right now what to do I need to choose an input source so every machine learning model is different some of them expect text input some of them expect image input some of them might expect input that's from its arbitrary scientific data from a spreadsheet then the model is going to take that input in run it through the model and produce an output and that output might be numbers or it also might be an image or it might be more text so now we're in the sort of the space of a case by case basis but if I understand image segmentation correctly I'm pretty sure the input is going to be both an image and the input and the output are both going to be an image let's make a little diagram so we have this what was this model called again Spade cocoa so we have this machine learning model presumably there's some neural network architecture in here maybe it has some convolutional layers this is something we would want to read that paper to find out more runway it's gonna allow us to just use it out of the box and you know it certainly would always recommend reading more about it I want to learn more about how to use it so my assumption here is I'm in my software that I want to build I want to maybe create a drawing piece of software that allows a user to segment out an image so you can imagine maybe I'm gonna like kind of draw something that's one color look I could use different color markers like I'm going to fill you know I'm gonna sort of fill this image in with a bunch of different colors and then I'm going to feed that into the model and out will come an image so we have input and we have output and again this is going to be different for every model that we might pick in runway although there's a lot of conventions a lot of the models expect images as in and output images some of them expect text is input and output an image or images input and output text etc and so on and so forth but so now what I want to do is choose the input source in runway for the model so something that's going to produce a segmented image and so that could be coming from a file it could actually come from a network connection which I'll get into maybe in a future video or you can explore on your own I'm just gonna pick segmentation this is like the greatest thing ever because what just happened is runway your image segmentation is a common enough feature of machine learning models that runway has built into it an entire drawing engine so that you can play around with image segmentation so and you can see these are the colors for different labels so maybe what I want it looks like it's a lot of Transportation stuff so maybe what I want is let's try slette stride wrong some people to people with a airplane and a wineglass flying overhead okay are you doing now I'm gonna choose an output and I just want to do preview right because preview right now is like I'm not actually I don't need to export this I don't you need to use it somewhere else I just want to play around with it in runway itself so I'm gonna hit preview now I have selected my input which is just the segmentation interface of runway itself I have selected my output which is just a preview now it's time for me to run the model and here we go run remotely so a remote GPU enabled and you can see just by signing up for runway I have ten dollars in remote GPU credits I be interesting to see how much just running this once actually uses so one thing I'll mention now if you want to get additional credits I can go over here this is like the sort of icon for my profile I can click on this I'm going to go now to here I'm gonna go to get more credits and this is gonna take me to a browser page and I could have certainly pay for more credits but I'm going to click here and I'm going to redeem credits by saying coding train right here so if you would like to get an additional $10 in credits you can do this and we can see now I should have twenty dollars in credits so this icon up here just so we're clear this icon up here is your workspaces of which I only have one with one model that's connected to remote GPU and if I wanted to look at other models I would go here to this icon alright now I'm gonna press run remotely oh it's so beautiful I cannot believe it so this what has made cocoa machine learning while generate it's really interesting to see the results here so you can think me knowing nothing about this model kind of how it works and what to expect get some pretty weird results with it probably if I were a bit more thoughtful maybe if I even like filled in the entire space right I probably I left so much of it blank I also included like a giant wine glass with two people it's very kind of creepy looking although this I think this sort of resembles me in some strange sort of way and we can see here look at this five cents so one thing I should mention is the reason why that took a long time it was like spinning up the server and everything to start actually running the model but now that it's running in real time it can happen much more quickly so let's try filling it so what would be a good thing to fill it with let's try floor wood so let's try filling it with a wood floor oh whoa then let's put let's try to put like some fruit oh this is looking much better now let's put like an orange right next to it it's put a couple oranges or make a little bowl of fruit [Music] this I gotta stop that's pretty amazing so again here is just a little moment later of being being a little more thoughtful to think about how this model actually works and what what might have you know i if i knew if i looked at the data set which is the fairly well known I imagine cocoa image data set that's probably going to be give me even more information to think about what it's going to do well but you can see how able to sort of think about a sort of little seat a little little pile of fruit here on a you know wood background almost looks a lot more like cloth like it's sitting on a table pretty realistic and yes Charlie England points out which is correct is continuing to use the GPU credits and we can see that you know still though I've even with doing a bunch of live painting I've just used ten cents there so you can do a lot with the free ten dollars just in playing around so let's look at so input wise I could also so I chose to do segmentation here but I could also use a file so if I wanted to open a file on the computer I could do it that way and then output if I change to export I could also actually export that to a variety of different formats but of course I could also right here just under preview I can click this download Save button and now I am saving forevermore that this particular image is a file now what's really important here actually more important here is under network so if what I wanted to do is click over here under network this means I can now communicate with this particular machine learning model from my own software whether that's software that I've downloaded or purchased if somebody else has made that speaks one of these particular protocols or my own software that I'm writing in just about any programming language or environment if you if you have a framework or module or a library or support these types of protocols so and one of the nice things here if I click on JavaScript it's actually we can see there's actually a bit of code here that you can actually just copy pasted into your JavaScript to run it directly so I'm gonna come back oscy is also a really popular protocol messaging Network messaging protocol for creative coders stands for open sound control allows you to send data between applications so I will also kind of come back and in a separate video and show you about how some of these work I should also probably mention that the runway software itself works in a very similar way to a piece of software called Weka Nader that you might be familiar with Weka nater is a software that was created by Rebecca fie brink years ago that allows you to train a neural work with data sent over OSC messaging and then get the results of that after the fact the real sort of key difference here is runway is really set up to support a huge treasure trove of pre trained models whereas Weka Nader was more for training on training neural networks on the fly with small bits of data but and I will say that one of the things that runway is planning maybe by September is to start coming out with features for training your own model as well so thanks for this watching this introduction to runway just sort of the basics of downloading installing the software what it is from a high-level point of view um what the features of the interface work how to get some free cloud credits and what I would suggest that you do after watching this video is download run it run the software and go to this browse models page so you can see there's a lot of different models for looking at motion generative community text recognition cook around here let's try this recognition one face recognition dense cap wares pose net in here that might be under motion dense pose pose net so here's a model called pose net which performs real-time skeletal tracking of one or more people I've covered this model in other libraries like the ml5 jazz library with tensorflow jazz and so what I'm gonna do in the next video is use this model pose net in runway with my webcam running it locally on this computer without requiring cloud credits and then get the results of this model in processing itself so I'm gonna show you that whole workflow but poke around click around find a model that you like let me know about it in the comments share images that you made with it and look forward to seeing what you make with runway ok thanks for watching [Music] you
