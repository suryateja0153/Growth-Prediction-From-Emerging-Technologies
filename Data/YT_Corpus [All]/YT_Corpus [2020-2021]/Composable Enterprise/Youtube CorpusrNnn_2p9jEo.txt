 So through this migration from static infrastructure, dynamic infrastructure, there are at least three very clear advantages of deploying this dynamic and agile infrastructure. Number one: industry wide coming from various analysts and OEM partners, we understand that the typical enterprise utilization of resources, the 18 to 20% range. So again, it doesn't matter, you're talking to 100,000, a million, 10 million plus....using only 20%...there's a lot of waste that's happening. So we have customers and partners right now that we're able to double or triple that utilization. So that immediately translates into, into business and bottom line benefits clearly. Secondarily, it's the ease of use, right? Instead of sending out somebody with a cart out there and popping the hood off a machine uncabling and powering down gear to add additional storage or change the networking or add FPGAs, we're literally able to assimilate the provision of those resources with a few clicks in software. And so truly making this vision of software defined infrastructure a reality. So it's the ease of use. And tertiary, we all understand that SQL server software licenses or Oracle DB licenses or any other software licenses, they come at a high premium. By increasing the utilization and being able to only provision the type of gear that I need, I don't necessarily have to always ingest more CPUs, thus pay for software licenses per core. So those are these three very clear advantages of deploying LIQID, as an enabler to Composable Dis-aggregated Infrastructure.
