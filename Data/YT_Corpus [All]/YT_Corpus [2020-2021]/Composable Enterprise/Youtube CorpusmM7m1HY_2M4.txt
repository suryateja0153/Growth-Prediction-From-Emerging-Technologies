 Using HPE OneView, IT administrators create a catalog of workload optimized infrastructure templates, which allow generalists to rapidly and reliably provision compute, storage and fabric resources. In this demo we'll show you how to deploy storage using server profile templates to deploy storage consistently. Login into HPE OneView. Using the storage we added and the server profile template we configured, we are going to create a small cluster by creating a server profile and provisioning the volumes. Add a name. Then select the server profile template we preconfigured that has all the SAN connections, enclosure groups, volumes and boot settings configured. Then we will select the hardware we want to assign the profiles to in our environment. We will need to identify the 'World Wide Name' for the fibre channel connection we attached to the template. For Gen10 Servers this can be accomplished all within HPE OneView. Selecting the server from the server hardware list that we selected for our server profile, we can quickly identify the 'world wide name'. Copy it so we can paste it back into our profile under the fibre connection we were establishing. Now we are ready to create! As we apply these profiles for all the HPE Primera storage including the boot disk, the attachment to a shared volume will be done for these servers including the SANs which will be auto zoned for their access. Through software-defined intelligence, HPE OneView takes a template-driven approach for deploying, provisioning, updating, and integrating compute, storage and networking infrastructure, enabling IT to be more agile and work more efficiently.
