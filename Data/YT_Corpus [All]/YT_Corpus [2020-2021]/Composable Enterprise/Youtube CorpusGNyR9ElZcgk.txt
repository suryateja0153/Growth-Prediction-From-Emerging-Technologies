 I think one of the biggest benefits of LIQID is that we are software agnostic. All of our software lives on our fabric switch. We don't force the user to put any drivers, any agents, any software modules on the compute nodes themselves. They're bare metal compute nodes, run whatever software you want. If you want to run a bare metal OS, run a bare metal OS. If you want to run a virtualization layer or a hyper-visor, Myrna virtualization or hyper-visor, if it works on a static server today, it's going to work even better on a composed LIQID system. So I think that's one of the big benefits that we can bring to the customers is it's completely transparent to their environment, especially their software environment, to be able to leverage liquid. We don't require them to modify or change anything.
