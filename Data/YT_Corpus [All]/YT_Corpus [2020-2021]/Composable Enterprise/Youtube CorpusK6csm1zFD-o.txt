an opportunity as sharon had mentioned to give a thumbs up if there's other questions that you like as well so we can help to prioritize them so seeing no questions yet in the queue i'll throw some softballs over to our experts and get them warmed up for you and maybe get you kind of thinking about some topics as well too that are of interest april let's start with you um so there's a session available on demand about asset leasing can you maybe give the highlights you know your top three maybe five highlights on what you want the community to know about on wave two what are you most excited about that you wanna share great thanks philly yes i would say with finance you know in the in the situations that we've been in in the last eight months with with kovid and even before that there's been a huge focus on automation and i don't think we could possibly get to automating finance processes faster um anyway faster um and so that has been a big focus on it for us so one of the couple of the things in addition to asset leasing that will be released in wave two are additional automations around collection strategies so again taking that manual effort that people are having to do today monitoring thousands of customers at a time looking at multiple different sets of data to try to make decisions we're actually doing data driven decisions um for them and helping automate those collection tasks so we're really excited about that and then another thing in the theme of automation is in vendor invoice automation so we're releasing kind of the first phase where you once you get your uh invoices in through either electronic submission or ocr we've added a ton of enhancements and analytics and metrics to make that process very seamless and touchless all the way through post team so that's another big thing that we've invested in that we're really excited we have a lot of great feedback on that's fantastic all right let's kind of stick with this roadmap theme anand on your session that just ended you did a great job on talking a lot about fraud and the details that we have and showing a lot of great demos can you share with the community as well too about the roadmap you know what do you feel is really exciting that you want to make sure that the community is aware about that we didn't get a chance to showcase in the session yeah definitely i think the two big call-outs here are really that just in the in the last part of wave one we had shipped some major uh updates to uh to our production solution in terms of covering both account side fraud as well as you know fraud related to returns and discounts you know through anomaly detection and in fact one of the questions i see that has just posted is around this like can we also help on a concept fraud so i'll definitely take a moment to answer that but uh so after those big kind of announcements or big capabilities that we added to the product wave 2 was all about like improving the experience of the user in terms of onboarding and getting going with the product as early as possible because it's a fairly broad i wouldn't say complicated but fairly broad and multi-featured product and sometimes users get overwhelmed you know in terms of how many different things are there to use so we have done a lot of work in terms of onboarding a lot we have added we're adding things like uh guided tours we have revamped the user experience in terms of the information architecture and the web page you know our product page has been fully refurbished we have a new new ux for that and then plus we have added several new capabilities which allow you to basically in an easy way get data data in and out of the product you know quickly we also have added several improvements which will enable you to consume the insights of fraud protection much better so in general i think the theme for wave 2 has been make it easy to get in the product consume the insights and get insights and maybe export them out also and use them for further analysis so that has been the theme for this release and in the upcoming release we will kind of take this further but then we usually have this kind of structure where in wave 2 like in the october wave we we do a kind of release around improving user experiences and in the wave one which is usually the april we try to do releases around big new product features new capabilities so i don't want to spill the beans on that right now here but you can expect that to happen in april fantastic so yeah we do have a couple questions that have come in specifically to fraud so let's just make sure that we cover off on them so the first one does fraud does dynamic fraud protection provide safety and protection both merchant as well as customer and would it protect against compromise of legitimate customer payment profile yes i think a great question and answer to both is yes very strong yes so the product is designed in such a way that it's aimed to protect you as the merchant or the business whose online portal you know may suffer fraud attacks so that's obviously the primary goal but that's not only goal in the sense that fraud protection also helps your end customers or the consumer shoppers to be protected too because after all by making sure that their accounts then you don't get compromised and that ensuring that their uh you know instruments and other details are protected you are ensuring your own reputation as a business and you're also giving them a stellar experience so yes fraud protection is all about protecting you but that happens only when we protect your end customers so it goes in hand in hand so the answer to both those questions is yes fantastic how about e-commerce so does dynam does fraud work only with dynamics 365 commerce or is it available as a standalone product that can be used with any third-party e-commerce solution again a very great uh very nice question and you know it's an important question because many of our customers do ask that and as venkat who is my colleague he has answered the answer is that it is not like kind of conditioned on you being a customer of commerce you can actually may not use any other dynamics capability but you can still use fraud protection standalone and we can our product can interface with any of your incompetent solutions that you may be using for for your commerce system um so so yes you can do use it standalone having said that obviously you know if these are products from dynamics commerce as well as fraud protection so obviously we have a strong better together story so if you happen to be using commerce and you want to use fraud protection then it's it's a very easy onboarding you don't have to do any api integration yourself because it's already done under the hood you just have to basically click through on a couple of places saying yes i want to start using dfp and it will get working so the answer is yes you can use it standalone but at the same time there's a strong beta together with commerce which you definitely want to leverage if you are using commerce perfect so i think what i heard you say is even i could get it up and running if i'm using it with commerce which i love that okay fantastic april let's go to you for a question you know we had announced a while ago um finance insights and i know you guys have been working really closely with some customers as far as that preview can you share any of the successes that you're seeing with finance insights and give the community an update april are you still with us are you able to were you able to get this i'm on mute oh there we go perfect so yes thank you shelley um so to give a recap to the group finance insights is our introduction of intelligent cash flow forecasting where we're really bringing intelligence into finance and we have a private preview going right now we have a very healthy pipeline of customers that are currently using it as well as interested and we've seen some great out-of-the-box success with it for example um in the first handful of customers that we onboarded we were immediately without any changes able to see about a 40 to a 72 to 80 percent model accuracy in some of our predictions so we're really happy with that uh first time around um in addition to to that we've been getting some great usability feedback as well so we think you know not only are we bringing intelligence to finance but we're putting as much effort into the experience of it of the end user so that they can easily you know not even know what's going on behind the scenes and really interact with it and see some good results there so that's exciting and then earlier what i mentioned the automation i had talked about the collection strategy and the collections as well when i talked about data driven automation the predictions that are going to be happening from finance insights will actually also be an input into some of the rules and stuff that the collections will process on to automate some of the capabilities there so we're really excited to really tie that whole end to end scenario with intelligence and automation i'll when we ga finance insights awesome okay another question from the community and as i get prepared just a reminder for everyone please use your chat um ask questions away the team will be getting softball questions from me as fillers so you can gain insights into them and their expertise and their opinions um but we want to make sure you guys are getting the most out of this session so please i think this question is for you it is yes i am going to answer this one yes um but to wrap up on that please make sure to um go ahead and enter your questions in the chat window so there's a question about access to all the great products that we've talked about so we've talked about finance we've talked about fraud um if you guys have been on you know listening to other ignite sessions there's a lot of great work going on with commerce and project operations and really just the whole entire portfolio so what is the best way to be able to try this out so we do have some trials that are available we have a trials.dynamics.com site that will lead you through some experiences it is not the full-blown product that is out there um as it is compared to some of the other applications each application is a little unique and we're doing work there to make sure that we can streamline that so there is work happening here we don't have anything available quite yet in today but please know that this is a top priority for us that we are working on you may add one quick comment on this one yes please uh so uh as as uh shelly said uh you know we are definitely working on giving like a community trial of some of the products you know to make it easy for you to get a quick understanding there are a couple of things available today which you know with a couple of steps you will be able to access one is if you can work with your either with directly with your account team you know the sellers or if you can work with a partner assigned to you they do have access to demo environments at least in the case of fraud protection i can definitely say that and they can actually sit with you and let you walk you through the experience let you actually uh use it and you know try it out so these are like demo environments available to sellers and partners that's one and then just to kind of like address that in terms of trial as a slightly bigger concept we do offer all our customers a trial product trial uh before you before you actually have to decide whether to buy or not so you can try before you buy and uh you know you definitely you can start that trial by uh approaching your account team and uh you know it's a free trial you can you can use the product just as if you were using in production everything that is available in the product for production is available in trial for a limited amount of time obviously and you can actually integrate to the product and actually test it out fully and if you're satisfied of course at that time you can move to a purchase if not you can after the trial you can just stop and uh you know there is no other uh you know you don't have to like pay anything uh extra or anything like that so free trial is available please touch get in touch with your account team or partner as the case may be to access that perfect and that was the other question that just came in and in asking about the trials it was specific for fraud protection so you've read their mind anon that's fantastic yeah actually i should add one more thing just because i have the opportunity here we actually offer something called dfp in a day it's a program uh that is that is getting becoming very successful where not just that you'll get a trial but you will view the partner or the seller as the case maybe we'll actually walk you through it so that within 24 hours you'll be at a point where you'll actually be getting useful insights from fraud protection back you know especially doing uh analysis of historical data and getting inside so uh please like to reach out to your sellers because not just getting the trial but getting something going it can be achieved within 24 hours with this dap in a day program and especially for the loss prevention capability of the product uh it's actually you can get the first loss prediction report out literally within hours from starting the trial so that's something you should definitely check out wonderful and so there's been a couple community posts that have been made available here in our chat window so just a reminder for people to go to our community.dynamics.com we always have ongoing conversations out there and then all of the capabilities that we're talking about today as well as the future capabilities that we've publicized so far from our wave 2 release plans those are all available for you on docs.microsoft.com so don't forget to go out there and stay up to date on all the great innovation that the team is doing one other last plug that i'd like to make would be if you have product ideas that you'd like to see included or enhanced or maybe a new innovation that you'd like to see us add please tell us about that and the place to do that is ideas.dynamics.com that is our ideas portal where it is community based you can go out there and vote on ideas that you like and just like we do here where your voice matters and so we do look at the number of votes we do look at those counts as we are looking and taking in what is going to be coming available in our next update so please make sure to do that as well anad another question for you about dfp so what are what are the extensibility options available oh this is my favorite question because i have a lot to talk about so i won't take too much time but yes actually one of the things that i'm really proud about we are really proud about our product dfp product is is the various uh kinds of extensibility options it offers so let me walk you through some of them a you can there is extensibility in terms of the schema of the data that is sent to the engine for fraud protection so we have a standard schema like there's a schema for purchase protection there's a schema for account events so these are standardized this is what we think are the standard device attributes that need to be sent to us but if you think there are certain attributes that are very specific to your business that matter in your in your decision making you can send that as custom data and you can you can extend our uh there's a clean extensibility format you can just extend with any json payload you want so that's very powerful and then all that schema is consumed and all the data is actually made available to you in the rule engine for you to write rules on it's made available in your graph and then through eventing you can actually even export it back into like event hubs and things like that which leads me to the second kind of extensibility which is you know we we have in product uh reports detailed reports for local protections loss prevention as well as purchase protection these are like the standard reports that we give to every customer now but of course uh many customers will say that we need more detailed reporting we need more slicing and dicing we need more visibility the data is there in your graph in the product but it's not necessarily shown in the current form of the scorecard so you may want something more to help that what we are doing is that we are we have this very powerful capability called eventing where you can essentially every transaction that comes in for assessment you can actually send it through eventing to a location of choice like an event you can even send it to blob storage in the coming you know in the near future and the idea is that you're not just sending the event on its payload but all the insights that the product has generated about it the risk or risk reasons and so on so for all the device fingerprinting related data that we have collected for you and then with that data out you can actually use custom reports on top of that data you can like slice and dice it and run custom reports but we don't just leave you to your own devices we actually give you the templates of those devices of those reports for example venkat who is on the call right now he has some deep reports on on on loss prevention similarly we have reports on account protection also on the purchase side we have an experience called scorul optimizer which is much more detailed slice and dice than what you have with the in-product experience so again a very strong customization story here and then the last thing i want to call out is that we have taken this uh message too hard from our customers that they would like to bring in extra data from other sources you know so they will just point us to hey get this piece of data from this particular provider to which i have an account you know you just need to kind of use my credentials and get it and then for example the ability to call out of the product to call another service for example for some kind of assessment or a score and extend the decision making via those attributes so definitely those are on our roadmap we are taking that feedback very seriously and if you are like for you if that kind of extensibility is very important i would like to really hear from you here at this forum reach out to us in other ways and that will really inform our roadmap going forward thank you just wanted to add one thing to what anand just said in addition to the data egress capability that anand was talking about there is also a power apps that are being built where um specific exploration related capabilities are available so like for instance in the case of loss prevention um store managers can access the app on the phone and be able to make decisions on the fly where they have the ability to see which are all the suspicious staff or terminals that needs special attention where do they want to su they have the ability to subscribe to alerts and things of that nature and they can also open cases um directly on the app so it is well integrated into power apps so that's another thing that we are correctly lighting up just wanted to add to what animal is saying that's wonderful yeah what a great story about the power of the platform there as well too so thanks for sharing that vent cap since we have you guys on the hot seat let's ask another question about dfp what languages and regions is dynamics fraud protection since i've been using my microsoft acronyms of dfp um what regions and languages is dynamics fraud protection available in uh i can take that so um i should answer those questions in two separate forms so in terms of language support we support eight languages today uh english french and there are six other languages i try to enumerate them but i may make a mistake so uh you should just go to the web page and you will see it listed out on our website so six languages in total uh in terms of markets where it's available dfp is really available worldwide it's there is no restriction except for a few markets where there are some restrictions due to due to commerce commercial commerce and compliance uh kind of rules and regulations other than that it's available worldwide so you can buy it in any region um and uh depending on on the requirements of language and depending on the requirements of data residency there are certain markets in which you know you may there may be extra consideration to take considerations to take care of before you can start using it but enough just ability to buy you're not restricted almost in no markets in the world you can buy it in every market awesome thank you okay kevin let's get a question here for you so i think of you kevin as one of our resident storytellers uh you have the great job of taking all the work that the team is doing and stitching it all together and and helping the customers understand really the value prop of everything that we're building so when you look at the october release wave or the wave 2 release plans what in there really stands out to you that is really the most compelling for our customers especially considering the times that we're in right now with kovid and what have you what are the areas that if you had to just pick two or three that you really wanted to make sure that message landed with the community as far as how the innovation can help them what would you say that would be that's quite an interesting mix really because for me as a as a someone that likes to try and bring together the aspects that are you know the portfolio of the dynamics platform the power platform as well when i look at the release notes and when i release about when i think about this event as well there's been a lot of content and a lot of thinking around the data and how do we leverage that data and when i kind of put my lens on that has been going through this year of the 2020s you know we've done a lot of work around how do we help our customers take their data to that next level and i like the way that we've been able to draw out through some of our capabilities and april highlighted a great example earlier around you know the the rpa the automation aspect of how we can start to take an insight and drive a direct activity because when we think about the world that we're in now a lot of us are stuck at home with our young ones or family members and so forth and it makes life a little interesting so we've had to automate and in and become a lot more innovative around how we can do our roles so when i think about finance and when i think about some of the tools that we have you know that the way we've been able to kind of expand upon the common data service how we've been able to expand upon the dual rights and the wider capabilities of being able to connect in our power bi dashboards and drive those sort of insights i think it's really started to help everybody understand you know what is important what isn't important and drive that particular focus so for me if i was thinking of it across the platform is the data the data has been the crux for us the insights that we're able to start driving with that data and then there's the great tool sets within finance that we can leverage to kind of create a an effective mobile app whether it be from an expense claim lens perspective or taking a little bit of information from the screen and creating a mobile experience or even going a little bit deeper and utilizing the powerapp perspective and providing an experience that is focused i think that's been really a really powerful tool set for us that's that's how i would look at it i hope that helps i i know i put you on the hot seat with that question and it's probably a hard one to answer just looking at all the capability that does come out but i thought you did it very well thank you okay we have a few minutes to the end let's um go to our published questions it doesn't look like we have any coming in on the chat so april and anand i'm going to ask for each of you to give just a two second highlight as far as your um since the april update or the wave 1 update through the wave 2 update what are just one or two items that you're most proud of that you and the team have delivered and april i'll have you go first and then anand you will follow all right great so i you know i'm going to go back to you know enabling the automation and ability to take action with intelligence i mean we're getting better and better and better at making sure we just complete end-to-end solutions that really complete full scenarios and we're doing it by taking advantage of all the great technology that microsoft has as well and so i think for showing intelligence and finance and automation you know finance has always been kind of a you know we got regulations to follow accounting rules and just being able to do this and doing it out of the box seeing the success and now seeing all the automation light up on it i just keep coming back to it's just it's just really enlightening to see the success that our customers are having when they're seeing they're using it preview and giving us the feedback so um i think that's a kind of a game changer for finance i think we'll continue to see that in finance and it won't be the finance of of the 2000 early 2000s and the 90s so um yeah it's it's very exciting very exciting time for for accounting so maybe your tagline on that is making finance you know absolutely fun and just having a great experience with finance and then especially with dynamics 365 finance so that's even better so that's wonderful making those great experiences so that's fantastic all right anand you are here to close us up what are the top two items for you so definitely the things that really pop to my mind are the two aspects one is the holisticness of of our solution now we really cover the end-to-end story of the user journey and all the fraud patterns that can happen across the journey and we have something in the product to protect against all those things so account fraud purchase fraud post purchase reverse logistic related fraud that's quite awesome i think in the market there are not many products like that and secondly i'm really kind of proud we are really proud as a team that you know we have offered so many extensibility options now somebody asked that question earlier as i replied that's that's really quite kind of amazing where we allow you to extend all the input side schemas but we also allowed to extend the product itself by taking the data out and doing much more with it than even that we could do for you so a very open open and broad product which allows you to like bring as many as much data as you want in and then do as much as you can with it and without insight and then finally just one last feel i'll do is that this is a product that is being used in production today by really big customers from hundreds of thousands to millions of transactions every day that scale that's something that is that that means that they're relying on us for their primary money making mechanism right like this is the lifeblood of businesses so it's extremely uh inspiring and it's also extremely satisfying to see this happen because that means that we are winning the trust of the customers and i'm really looking forward to our ability and our desire to help as many customers as we can you know become successful on this journey of digital transformation well that is a fantastic summary thank you guys so much so thank you very much to our experts we really appreciate you guys and also to the community thank you guys for joining and i hope you guys have a great rest of the conference thank you thank you
