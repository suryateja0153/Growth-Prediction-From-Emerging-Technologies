 I think of our society as an on demand society, right? We have everything from ride sharing, Uber, Lyft, other ride sharing services that are on demand. We have on demand shopping. I can use Amazon Prime, Amazon Prime now I get my groceries delivered to my house. I have on demand streaming of movies, TV shows and other videos through youtube, Netflix, Hulu and other other devices, other technologies. LIQID is like that. We provide the, the server infrastructure and resources you need to run a workload on demand in real time, in seconds. So I would say we (LIQID) closely matched the automatic culture that's existed in this existing, in our society now. I think some of the unique technologies that are out there, um, are, are these technologies, everything from Uber and Lyft, everything from on demand, video streaming, those sorts of technologies allow us to get what we want when we want it to save ourselves time, save ourselves money, make life more convenient. LIQID is the same way. We just happen to do it inside your data center and give you the resources you need to make the infrastructure exactly what you want it when you need it.
