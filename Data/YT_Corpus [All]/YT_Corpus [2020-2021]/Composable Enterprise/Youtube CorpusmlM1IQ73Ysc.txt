 We think one of the interesting aspects of HPE Synergy is that it's not truly a composable solution when it comes to things like GPU's. You don't have the ability to put GPU as a bare metal composable resource inside the synergy platform. You can buy compute nodes that have a GPU attached to it, but you do not have the ability to dynamically compose GPU inside the Synergy environment.
