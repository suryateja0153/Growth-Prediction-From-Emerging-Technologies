 Caution, to avoid overheating your storage system, you have 10 minutes to replace the I/O Module, once the failed I/O Modules has been removed from its bay. Attach your ESD wrist strap to an unpainted surface of the enclosure or rack. Caution, to prevent data loss, confirm that the SAS data cabling provides a redundant path to other enclosures and nodes. Confirm that the UID Locate LED is solid blue on the I/O Module to be replaced. This indicates that it is safe to remove. Confirm that all the cables attached to the I/O Module are labeled, noting their locations. If not labeled, label them with Node, Slot and Port information. Remove SAS cables by grasping the cable connector, pushing inward while pulling the long tab above the connector to release the cable from the port, and disconnecting the SAS cable. Caution, make sure that all cables are out of the way before proceeding. Fully loosen both captive thumb screws that secure the I/O Module release levers to its enclosure bay. If too tight, use a Torx T15 screwdriver to loosen the thumbscrews. Open both release levers simultaneously to disengage the I/O Module from the enclosure backplane and partially slide the I/O Module out if its bay. While supporting the I/O Module from underneath, fully slide it out of its bay. Caution, confirm the area in front of the empty bay is clear of any cables that might get snagged or damaged during the installation of the replacement I/O Module. With its release levers in their open position, carefully align and slide the I/O Module into its bay until the release levers begin to engage. Close the release levers to fully seat the I/O Module into the enclosure backplane. Fully tighten both thumb screws to secure the I/O Module to the enclosure. Replace all the SAS cables that were removed earlier, making sure that each cable is in the same location and fully connected.
