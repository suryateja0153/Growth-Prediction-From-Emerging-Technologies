 (gentle lilting music) - (speaking faintly) will be bigger for everyone. - I know, I'm so excited I don't even know what to do. - Oh, this one's on me. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, don't thank me, thank Engage & Grow they've been amazing for my business this quarter. - Engage & Grow, what's that? - You're an HPE Partner and you don't know what Engage & Grow is? - No. - Well, you could be earning even more than you are. Do you want me to tell you about the program? - Absolutely. - Well, the Engage & Grow program was created to be a very intuitive and easy way to earn points and ultimately, rewards. So, you will add to your HPE Partner PPID and your company address, and then signing on will be fast and easy. From there you can start earning points and start gaining the benefits of HP Engage & Grow, watch the training videos, and get more familiar with HPE products and solutions. Then, by selling HPE products, you'll really accelerate the process of earning points. Basically the more you sell the more you earn. Oh, and then this one's the best part. Redeem rewards, everyone's favorite part. You can redeem your points with a reloadable credit card that can be used anywhere that accepts major credit cards for purchases. And then lastly, stay active. HPE regularly adds new educational modules, and promotions to come back to the site often to discover new opportunities to earn points and to learn more about HPE products and solutions, and how to sell them. Before you know it you'll have enough points for a new set of golf clubs or maybe even a weekend getaway. - Or even both. - Thanks. That's everything you need to know to make earning and redeeming points as easy as possible. But if you need any assistance, just reach out to them online. - Oh, wow. Well, thanks for the information, girl. I'm to Engage & Grow my business and win all the way.
