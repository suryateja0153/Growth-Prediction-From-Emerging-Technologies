 the biggest frustration variety the way I I've seen it in in my time in the industry has been resource ownership and the capability to get what you want when you want it right so as a DB administrator versus a SAN administrator this versus a business owner right they all have different needs and I think simply through the fact that the infrastructure is static right it's so hard especially in this rapidly changing environment I think that the kind of the the data and business velocity has increased so dramatically that as a business we see folks not necessarily being a hundred percent sure what type of infrastructure and and and resources they need six months down the line let alone you know two three years down the line so I think the the biggest frustration out there has been I need the type of gear I need and the resources I need and they have to be augmented on a fly and and certainly the traditional business the traditional way of looking at infrastructure doesn't matter if you're looking at compute or storage has not been able to keep up with the business dynamics and kind of the the real-time needs of various applications so as we are introducing this way of configuring and reconfiguring and provisioning everything from servers to entire racks and and their respective applications running on top of it we're able to dynamically allocate the resources that the various stakeholders need when they need them so time to infrastructure time to data is something that liquid has been able to bring to bear in a very elegant fashion you [Music]
