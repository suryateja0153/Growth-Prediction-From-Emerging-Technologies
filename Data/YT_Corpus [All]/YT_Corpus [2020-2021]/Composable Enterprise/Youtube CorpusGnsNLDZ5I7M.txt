 ease of enablement right the ease of migration of what they have done from the dawn of IT right to the fact that they can truly deploy now trays of the segregated resources right so we've talked about trays of you know compute versus GPU versus nbme storage FPGAs and beyond that can be tied together over very low latency fabric and literally provision the types of servers at the bare metal of the way they absolutely want to for different workloads and set policies where they can reconfigure those resources on a fly and actually a multiple personalities where literally from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. you can run a different configuration at 101 p.m. you hit delete and you reconfigure the entire sandbox the entire rack the entire multiple racks whatever you have and use those resources in the completely different fashion but remember within the the fabric that I want that same configuration back to more morning at 6 a.m. right so I think it's literally that simple and it by the old saying is too good to be true they don't believe it until they see it what makes the whole value proposition even more powerful is the fact that either through our GUI or through our REST API or CLI nothing changes on the production software side right we assure for multi-tenancy of the various types of software while only the underlying bare metal infrastructure changes that's what's so unbelievable don't change what you're used to just make your entire infrastructure more efficient more agile to to meet all your business needs that change constantly you
