 from around the globe it's the cube covering HPE discover virtual experience brought to you by HPE hi everybody this is David auntie and welcome back if it keeps coverage of HP ease discover 20/20 the virtual experience the cube the cube has been virtualized we like to say I'm very happy to welcome in Neil MacDonald he's the general manager for compute at HPE great to see you again Neil wish you were face to face but this will have to do there well it's great to see you Dave next time next time we'll do this hopefully next year we'll see we'll see how things are going but I hope you're safe and your family is all good and and they say it's good to talk to you you know we've talked before many times I'm you know it's interesting just to know the whole parlance in our industry is changing even you know compute in your title and no long as you think about it's just sort of servers or a box you guys are moving to this as a service notion really it's kind of fundamental or or poignant that we see this really entering this next decade it's not going to be the same as last decade is it no I think our customers are increasingly looking at delivering outcomes to their customers and their lines of business and compute can take many forms to do that and it's exciting to see the evolution and the technologies that we're delivering and the consumption models that are our customers are increasingly taking advantage of such as dream-like yes so Antonio obviously and his keynote made a big deal and has in previous keynotes about Green Lake a lot of themes on on you know the cloud economy and as a service I wonder if you could share with our audience you know what are the critical aspects that we should know really around Green Lake well Green Lake is growing tremendously for us we run a thousand customers delivering infrastructure through the Green Lake offerings and that's backed by 5,000 people in the company around the world who are tuning and optimizing and taking care of that infrastructure for the customers there's billions of dollars of total contract value on the green light now and it's accelerating in the current climate because really what Green Lakes all about is flexibility the flexibility to scale up to scale down the ability to pay as you use the infrastructure which in the current environment is incredibly helpful for conserving cash and boosting both operational flexibility with the technology but also financial flexibility in in our customers operations the other big advantage of course at Green Lake is it frees up talent most companies are in the world of challenges in freeing up their talent to work on really impactful business transformation initiatives we've seen in the last couple of quarters even greater acceleration of digital transformation work for example and if all of your talent is tied up in managing the existing infrastructure and that's a drain on your ability to transform and in some industries even survive right now so green line can help with all of those elements and with all of the pressure from kovat it's actually becoming even more consumed by more and more and more customers around the world yeah right I mean I mean that definitely ties into the whole as a service conversation as well me to your point you know digital transformation you know the last couple of years is really accelerated by fifth you know I feel like in the last 90 days its accelerated more than that's good the last three years because if you weren't digital you really had no way to do business and as a service has really played into that so I don't if we could talk about your as a service you know posture and thinking well you're absolutely right David organizations that had not already embarked on a digital transformation I've rapidly learned in our current situation that it's not an optional activity those that were already on they're bothering to move faster and those that were NAR having to develop those strategies very very rapidly in order to transform their business and to survive and the really neat thing about Green Lake service offerings that we provide in that in that context is how it can accelerate the deployment many companies for example have had to deal with VDI deployments in order to enable many many many more of their workforce to be productive when they can be in the office or in the facility and a solution like Greenway can really help enable very very rapid deployment and build-out but not just VDI many many other workloads in high performance compute or in ASAP Hana for example are all areas that were bringing value to customers through that kind of as a service offering now a couple of examples nokia software is using green light to accelerate their research and development as they drive the leadership and the 5g revolution and they're doing that at a fraction of the cost of the public cloud we've got the new 'ti which has built a private cloud for artificial intelligence an HPC has been used to develop the next generation of autonomous software for cars and finally we've got salsa Porsche and formatic who have built a fully managed hybrid cloud environment to accelerate all their application development without having to fear the traditional costs of an over provisioned capex infrastructure so all of our customers are relying on that because compute and innovation is just at the core of the digital transformations that everybody is embarked on as they modernize their businesses right now and it's exciting to be able to be part of that and to be able to be there to help so of course in the tech business innovation is that you know the mainspring of growth and change which is you know constant in in our industry and I have a panel this week with dr. go talking about swarm learning and AI and that's some some organic innovation that HPE is doing but as well you've done some M&A as well recently you guys announced and we covered it a pretty major investment in pensando systems I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what what that means to the compute business specifically in HPE customers so our partnership with pensando is really really exciting and it's great to see the momentum that is building in delivering value to our customers at the end of the day we've been successful with pensando and building that momentum in very highly regulated industries and the value that is really intrinsic to pensando is the simplifying of the network architecture traditionally when you would manage an enterprise network environment you would create centralized devices for services like load balancing or firewalls and other security functionality and all the traffic in the data center would be going back and forth back and forth crumbling across the infrastructure as you sought to secure your underlying compute the beauty of the pensando technology is that we actually push that functionality all the way out to the edge at the server so whether those servers are in a data center whether they're in a colocation facility whether than the edge we can deliver all of that security service that would traditionally be required in centralized expensive complex unique devices that were specific to each individual purpose and essentially make that a software-defined set of services running in each node of your infrastructure which means that as you scale your infrastructure you don't have a bottleneck you're just scaling security capability with the scaling of your computer infrastructure it takes traffic off your core networks which gives you some benefits there but fundamentally it's about a much more scalable responsive cost-efficient approach to managing the security of the traffic in your networks and securing the compute endpoints with in your infrastructure and it's really exciting to see that being picked up in financial services in healthcare and other segments that have you know very high standards with respect to security and infrastructure management which is a great complement the technology from pensando and the partnership that we have with ensign to an HP and it's compact too we should share with our audience is basically the card that you stick inside of a server correct Neal that's exactly right if pensando is a PCIe card together with HPE servers fruits that security functionality in the server exactly where your data is being processed and the power of that is several fold it avoids the tromboney that we talked about back across the whole network every time you've got to go to a centralized security appliance it eliminates those complex single purpose appliances from the infrastructure and that of course means that the failure domain is much much smaller because your failure domains a single server but it also means that as you scale your infrastructure your security infrastructure scales with the server's so you have a much much simpler network architecture and as I say that's being delivered in environments with very high standards for security which is really a great endorsement of the pensando technology and be partnership at HP and pensando will have in bringing that technology to market for our customers so if I understand it correctly pensando is qualified for ProLiant Apollo and in edge lines my question is so if I'm one of those customers today what's in it for me are they sort of hopping on this for existing infrastructure or is it part of sort of new digital initiatives I wonder if you could explain so if you were looking to build our infrastructure for the future then you would ask yourself why would you continue to carry forward legacy architectures in your network with these very expensive custom appliances breach security function why not embrace a software-defined approach that pushes that to the edge of your network whether the edge are in coals are actually out on the edge or in your data centers you can have that security functionality embedded within your computer infrastructure taking advantage of Cassandras technologies so obviously things have changed specifically in the security space people are talking about this work from home and this room remote-access being a permanent or even a quasi permanent situation so I wonder if we could talk about the edge and specifically where Aruba fits in the edge how pensando complements that what's HP's vision with regard to how this evolves and maybe how it's been you know supercharged with Kovan pandemic so we're very fortunate to have the Aruba intelligent edge technology in the HP portfolio and the power of our technologies is focused on the analysis of data and the development of solutions at the site of the data it's generated increasingly the data volumes are such that they're gonna have to be dealt with at the edge and given that you need to be building edge infrastructure that is capable enough and secure enough for that to be the case and so we get a great compliment between the intelligent edge technology within the Aruba portfolio with all of the incredible management capabilities that are in those platforms combined with technologies like pensando and our HP compute platforms bring the ability to build a very cohesive secure scalable infrastructure that tackles the challenges of having to do this computer the edge but still being able to do it in both a secure and easily managed way and that's the power of the combination of Aruba HP compute and Sun well with the expanded threat surface with people working from home organizations are obviously very concerned about about compliance and being able to enforce consistent policies across this sort of new network so I think what you're talking about is it's very important that you have a cohesive system from a security standpoint you're not just bolting on some solution you know at the tail end your comment well security always depends on all the links of the chain and one of the most critical links in the chain is the security of the actual compute itself and within the HPE line platforms we've done a lot of work to build very differentiated and exclusive capability with our hardware or silicon root of trust which is built directly into silicon and that enables us to ensure the integrity of the entire food chain and the security of the platform runs up in ways that can't be done with some of the other hardware approaches that are prevalent in the industry and I actually brought some benefit in in financial terms to our customers because of the certifications that are enabled in the cyber catalyst designations that we've earned for the platforms so we also know from listening to your announcements with pensando and just observing security in general that this notion of micro segmentation is very important being able to have increased granularity as opposed to kind of a blob maybe you could explain you know why that's important you know the so what behind micro segmentation well it's all about minimizing the threat perimeter on any given device and if you can minimize the vectors through which your infrastructure will interact on the network then you can provide additional layers of security and that's the power of having your security functionality right down at the edge because you can have a security processor sitting right in the server and providing great great security of the note level you're no longer relying on the network management getting all of that right and you also have much much greater flexibility because you can easily in a software-defined environment push the policies that are relevant for the individual pieces of infrastructure in an automated policy driven way rather than having to rely on someone in network security getting the manual configuration of that infrastructure correct to protect the individual nodes and if you take that kind of approach and you embed that kind of technology in servers which are fundamentally robust in terms of the security because of the silicon root of trust that we've embedded across our platform portfolio with a mouse pro lion or synergy or blade system or edge line you get a tremendous combination as a result of these technologies and as I mentioned the other cyber catalyst designation is it's a pro point of that last year there were over 150 security products put forward for the cyber catalyst designation and only a handful were actually awarded onyx 17 of which 2 were HP compute and a robot and the power of that is that many organizations are now having deal with insurance for cybersecurity events and the catalyst designation can actually lead to lower premiums where the choice of the infrastructure that you've made is such as basically compute has actually enabled you to have a lower cost of insuring your organization against cybersecurity issues because infrastructure matters and the choice of infrastructure with the right innovation in it is a really critical choice for organizations moving forwards in security and in so many other ways yeah you mentioned a lot of things there Software Defined that's gonna enable automation and and scale you talked about the perimeter you know the perimeter of the traditional moat around the castle that's gone it's the perimeter there is no perimeter anymore it's everywhere so that whole you know weakest link in the chain and the chain of events and then the other thing you talked about was layers you know very very important when you talk to security practitioners you know building layers in so all of this really is factoring in security in particular is factoring into customer buying decisions isn't it well security is incredibly important for so many of our customers across many many industries and having the ability to meet those security needs head-on is really really critical we've been pretty successful in leveraging these technologies for many customers in many different industries one example is we have recently won multiple deals with Defense Intelligence Systems agency who you will imagine have very high standards for security worth hundreds of millions of dollars of of that infrastructure so there's a great endorsement from the customer set who are taking advantage of these technologies and finding that they deliver great benefits for them in the operational security of their infrastructure I wonder if I could ask you a question on the edge I mean as somebody who is you know with a company that is really at the heart of technology and I'm sure you're constantly looking at you know new companies M&A you know etc you know inventing tech but I want to ask you about the the architectures for the edge and just been thinking about a lot of data at the edge not all the data is gonna come back to the data center or the cloud there's gonna be a lot of AI inferencing going on in real-time or near real-time do you guys see different architectures emerging to support that edge I mean from a compute standpoint or is it is it going to be traditional architectures that support that it is clearly an evolving architectural approach because for the longest time infrastructure was built with some kind of hub you know whether or not a data center or in the cloud and all of the devices at the edge would be essentially calling home so edge devices historically have been very focused on connectivity on acquisition of data and then sending that data back for some kind of processing and action at some centralized location and the reality is that given the amount of data being generated at the Internet of giving the capability even of the most modern networks it's simply not possible to be moving those kinds of data volumes all the way back to some remote processing environment and then communicating a decision for action all the way back out to the edge first of all the networks can handle the volume data's involved if every device in the world was doing that and secondly the latencies are too slow they're not fast enough in order to be able to take the action needed at the edge so that means that you have to countenance systems at the edge that are now actually storing data that are not actually computing upon data and in a lot of aged systems historically they would evolve from very proprietary very vertically integrated systems to perhaps PC controller based systems with some form of IP connectivity back to some central processing environment and the reality is that if you build your infrastructure that way you finish up with a very unmanageable fleet you finish up with a very fragmented disjointed infrastructure and our perspective is that companies that are gonna be successful in the future have to think of themselves as an edge to cloud approach they have to be pursuing this in a way that views the edge the data center and the cloud as part of an integrated continuum which enables the movement of data when needed you are about the swarm learning that you talked about with my colleague dr. Cole where there's a balance of what is computed where in the infrastructure and so many other examples but you need to be able to move compute to where the data is and you need to be able to do that efficiently with a unified approach to the architecture and that's for us s like the HP data fabric come into play which enable that kind of unification across the different locations of equipment it also means you need to think differently about the actual building blocks themselves and a lot of edge environments if you take a classic 19-inch rack mount compute device that was originally designed for the data center is simply not the right kind of infrastructure so that's why we have offerings like the edge line portfolio in the the HPE product set because they're designed to operate in those environments with different environmental than you find the data center with different interfaces to systems of action and systems of control than you typically find in the data center environment yet still bringing many of the security benefits and the manageability benefits that we talked about earlier or a conversation today Dave so it's definitely going to be an evolving a new architectural approach at the edge and companies that are thoughtful about the choice of infrastructure are going to be much much more successful than those that take a more incremental approach and we're excited to be there to help our customers on that journey you know it's a very exciting time I mean you know much of the innovation in the last decade was find inside the data center and in your world a lot of times you know inside the server itself but what you're describing is this this end-to-end system across the network and that systems view and and there's gonna be a ton of innovation there and we're very excited for you thanks so much for coming on the cable is great for you again I was great too the Urim we're just excited to be here to help our customers and give them the best value for the workloads for the last taking advantage of Green Lake taking advantage of the innovative security technologies that we've talked about or being the edge to cloud platform as a service company that can help our customers transform in this distributed world from the edge to the datacenter to the cloud thanks for having me Dave you're very welcome awesome summary and always good to see you Neal thank you for watching everybody this is Dave Volante for the cube our coverage of the HP e discover 20/20 virtual experience but right back for this short break [Music]
