 I think the biggest myth related to cloud IT infrastructure today is the premise that everything is going to go public cloud. We're not believers that 100% of the data center infrastructure is going to live in public cloud, what we actually believe is in "Bi-Modal IT". Some amount of your infrastructure will live on public cloud and some amount of your infrastructure you're going to be responsible for. And again, what we deliver is we give you the flexibility and the agility that you get from public cloud on the infrastructure that you are forced to own. We believe that it's going to be a "Bi-Modal" environment where you have some mix of public cloud and on prem.
