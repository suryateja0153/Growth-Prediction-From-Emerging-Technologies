 next up we have dr vishal tapa and miss helen scott who will be telling us about their exciting work and vision at raytheon bbm can you please play their video hello everyone my name is bishchal tapa and my colleague helen scott i'm from a tactical data networks group at bbn and helen is from synthetic biology group today we are here to propose a concept of celeste a community environment for learning eco-science via testbed experiments so we're thinking of a research net kind of like what bbn did back in the day for darpa called arpanet that ultimately became internet and what we do today for dod where we build something called a mosaic internet or tactical internet where we're delivering the information to the tactical users in the forward operating areas and we believe that this work and experience can be reapplied to the challenges that we're discussing today uh for in this workshop smart oceans workshop next slide so our background is um you know building this uh kind of multi-domain heterogeneous network or network of networks uh which is called internet where the idea is all these sensors they need to be able to collect data share with every other node in the network be it from space under c or arial and then be able to compose them so that you can have a common operating picture so that somebody was acting on that information to either deploy certain assets or take some action they could do that so the whole concept is to be able to have a scalable network which actually has some deadlines so every you know step of the way you need to know that the messages have a utility and if you're delivering that you know beyond the deadline then it has no value so in the bottom left you see this is a simple you know a vision or the version of that internet the tactical internet the architecture looks uh kind of like in the right it's very generic you have the management and command and control function then you have this information management the heterogeneous information management and then how do you disseminate them where the idea is it's just subscribers and producers producers not like ip addresses that we think of in the internet so that somebody you know needs an uh information could get it in time and somebody who produces it can deliver it to the network in time and then ultimately all these sensors from various domain uh do their job uh to cover a certain area or certain domain so i think the problem that we're discussing today in a smart ocean is very similar maybe a little bit different data model maybe a slower timeline maybe we'll be using resource vehicles and academic sensors instead of dod sensors but i believe that the idea that you can get the right information to the right user in the right time while being able to prove their provenance so that you know where the raw data came from i think this is really useful for this community and we hope that bbn can contribute there uh let me pass this off to my uh colleague helen now special so just like michelle said you have these multi-domain network of networks of sensors and so that's something we also see in ecological research so instead of using those dod sensors or different void missions there we'd be using the academically supplied sensors so here we'd be using remote sensing data off of satellites aerially collected data from planes or drones ship based data things from buoys or moorings autonomous vehicles underwater gliders and floats and even human-collected data where you could be bringing in biological data from the lab and from the benchtop that you then want to get into this network so that other people can access it and so when you have this multi-domain network you're able to correlate things that you wouldn't have been able able to collect yourself so here you're able to see multiple types of data and connect things across the globe and much larger spatial and time scales which we think would be really important for a problem like this so you could just imagine a single student using this to retrieve a little bit of data to supplement their own research or much larger problems for ecological forecasting or something that really needs high demands of data at very fast time scales where you're needing lots and lots of data but you can't collect it all yourself so here you're able to do this thanks to all the interoperability and provenance that vishal's architecture gives you along with the name data query which makes it very easy for the scientists to access so this is something we're really really excited about and bbn has expertise in a lot of these fields we have expertise in networking and communications with people like the shaw we have a lot of expertise with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms there's an entire darker project we've been performers on about building this automated pipeline for non-experts like ecologists to build and test different machine learning algorithms we've worked with data management to bring in those legacy data sets um so that you can get that really long time scale especially important ecological data and we also have a synthetic biology group which does a lot of dna analysis including on e-dna so we are looking for partners other people who are interested in these types of problems with expertise in marine robotics remote sensing and people who are doing that sampling out in the field thank you very impressive thank you very much you
