 (upbeat music) For me personally, working on HPE Primera is incredibly rewarding. The primary reason? It's the people, it's the engineers, it's the others in product, it's marketing, it's sales, it's customers, it's partners. It's something that I wish everyone had the chance to see from where I'm sitting. We have people that just want to build something cool, something that solves problems, and we're doing it. We're having fun doing it. We're winning, winning big. We're going into a place in the market that frankly hasn't seen a lot of innovation in close to 20 years. That's fun, that's bold, and that's what gets people excited to come to work. What I specifically like about the product is that HPE Primera is not about the hardware, it's not about the software, it's not just about the analytics. That's all important, but the fact that we bring it all together, all these teams working together to come to market with a solution, and we go beyond just the storage, something that just storage companies can't do. We also know that it's incredibly important for our customers to do it. And because it's all backed with HPE InfoSight, not only does it tie seamlessly into their current infrastructures, also their future infrastructures, but it's really starting to bring some powerful insights into helping them get more out of their IT.
