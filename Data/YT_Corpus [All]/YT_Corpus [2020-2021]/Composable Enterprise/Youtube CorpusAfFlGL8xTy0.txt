 Some of the biggest risks around migrating to the cloud Really has to do with cost expense, right? The cloud is very easy but once you get to a certain scale is just not very cost-effective There's a couple of hidden costs inside the cloud environments that customers don't necessarily always realize it might be Inexpensive for you to upload your data to the cloud. But what about when you want your data back? What is the cost to pull your data back down off of public cloud? That's one aspect of it? And also the other thing we need to think about is next-generation workloads If you're doing a standard workload that uses a simple x86 processor with a little bit of storage and a little bit of networking those types of instances can be Available on the cloud in a relatively cost-effective manner when we start thinking about next-generation workloads workloads that leverage GPUs workloads that leverage FPGAs workloads that leverage high connectivity of six or eight sixteen GPUs inside of a single cluster Now those types of machines are not very cost effective to rent or lease on the cloud, right? So what we're realizing is for certain workloads It's actually much more cost efficient to do it on Prem than it is to do it on the cloud So the hidden part of the cloud number one is the expense Associated to getting off of the cloud and bringing your data back home. And then the other side of it is the actual workload What workload are you actually deploying? Some of those workloads are well suited for cloud environments and some of those workloads For example, next-generation GPU centric workloads. Those are going to be very expensive to run on public you
