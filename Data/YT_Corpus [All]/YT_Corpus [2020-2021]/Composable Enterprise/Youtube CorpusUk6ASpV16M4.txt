 Attach your ESD wrist strap to an unpainted surface of the enclosure or rack. Caution, once the Adapter Card blank is removed, you will have up to five minutes to install the new Adapter Card to avoid overheating of your Primera Storage System. Remove the Adapter Card blank from the slot. Carefully align and slide the new Adapter Card into its node slot, and press firmly to fully seat it. Note, you may need to press very firmly to fully seat some adapter cards. Tighten the captive thumb screw to secure the Adapter Card.
