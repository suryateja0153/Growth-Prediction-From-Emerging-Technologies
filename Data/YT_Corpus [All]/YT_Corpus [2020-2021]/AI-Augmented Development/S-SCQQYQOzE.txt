 hi guys welcome back to my channel and in today's video we're going to talk about three tools you need to build an ar app [Music] so unlike in smartphone applications where we experience the app through a 2d screen in ar you experience it in the real world because it's virtual objects blended into the real world so what that means is you need 3d models to build your ar experience there are various ways to get hold of 3d models the most traditional way of doing it is using 3d modeling software like blender maya or zbrush which people have used for years to build their 3d models but these require a steep learning curve it might take a couple of years for you to master them well enough to build anything you want for scratch more easier way to get 3d models is of course get 3d models that others have made and there are plenty of sites available like turbosquid or google poly which have millions of 3d models available for download and anything you could think of you'll probably find there and you could just mix and match what you need to build your ar app and these are mostly free models to use and some of them of course are paid especially the higher quality ones but this is a route that i would highly recommend for someone who is a beginner ar developer and whose main skills are in programming because what you want to do is focus your skills focus your time on building the app and not worrying about the art which uh is essentially a different skill set the final way of building 3d models is to use vr to sculpt your models now this is a bit less common unconventional and a bit less established for obvious reasons how does this work well you can see i've got a vr headset back in my shelf and with this i've got access to sculpting softwares like gravity sketch oculus medium or google blocks and these essentially allow you to build your 3d models by sculpting them with your hands or your controllers so this is a much more intuitive way of doing things so it's much faster to learn and much more easier which makes it attractive for beginners but the downside is it's less customizable and it's not very functional yet what that means is you probably could build a prototype model and you might need to point it off to the more traditional softwares like zbrush or blender to polish it off before it's usable in your ar experiences but that's today in a couple of years time i'm pretty sure this will become advanced enough to replace the entire 3d production pipeline and if that happens it's great because beginners can get into 3d modeling much quicker so these are the various ways of building a 3d models and out of this the ones that i would recommend are to first use 3d models available online through sites like turbosquid and then if you want to build something a bit more of your own to use vr if you have a vr headset to sculpt your model so now you've got a 3d content next thing to do is to breathe life into that 3d world using programming so for ar to happen the phone through its camera needs to see the real world and make sense of it it needs to understand the context it needs to understand where objects are like their table your bed your floor your walls it needs to understand where they are so they could realistically place virtual objects in your surroundings so take a simple example if you want to place a say a flower pot on your table a virtual flower pot on your table the phone will first understand that there's a horizontal plane which is the table and then once it's detected that it will then place the virtual flower pot on it and this requires heavy and a lot of computer vision and machine learning and lucky for us most of this we don't need to build it ourselves so fresh instead apple has provided a framework called ar kit which lets you use these out of the box ar kit is great because it has most of the ar functionalities that you would ever need and the latest one arcade 4.0 even has a location anchor feature so what that means is say if you want to place your ar objects into a different location say you want to place a virtual object in the eiffel tower so you can go to apple maps and place it there and it would appear there for everyone using your app so that's pretty interesting feature that i find so apart from ar kits you would also need to use scene kit and scene kit is apple's take on a games engine and essentially does all the heavy lifting you need to build a 3d experience so in summary you will need ar kit in conjunction with scene kit to build quality ar experiences for the apple ecosystem this is more so the case if you are building productivity apps for example or utility apps where you would need those native ios components to build a polished experience but say if you're building something more 3d intensive or say a game for that this tag would not be ideal instead something better to use would be unity and euphoria so unity is a very popular games engine used by the games industry to build games and before you is of course a framework which you can use with unity to build ar experiences so the advantage of using unity for building games is that it is a more mature game engine platform firstly and that means it has most of the heavy lifting done for you in terms of things like say collision detection or other physics that you need to build a 3d game secondly most importantly is that with unity with one codebase you can target multiple platforms it's a cross-platform engine that's not something i can do with xcode and cnk10ar kit but of course the downside of using unity then is that you won't get access to those native ios components which will be extremely useful for building things like productivity apps or utility apps so now that you've got the 3d modeling done and used ar kit and scene kit to build the ar experiences it's time to move on to the third and final tool and that is testing unfortunately you can't use the simulator and xcode to test your ar app instead you would need an actual device and what you would need is any device that has an a9 chip or higher and this essentially means iphone 6 and above so these are the different things you would need to build an ar app in summary they were number one 3d models and for this highly recommend sites like turbosquid to get premade assets and number two was ar kit and scene kit to build their functionality into your ios device and finally testing device which is basically any ios device which has at least an a9 chip to test the ar app so with these three tools you can build any ar app that you want for the apple ecosystem that brings us to the end of our video today and if you're interested in more augmented reality tutorials do
