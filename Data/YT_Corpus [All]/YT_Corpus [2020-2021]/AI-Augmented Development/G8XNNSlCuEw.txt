 a very good afternoon to all of you all of you look pretty dry and and rested here so I am the co-founder and CEO at Prowler.io we are a Cambridge based company about for those of you are not from UK it's about a 45 minute ride north of here about a hundred plus staff we've been around for roughly three years till date we published about thirty-eight papers filed about nine patents and the areas that we operate in are all the way from logistics to finance and assessment and education the first part of my talk is really going to be about focusing on human machine teaming and how the real world applications happen and lowry vitae and my colleague from month autumn life is going to follow on and specifically talk about more in detail around asset management but before I go any further into my talk on human machine teaming and real-world applications of AI I want to start between I would like to start from how Europe can lead in air and machine learning so the first thing we need to do in Europe in order to lead the air and machine learning revolution that's coming along is to start by believing in ourselves if you look at the news over the last 12 months and you read the books and the popular press it will have you believe that somehow we are in some sort of bipolar world in which there is a clash of civilizations happening between the US on one side and China or the other whereas the rest of us in the middle are just waiting around helplessly to see who wins and then see what we do the question is really now the combined population of China and us is 1.7 billion people which we all know is a lot of people but that leaves about 6 billion of us in the middle and we aren't really hanging around twiddling our thumbs waiting for something to happen and a good illustration of this is the graphic that was posted just before new reps which is arguably the most prominent air and machine learning conference in the world that showed as per the first author affiliations the name the number of papers are published and rightfully so the top five are very large and respected technology companies in the US but at number six highlighted here for ease of reading is a small company in Cambridge namely probably at i/o which is which is not doing too badly now we have to look at these results in the context of the investments and the efficiency of technology development so let's look at this graph from a slightly different angle so what we see here is that per dollar spent we as a European company are orders of magnitude more efficient than any other company out there and that's what we in Europe are really good at building efficient solutions and specifically this will have a major implication on the future of a and machine learning where efficient ability to learn with small amounts of data will define the success of the next generation of companies in AI focused on real world problems like asset management not just extension and so forth and we'll come to that in a bit so one of the reasons so what this really shows us that size does not really guarantee success there's a lot more success than just mere size so one of the reasons why all of us here in the audience and I'm sure all of you have some sort of a smartphone of a type are able to flare out anywhere in the world flip the phone out of a pocket and make a phone call and your phone works everywhere is down to the fact that in the 1980s European governments and European companies decided to work together to build the GSM standard the AI and machine learning industry today reminds me of the 1980s of the mobile industry where there was a huge amount of fragmentation both in terms of technology and interoperability so for AI to really reach its full potential we need some sort of standardization so they can avoid all this wasteful work that we keep doing on and on and on so what we really need is something that I like to call the global system for AI so there was the global system for mobile for mobile communications and what Europe needs now is a GSA I or the global system of air and machine learning we definitely have the talent we definitely have the ideas and we most definitely have the culture to do that so for Europe to succeed together with a right will and the right effort there is no reason why we could not lead in air and machine learning 15 years a little bit and let's move on to human machine teaming and the real-world impact of AI so what are the key questions that we asked ourselves at collared i/o that if AI and machine learning is not going to help you make better decisions what's the point so that's our starting point if you read the popular press they talk about three big waves of AI and the first one being about numerical input I remember my days from being a high school student in India we in order to log tables as to have a pic book how many out here who've ever used log tables in a book okay so somebody have definitely suffered so when I went to the University I was handed my first scientific calculator and it was pure magic right as far as I was concerned it was very intelligent are you guys able to hear me over the rain it's alright the second way over here has been all about perception categorization and made possible by the good work that happens with deep neural nets now that's all well and good if the focus is to do classification of family photographs you know take off your cats and dogs or the photographs and see how many there are or if you are interested in you know board games and video games and so and so forth but when it comes to real-world mission-critical applications time and again we have seen that deep learning simply doesn't work so that's what brings us to the third generation we are right now at the dawn of the third wave of AI which is all about making decisions decisions that can improve the efficiency of of companies of corporates improve resource allocation and at Prahlada Rio we pride ourselves in being a decision company our goal is to ensure that businesses are powered by AI sorry businesses are powered by people and empowered by AI and to that end we focus our energies do our research and that guides us every day so what kind of decisions does our AI enable in the finance industry we do ask management but I leave Lori to talk about that in terms of logistics we work with our customers who manage hundreds of millions of assets every day and we are helping them save tens of millions of dollars in terms of improved efficiency not that benefit is just from the bottom line but the byproduct of that is that significantly less resources are being used and thereby also reducing the carbon footprint of our customers massively and that's important with our customers in education they are working with us to roll out new products which will make personalized education much better there will be a lot of announcements coming in the third and the fourth quarter of this year on that so stay tuned when we talk to our partners in the industry and our customers one point that keeps coming up is that while there's been a lot of talk about explain ability of AI over the past 12 18 months they keep telling us that explain ability is not enough what they want is AI that can be trusted to work inside an enterprise environment and not go wrong to start with in the first place so in other words we need to build air solutions and air platforms that go hand in hand in building trust inside the organization's I'm not sure how many of you have read Rachel Boltzmann's book about technology and trusts but I would really recommend that and there's a very interesting quote from there in which rachel says that Trust is not a nicety a kind of an optional extra our very lives depend upon it similarly inside enterprises real jobs real people real families depend upon us ensuring that in AI enable systems can be trusted and so it's very important to incorporate that into your design from day one rather than have that as a bolt-on separately so that gets us to a point of what is trust according the Cambridge English dictionary for obvious reasons I couldn't use the Oxford business prediction area here to trust is to believe that someone is good and honest and the Lord harm you and that something is safe and reliable and this has to be a key part of the design that we do for our systems in order to build systems that can be trusted and be relied on the AI within the system should be able to answer the following four questions how does the AI know that is right how does the AI know that it's wrong how does the AI know that it's going to go wrong and how do we trust our AI to even ask the right questions the reason why our customers trust us is that we always start by focusing on the business problem and agreeing on common KPIs and after that because the solutions that we have built don't require millions upon millions of data points but can already get to very effective decisions with hundreds or even tens of data points allows for getting us to answers fairly quickly sorry I think I clicked too fast or something go right so allows us to get to the answers very quickly and the other bit that we really focus on when we talk to our customers is that we don't over promise we focus on our strengths we focus on ensuring that what we are building is well explained within the organizations that is well trusted through a strong human-machine teaming factor and a key element of our technology stack is that to make sure that our AI is able to fully understand its own incompetence and that's key because there's going to be lots and lots of scenarios in daily operations of any company but it's absolutely critical for the AI to understand this incompetence and hand over control to the humans without anything going dramatically wrong beat the financial markets and beat the future autonomous car that you're driving maybe the autopilot in aircrafts or any of those use cases it is really fundamental to any execution of the platforms and to give you some of the examples on the kind of benefits we've had for our customers over the last few months with our trusted systems is in logistics we've been able to reduce the failed pick ups for a very large Logistics customer by about seventy five percent we've been able to improve the asset allocation by 17 percent and the number of trucks required in a fleet by about 15 percent and these are all massive numbers resulting in potentially tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of savings for our customers but the important point is even bigger that not just we are improving the top line the bottom line of our customers but we are really showing businesses that they can continue to thrive and grow by using much fewer resources that they had ever planned and also having much lower carbon emissions so this is really the impact that having a trusted and explainable business brings to the world of business and with that I'll hand over to Lori who has some really good stuff to say how they're using our platform thank you very much thank you for sure thank you terrific Chris let me ask you a question be shell you're the chief exec of Prowler dot IO what's the biggest decision facing you as you take the company through this next 12 months so we're to have our next international headquarters there is only one answer vigil is London tech week where are you where are you trying to choose between so there's a we've been talking to a few governments and they've been inviting us to open their offices I hope I'll be able to make an announcement over the next two three months well those rose petals over there are from London and partners who will welcome you later Vishal thank you so much fantastic our next guest knows a thing or two thank you for shell about extreme weather all the way from Helsinki for those of you who don't already know Manderson life is one of Finland's most respected financial services providers it has over three hundred thousand individual and over 20,000 business customers and I'm provided to say that Lauri Vaittinen is here to present thank you ladies gentlemen three thank you so after Vishal I'm the boring insurance guy come from Finland as from madam life which is part of sample group not sure if any of you know actually is sample group here no that's what I expected but we are the largest insurance group of financial group in Nordics seventh largest in Europe and actually 22nd in the world so there is fairly sizable business in this area in Finland and I'm today talking about this or more asset management side so we are doing both asset management for our own balance sheet but also for external clients and why I am here is that we are doing cooperation with Prowler so we are building sort of the next generation AI driven statistical models and products based on that so how I think how the sort of quant in investing is developing I think it's a certainty that many of the models processes that that nowadays are driven by human built models they will be replaced by AI and if you think of for example even even nowadays all the millions of amateur traders using different type of graphics tools to do technical analysis that is one example of statistical analyzes where human tries tries to build a model and tries to make a profit out of it in in a fairly sort of efficient markets or actually now they're super efficient market and if you think of that process how sort of ridiculous it is that a single human in an efficient market could make systematically profit out of out of that type of process compared to where the AI is already nowadays and even if you think of the huge hedge fund industry it is where there's sort of trillions of euros dollars managed with actually still mostly human built built algorithms statistical models and actually large part of that let's take I'm not sure how many of you know trend-following it's a it's a fairly common hedge fund strategy where you try to identify trends out of the market which is called momentum in investing or trendy investing most of those models are still they are they they based their origins somewhere in 80's 90's and most of the hedge funds still use last part of their models are based on those sort of 30 year old models and actually you can replicate the average of those hedge funds who run actually on average several hundred billions of euros based on those models you can replicate the performance of those hedge funds with fairly simple very simple statistical models and and if you think of that it's for me it's it's a no-brainer that those models will be replaced by more sophisticated models of course they are nowadays very sophisticated hedge funds that have millions or hundreds of millions to invest in the technology but still most of those technology is today run by human stations or quant analysts and and that's why I think it's super interesting to cooperate with with I was like Prowler and actually to try to develop the sort of next-generation trading systematic models so how we do is that actually we bring this sort of more traditional background to it so we provide all the execution the expertise on these more traditional type of models that that we have been running internally and also been investing into various hedge fund systematic strategies for for tens of years but what we say that that is the starting point and then with the help of Prowler to try to improve those models and at least so far actually we have seen similar type of improvements as visual showed in the logistics we can see that it's fairly easy with AI to improve the models but of course what is the most important thing is actually what what we should open up on how Prowler is working that is both you need to have sort of understandable AI you have to have a transparent AI but also you have to have AI that you can work alongside with humor models so actually how we see it when we're doing this cooperation that we have we have been able to actually understand what AI is doing what we would never do is is that we would plug in our execution let's say to some watts on AI and and give it sort of free hands to trade whatever it wants but what we want to actually to say that this is the starting point this is the trading model what that we want to improve and then we see what are the improvements that the AI does and does they do they make sense or not and and we start from the pure statistical models that actually in the first place you can say because they are human built statistical models that it's completely different from having let's say model that that has some sort of economic rationale valuation model is different thing than a statistical model that that is based on on price patterns so we see this as a sort of optimal combination and an optimal company to work with because we have been able to understand how the models have been improved and we are already sort of in a production production phase internally running these AI powered models and we are going to actually introduce first products based on on this AI improvement very soon so we are very excited on the cooperation and as at the moment even even for regulatory reasons I don't have any more details about it but it's very exciting project and bit on abstract level but very very nice being been working with the company now for two years and so so that part very shortly was about to say but in the speaker session I can I can tell you more more data as if you're interested on that
