 [Music] all right since it is 4:10 berkley time I think we are four o'clock Berkeley time I think we can get going all right so good afternoon distinguished guests fellow faculty current and former Golden Bears and all manner of friends welcome to Berkeley's annual Fleet Admiral Chester W Nimitz Memorial Lecture ship and national security affairs which since 1985 has hosted a distinguished scholar military professional or government official for a series of lectures on national security subjects I'm captain Travis putzel I'm the professor in naval science and the commanding officer of Berkeley's Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps unit which is composed about 50 young men and women who have volunteered to serve their country as officers in the United States Navy or Marine Corps after they earned their undergraduate degrees this unit was one of the original six such units established across the nation in 1926 Berkley also hosts Army and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps units all under the military affairs program in the College of Letters & Science it's an absolute privilege to work with the talented students in Berkeley's ROTC programs but I'm also very fortunate to work with the esteemed and supportive faculty here at Berkley such as professor Daniel Sargent and his fellow members of the Military Officers Education Committee I'm particularly lucky to have as my direct boss Dean of undergraduate studies professor Bob Jacobsen an avid supporter both this lecture series and of educating tomorrow's military officers so that they serve our nation with honor courage and commitment please welcome Dean Jacobsen who will introduce today's speaker [Applause] [Music] welcome to this year's lecture in honor of Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz many of us know Admiral Nimitz from the Titanic struggles of World War two in the Pacific his leadership and will to fight help shorten that war significantly because this is California his accomplishments in the Pacific were recognized by naming a highway after him but actually his career stands for much more there's an important context to his eventual success before that work war broke out in the earlier parts of Admiral Nimitz's career or to be Admiral Nimitz's career he chose to work on some of the most complex and important issues of the time he worked on technology that was not certain to be a success diesel propulsion he worked on the question of personnel which was a very hard problem to be resolved in a peacetime Navy and as the Midshipmen know he created the ROTC program including this unit which was one of the first six all these efforts were forerunners to his success the country's success during the Second World War although his leadership during the war was important his role in preparation for any future even a future that was completely unexpected and people didn't want to contemplate was also of great importance that kind of commitment to engaging on important questions preparing for and advancing into the future I want to think as a Berkeley characteristic our job your job is to consider the future and do what you can to be ready for it in that spirit I am very pleased to announce and welcome tonight's Nimitz Speaker Air Force general Ellen Kowski how'd I do although not a Berkeley ROTC graduate as her undergrad was at the New Jersey Institute of Technology she came to Berkeley for a PhD in chemical engineering right after that and she got it in three years so if they're any graduate students in the audience you can do that too she then started a distinguished career in the Air Force in which she worked on key problems facing the air force in the country atomic energy counter-proliferation chemical and biological defense airborne lasers military satellite communications and reconnaissance that's pretty cool that's a great set of problems that need to be dressed by thoughtful people then echoing Admiral Nimitz's determination to work on preparation for wars that nobody wants to come all of these questions have to be addressed like Nimitz she even took on the key question of personnel serving is that I love this title I wish some day I would have this title the chief of the revolutionising training division of the aeronautical system center at wright-patterson Air Force Base I mean I work on just trying to keep Berkeley saying the idea of revolutionising training is very daunting most recently after achieving the rank of four-star general and led the Air Force Materiel Command again remember the preparation is one of the most important things you can do since her retirement she's become a judge whitney professor at USC engineering which i claim is a big deal that's a good engineering school she teaches the systems architecting an engineering course which is probably an incredible experience for her students she's a member of the National Academy of Engineering which is also a big deal and she's here to address us all with their thoughts thank you for coming general Pollak ask [Applause] all right well first of all I want to thank the committee and the Navy ROTC unit here for inviting me to come and speak this is I cannot tell you what a tremendous honor this is you know we all go through our life not sure where our lives are going to take us but to think that I could come back to my alma mater and get a chance to share with you my thoughts in fact as we were as I was looking at the agenda I realize so many memories flooded back my first year I lived in an international house I had a little room in the back and I you know as a graduate student I heard I finished in three years well I worked long hours and I didn't go to football games but I had the opportunity to hear every minute of it through the back and I walked and then I lived on Ellsworth Avenue the next year so I got a chance to walk through the campus in fact I was reflecting my first year here I really since it was the College of chemistry I don't think I ever got south of Sproul Plaza or north of spouts brow Plaza the whole year I was here and I have to tell you when I I made the decision to go to graduate school after commissioning and to take a delay from going on active duty and that was certainly something I had never thought about doing I remember I one of my chemical engineering professors said to me you know we you know you're really good at this and we think you ought to go to graduate school on you you can get somebody to pay for it because you know you got good enough grades and I'm thinking I don't want to go to school anymore I'm ready to go out and serve right but I went ahead because I had a passion all right any engineering students out here I had a passion for thermodynamics right Georgiana and the man in the whole world who was studied was the not just the father but the grandfather of something called molecular thermodynamics was lived right here at Berkeley and that was John presidents and so I made up my mind okay I'm gonna go to graduate school and now I'm in ROTC in 1978 and I decide I'm going to go to Berkeley now some people in this room understand what that meant that was just at the end of the Vietnam War or was over but it wasn't completely over in the hearts and minds and Berkeley was known as one of the nests of protests and disagreements so I had my RTC classmate saying what are you doing are you nuts why are you going what are you gonna do going out there you but but I just had such a passion to study thermodynamics with John Proust it's that I didn't care and I have to tell you I believe I am here today because of that decision not because they invited me because I was an alum but because of what I was able to accomplish because you know the military is a very structured organization you guys are probably figuring that out right you you know and it's that way on purpose but this country does not have a standing army we are all citizen soldiers sailors airmen Marines Coast Guardsmen and when you come to a place like Berkeley the thing that I discovered at out Berkeley was the freedom that you have it Berkeley to think and to innovate and so what I got from my years at Berkeley was an understanding of the tremendous power an ability to accomplish things that can come from opening up that creativity in your own mind and being willing to take the courage to take on things that others may think are impossible and because of that experience that I had here I had an amazing career of taking technologies and putting them to good use for our national security and I like to say it that way I believe that my job as an Air Force officer as a technologist as an acquisition officer was to ensure that all of those young men and women many of them are sitting here now that voluntarily put themselves in harm's way to protect our freedom do so knowing that the things we give them to fight and defend themselves is going to work or going to work and they're going to work every time and so I can sit back now and look at 40 years and be proud of the fact that I was able to take that innovative spirit that creativity that sometimes got me into trouble right professor Smith but I was able to take that and turn it into something that was good not just for this country but I believe for the world the thing I learned them about that time and as I reflected on my career is just how much technology has impacted the way we fight wars and the way we protect our freedom so I decided that given the opportunity to come back to Berkeley I would go back to my roots and talk about how much technology has affected warfare and national security in the past take a look at what are those technologies that are going on today and it's an exciting time in national security for a technologist I it's it's just an amazing time at what how has that changed the way those young men and women protect us how we conduct military operations what our national security looks like and then if you will allow me I'd like to kind of project a little bit give you my opinion about what I think warfare will look like in the future I'll take a look at about 20 years which I think I can do a pretty good job of projecting since I spent 40 years in the Air Force I can think back about you know how much things have changed I'll look at 50 years and then I'll look at a hundred years and frankly at a hundred years my opinions as good as yours but I've got this microphone so you get to listen to mine so let's start out with the man that this speech this speaking series is all about and that's Admiral Nimitz and I have to admit I didn't know much about Admiral Nimitz except for the fact that he was the head guy in charge in the Pacific so I went and did a little bit of homework after I accepted this speaking engagement pretty handsome guy huh he was a an Academy grad not in order to see a grad which is a shame because he didn't get that opportunity to have that ROTC experience that's what I tell all my Academy friends you know but much of what he did when he wasn't fighting was as the Dean pointed out was getting ready for the next war and he was a technologist as much as he was a fighter in fact during the interwar years between World War one and World War two he was a big part in testing and implementing underway refueling which was critical in World War two particularly in the Pacific without underway refueling ships had to go back to a port in order to be able to steam so this was a critical aspect of our world war two capability and then his brilliance during World War two left without you I know all my Navy can Patriots know the story of Pearl Harbor and how it changed much about well how the Navy conducted the war because we lost so many ships but Admiral Nimitz had not just the trust of technology but the courage to take technology places that others wouldn't and here's a guy who pretty much was known for surface warfare and submarines that crafted the island-hopping campaign that was used to get to March our way to Japan during World War two he relied on on aircraft carriers he relied on aircraft it was so I mean to think I think back about some of the generals that I've met in the Air Force who refused to get out of what they did back in 1982 and this was a man who had trained for years on surface warfare that conducted an air campaign truly a man that deserves a speech that talks about technology and its impact on warfare so without that let's take a look at what he had to work with that really World War two changed warfare in more ways I believe than any other experience in in modern time and Counting the Civil War and there were a number of things that allowed us to do this think back now everybody always tries to win the last war World War one trench warfare chemical weapons masses of people killed firing at each other over a no-man's land so a lot of what was focused on in between World War 1 and World War 2 was to avoid being in that and a lot of that had to be ability to for speed and to be able to reach long distances and that was one of the major focuses of aircraft and aircraft engines so aircraft during World War one were pretty much just mano-a-mano battles some reconnaissance the and then in World War two they became a way to overcome that tyranny of distance and to and to be able to get somewhere and effectively provide bombs on target with speed air the UH I think I'm going the wrong way sorry about that oh I'm going the wrong way I got to get back to my chart okay so but when you got there in the old time you could slob them over and it was not very good not very precise so we had this thing called the Norden bombsight which allowed bomba deers to precisely drop bombs and so instead of world war ii was personified not by masses of people on two ends of living in trenches and trying to kill each other by with machine guns but our models of aircraft bombers protected by fighter aircraft hundreds and and dozen and and dozens and dozens of them effectively eliminating any issue with eight now don't get me wrong boots on the ground is still important but the world war two was defined and was won because of the effectiveness of air power both in helping the naval operations in the Pacific and in in in Europe when it comes to the strategic bombing campaign and then keep and then there were the submarines and torpedoes that was a way to surprise torpedos by the way was something else that Nimitz Admiral Nimitz work done that was a whole new now so think about this we just recently established a space force right so now we have a space domain we think about today it's actually been a little bit longer world war to define two new domains under sea and in the air completely changing the way you think about naval operations because now you've got to worry we you've got this as an effective tool and you got to worry about it and in the air and then you know just radar radar was used in so many ways but another way to be able to bring lethality precisely was radar aimed proximity fuses so this changed the way we conducted the war and then I like this one you know we like to talk about cyber but really the whole activity started with with the codes in intercepting codes which if you through strap elite back is that control the spectrum right and intercepting the spectrum and by the way I want to point out that that is a woman because during World War two the majority the cryptologist that were in the navy cryptology in Virginia were women graduates of college that had mathematics degrees and they worked long hours in in very very poor conditions so that's another thing that's so great about this country is our embracing of the value of diversity and how this truly was in all of country activity so these were the things that Admiral Nimitz had and that we had that really changed the way wars were fought and at and of course the ultimate GameChanger was how the United States ended the war which was the application of nuclear power or nuclear weapons why don't just we'll get back to this a little later in it but know that in World War one chemical weapons were used pretty frequently you notice they weren't used in World War two if at all if then you it was used only a little bit but the nuclear weapon was a key part of ending the war so I know there's a few people that have hair with colors kind of like mine and gray so we all remember that there really wasn't an inner war year because we want to right into the Cold War and I bring that up because that new technology that nuclear weapon that nuclear capability really defined the Cold War and the Cold War once again was a complete change to the way the United States conducted national security we are a nation as I pointed out that never likes to have a standing army and we were faced with a very large force in Europe and we did not want to take that on so we had what my good friend former deputy secretary Bob work calls the first offset our first offset two masses of military was this nuclear weapon and for those of us who lived during that time this was all about our national security was all about this threat of of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union we had mass the way we defended it was something called mutual assured destruction which says you destroy me I'll destroy you that's not exactly the most appealing strategy but that's what it but that's what it was but it also did more than just influence the military anybody recognize this picture here how many in this room hit under their desk in practicing for a nuclear attack I kid you not I know the rest of you those of you who weren't around or looking at us like we were nuts but Homeland Security we used to go into in your school and you would practice if there was a nuclear attack we would go go under our desk or go into the basement of the school and huddle in in the hallways and people actually had these underground facilities for if we had a nuclear attack Warriors were no longer just flying in airplanes they were sitting in silos below by the way the silo still looks like this underneath the ground so that they would be protected and we could launch that nuclear weapon if we were attacked because the he would survive at least long enough to launch so less the weapons so we actually had a viable and mass mutual assured destruction but growing up this is what we thought about right this is what we thought about this was what national security was protecting our country protecting our homeland from this threat and and we waited with bated breath every time the President of the United States would get together with the president of the Soviet Union or was he a president was that the title used I don't even remember anymore but to talk and it was a game it was a it was a game of Russian roulette at times we went through the Cuban Missile Crisis which was an example of oK you've stepped too far because the Russians had put Soviets have put nuclear weapons or we're going to put nuclear weapons on Cuba this was the Cold War very different from World War two in the nature of how warfare was thought and the nature of where our our priorities were and it was the Cold War and it was none of this would have happened without the technology development of nuclear weapons so think about this we use nuclear weapons in anger twice and no one has ever used them again so I think this is a pretty good national security strategy now the question is is it going to be good enough in the future we'll talk about that so now we go to 1990 and you know these nuclear weapons are great for keeping a power that's got nuclear weapons but there's things else going on in the world in which we have to be able to protect our interests and in 1990 the the nation of Iraq invaded Kuwait and this was considered a threat to our national interest and so we went to war again but you know what it wasn't dozens and dozens of bombers accompanied by fighter aircraft that we use it was something called stealth this ugly-looking airplane any fighter pilot would look at this thing and say what and ugly-looking airplane but this is a thing of beauty because this airplane can't be seen by radar because of its shape so now instead of dozens of airplanes to go in and to provide lethal effects it's one airplane and now what's important is how you track how you talk how you go through the path of that airplane not a large number of aircraft and then this is the sight from the first night anybody remember that I know that you're all too still too young for it but the firt those are all Tomahawk missiles over the city of Baghdad now the remarkable thing about that is you remember that you know those naval ships bombardment right well now this is what naval ships were used for to go hundreds of miles and to have an impact again taken away the protection of distance and keeping Americans out of harm's way while still being lethal we all watch this too because the precision that we could use in doing this allowed international news people to stay in the city of Baghdad and not be threatened think about how different that was than the bombings of Dresden and Berlin that was just what 50 years roughly 50 years before that so warfare once again had changed it had changed in addition to precision weapons GPS Global Positioning System this was the first war it was called the first space war because it was the first time that military operations really use space systems GPS which now we all take for granted but in 1990 this was a first time we had ever used in GPS to precision weapons which enabled us by the way to take out and in an adversary right next to a hospital and not harm the hospital so it as we evolved we got our ability to keep ourselves out of harm's way by having the speed and the in the ability to go long distances and then this little thing here is a radar airborne command and control with a radar those airplanes flew that's a joint stars and you're familiar with the joint stars aren't you professor Smith it flew as an experimental airplane at that time by the way and it was the what it was able to accurately relay to ground troops where tanks and other moving targets were and to be able to destroy them once again taking away the value of distance and improving our speed and our accuracy so we keep evolving through this and and the impact of space was not just TPS but communication which we take for granted today but there were no cell phones in 1990 might have been one or two but there but they certainly weren't the army certainly wasn't using them and we had satellites for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance that were actually designed to do the nuclear security mission that we actually used in operations to once again give us eyes and ears throughout the world so we see this trend now continuing of being able to be effective at a long-distance keeping ourselves out of harm's way being precise and lethal to be able to target exactly what we wanted and minimizing collateral effects and having the ability to get information and to acquire information from around the world once again this was a whole different campaign in a battle than what we saw in Vietnam or in World War two because of the advancements in technology that allowed us to do to get that speed to be able to penetrate and not be seen to be able to get information around the world by use of space all technology and developments now let's look at today today is a fascinating time in looking at the nature of warfare because technology once again I believe is putting us on the cusp of what is going to is is already a pretty dramatic change is going to be even more social media it's both a curse and a huge benefit social media has eliminated the ability to hide because so many people can see things and observed thing I see it myself you know I was the commander of Air Force Materiel Command the Dean told you that and I we lived at Dayton Dayton Ohio and I had a base at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida and there was another base out here at Edwards Air Force Base and there was a fire at Eglin Air Force Base and now I'm the commander the the person who reports to me is the guy at Edwards and then the commander at Eglin reports the guy at Edwards and so the usual fashion for me to be notified that there's been a fire at Eglin Air Force bases for the Eggland's commander to call the edwards commander and will then will call me well my secretary came walking into my office and she said you know I was I just got a Facebook message from so-and-so down at Eglin that there's been a big fire at one of the test facilities two minutes later I got the call from the commander at Edwards so if that happens for me think about and and we saw this happen in Georgia not the state of Georgia but the country of Georgia we saw the Russians cyber attack on Georgia government resources that crippled their effectiveness at being able to counter Russian movement we saw the Russian involvement and other involvement in our election so now when we think about homeland security when we think about our national security those oceans aren't going to do us much good are they we now have to think about that spectrum warfare as I like to call it in a whole different light than we did before this is another example back space is now becoming a commercial market this is a image taken from a commercial satellite of a North Korean missile launch now we have all these special protocols in this country where we're trying to watch all these sites so that we know when a missile that might be coming to attack us is and we do all sorts of things in this country where we don't want another people to know what we're doing not anymore not anymore you can't hide anymore so any training you do anything you do it's either going to be there on the internet or it's going to be a commercial space asset that's going to be able to find it and then there's this little thing called the drone or a remotely piloted aircraft as we prefer in the Air Force or an unmanned aerial vehicle which has basically is got the Air Force really upset these small little ones because for for over a century now we have taken pride in the fact that no US soldier has ever been killed or fired upon from the air because we protect the skies these things fly low right now in in Afghanistan and in Iraq they are a real issue with you know dropping they are hard to kill and when we talk about some of the new technologies we have we are there's even more issues when we talk about autonomy in these operating so these are all things that have to change the way we think about what are gonna end by the way there easily can fly around in this country and the FAA still hasn't sorted out quite how they're going to how they're gonna deal with it and this by the way is a 3d printed part I put that up there because I think 3d printing is kind of cool or is what we call it additive manufacturing but what it is doing it's going to change the way we do logistics it's going to change the fact that we're not going to need to have stockpiles of parts because we'll just build it and it's going to change the speed at which we can change designs because all you do is change the software you don't to retool your hardware so it's going to change warfare because of what it's going to enable us to do things because Clausewitz said it Eisenhower said it logistics wins Wars and if it doesn't win it it will lose it for you for sure so when we look at things like additive manufacturing artificial intelligence and all of the things that we can do to improve our ability to and keeping less people in harm's way means less fuel I have to get there I mean all of these things are multipliers that change the way we do warfare let's just look at this simple example and how much it has changed the way our national security we think about national security and we think about warfare this was the the assassination if that's a word that I can use maybe not of general Soleimani how did this play out well we had a remotely piloted vehicle so Americans were there but not in harm's way right they used a precision weapon to I think is what they surmise minimal collateral damage we destroyed two cars and nothing else in the area we the intelligence came from the internet and from the commercialization of space in the fact that that RPA the command and control that our PA is of a commercial SATCOM and the data that comes from reconnaissance is transferred over commercial Satcon but this is the thing that I want you to think the most about back 50 years ago this would have been an assassination the only way we would have been able to have done this is to have put Americans in there had them at risk and this would have been considered an act of war to have gone in to a neutral country and assassinated but think about the debate we've had no it wasn't this was we believed he was an immediate threat and we've got all of the lawyers and everybody debating about what immediate means right with respect to whether this was a legal action on the part of our president or not but we could never have done this without the technologies that I've described so we are in a position now so I it's kind of which came first the chicken or the egg was it the policy that enabled us to use the technology in that way or has the policy changed because the technology enabled it to happen and I guarantee you in the next few years we'll have more and more debates like the one you saw going on with respect to the Salamone raid because technology is challenging the way we think about national security there's a few new things to this whole issue of cyber is changing the way we think about homeland security and it's in by the way it's not this talks about the fact that there were 105 nation states that have used cyber what we did to then when we were when there were cruise missiles launched against against us by the Iranians and you remember you may remember it in the press that the president decided he wasn't going to go forward with the attack as too many would die so what do we do we launch cyber operations against those missiles so think about this now we we don't even have to be anywhere near and we can effect a change in this is not I know this already because you know I have a home security system and I travel a lot and I have a cleaning service that comes once a week so when they show up they my doorbell rings in my PAP tells me my doorbells ringing and I'm here I live in Georgia by the way and I just get on my app and I push the button and I open the door for him and if I can do that what can I do with a military robust system that can allow me to trigger things remotely right and then so thinking about you know Cold War we had bomb shelters I think we're going to need to be seriously thinking about some cyber hardening because one of the things that's an issue is infrastructure power water and gas if I can you know all those systems are our computer control so cybersecurity is now the new in my mind cyber hardening security and cyber is the new bomb shelter for the 21st century for as a nation welcomes to our homeland security here are some emerging technologies that we're still learning to understand how they could change warfare one is a lot of this is based on artificial intelligence but we look at it differently depending on how we're applying it swarming autonomous drones the for all of us star star wars fans we remember all the robots but this is essentially the killer robots on drones and this one is one that we're enough to think about because there's ethical issues associated with this but I ask you to think about you know when we when we send cruise missiles that have radar since the you know few radar fused fusing on them how much different is that then using the drones that use a little more sophisticated analysis of the sensors so it's gonna happen biological based sensors one of the big challenges for the Army in particular is all these batteries that are carrying around because everything requires battery power well biology offers us a real opportunity to be able to spin are sensing around the world and I think it's going to do it hypersonic weapons that the tyranny of distance is going to be completely wiped out if we can get these weapons you will not be able to stop it and then what I call ubiquitous information 5g Internet of Things you know we we grew up where you know I had a party line on my phone when I was a kid I didn't have my own cell phone you didn't have information available my first cell phone all it did was make phone calls right it didn't it didn't have text messages or anything else so this generation takes it for granted and more for it where warfare is going to see the advantage of this and the disadvantage of this because everything's going to be connected and nothing's going to be independent and we've got to figure out first of all how do we defend ourselves against this and then secondly how do we use it to our advantage so these are some of the technologies that I find intriguing this is the list that the Department of Defense considers its top technology priorities it's an interesting list when you look at it as a purist I say it's kind of apples and oranges on there some of those are technology areas right some of them are just areas of interests for example we've been doing command control and communications since the Revolutionary War but I think what the department means is now what does it mean when we use artificial intelligence and we have 5gm with the internet of things autonomy is another representation of artificial intelligence but I put this chart up here mainly just to give you a view of this is what your your National Security leaders are thinking about when they think about what are going to be the important things for warfare in the future what are the tools we can use what are the things we need to worry about and you see some of these I've already talked about hypersonics directed-energy laser I have a little bit of experience with those they've always been five years from being something real hopefully we'll get past those five years one of these years quantum science and computing that could completely change cryptology with quantum computing because chronic cryptology right now depends on think having massive numbers of the time it takes you to actually break some of our cryptology so now I get to look at my projection of what I think the future might look like as I think about these technology areas and the things that you saw and you can see there's a pretty good parallel from what I see as the technologies and what the department defense is working on what's the move is going to look like in 20 years well CNBC talks about an interconnected world in which connectivity will drive innovation economic growth educational advancement and social change across the globe well I think in 20 years we're gonna be better connectible we're not going to quite be interconnected yet but we are getting really close to being interconnected as I like to say now one sneeze in China creates say a pandemic right in that in that this situation is only going to get more so my opinion is that this can lead to good things but it also can lead to mischief the internet and global communication are going to make it impossible for us to hide it's going to be impossible for people for us to conduct training and testing and be able to not have people do it regional conflicts are going to have global impact just like a a Colden in China is having global impact regional things and so global powers great powers are not going to remain be able to remain on engaged I'm not going to be able to say I got my big oceans I'm gonna build everything in America because I'm not gonna be able to because my resources are going to come from elsewhere environmental impact conducted in one place is going to affect everything else so we're going to be driven just as you saw this week where all of the eight economic largest economic countries got together and talked about what they were going to do with respect to the economic market you're gonna see more and more of that so when it comes to our national security strategy in 20 years I think we're gonna have four elements to it homeland defense but homeland defense is gonna focus on protection of those important systems like our power our and and our and our information in the control of the spectrum or in cyber defense social media internet I personally believe in 20 years we'll still be struggling with that with respect to individual freedom and what we must do in order to protect ourselves from that nuclear deterrent strategy is gonna need to include more nation-states we can't keep this genie out in the bottle I don't think and so we're gonna have to really think about this mutual assured destruction is probably not going to be the effective one so we're gonna have to figure out whether there's a nuclear deterrent strategy that has much more of a cooperate and graduate approach in my opinion than than what we have and peer competition is going to not only be traditional but it's going to be spectrum defense I think spectrum defense is going to be our first priority we're still going to have Wars little non terrorism and and that's gonna drive resources but warfare artificial intelligence I think of all the things is going to have the biggest impact we will have autonomous systems but I believe they'll be largely integrated in with the systems we have today and why I say that is because we're still buying stuff and for you you young midshipman and cadets we never throw anything out in the military we keep everything forever and ever that's why well you will have b-52s that are four times as old as you are that people will be flying so you will find that man will operate side-by-side with autonomous weapons and this is really my comment about there's just going to be not enough of the autonomous systems but they will be there and that will change what an operator looks like because an autonomous system the actually having pilots and ship drivers and are not that's not going to be a role that will continue to be dominated by the human it's going to be done autonomously in 20 years ISR and artificial intelligence will mean that data will go directly to the shooter you won't have that radar sitting out there with a bunch of people like we have for joint stars with a bunch of radios telling people where things are the information will go directly from the source the satellite to the shooter and autonomy will I believe in 20 years it'll still be a subject of debate about just when it comes to lethal autonomy I think we still have to kind of sort that out a little more ma our mind so I don't think in 20 years we will have purely autonomous weapons I think we will have human involvement to some extent in the use of the weapons hypersonics is almost going to eliminate that protection of the defense but we're gonna have a lot of these the initial ones are going to be expensive but they're going to be enough to challenge things like the Chinese strategy of continuing to build out on Islands in order to deny us access because crews missed hypersonic weapons are going to penetrate and we will have counter hypersonics but that will lag behind the development of hypersonics just as missile defense has lagged behind the development of missile systems directed-energy i believe that lasers and in particular high-power microwave will play a key role in defensive systems it will be high powered microwave could very well be a game-changer particularly as a Counter hypersonic weapon as as we learn better how to control that and not do harm to human beings and others so please forget Ocean's eleven with the big thing I don't you know I think this can be effective defensive tool lasers will be defense against soft targets and speaking of somebody who built a megawatt class laser and is a thermodynamic system we can figure out how to violate the first and second law high energy lasers like we used to see when we were watching Star Wars and Star Trek where I can point at you with my phaser and you disappear unless there's three trucks of power and thermal cooling systems behind you it's not going to quite be there in 20 years we're getting some improvements but we're not going to be there command and control is really going to be the one that's going to be the big impact 5g and the Internet of Things is going to enable us to do essentially in term it you know across the whole spectrum joint domain wheel we will probably still have an army and a navy and an Air Force but they will work much more closely together because the distinction between the domain is not going to be as significant when it comes to the sensing of that domain as it is today but we're only going to go so far because this line basically says it takes a little bit for humans to catch up with technology and you know Nimitz did it pretty quickly in World War two and thank goodness that he did but my experience is that it takes a while for us particularly the military because we're so disciplined because we know how important it is for everybody to execute and understand the plan it's difficult for us to completely change the way we think about things if we're going to talk about autonomous weapons if we're going to talk about multi-domain operations we're going to have to change the way we think about things and we're gonna have to think about things much similar and right now I'm sorry but sailors don't think like airmen and airmen don't think like soldiers and Coast Guardsmen don't think like even sailors you know and so that's going to take time and I don't think it'll be there in 20 years training is I think you know you talked about my job and revolutionising training well I want to revolutionize training again because I'm not going to be able to train the way I used to because I can't hide and I can't learn how to operate autonomous with autonomous system so augmented reality is gonna play a significant role in training we're going to leverage simulation and training because it's going to enable us to be able to train individuals better and it's going to enable us to be prepared to Train the way we fight without having large areas available and actually using the weapons themselves so I think the particularly the value of augmented reality is going to be very important in military training in the future and I believe the Air Force is already doing this with pilot training starting to ventures so what's the world look like in 50 years now 50 years I think we have interconnection so the danger here is if there's a conflict it could spread quickly and become all-encompassing so I think that what we will see is we're gonna go back to looking at alternatives to violence instead of violence being soft power and military operations will become intertwined I hope but I also believe based on history that we will see technology overcome some of the uneven distribution of resources we have in the world that will we'll take away some of the strain that causes warfare renewable energy commercial services from space we'll be mining in space in 50 years write it down prove me wrong we will be bringing back natural resources from asteroids from from space that will help us to deal with it and there will be advances so this will contribute to the interconnectivity but there's still going to be ideological differences that are going to drive conflict so what would that look like well now the balance between manned and unmanned systems is going to flip autonomy is going to rain the number of man systems will decline as they are now older I'm sorry I don't think we'll be flying b-52s and 50 years at least I hope not but if we do it may not be a human that's piling it they humans will play a remote role and remote operations and they will monitor it but the timelines are going to be too short for the human to to think through the information is going to be processed cyber operations are so fast than the reactions that the human just can't think that fast so it's going to be done by machine and by that means kinetic operations will be completely integrated with kinetic operations directed energy is going to dominate in the defensive systems this is my little part tuned picture you know the the force field I think that you will see I mean equivalent to that using direct energy laser systems on high altitude airships will be used for area defense and in space lasers are cool because they don't have to they don't have to deal with some of the things they do on the ground so slaves and space are going to provide a very important role for commercial space because space is no longer going to be this place that we don't really that there's gonna be a lot of things going on in space and it's going to be commercially important because remember we're mining in space right okay hypersonics in addition to having weapons we're gonna have hypersonic flight we're going to that's going to change the way logistics is because we're going to change we're going to transport things in less than an hour right around the world and get it into place command and control there will be just there will not be any humans in the loop in most cases the separate domains will come together there will be a combination of biosensors space platforms that will provide us ubiquitous sensing and this will contribute to the interconnectivity both from a military perspective as well as the world alright logistics I think I talked about this we will have essentially the ability for our systems to be able to be maintained and operated with from long distances by using artificial intelligence and software updates will be done by the way now timeless systems present a challenge particularly for the Navy an unmanned ship who's going to do all that clean up that's normally done on the ship right there's no humans there to do it you know so it's a little challenge see logistics logistics it's it's gotta you got to think about it even with with unmanned systems strategy with all the different complexities this is where that that augmented reality and artificial intelligence so you're gonna have yet I think this is that's a marine isn't it isn't that a marine uniform look at that with an with a or how how cool is that right a marine using the AR that's cool I like it so I know there's a lot of stars on that collar right there yeah if I count there's four of them so I believe that there would that strategy development and leadership development is going to be all about being able to use a augmented reality and AI for campaign planning and for training of leaders now in particular all right hundred years I don't know but I just thought for grins I'd take a look at what the world was like in 1917 versus today because 1917 was World War one right this was New York today and 100 years ago this was the day of the art for the military you notice the gas masks and the machine gun for World War one today we've got this so it's really hard to predict what it might look like there's two ways it could go if you're a student of science fiction which I like to read we could destroy ourselves which is a possibility or we could have the Star Trek Federation right the Federation where we all are it truly interconnected and military operations I personally hope and believe in the latter and in that case spectrum defense and warfare will dominate I think Wars will be fought in the cyber domain because the cost of physical destruction is just going to be too high in an interconnected world we will return to the Cold War era of dominance autonomous systems are going to perform most functions and there will be no really large armies and I'll leave you with this this perhaps it's more of a dream than a vision but this airmen technologist who's watched technology evolved for the last four years and watched the fact that yeah we figured out new chemical weapons but we only use them once yeah we figured out nuclear weapons but we only use them once that I think technology will to succeed in fostering peace rather than destruction and this is what we'll have in a hundred years so I've enjoyed sharing my thoughts with you I'm always open to a debate about any of this because like I said I'm only the one with the microphone so you get to hear what I thought but I leave you with particularly for our our students that are here during the time you're here really get to understand what this country is all about and just how valuable we have as a nation our diversity and our creativity and our innovation because that's what's important in the future when you join the military there's structure but that doesn't mean you have to leave your creativity on the other side Hey look at me I made it all the way to four-star general I never did it I wasn't very good at taking orders was I professor Smith so with that I think we could take some questions if we have some [Applause] [Applause] and if I may ma'am you said your will your you're willing to take a challenge on any of your points and I would say the last ship that I served on the great USS Rafael Peralta the Operations Specialist in combat Information Center they actually use the Roomba vacuum to do sweepers every day so you have autonomy going for sweepers all right okay so we got to buy some rubra vacuums for those on man ships right absolutely so any questions you mentioned terrorism and one of the things that strikes me about some of the new technologies especially around cyber stuff is that you don't need to be a big nation anymore to have very powerful weapons basically and small groups with ideological thoughts and philosophies that say I don't care if I wipe out everything on earth unless everybody does what I want them to do would have the power to maybe not do quite that but to an awful lot of destruction and so it's not big nations who mutually don't want to you know go away you have groups that are willing to go away based purely on their philosophical beliefs and they have some power to create real danger for all big nations all people on earth any thoughts on that yeah and I actually have thought about that a lot particularly you know when you look at defense because which is why I say the whole cause of a mutual assured destruction just isn't going to work with technologies that are easily gained and used and frankly this country is no longer so far ahead in technology than the way we used to the timeline between a new development and having it readily available is so much shorter now that I think it we have to change the thought process about what is deterrence mean the idea that well if you do this I'm going to retaliate in a worse way it's MIT is probably not because of the destruction that happens in that and that's why I think defensive systems that negate the ability so in cyber it we have to develop cyber defenses we have and you can do it I mean we it isn't as it isn't an impossibility we've just never thought about it because anybody could break into the power grid and shut it down and and we we have to be able to defend ourselves because I believe that that is going to be as much a part of a deterrent strategy as having a viable response force which is what our nuclear strategy has been you know at that time because it's just not going to work anymore so we have to have a way to provide if you will that force field in in each of the areas which is why cyber defense spectrum controls of managing the spectrum being able to control is going to be critically important general I've asked the same question the last three lectures George Friedman in his book the next 100 years forecast that by 50 years out we will be at war with the Japanese cyber war fought in space that probably people on the surface won't know and he says that's because we are a 2 nation 2 ocean nation controlling sea lanes and that the Japanese won't allow us can't allow us to do that second microwave collecting solar collectors in space with microwave power down to the surface what are your thoughts on those two questions well I mean foreign International Studies was not something I spent much time on but I do know that that nations do have a culture and an approach that lasts for centuries I just point to where we are in Afghanistan today and I go back to pre BC and and and the struggles that anyone has had in in Afghanistan counting the British and the Russians and now us so I can't discount what he said but what I can say is that I believe that the issue of control of the ocean is not going to be material because of you know the the ubiquitous availability of information because of the use of space and so I think the Japanese are probably going to be more concerned about other things than what the United States is doing and I think that the relationship between this country and Japan is very different than it then it was back in World War two so I don't believe that's going to happen now as for solar panels and microwave power coming from from space I'd have to look at the power equation because you know one over R squared is a pretty big number when you start looking at you know things a pretty small number right one over R squared but R squared and so I think that that would be my question i I didn't I don't have a lot of familiar with about it was microwaves in space but I do have a lot of familiarity with communication and radars because I I did work for the National Reconnaissance Office for a while but anything it's possible but I don't know that the solar technology we have today would be able to generate sufficient enough power to be make that an effective way but I do believe that solar power from space has a lot of promise in providing the solutions I think the biggest challenge we are going to have with power is how to manage it which gets me back to what I post often batteries I think the limitation in power in use of renewable energy sources is going to be how you store it I mean even look at today you know in Texas in some counties in Texas electricity is free at night you know why because that's when the windmills generate the power and the grid cannot handle it so you have people that don't wash their dishes don't do their laundry until after 10 o'clock at night and then they turn everything on because the power is you know so I believe that the real challenge is going to be in an energy storage to most be the most effective use of renewable energy sources good afternoon ma'am a trip insect class relax Stanford University East Asian Studies so every time the military tries to buy something whether it's the LCS through the f-35 we see cost overruns and delays if you could redo the American procurement system what would you change okay you're speaking to somebody that's been 36 years dealing with the latest AK reform initiative and so I've seen them all but I believe that the best way to buy things is you need three things it's really very simple it's a simple model we just fail to follow it you have to give the person that's responsible for buying it what I call near godlike power which means that they can make decisions without having a council and a committee and 1,500 people say whether that decision can be made or not so I'm bothered by that I mean let's take the f-35 I actually was involved in the f-35 several times in my career the first time was in 1997 when I left your office and I was at wright-patterson Air Force Base and I was responsible for something called a autonomic logistics now this is 1997 that now is called Alice which is a four letter word on the f-35 because it does it's their system for logistics so at that time they were doing requirements and there was there were so many people involved in defining the requirements for that then so that's the first thing is the person that's responsible for buying it you have to trust them and you have to empower them to be able to make decisions so you can make decisions fast and and then the second thing is you need a small team of really smart people now don't take this wrong but I don't want a program offset has any second lieutenants I like second lieutenants and they're really good and they had a lot of energy but if I'm gonna do something fast I want a team of experts people that have been there done that so I let the the second lieutenants work on something that's not an f-35 if that's what's important to me the third thing is you can't constrain the resources to the extent that they make foolish decisions too because the budget is not enough in a given year and then the last thing is you have to have direct involvement with the operator with the person that's actually going to use it now I'll give you a personal example I had I was responsible for this thing called transformational satellite communications I had a lot of these big fancy words in my pass or a transformation revolutionising training and this was a protected communication system and the army had a requirement to have what they called comm on the move now this was back lesson learned from Desert Storm Marine story had a one store marine friend that was a calm guy and they said during the big left hook and Desert Storm the Marines were way out on the end of the left hook because because that's where I always put the Marines right way out there in front and they were thrilled because they had a mil start terminal that they traveled with themselves on a truck and every night they'd set it up and communicate then put it back on the truck and travel and they were called that calm on the move right the army had a requirement for the system that it have calm on the move so we went through and we did all the math the power equation you know how much power could I put on the satellite to be able to provide how big did the antenna have to be and we went back to the army and we said you know you want 40 miles an hour but and this was to the generals right not to the staff sergeant that's driving the Humvee but we can really if you'll settle for 30 miles an hour then I can do for significantly less dollars and a lot less technical risk because I know I can do this and the answer was no we got to have 40 miles an hour now if we to ask that marine what do you think the Marine would have said I'll take 10 miles an hour right it's better than having to take this thing down and up and down but so the aye-aye and we've proven that model time and time again a lot of times you'll hear stories about black programs you know special act you know special programs that are secret and they are usually far more successful than big programs like the f-35 you know why because nobody knows what they're doing because the guy in charge you know everybody's got all these super secret clearances the guy who wants it is heavily involved so that's my answer f-35 is a perfect example of a program that tried to do too much you know I mean it has three different variants because that was going to make things simpler because we would only hit but it really hasn't because there's you know the Navy one needs a whole different physical structure in order to be able to land on a ship the Marines are vertical so that's a whole different engine so what did I gain by forcing everybody to put everything on and spending three years with working groups to get everybody together to agree on a common set of requirements and then the budget every year people cut budgets and that's why I make the point you know you got to fund it sufficiently and don't cut the budget because then somebody tries to cut something in order to fit in the budget but we never seem to remember those lessons we just keep repeating it so I share your frustration and I share it on the part of the person that was responsible for trying to figure out how to deal with cost overruns and things but I think those are my four if you could do that give me the money let me make the decisions and I'll deliver it for you so I'm good all right so we have time for one more question and I'd like to invite everyone if you didn't have a chance to get your question answered we have some refreshments in the back if you'd like to stick around and and discuss the lecture general Pollak house Keys gonna stick around for a few minutes and perhaps you get a chance to ask her your question so one more good afternoon ma'am I'm interim second class Santos physics UC Berkley do you believe that there is a knowledge race and meaning that all this new technology requires very smart people to do that and we have lots of brilliant minds in the United States do you think we're recruiting them effectively and are we winning a knowledge race against other countries if there is one well first of all I think it's going to be foolish for us to think that we can capture all the technology it's like what I told georgeanna by the way Georgiana and I went to school together here so the one that asked me of the cyber question we both lived in this house at one time but I I believe that we can't capture it because we there's just too much going on all around the world but I do believe we have a lot of smart people I do believe that just the fact that I look out here and I see all of you from my experience in the military really good people want to serve this country you know I have just been overwhelmed when I've looked at some of the bright Americans that want to like all of you want to put that you are willing to put that uniform on and be part of something bigger than themselves greater than themselves but I really think the the thing that is going to be the multiplier for this country as it always has been is the fact that we embrace diversity because that's the thing that I saw when I was at Berkeley and I mean I'm an engineer I'm a geek but the beauty that you take a geek like me who can't draw to save her life and share dinner with an you know an art major an international house from some other country because we all look at things differently and sometimes solving a problem is best done by looking at it from many different directions so I think I feel very positive about the future of this country when I look at the talent that we have and the willingness of people to be part of something bigger than themselves so I I think we can do it we have never paid as well as anybody else did you know so it's not a mad people do not put this uniform I did not serve for 36 years because of the money you know I mean if I wanted to make money I would have taken the uniform off after my four years of service and-and-and I am NOT alone and I saw I have an plus we have a lot of great Americans on Aarn in uniform that are willing and and ready to do great things for this country so and I think the value of international relationships is even more important now because of what you talk about we are not going to be the first at everything as much as well as we used to be and that's okay because there's an interconnected world and as long as we take advantage of that interconnectivity instead of seeing it as a threat I think we can use it as we have always used it as a multiplier for ourselves look at Elon Musk you know he's a SATA he was born in South Africa and look what he's done he's turned space launch upside down he's totally changed it and he's not he never wore a military uniform but he has changed national security launch and and and look what he's done to the car industry I believe that this country will continue has to continue to foster people the with innovation and smarts and then we will succeed right well again thank you very much for listening so general thank you for your your informative presentation for your thoughtful responses those questions and I also want to thank you on behalf of the military affairs program and UC Berkeley for taking the time to share your extensive experience and knowledge with us today in this important field and I'm I'm really happy to to have you here [Music]
