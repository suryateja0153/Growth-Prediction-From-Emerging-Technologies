 hi I'm Tommy Thompson and welcome to design dive on AI in games where I look at how artificial intelligence impacts game design and vice versa in this episode ambush sliding into the world of high-octane cover shooter vanquish developed by Platinum Games in released in 2010 languish is a third-person cover shooter that the time caught me off-guard by its intensity fast paced gunplay and blistering combat well originally published on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 it received a release on PC in 2017 to much fanfare which was fascinating to watch given the game largely didn't receive that much noise during his initial launch to the point that GameSpot deemed it the best game no one played of that year so here we are almost 9 years since its original launch it's time to visit the game once more and re-examine the AI behavior in relation to the game's core design how it meshes with its core mechanics and builds not just a game that is exciting challenging and intense but also one that is a little unbalanced and nonetheless tries to be more accessible for all [Applause] [Music] for those who've never played a vanquish is a third-person cover shooter where players take control of Sam Gideon a DARPA agent armed with an augmented reaction combat suit who's sent to the space colony Providence sitting in orbit above the earth his mission to take down Russian separatist forces who have weaponized the station and threatened to destroy the USA it's a weird game that loves to relish in its own absurd a devil's trying to keep a straight face but while it's incredibly self-aware of the genre trappings its adhering to ranging from dudebro shooter types to classic anime tropes it still manages to do so without impacting game playing court experience Steve Blum gives his gruff fest jingoistic steve blum performance he's ever made as Lieutenant Colonel burns alongside edgy good guy Sam by Gideon Emery a voice actor who strangely has two prominent videogame credits in which his character is named Gideon it presents main characters are pretty much a pastiche of pretty much every Carver sure our protagonist on the market and true to form the secondary characters aka the women are the budding sidekick on comms and it'll Hillary Clinton who's found to be a skinny shyster and kills herself as a result I mean come on lads we can we can do better than this right the game relishes and ridiculous quick time events and hiding squeaky-voiced Pangloss statues for you to shoot as collectibles but then leans into this absurdity and builds mechanics around it you've got Sam repeatedly trying to come across as hardcore by virtue of smoking cigarettes to allowing the player to throw cigarettes as a distraction tactic which then becomes a running gag of how he can't catch a break and have a smoking piece I mean come on the closing credits have you shoot the developers as you return to Earth as flying photo board asteroids if that doesn't sell to you how totally inconsistent and kinda bonkers this game is I don't know what will when vanquish came out in 2010 it was the heyday of the cover shooter what with the first two Gears of War entries popularizing this particular branch of third person genre to great acclaim it wasn't hard to see that impact on store shelves from uncharted and grand theft auto tiss when a Cell Conviction army of two and 50 cent blood on the sand cover shooters were all the rage but that market saturation perhaps denied vanquish broader success despite its innovations in anacs although in seeing that its absurdity it's over anime influences as well as the price tag combined with a relatively short campaign which you can complete in under five hours may have had something to do with it despite its shortcomings there was something endearing about it to me from the get-go the opportunity to play Gears of War huffed up on two litres of iron brew a bag of Skittles in a lane of cocaine sounded like an opportunity too good to pass up and then playing vanquish of course abrams it's been acknowledged in interviews by director Shinji Mikami that the game sought to embrace the anarchy of bullet hell shooters and transpose that reality onto a cover shooter the final result is fascinating and merits more than one playthrough to truly embrace it this is driven in part by the gameplay mechanics working in conjunction with AI behaviors and building this fast often anarchic experience I remember the game fondly from originally playing a back at launch but it sat in the back of my head for many years to a point it needed reexamined plus I have a youtube show now so like I can make loosely constructed justifications for playing games for a youtube Gomi so let's get into that I want to talk about what this game does and doesn't do that still makes this rather endearing the critical components of vanquish that help it stand out are the two additional mechanics you gain courtesy of Gideon's combat suit the ability to slow down time to take aim enemies and the boost slave mechanic that allows players to move across the combat theater at blistering pace boosting takes the road Iran concept from Gears of War and cranks up to 11 by enabling you to move around high speed shifting from cover to cover with precision and urgency meanwhile the slow mo allows you to focus on that one target this bearing down on you take the shot you need and remove the pressure being imposed upon you but what makes it really interesting is that while one or more AI are targeting you you'd think these mechanics make the game painfully easy but they come with certain Caviar's first the in order to trigger the slow mo you need to move so while you're relying on that cover to keep you alive you need to push out of cover to save your life diving sliding or leaping towards enemies are all valid approaches to initiate the slow-mo attack the second aspect is the energy meter attached to the combat suit both sliding in slo-mo drain masu more critically in the event you completely exhaust the suits energy you have to wait for it to recharge entirely before it can be used again perhaps even more interesting as that Gideon's melee attack will largely eliminate any immediate threat but it completely exhausts the energy tank in the process what's great about this is that the game inherently wants you to keep moving but also to stop take stock reevaluate before you move again it provides a fresh take on the expertly crafted reload mechanic of years of war providing an opportunity to make that risky play but punishes you in the event you fail to control it when all of these mechanics come together that it completely changes the game itself to a point that the emphasis on the cover shooter is minimised significantly your focus is on the carving around the space taking out as many enemies as you can exploiting the slow mode to hit some of the more demanding targets only to take a moment to recharge before dashing around again what's powerful about this is it becomes the antithesis of cover shooter design principles unlike gears and its ilk you don't need to hold the defensive Lane vanquish allows you to define the combat zones the lanes of attack and the safe areas to recover whenever you want and shift the pace of combat on a dime the contrary to this the game punishes you if you do not respect the authority it provides when you burn out the suit you're forced to rely on those more traditional cover shooter mechanics to keep yourself alive long enough before you can move again it shares a lot of similarities with doom 2016 and that it rewards the player with great agency and control of combat when in constant motion but punishes you for doing it too much whilst providing the fails tape of traditional cover shooter and behavior if you overindulge it's a fun mishmash of ideas given that without the boost in slow-mo mechanics the game would be but another cover shooter but this enhanced mobility and precision fundamentally changes heard the game plays and how we express ourselves within the space it's interesting given at argue a much-maligned tie older also sought to achieve the same thing was dark void by airtight games published by Capcom in the same year as vanquish added verticality to the cover shooting that mechanically doesn't feel as smooth or as slick as vanquish but it's always stood out to me as a fun attempt to innovate in the same space so my long-held memory of vanquish was that the AI enemies were challenging and refreshing but then I'm complaining again I didn't see that as strongly as I did once before enemies are competent for sure especially the smaller more nimbler ones but fundamentally they're actually rather dumb kayat as frequently don't see the player or pay attention to them instead prioritizing the friendly non player characters in the scene for me playing through the game it was satisfying but also slightly disappointing and that the innovative mechanics I just praised are not challenged sufficiently by the anime designs games of this ilk require mechanical balance that the player has some adacia smih Kanaks we need to find interesting ways not just to challenge them but in time counteract them a great example of a I design contracting player empowerment is the Batman Arkham series where not just in the original game but in subsequent sequels the games introduce new enemies in the combat sequences that negate or counter Batman's mechanics and forces to improve our overall mastery of playing as the Dark Knight this isn't to say vanquish doesn't have any variety nor enemies don't achieve this to some degree they do and I'm gonna explore that now but for me it seems that they're limited in scope we start the game fighting the regular robot grunts the Gorgas either standing out in cover or manning turrets this then expands out into gorg ease with more powerful weaponry and raiding on more walkers by the time you reach level 1/3 which you can hijack if you exploit the movement mechanics to get in behind the entrenched forces this opening phase of enemy design helps players get the feeling for basic shooting moving into cover and also if you're feeling adventurous the ability to start using the boost and slo-mo over time this has expanded such that the boost install will become more prevalent and the subsequent sequences as target prioritization becomes increasingly more important but also maintaining a defensive line as larger enemies are introduced spears force us to prioritize targets that move towards us the chicane droids present mobile cover that needs to be watched carefully while the jellyfish sequence in act 1 six forces that target prioritization to begin to employ the slo-mo for fear of them getting too close to the convoy meanwhile the first boss enemies begin to appear with the first Argus robot as early as one three this beast is extremely powerful and forces players to Garro of cover and move not just to avoid enemy fire but also to line up shots against vulnerable areas of the robot in both its quad repaired and pipe Hetal forums it also has a defensive mechanism when damage that projects arcs of energy that can overheat sam tsui for the reinforcing how vulnerable you are to counter-attack if you're not careful the number of larger and more aggressive enemies that force burst movement increases throughout the first and saying I act with the lakes of the spate tanks the Romanovs and the bio robos now this is also quite fun but the problem for me is the enemy diversity stagnates pretty rapidly by the end of the first act but the same enemy types thrown at you and often just placed out with Gorgui grunts while new sub boss enemies appear such as the Buzzard you fight each of them several times but largely independently there's an argument for me mixing these enemies and interesting ways to keep you on your toes Romanovs and buyers together or perhaps with spike tanks or an Argus naturally I can imagine that our overheads within shooting the soul run smoothly given the sheer number of characters involved to be they friend or foe running on a game originally intended for xbox360 and ps3 but still it left me wanting something that really stretched my abilities as the game soldiers on all the while there are still aspects of Gideon's core mechanics that aren't being challenged for example what about creating enemies that deliberately target you while you're boosting or enemies that can only be attacked or even sported whilst an augmented slo-mo or do more damage while you're in slo-mo sure that's and ridiculous by imagine they could come up with some sort of rationale for no new mechanics are introduced through and as a result the gameplay plateaus as early as the middle of act two with a larger focus on the variety of different weapons you can use instead of finding new ways to challenge players and their use of the core mechanics that isn't to say it doesn't happen at all two of the later bosses in the game the unknown from AK 3 6 and the crystal viper and act 4 for force players to move around differently each character has attacks that can quickly prove fatal and given the rapid movement you play more defensively staying in cover waiting for an opening and then boosting out the way once it looks too risky these stand out to me as some of the best moments in the game because it's forcing me to play the game defensively rather than offensively and completely change my strategy No all that said I still had a great time playing the game the game doesn't upstairs welcome but it's arguably a little short and forgettable in some segments however one valuable aspect is the replayability brought on by the variety of difficulty configurations I'll readily concede playing through a normal it's simply too easy from me and I needed to play again on hard to feel challenged if I really appreciate both the introduction of God hard mode after you complete the game the first time but also the casual auto mode which is offered straight away originally I wasn't even going to give this thought were it not for the recent resurgence of the easy mode discussion thanks to the recent release of secular shadows die twice and it seemed prudent to be playing through vanquish at a time that this crops up given it's a game that requires a lot of dexterity and fidelity but provides a range of difficulty modes that cater to different types of players the casual auto mode is admittedly not for me what's great about it is that it removes the need to handle the fidelity of aiming and instead prioritize movement which can prove disorienting if your boosts sliding around an opponent Plus while it's a relatively minor issue the game still enables players to our most gameplay achievements or trophies which is often an implicit method of punishing players on lower difficulty levels what is valuable about all of this is that it opens this game up to players who perhaps couldn't play otherwise meanwhile for others that are increasingly more demanding modes for players that want that additional challenge it works well for a game that only takes three to five hours to complete you can go through again on the next higher tier and test your limit what is both fantastic and frustrating about this is that many of the points I made a bit remixed enemy Leo's as a big part of god hard mode but the overall balancing of that mode is no so overwhelmingly difficult and came to put off by it perhaps more disappointingly is that these elements are for the most part not even addressed in Hard difficulty sure the AI is a little more ruthless and health and damage values are tweaked but the game only shifts into something completely different once you cranked up to maximum it would be nice if I can balance those distinct difficulty vectors into a more rewarding experience as always difficulty is subjective whereas deem normal by the developer could be beyond the competencies of others for a multitude of reasons I respect when teams prevail unique difficulty configurations to open a game up to a broader audience at the end of the day if people are entertained and get value for money what's the problem vanquish still holds ground as a novel take in the cover shooter genre it's become a cult classic the arguably deserve better there's still no cover shooter like it and since then the genre largely cooled to a more consistent set of mechanics but there's still space to enovate and one day we might see vanquishes successor in the future thanks for watching this episode on design dive as the first of these videos for 2019 but it won't be the last I'll be back soon with another a patron voted episode on the legacy of Goldeneye double-oh-seven but for now let us be than the glory of my wonderfully supportive patrons with a special show to enter German Cotulla mod mod R and Michael Verner all right now I'm gonna go pester someone about adding new difficulty modes to the adventure of little Ralph just google it google it seriously you probably don't know one ton about
