 [Music] discussion that we were seeing about so far was node and it's non-parents and what was a rule that we came up with a node is a node as - of its - given its - independent of any node given its pairs that's the rule that we came up with there okay so we have come up with two rules so far now look at the third case so we looked at node and its parents we looked at node and its non parents now they're going to look at node and its descendants okay so this is the first tool that we had a node is not independent of its parents the second rule that we had is a non node is not independent of its parents even when other variables are given the third rule that we have is our node seems to be independent of other variables given its parents this is the giveaway okay and that's what we need to fix based on whatever discussion we saw in the previous module this is the dual that will come up with that a node seems to be independent of the other levels as long as I know its parents value it's independent of everything else in the network is that fine that's what we saw in the Pew is that fine everyone loudly someone got Dietrich okay so let us inspect this Ross last rule right so let me ask you this is G independent of L given D comma I you know that the course was difficult you know that the student was intelligent or not or which service now is the great independent of the letter so if you know that the first two conditions were true right that the course was easy and the student was intelligent you would expect the student to get a good recommendation it right but now if someone you would expect the student to get a good grade sorry but now if someone tells you that a student got a bad recommendation later will this belief change or not given the assumption that you have made about the way the world works of course if the instructor was in a bad mood and all that those what if questions are not there then the the student ended ended up getting a bad recommendation letter is that going to change your belief about the grade or not it is right the influence does not flow just one right you know that the relator was bad that means something would have got wrong God would have been wrong with the great right so what is the dual that is coming up here so let's correct her we will say the first rule is fine as known as not independent of its parents even when other variables are given what's the last rule a node is independent of other variables given its parents I want you to replace that other variables by something a node is independent of its non-descendants given its Paris does that make sense so given its parents a node is independent of all variables except its non-disabled okay [Music] [Music]
