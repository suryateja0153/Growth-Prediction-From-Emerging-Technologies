 today we're gonna talk about the power of augmented reality for learning and development so I'm gonna use this app that we created on the iPad to scan the surface of the parking lot we're just gonna look around with the camera and I'm going to touch on to the parking lot surface right about here to place my 3d model so now we have a full sized to scale model of a vehicle right here in the parking lot with us what's cool is I can walk around this model now I can check out details of this model we can walk inside check out the interior we can look through the front window now the real power of augmented reality for learning and development is not just placing a really cool model in the world with you but it's being able to interact with that model so let's say we wanted to teach somebody about the parts of this car I can walk up here maybe want to learn about the tire you touch a tire it highlights it it gives me a tag I can touch the wheel it's getting closer you touch the lug nut we can also teach somebody how to perform a task so here we have a toolbox icon on the upper right hand corner I'm gonna press that icon and it gives me a couple things we can do let's learn how to change a caliper so now we have step-by-step instructions on how to perform this task so here we have highlighting what it is we need to remove instructions on how to remove it we even have a little video button that we can touch and a video player pops up showing us a demonstration on how to remove the lug nuts I'm going to close that window and now I can hit the next step button on the lower right hand side of the screen the wheel pops off and it tells us remove the wheel and then the next step removing the caliper bolts and the caliper pulls away and it highlights where those bolts are located tells you what to use and how to remove them now that's just the surface of what we can do with augmented reality give us a call let's talk about what we can do to make a our work for you
