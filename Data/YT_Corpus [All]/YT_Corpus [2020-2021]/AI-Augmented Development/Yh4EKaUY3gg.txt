 thank you so much for coming out and you heard everything about how to get get involved in the community I am part of the developer advocate team so I work with people in the community like that and I would I get to work with developers every day we're trying to work with our products and using them in in however possible in their products or in companies and then when they ask questions or want to troubleshoot something I'm part of the team that that does that so today I'm going to be talking about conversational AI and the new user experience and I don't think I want to do this because I can't use my hands it's just difficult so we call either a telephone system that's software-based or any automated machine that we want to have a conversation with and the reason for that is pretty simple most of the systems that we work with especially on the phone are based on four charts and stuff where it's like okay if somebody says this do that and if they say this do that it's very rigid it's it's not based on how humans talk and how humans interact with each other so to solve and the reason for some of those problems is are many these are some on the list as a list some of the top ones are how do you use the use cases are not defined properly so you've built a a bot or a not autonomous system for something that you should not be building it for for example a user wants to probably talk to somebody for a specific thing and if they are getting a machine for that it doesn't seem personal to them or on the other side you might be not telling the user that they are talking to a machine which could be misleading so those are those are some examples but there are a lot many that lead to ending up in a situation where people would have a frustrating experience and the biggest obviously is that that the artificial intelligence that you're trying to use is not is not defined for the use case that you're so and we're going to see a lot more of this but I wanted to set the stage with some of the problems here and but in spite of all of that we are still finding that conversation is the new UI and the reason for that is pretty simple there as the number of devices that are increasing as we as we see as yours going by end days going by the number of devices that we interact with every day has grown over time so just as an example right a lot of us speak to you Google home in the in the morning to learn our calendar and what's going on in the day or Alexa or any other you know smart speaker devices it's and and we have if you're like me who likes to play around with these things then we have those connected with our lights and our fans and our coffee makers and be like oh can you start coffee right and and as we start to work with devices that are that that help our life get better or more convenient we are it's going to be impossible for us to interact with them on screen or to look at the app and then start how inconvenient would it be to look at the app and start the coffee maker when your eyes cannot even open right in the morning so it's just thinking about those types of things and that's just that's just when you have when you're not even disabled or differently abled in a situation in a in a small situation like if I'm carrying groceries coming into the coming from from my car in in the garage to the house and I can't use my hands but I still want a lot to be open right though just those little situations like that and we are we are used to using devices like that so as those devices are becoming more prevalent as we as people are getting more comfortable using those devices we are going to have to use ways to interact with them because hands and eyes would just not be enough and there are so many of these how many apps are we going to use and download so that is why conversation is becoming the new UI and there are studies that companies have done which prove prove that fact there are 60 percent of the customers customers who want to use self-service as an option to to get help and that is a pretty big number when when we say self-service this is around customer service when we place that phone call or when we try to get get get to help to say refund or return our stuff or get get help to buy something new things like that 80% of the customer interactions can be actually resolved through a well-designed part so it just all boils down to how do we use the conversational technology that we have available today to get to that 80% number four for interacting with our users and to design those well and to get to those well-designed parts now talked a lot about how of why this is important now what is a conversational experience is also important to understand now what conversational experiences anything that we can speak to in in terms of machines so things that I think there are different terms that go around you might have heard about chat BOTS voice BOTS conversational ux conversational UI conversational apps this these are all just the terms for kind of the same thing which is how do you interact with machines it can be a phone it can be an app basically a computer on the other side and any conversational experiences is is under an umbrella of all the technologies that are used are pretty much under the same umbrella which is natural language understanding so a natural language understanding is the technology behind it and it's really how a machine interacts translates what a user what what we are saying in human language into the computer language and vice versa and that sounds pretty simple but there's a lot that happens behind the scenes in it and I don't expect you to read this but about I wanted to get out of this slide was natural language understanding is a subset of natural language processing it is that subset which actually helps computers define what was the sentiment in that sentence what was how do I para para phrase something that the user has said in in it in my own terms or define understanding different accents understanding different types of users understanding spelling Corrections and and and I think I mentioned sentiment so some of those nuances that we that come on with the natural language who under natural language understanding and all the other terms are kind of useful to know because you would use text-to-speech to convert text to speech and from and vice versa which is speech to text ESR is is useful to just know because automatic speech recognition is the first step that you would do in order to understand what the users saying and then applies speech to text and text to speech and on top of that you would apply natural language understanding so just wanted to make sure that the terms are out there laid out so everybody understands it and then the power of natural language understanding is it applies to both texts like written text as well as voice so a you're not you're not using different technologies for for of those okay so what does it take to actually build a conversation experience to build a conversational experience it really doesn't take much you can there are a lot of automated tools and we are going to see some tools later in the presentation but to build a good conversational experience like we saw 80% of the good experiences 80% of the user experiences can can actually be served with good conversation experiences so we need to understand what would that good or best conversational experience look like and for that let's see some challenges that we that need to be solved in order to get to a good conversational experience so if you were to do this on your own here the first thing you have to understand is how what are the different ways in which a user will be asking me questions so I'll take an example here when I ask for coffee in the morning I can say I need coffee and assume depending on the day and the time and my mood and where I am it could be different ways in which I ask for coffee I need coffee can I just get my coffee coffee right now Oh coffee would be amazing right now right those are very different ways of asking for coffee and I am only one person if we go in the room and ask for ask all of us to say look for coffee we are probably going to come up with thousands of different ways in which people ask for coffee so that goes to say that when you are designing a conversational experience you need to incorporate how are how many different ways in which people can ask for coffee and that requires obviously machine learning so you're going to take all of the that data you're going to train your your train your model to to respond to that question and that leads to leads to the point that if you were doing this alone this is going to be on your own this is going to be probably pretty hard and then the second part is entities when I have and we'll take another example here entities is nothing but parameters that you need to grab when when user has said something or asked for something so if I say I want to set an appointment for 2:00 p.m. tomorrow 2:00 p.m. tomorrow an appointment are three critical pieces of information I need in order to set up that appointment so how do you grab some of those those variables from what the user has said in the intent and use them to to take an action on them and then that would be the third piece as well which is context and context is I would say pretty much the most important part of making a bot really smart and again another example imagine any example in this case but this is really to explain how and for us humans in general context comes naturally so we don't have like what I was talking two seconds ago I can I can assume that you guys retain that right and and that's just natural we don't even have to think about it and that's the part we need to train them train the computers or machines to understand and we do that through through variables and which is what we call context so in this case let's take an example if I'm trying to book a flight from LA to Hawaii for less than $300 in this example right and then and then I can continue on with that conversation and say oh how about LA to Pittsburgh for less than $300 I'm still talking about flights so that part should be stored somewhere in the previous conversation if you're Bart does more than just booking flights because I assume if that's the case you probably also do refunds you probably also do some other things rebooking maybe cars so depending on what your bar does you want to store the context of the conversation and you see this happening if you use Google home and other devices like that then if I ask for weather or what's the weather today in San Francisco and then I say oh how about in the afternoon or how about tomorrow how about in Mountain View because I maybe going traveling right so it it context is pretty important to make the conversation seem natural and you want to start off with thinking about context as the first thing in a conversation including all the other three things which is intense and parameters and how are you going to get all of that so those are just three there's a lot more but I picked out the top three because those are pretty big ones now we'll see some more in this architecture as it evolves when you are talking about a conversational experience in order to build it you need you need to think about the left-hand side here which is you need to make sure it's multi-channel people these days are not going to either call not going to communicate with with the brand or anybody in just one fashion so they are not always going to pick up the phone to do that they could be in their cars and using the digital voice from there they could be wanting to get help from phase through Facebook Messenger they could be on on skype or mobile any other mobile app or Google home it could be anywhere so you need to design for for multi-channel experience so you can't be just thinking about one thing and that itself requires integration with all of those all of those things so think about that then you have to detect intent we talked about that already then you took by machine learning on it and the list growth keeps growing you have to start to think about natural language processing once you have all of that you're going to process the process the language and then if say if you start to go global then you need to think about all sorts of multiple languages that you need to support conscious being English anymore then think about analysis on that think about small talks because sometimes you may have to engage in conversations like oh how's the weather today at your place even though they aren't there for something else so this and then the most important piece which is all of those need to then connect to your back end and the back end is the very critical you can have everything I say this all the time when I do this talk because you can have the best possible natural language experience on the front end but if it doesn't connect properly to your back-end systems then it is all worthless because imagine in this situation where I say oh I want to return I'm calling about this order and I want to return the pair of shoes because I don't they don't fit me or I don't like them whatever it is that system needs to go back and look at my order and it needs to be smart and it it needs to first understand what I'm saying which you would which say you've figured out doing through natural language processing and a machine learning and all of that but it still needs to go back into whatever is the backend system if it's a database if it's Salesforce if it is another order processing system it needs to dip into that it could be an API and then come back and give me give me a response and and that should be in a way that it's seamless and it can go back and forth between that in during that interaction so it's very important to understand how scalable that system is at the back how how I'm going to be able to connect to it in order to provide that conversational experience so we talked about all of the way all of the challenges that one needs to face in order to build a good conversational experience but it's if you look at it all the red pieces it's pretty pretty hard to do it's not as simple as oh let me just build a bot it's you can in probably an hour but when you start to think about all of this you're you're going to find that it's not that easy so you need to you say need some tools in order to build this so that you're not doing some of the stuff that is already out there and one of the great tools that we have at Google built is dialogues though how many of you have heard about dialogue flow oh okay yeah whew that's good so I'm teaching something new which is amazing dynodes No is basically like you saw here all of the red pieces I've pretty much replaced with dialogue flow so you can handle a lot of machine learning and now it comes it comes pre-built with machine learning and natural language processing so you just basically provide examples and I'll show you the tool in a little bit here I'll show you the tool just right after this and then you can see that you you're not really doing machine learning you don't need to be an expert in machine learning to use the tool you can just start to put some examples of how I asked for coffee and how you ask for coffee and then it will train itself and then you just click a button to train it once it's trained you can just enable multiple languages and then as you start to go into different different countries you can it makes your life easier to to build it it gives you some analysis it also gives you how my bot is doing over time you can learn if some of the intents are not working you can start to create new intent so it's it's a tool that makes it a little bit easy for for starting with conversational experiences if you want to do it yourself you have would have to think about a lot of that and it's natural and rich in terms of it has natural language processing built into it so you don't have to train it to learn to learn natural language and how people ask for things and it also understands grammar and stuff so if I say something that's not accurate in English it would still be able to pick out because you can provide that provide examples of bad grammar as well so demo alright I have five minutes so I'm gonna try to do this pretty quick escape here I'm gonna pray to the time oh god what I've done here is I have built an experience with Django on so if build an experience with Django that which is a front-end it's it's on App Engine so the user when they interact so the interface that you're seeing here is on App Engine and then it speaks to cloud sequel for some of the some of the database requirements and then I send a we don't have to worry too much about that at this point and then all the images that I take from the user going into cloud storage and then everything that needs to be going to dialogue flow I use the dialogue flow API to make a request to it and then I'm using two of the other services which we'll come back to so okay so this is the bot it can set appointments and explore landmarks so I wanted to show two very different things that's why this is doing two very different things let's say I want to set an appointment for 2:00 p.m. tomorrow if I can spell for 2:00 p.m. tomorrow it actually also has spellcheck but I'm not gonna try that because demos always driver license I could say registration or something else and then now it's basically talking to Google Calendar and setting me an appointment I should be able to see that appointment on my calendar that's my actual calendar this is the calendar that you want to see and that's the appointment that it's set up for 2:00 p.m. tomorrow so I'm basically making a hook into and into a calendar and calling that the other thing that it can do is it can also just in the interest of time I'm just gonna upload an image and then it should be able to go into dip into the ml API for vision and look at what the image was and parse the landmark that was in the image the image itself was was Golden Gate so it parses that it calls the ML API and gives the response so how is this happening this is dialog flow you go into the intense and you create those intents I have it if somebody says hi hello that's when I trigger the trigger of the bot and I say yes I can help you with appointments and explore and getting I have one minute and doing really quickly here explore landmarks and then once somebody has said okay I want to upload an image I go into the file upload schedule an appointment I come here and I say okay if people say this this and that need an appointment for p.m. tomorrow then I ask for a couple things that they have not told me like they didn't tell me that they want to come in for a license so I asked for that and that's pretty simple because I just make it a required field and I don't move forward without they give without them giving me that information and all of that it's pretty pretty simple to do now I go to fulfillment to actually serve that record to fulfill that request and in fulfillment I write it but a little piece of code where I say this is where I want to connect to my calendar function yeah this is the calendar function that that's taking date and time and the appointment type which are the three pieces of information we extracted and then from there it's setting up an appointment and if it can't find is find that slot to be open it will throw an error and say that is not available or there's a conflict in that appointment same I'm doing for ml API I'm calling the vision API and I'm trading an instance of the vision API and then saying unjust landmark detection you could also do I've done this for receipts as well you can pass a receipt in the image and and look for text annotations in it and you can then start to do refunds and learn more about what the users trying to say from the refund perspective and things like that so this is just to show the art of the possible with the MLA API all of this code I'll go back into my slide so that you can find me all of this code is available on my github repository and if you are really pretty new to dialog flow in general or conversational experiences I have a series called deconstructing chat bots on a YouTube channel it has about 15 episodes and this demo is also in there so you can try it on on by yourself and I have a step-by-step video to follow along in that as well so with that I would wrap it up thank you hopefully this was helpful [Applause]
