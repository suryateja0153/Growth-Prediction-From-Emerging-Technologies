 welcome to the Harvard art museums and tonight's lecture rare and beautiful objects new and unexpected findings revisiting Harvard's early Chinese Jade's my name is Caitlin Howe and I am a sophomore living in courier house and I concentrate in the history of an art and architecture I am a member of the Harvard Art Museum's student board am delighted to welcome you to the museum on behalf of our student community please now be sure to turn off your cell phones and help me to warmly welcome Soyoung Lee the Landon and Lavinia clay chief curator of the Harvard Art Museum's who will introduce tonight's program good evening Thank You Katelyn we have an amazing group of student board members and I'm always so grateful for their involvement and these poised students who come up here and introduce us so welcome it's my pleasure to have this honor of giving the welcoming opening remarks we've already said the title but welcome to rare and beautiful objects new and unexpected findings revisiting Harvard's early Chinese Jade's this is a really long-term project that's come to fruition and we're all extremely excited to have Jenny back with us now before I dive into introducing our main speaker of the evening please indulge me in saying a few words of thanks to those who made this evening possible now first of course we'd like to acknowledge the generosity of Grenville L Winthrop the collector whose collection gifted to the Harvard Art Museum's made this work possible he was a new york-based attorney and prolific art collector Winthrop bequeathed his entire collection nearly 4,000 works to his alma mater Harvard Harvard upon his death in 1943 and the collection ranges widely so of course the incredible ancient Chinese collection including the Jade's but from paintings to drawings to sculpture from so including Western European art angra Whistler and the pre-raphaelites but also ancient Americas as well as near and far east now although the entire gift was transformative for the Harvard Art Museum's it's the nearly 700 Jade objects that we will celebrate tonight so without one thrips thoughtful generosity this whole program would not be possible but in addition to the gift of the collection this evening is made possible by some of our generous supporters and we'd like to thank the e Rhodes and Leona B carpenter foundation for a generous grant that supported this project and we're very grateful to the Harvard yenching Institute for the fellowship that allowed Jennie so to come and spend a semester here in Cambridge reviewing the Winthrop collection and then writing this book the Andrew W Mellon publication and the publication and the Henry P McHenry fund helped make the pepp the publication possible and lastly support for this particular this evenings program the lecture is provided by m victor levin 'tried fund which was established through the generosity of his wife children and Friends of the late mr. Levin Tripp Harvard class of 1935 and with with that generous fund we have been able to share so much of our collection and programming with the public and with the Harvard community and in fact the Greater Boston community so at long last I get to introduce Jenny Jenny so received her BA from Swarthmore College and MA and PhD in art history from Harvard so she's our very own and her mentor was max ler and those of us in the field of East Asian art but Chinese art in particular that's a big name who was in fact author of the first catalogue of the winthrop Jade's published in 1975 she served as a senior curator at the freer and Sackler galleries of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of their ancient Chinese art collection she left the Smithsonian to take up the position of professor of Fine Arts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and later was also appointed director of that University's Institute of Chinese Studies and subsequently the Art Museum's she retired from her full-time Hong Kong appointments in 2015 retaining an association as adjunct professor and returned to live in Arlington Virginia so she's back stateside where she continues to publish while serving as a specialist consultant in Chinese art for many American and international institutions and foundations Jenny so has published widely on early Chinese art focusing on materials and cultural exchange as well as on collecting and connoisseurship her books include Chinese Jade's from the Robyn and tong collection 2015 radiant legacy ancient Chinese gold in the main dision collection 2013 traders and Raiders on China's northern frontier 1995 and eastern Joe ritual bronzes in the Arthur M Sackler collection from 1995 please join me in giving a warm welcome to Jenny sue [Applause] I'm okay can you hear me all the way in the back good if you can't just raise your hand well thank you very much Sooyoung for this wonderful introduction to my home home institution I I still can't get over the transformation of the museum from the days they were when I was a student here but it's a good transformation and I just love it here and I think it's just entirely my pleasure and my delight to be able to do this to be able to write this book for the collection the backstory to my book actually began in the 70s when I came to Harvard as a graduate student to study with Max ler Laura at that time was working on the catalog of arcade Chinese Jade's with the help of Louisa Huber in the Winthrop collection and as soon said that catalog still a primary reference for the mature for the collection in the field was published in 1975 so we are talking 40 years ago all graduate students at that time enjoyed the privilege of virtually daily encounters with this magnificent collection and this is this photograph brings back fond memories I'm not sure that's me but I think it should be me just looking intensely this is what leur taught us look carefully closely and intensely so to be able to work on this book today after all these years is my small token of appreciation for this exceptional opportunity and exceptional training that I received at Harvard so fast forward to 2010 I was no longer a graduate student I have been working ten years at the Smithsonian and I have come to know the two remarkable early Chinese collections at both the freer and Sackler gallery there and then of course I left the Smithsonian and went to Hong Kong and did something very different I taught so I went from the museum world into the university world and advise graduate students in early Chinese our meanwhile China's cultural revolutions end and the country's economic development uncovered an overwhelming wealth of archaeological material and being right in Hong Kong on the edge of all of that is possibly the most exciting time of my life I can take a long weekend and go into China and look at new discoveries and to museums and that has been a tremendous help for me in my research but at the same time the the more I get to know about what's going on in the field the more I came to realize that despite this explosion of material and the incredible number of publications that's come out there is no accessible account in either English or Chinese that make sense of this myriad of new material that has surfaced particularly on early Chinese Jay so one purpose behind my book is to provide a framework to navigate some of this material so what do we know now that ler probably didn't know 40 years ago a lot but one of the things very important is that we now have evidence that the jade production began in China at least over seven millennium years ago or around 5000 BC or more in different parts of China here northeast southeast Northwest mostly Neolithic communities using material that they could find in the nearby locations and it is only Oh three thousand to three thousand years later by the early centuries ad or last centuries BC that they started importing material from Far Central Asia here and by the late Imperial era around seventeenth eighteenth century they started importing jadeite another major material in what is now northern Burma or northern Myanmar so essentially most of the Jade that you will see tonight that you will see in any Museum in the United States that claims to be early from China should derive from various sources within China itself and some from Central Asia the far western regions of China now outside of that I'd like to highlight one very important and interesting phenomenon Chinese jade history is more than five thousand years old and it has yielded by far the largest body of worked Jade artifacts created by a single civilization while other Jade working coaches in India New Zealand central and North America have come and gone China's Jade working industry has continued this is a picture I took when I visited a modern Jay working work Jade workshop in Hangzhou in 2017 excuse me so what can account for this longevity the durability of Jade which is really just a piece of stone cannot be the only explanation why did certain elite individuals in China's Neolithic communities chose Jade's for the burial furniture here just a random example of a Neolithic burial from along the Yangtze River area where the the person was buried with Oh over 200 Jade and hard stone axes completely covering the body he was 10 bracelets on each arm this is a burial from around from between 3,500 and 3,000 BC and then all the way down the timeline to these Imperial princes of the Han Dynasty the second century BC who who was buried inside Jade and custard coffins their bodies encased in a Jade suit completely so why did these individuals choose to go to the death and be buried in this way why was jade considered a worthy material to house a sacred Buddhist relic that was dedicated a ninth century tang dynasty emperor here is a white jade casket shape very small casket shape reliquary encased inside a rock crystal casket shape reliquary inside the white jade casket is supposedly the finger bone of the buddha why why was jade considered important enough for scholar officials like read a lien and lagoon lien of the 10th and 11th century and 12 centuries ad why did they collect study and actually made the first catalogues of Jade's in their collection and here is an example of a second century je disk that was buried in with one of the members of the Liu family so it is a second-century disk buried in a 10th century 11th century tomb so it's clearly collected and here is a drawing and those days and no photography a drawing of a piece that was in his collection which curiously closely resembles a piece in the Winthrop collection so these scholar officials of the Song Dynasty collected was buried with catalogue studied these Jade's why did they thought thought it was important enough for them to do this and then why did the 18th century Emperor Qianlong wrote poem after poem in praise of RK Jade's sometimes engraving them on the Jade's themselves here is a piece in the Winthrop collection with the poem engraved on the edge around the edge and a he's in another collection in the Harvard art museums that few people know about the Dane collection that also has an inscription and the Imperial seal of the channel Emperor and graved around the edge so furthermore was it mere coincidence that the names of the hero and heroine of one of China's foremost literary classic the dream of the red chamber as value or precious Jade and black jade these are the names of the hero and the heroine of this classic Chinese novel and that the novel's original title is story of the stone what was it about Jade that attracted early 20th century collectors like Freya Winthrop Sun and shine Pillsbury and Brundage to build the collections that we have in these various museums around her in North America and here I should add Ernest and Helen Pratt gain the the other collection that I mentioned that is in the Harvard art museums which included 300 plus Jade's from the 17th to 19th century that was presented to then the fog museum in 1942 I don't think very many people know about this collection I only discovered this working on the Winthrop collection and as a Chinese economy boomed Jade objects became one of the first things the nouveau riche chose as markers of their success so already by the 90s huge sums of money were being paid for a piece of archaic Jade like this what three and a quarter inch tall white jade figure of a dancer that was sold at Christie's in 1994 for over $300,000 and then later into n2 in 2014 ritual objects like this one in the freer in in the Winthrop collection went for over $200,000 in New York now this fascination with Jade extends down to even the decorative objects I think every Chinese mother would give her daughter a jade pendant either for a birthday or for her wedding that's a very very small way showing the attraction of Jade to the general populace for the richer people we have decorative jadeite incense burner that this one is in the Dane collection that was sold not this one but something like it soared from millions of dollars at auction this piece in fact has a very interesting history it was stolen from the Fogg 40 years ago and was recovered only in 2014 after an attempt to sell it at auction in 2009 so we are very happy that the fog now regains this piece that came from the Dane collection and it's back home again and of course the very very famous jadeite necklace that used to belong to the actress Barbara Hutton or the heiress Barbara Hudson it sold in 2014 for a whopping twenty seven point four million back to the house of Cartier that designed it so in America diamonds may be a girl's best friend in China jade is a girl's best friend so underpinned by archaeological discoveries and looking at Jade's rose throughout Chinese history I can suggest now that Jade's persistent presence in Chinese culture is the result of successive layers of meaning added to the Tyrael and to the products starting with its early association with spiritualism among the neolithic communities from the 5th and 3rd century of millennium BC to its full integration into the political philosophical religious and social context of subsequent millennia during its extended engagement in the lives of the social and ruling as well as ordinary people jade has become so firmly rooted in Chinese life that when Anu and I should say socialist China emerges onto the global arena to host the 2008 Olympics in Beijing the government chose Jade as the centerpiece for the medals awarded to its athletes using the very traditional hierarchy associated with the color of jade so the gold medal has pure white jade the silver medal has a pale yellowish green jade and the copper a bronze medal has the dark green jade so more than 5000 years down the line changes of regime changes of political philosophy jade survives and persisted so the complex layers of this history is laid out in the book in the various chapters of the book I should not attempt to repeat it here like learns 1975 catalog I focus my book focuses on Jade's early history using mainly J's from the Winthrop request of 1943 so you will see on my images always Winthrop 1943 dr. Sneh the accession numbers for those images that do not have any labeling it comes primarily from archaeological sources now the later history of jade in China that is about 2,000 years or so might be covered by a future project using the Dane collection in the salient Museum and this was the same donor actually who donated the magnificent collection of June where that was the focus of an exhibition curated by Melissa boy in 2017 I think right so tonight I will focus on a very small sampling of the hundred or so pieces highlighted in the book pieces that exemplify the heights of rarity the artistic excellence and some of the new things that we've learned in the process of revisiting this collection but before we move on to these pieces let's do a very quick review of what we know what we understand about Jade Jade is as I said a stone and traditionally we think of Jade as two types of material nephrite and jadeite nephrite is what has been worked in China since 5000 BC or more it whereas jadeite is something that was introduced into China around the 18th century BC imported from Burma both of them are very hard nephrite Jade ITAR in six to seven Mohs hardness this is a grading system a scientifically recognized diamond being ten on the scale okay so this is fairly high on the hardness scale and they're right when pure is essentially white jadeite most of the time comes in various shades of gray of green so this is what we will be talking about in terms of the raw material now what does this mean to the Jade worker the maker of jade and also for us the collector or lover what it means is that the hardness of jade says tells us that it's harder than most metals it's harder than steel in some cases and because of its crystalline structure of densely packed bundles it's very tough and an easy way to think of this is your barbecue skewers your bamboo skewers if you take one bamboo skewer you can snap it very easily but if you have a whole bundle of them it'll be very hard for you to snap it so that's toughness and this is what I mean by toughness so as a result jade is never carved in the traditional sense with Michelangelo going at his marble with a chisel and a hammer the workers - never comes into contact with Jade Jade is is worked by grinding that is using an abrasive made out of stone that is harder than it okay so the tool itself can be anything it could be wood it could be it could be sinew it could be bamboo it could be something very very soft much softer than Jade it doesn't matter it's the abrasives who do the damage now what these two images tell you is that this is taken in Beijing in a day a bit Jade workshop meeting in the 1930s and it shows two workmen going at it manually with a bow saw trying to cut open a 1 cubic foot of jboden it took them roughly a couple of weeks to just slice one slice out of a cubic foot of Boulder the next image here shows you what it is in a webshop today but a year or two ago that's a workman using an electrically driven saw going at spinning at about 170 miles per hour and he would be doing the grinding and the cutting of the Jade so all this is unaccounted the hardness and the toughness of jade so with that in mind imagine what it would be like for a jade worker from 5,000 4,000 BC trying to work something out of jade so now we get to see some of these early pieces this piece is in the Winthrop collection in the original catalog leur had indicated an Eastern Joe date which means anywhere from 600 BC to about 300 BC beautiful condition almost pristine almost new beautifully ground and yet we now know through archaeological excavations and these are excavated parallels that this actually goes back to about 2,000 or 1700 BC so it's something that lurk could not have known when he was working on his 1975 catalog this is what a kea archaeology has done for us over the over the years now another example is this one again it's a cicada and in Lars catalog he said something about it being Western Joe which says it's early first millennium BC this is the top view this is a side you beautifully again beautiful material translucent sort of when you shine a light through it it's almost like a pool of greenish water and wonderful thing about this is that another excavator example came out from a site that dates to around 2000 BC so we are again pushing this all the way back and a thousand years in terms of date in both these examples the Secada and the fluted ornament that you just saw you notice how smooth the the modeling is how rounded the whole thing is and I put in a marble sculpture for comparison it's almost the same sculptural effect the roundness of the smoothing and of all the planes but marble is a much softer material it's only three on Mohs scale and you have to really appreciate how difficult it is to get Jade nephrite to be so rounded so smooth and so sculptural in quality when in fact the majority of things of Jays made in early China are flat like these like this one a slab a human figure just a slab in a thin slab and very and its features defined by simple drillings this is a very primitive way of creating a human figure separating the arms and the legs by drillings and then the rest the fingers very simply in size the features of the face very broad mouth thick eyebrows also very simply in size but very powerful in a way we think it was probably a phone'll some ceremonial object where the bottom part was would have been inserted into a staff and so forth now it is not as if and we've seen with the Secada it's not as if the early jade worker couldn't do fully sculptural object this is another piece in the Winthrop collection I would say about three four hundred years maximum five hundred years later than this one but a fully sculptural three-dimensional object of another figure and standing pigeon-toed and the side rear shows how he sort of slightly bent in some pose of deference very elaborate headdress depicted his garment the sash hanging down the center depicted the long suspension back of his robe also depicted very clearly so it's not as if they couldn't do something sculptural it is very often a matter of choice and perhaps a question of what the object was supposed to be useful here another five hundred three five hundred years down the timeline we have another very sculptural figure here depicted kneeling in the round but almost around the same time you still have these very flat slab like figures with the holes drilled very primitively just like that for to separate the arms in the body this is maybe above 1300 BC this piece is about 500 BC so we as art historians I think we have always to remember that artistic development is never linear there is no one single direction it things go back and forth and we should not be surprised to see multiple streamlined lines of development happening at the same time now a rare object in the Winthrop collection is this Jade beaker or Cup with very large bird shape handles in general vessels containers cups and so forth are very rare in Jade why because they demand a lot of consumption of a solid hunk of very precious material and on top of that we have to hollow the whole thing out for it to become functional as a cup now again this is a unique object there is nothing like it anywhere in any museum that I have come across and in Lars catalog he put it very very late in the early China period he called it lay Eastern yo ohan which means a third or second century BC but what we now know and this is the Winthrop piece is that this cup was actually a much earlier piece dating to the beginning of the first millennium BC and here is a bronze version of it that is was excavated and is now in the Shaanxi History Museum in Xi'an a Capri a pottery version of this also with these large elaborate bird handles that's in the Seattle Art Museum and then a wooden lacquered wooden version of it excavated again from a 92 eighth century BC - in almost fresh out of the ground as you can tell so we are pretty confident that the Winthrop beaker or cup belongs in this early first millennium BC group and again it's something could not have known about when he wrote his 1975 catalog the other thing that is rare and unusual and in the container category are these two the pair of jade oval cups and the lidded container with the gilt bronze mounting down here now in my research and in my students research in Hong Kong we've counted maybe just barely 30 jade vessels that we can that we know of either in museums or from excavations Winthrop Harvard has one two three four the the beaker we just saw and then I found this when I was rummaging through storeroom which was a gift from Helen Pratt Dayne subsequent to the original 1942 gift so this entered the museum in 1950 and it is essentially the same kind of Cup but without the elaborate decoration and also counterpart excavated from a second century BC tomb when the Dane Cup was catalogue when it first came in it was called Ming Dynasty and I think it had was left at that and no one really bothered to do anything with it so now I think of the just about 30 vessels in jade that we know of Harvard has five so I think we should be very proud of that the wonderful thing that how it also has that are extremely rare small ornaments like this one and this one that that is composed of two separate pieces a dragon here a bird here connected by a freely moving link now the whole thing was ground out of a single solid piece of jade if there is no mechanical joint whatsoever so just imagine the work of first carving these elaborate openwork designs and then somehow separating this plaque from that plaque and then leaving this link that connects them so that they can move like that freely so Harvard has to there are a total of six that we know of today one is in the British Museum and then the rest is in China too in China from an excavated three in China from excavations two in winthrop and one at the British Museum so this is a technical rarity that we do not see very often and here we have two of such examples now another interesting technical thing that that emerged during my work on the collection with these dragon pendants in fact this is one of the highlights of the Winthrop collection we probably have one of the largest collection of the best and largest and most beautiful dragon shaped pendants anywhere outside of China okay and if you look at them they are all different I'm lonely showing you one they're all different they're very lively and they're incredibly worked these pendants were made to be worn roughly in this manner as with a series of other Jade's suspended from the belt of a long rope so it is very important of course that it suspends well and is well balanced the same this is a more elaborate construction but essentially you still see these individual pendants very different in shape and size being essentially suspended down a central axis now in the winter collection there are three such dragon pendants that show two suspension holes here this is a detail now normally you would think fine you know what's what's in a hole I mean it doesn't exist and actually learn noted the double holes on these pendants when when he wrote his catalogue but he didn't go further with it and what I did was that I asked myself why drill two holes and you can see from here that the holes were drilled after all the decoration was put in in other words it is the last thing the Jade worker would do before he hands the product to the client or the purchaser and he would have spent months or maybe years creating this very elaborate shape creating these very beautiful relieved designs in size designs polishing it to this beautiful high gloss and then he would drill the hole now if he placed the hole in the wrong place the pendant will not hang properly and I think that's what happened here one hole was drilled and it didn't hang straight so he had to go and drill a second hole and that second hole worked and for students who came to my workshop yesterday we played with one of these dragon dragon pendants and they could see actually how two different homes worked in terms of the suspension now in modern terms I think Calder would make a good comparison and in in one of his writings in this construction of his mobile he said I start by cutting out a lot of shakes then I arranged them calculating for balance until I think I found the point of support this is crucial as there is only one such point and it must be right if the object is to hang and pivot freely now this is called a writing in the 20th century with the benefit of a lot of engineering mechanical engineering principles of balance and all of that in this drive impendence they were created in the 4th century BC by jade workers who were making these gorgeous things and then drilling in the hole at the last minute now the wonder of this is there are very few mistakes I have gone round to many many museums and tried it looked at every single one of its dragon pendants say most of them have only one whole and the whole is always drilled correctly when you when I put a string through it lift it up it's balanced so we are lucky in the wealth of collection to actually have the mistakes made by a jade worker and three of them because without these mistakes we probably wouldn't appreciate the significance of their achievement we can only guess what kind of experience or knowledge they might have that would allow them to correctly place the hole every time so so much for technical things the links the placement of the holes now the Windsor collection also has very important inscribed Jade's the top one is Winthrop I deliberately sort of should illustrate them to show your relative proportions the bottom one is in the freer collection and the detail shows you an inscription in size here and on the freer is also in size there now Jade's with inscriptions in general are rare and ones with long enough inscriptions that talk about events important events in history are even rarer most of the inscriptions on Jade's deal with auspicious sayings and stuff like that or maybe indicate ownership and that's about it but both the freer plate and the Winthrop blade talk about ministers for instance in the freer blade it was to commemorate an appointment by the Joe King for a minister to go south to act as his emissary the Winthrop blade talks about a minister participating in a very important annual ritual administered by the king himself so these clearly were important things in their lives and they commemorate them by inscribing it on a jade blade now to date blades Jade's with this type of very substantive inscriptions a number less in the fingers of a hand we have one of them then we have the inscribed blades the inscribed jets that indicate ownership and this is a piece in the winter collection with a poem by the channel Emperor dated 1766 and inscribed along the outer edge completely along the outer edge of the disc so this is endorsement and ownership at the highest possible level then I found this one again rummaging through the storage a disc from the Dane gift of 1942 this one also has a poem written by the channel Emperor dated 17 for this 47 and it actually preserves the original hardwood frame that it would have been in a set on in the palace so in some sense the Dane ownership the game disc is even more complete than the Winthrop one now another indicator of ownership is this piece in the also in the day in collection that I discovered it's an acoustic piece made and Jade after a bronze prototype with an inscription on the under belly of this beast that says made in imitation of antiquity by the great Ching general Empress so again an 18th century imperial piece lifting Jade to the highest possible level in terms of collecting in terms of ritual and ceremony then I found there was actually a whole new category of inscriptions on Jade's again both are in winthrop as you saw and this is a dragon and on again somewhere now I don't even remember where now some obscure place on the thickness of the dragon pendant is inscription that says middle 43 just like that then on this disk a large disc inscription says the fifth one of 14 now this this actually was all of these inscriptions of numbers were read and identified in Lords 1975 catalogue he couldn't read all of them but in this one in particular I think he read it the other way around I think the problem with the Chinese numbers on a circular trajectory is that if you read it this way it goes like that if you turn it around if it reads just as well in the other way so he misread this number and I unfortunately did not check it was my problem my fault did not cross check and repeated this error in the catalog so this is how it should be read and why is it so important that it's corrected it's because when this is caused itself I'm the fifth one of 14 it is reflecting a burial practice in during the third and second century BC where and here you see a drawing of that where the body was covered with anything from thirteen fourteen eighteen or twenty three disks just like this with the same kind of decoration so we now can almost say pretty certain that this disc came from a context like that was one of fourteen that was used in burial of an individual now more than that I think we I found that there are other numbers on inscribed in out of way places on J's this is a piece in the Sackler collection and this number is right on the edge here it says 523 a 24 and then this is an excavated example very similar to this and the number says 1214 what do these numbers mean we really don't know what we do know is that particularly in the case of the excavated examples with these really really high numbers they are older Jade's by order I mean for third century BC Jade's buried in 2nd of 1st century BC tombs so it's early Jade in a lake tomb and you have large numbers five hundreds thousands so my very preliminary guess is that the these numbers might reflect either a grading issue when you say middle or Shang or top it might reflect the grade either of the material or of the workmanship and sometimes if the number is low enough it might actually reflect where it's located in a very elaborate pendant but when you get into the hundreds and thousands it says something else entirely at least to me it says that maybe we are looking at the activities of early collecting early inventory systems or even collections management systems I mean they are written in places in exactly the same places that we were writing accession numbers these days because no one sees them except for the person who knows where to look for them so this is to me you know an incredibly exciting thing to learn about the fact that they were collecting they were amassing these large numbers of Jade's from earlier generations and most of these were princely tombs where they were found and that they were trying in some way to record them to inventory them and to sort of do some management collections management the way we do in museums these days and the wonderful thing is that none of these observations I mean these numbers would not be possible to a casual viewer it has to be handled and studied close-up now some bad news I would say I mean so far it's all been good news this little bad news is that we have an iconic piece like this one that was in the Winthrop collection very well published and so on so forth loaded as one of the greatest masterpieces of early Chinese art a mirror a bronze mirror that is inlaid with jade and glass and gold and silver you know all of that and it has been unique all this time there isn't a single comparable piece like it even with the ladies excavations and so we took it up to the lab we'll have it has such a great lab and and Angela child and Catherine Airmen helped put it underneath the x-ray and we discovered that underneath is actually a genuine bronze mirror from the time from perhaps the second century BC but there are all sorts of problems with the Jade and the glass and how they were attached to the to the top the backside of the mirror so we are now working on trying to be a hundred percent sure that we are dealing not with an original artifact but something that was put together perhaps at a later time more likely in the 20th century but not without perhaps some inspiration from genuine artifacts of the time which this is a bronze a heavily fragmented bronze mirror inlaid with a glass beads that was excavated and so we know that there must have been precedent for this kind of thinking and decoration now another two pieces that's really complicated are these large horse heads again quite unique and very special in the Winthrop collection were had dated it hands Ahana second century BC and they're obviously bronze and ceramic versions of horses from the period but no Jaguars so how do we understand this and then we discovered with x-rays again that there is this huge gouging or perforation underneath stuffed with paper and screws and you know all sorts all manner of things that you do not consider ancient and the holes according to scientists are also extremely neatly and well drilled very clean so there is um immediately the suspicion that the hole the drilling and all the stuffing must have been much much later now it doesn't mean that the horse head is not ancient there are ancient potentials for something like this I show you a dragon head ornament with a very large opening on the underside that was recovered from a pleasure palace of the Tang Dynasty so eight ninth century they pick and the archaeologists think that it might have served as the end piece to a banister railing or maybe even furniture the Sackler in Washington DC also has a similar type of large dragon headed fitting that dates even later into the 12th or 13th century so the Winthrop's horses may actually be ancient but perhaps later than we think it is now we're still working on that so that's another one of things and of course those of you who are interested in Chinese Jade's know this very very famous piece in the Victoria and Albert Museum it's a cover image for its catalog on Chinese jade but I went out there looked underneath and found this incredibly clean tubular drilling and looked at the piece itself and I talked to the curator and said maybe it is not Han Dynasty or you should sort of look very carefully and do a new study in the same way that we are studying our horse heads so that there is a case where the verdict is yet to come a second piece where the verdict is yet to come is this bracelet that's on display I think ler put it in his catalogue as date uncertain I now think that it just is probably right on the other hand I've sort of stuck my neck out and put it suggested it might actually be Neolithic around 3 3000 between 2000 and 2500 BC but there are things about it that is bothersome particularly the alteration that's all the way around throughout and you can see how feathery and and crackled it all is except for this one section on the inside where you can see the near pristine material this pale grayish green jade now what caused me to worry about the the antiquity of this it's not just the way the alteration looks it doesn't look it looks too even it's also because of the design where you have multiple I think eight of these panels with faces on it we know these faces from excavated sources in the southeast in the Neolithic southeast from 300 3000 to 200 to 2500 BC but nothing excavated in a bracelet is this large or has that many faces nothing on the other hand the freer has a piece just like that also altered in this very sort of amber reddish color varies a fractured thing that bothered me when I was in the career and and then there's a third piece in the Royal Ontario Museum in - in Toronto that is completely unaltered that shows that pure pristine light green material also with many many faces on it so that's probably too much information but the last piece of information I'm going to throw in is that the this is one of the few pieces that Winthrop had a record of where he got it from Windsor didn't keep great records but he bought it from a Japanese dealer in 1918 ok freer also bought stuff in the 19-teens and this Japanese dealer was actually a very closely associated with the imperial family and then right after the fall of the Qing Dynasty it helped them a lot of things from the imperial collection so that they can live comfortably outside the palace so the provenance then what we call provenance now sort of raises a big question as to whether this piece actually might have come from the imperial collection and if it came from the imperial collection it might have come been an akai singh piece like that big container we saw with the channel made after antiquity so I mean all of these things pop up and and we have no answers to we looked at it I did all the research and we are still at a loss so this is very much a situation we have to deal with our constantly in spite of all the information that we have and now finally we look why why did that bracelet create so much trouble it's because of the alteration because of that surface it's not it's not real in that sense but then alteration can be hundred percent real like this pair of cups we have in winthrop collection where the outside of one is very much altered almost to an opaque ivory color whereas the outside of the other is almost pristine in in its original pale green color now we think what might have happened was that these two cups were put one on top of the other in a burial so that the cup that was didn't change didn't alter was inside the other cup whereby the outside being in contact with the burial juices and and waters and all of that changed into this opaque ivory color and of course we have beautiful totally pristine in unnoted pieces that are definitely genuine ancient so the whole question of alteration of a Chinese jade has been a major major issue in connoisseurship and understanding and a real challenge in scientific analysis so finally we have this wonderful pair another JS in the Winthrop collection a jade disk ax also in the Winthrop collection where you have all of this you have their pristine material you have the natural discoloration of the stone and may be right on the edge some alteration due to burial and this incredibly beautiful ira colored piece that's large it's on display it's this big that we completely do not understand what's going on in terms of the material is it pristine the way it is like ivory is has it completely changed ivory colored what happened to it how did this alteration take place and it is this these questions about alteration of jade natural in burial or even manually manipulated that can't continues to bug us in because it poses kind of sir ship issues questions and stuff that that we are still struggling with so in spite of all the things that we've learned about Chinese jade there's still many questions that needed to be answered but I do hope that you realize just from these few examples tonight that you have at Harvard one of the best and most beautiful collections of Chinese jade and a perfect vehicle for research for teaching and for training the next generation about historians and that is why I think Winthrop was right on the mark when he said in his presentation to to Harvard that he wanted to give this collection to have it and not to a National Museum like the National Gallery in Washington DC so that it may and I quote it may prove for generations to become a benefit to students of art and lovers of beauty thank you [Applause] thank you so much Jenny that was a most interesting and intriguing talk we are sort of at the end of the program but if there's one burning question otherwise you know you're obviously all welcome to come up and and speak to Jenny if there is one burning question we'll take it otherwise I did want to remind you that the gallery is the first of all gallery is open for you to see some of these amazing works in person and the shop is open and we're offering 20% off Jenny's book thank you very much for joining us and let's give another round of warm applause today [Applause]
