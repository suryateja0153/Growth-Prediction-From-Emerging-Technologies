 and I describe what we do with cupboard graph so my name is Latin points I'm a computational biologist and with my company I essentially do neo4j consulting for pharmaceutical industry and medical research so it's a partly industry and partly public project with universities research institutes all that kind of stuff and three weeks ago and I started loading loading some data set to new 4j because that essentially what I do and I started with these these famous case statistics in case data from Johns Hopkins University and just played with it essentially and then one more data set came up and one more collaborators came onboard and we build a real community around a knowledge graph on covert 19 and I give you a quick tour of the project at the data so you find everything on Kovac graph dark also current current developments and news etcetera if I thought it here um we are very diverse a team both from academia and from companies so we kind of have well at least half of the European you forge a community here we have pradhana we have structure we have linked careers we have graph where go Fillion etc so it's a very diverse team which is in my opinion very interesting because doing doing something like a knowledge graph on on this disease in a purely academic or purely university setting would be very difficult what we do is is in many cases considered as some sort of infrastructure we build a tool that is supposed to head scientists do their job and that is something for what you don't get don't get funding through the traditional research funding agencies so that's why this is really interesting I think and we have we do have the contact to scientists we have their the data scientists and we have all the software developers around new 4js we actually have the capability is to build a useful tool and this is something that we that I think sets us apart from all the other data projects that you find on the internet and most of essentially marketing for fancy titles we want to build something that actually helps researchers through the job and we're not quite there yet but what we managed to achieve in in two or three weeks is really impressing I think and impressive I think and we are on track to build more use cases to collaborate with the real world researchers and to build actually actually useful applications on top of our knowledge graph and this is who we are and everything we do is of course available so you can you find everything on cava graft a talk so the verge a database is public we have a very active community and we use matrix it's sort of a free and federate it's like and everyone is of course invited to join our chat and you find all that also on the website covered graft at all they stuff like get in touch so we can have a quick look at the data since we're working with wallah this is here as I said and this is what you see in the bottom left we started with these case statistics first thing we added was word population data and to sort of put it in perspective something like percentage of infected in the population etcetera the first broad also to say data that we used was the core 19 publication data set it was published as part of the kegger challenge it's 50k scientific publications curated that are relevant for the coronavirus at the covered 19 disease second tech space data set we edit was a patent data set from an organization called lens dark and they also created patterns that are relevant for the virus we then started to add more biology to the whole whole database and everything from a basic biomedical data data sources genome databases etc gene annotations and the fourth building block currently in the down ride is experimental data and offices public offices around but obviously all this is separated in different databases from different data providers and our goal of course is to connect everything because this is what you need to answer real world medical or biological questions because I mean the problem in the end is we have a solid understanding of how viruses work but no one can can really comprehensively answer why this virus leads to so many side effects to so many severe cases and this is something that we have to understand mechanistically we have to understand how this disease works on a mechanistic biological level to actually develop drugs because if it seemed and might work might not work but it will take some time and if you look at influenza for example the hand for insert vaccines but you need a new one every year and you never know how well it actually works and as of yet we don't know the corona virus is going to come back in a slightly change or mutate it way so understanding diseases on a mechanistic level is always be the the basis for any kind of drug development here's a quick overview of the actual data set so this is a screenshot from the new frontier browser on the top left and yellow you see the publication's we have papers papers of the full text here in blue you see patterns again they are subdivided in in the title abstract etc and here on the right is biology so we have thought the information we have on genes proteins etc we have annotation for these data sets of the like gene ontology terms of sample composition so here you will know that it's category using groups of biological functions in a lighter blue we have x-ray experimental data from a really huge database we can say that certain genes are active under certain circumstances and in certain tissues and what you can do with this is answer questions like in these 50,000 covered 19 or coronavirus relevant publications to find sir jeans are these jeans actually relevant in in lung and human lung for example these kind of a kind of path like queries on this data set would be very very difficult to answer if some cool PhD student had to read all the papers and open gene databases and genome databases and look for that manually very difficult this is an overview of the data set you already see some nice graphs graph things you can do here because one of the first sort of sort of graph manipulations we did was to split up the full text data sources into individual sentences which are called a fragment usually a sentence everything is split up and we now have people working on NLP related tasks like named entity recognition so that we can create more connections between the word of biology and these text data sources this is sort of the first goal and a lot more data sources are on their way one of the next elements will be clinical trials which sort of combination of structured data so you are obviously in the communique trying to test the drug you see if it's efficient but you also collect a lot of text essentially because doctors write down the observations it's always also a part of the whole thing and more connections and epi like connections between the structured world of biology and the unstructured world of text this is what we are currently working on even even so the next set of slides are examples data examples even very very simple things and can be incredibly useful looking model them on the graph genes have names here's my favorite gene it's called Fox a to unfortunately some people call the gene Fox a to other people call the gene for some reason t CF 3b as I call it others call it Asian f3b so genes have synonym names and this is essentially historic development so the way I mean the oldest genes have the name maybe 100 years ago or so and but this is how it is just including something like these tsunami mappings in a graph you see that here right this is the name of the gene and you have these synonyms steps just including this is incredibly useful because if you read a publication and the talks about TC f3b and you don't know that this is the same gene that other people call fox a2 then you don't see this connection just this is very very small graph light step can be incredibly important it useful then again if you go the next step from from the biology here from genes and connected to text data sources very simple queries for example I can give me give me the genes that have most mentions in my curator text corpus this can be very very interesting because you find find new ideas in the end and this knowledge graph in this database it does not solve any kind of problem it's it's a tool that researchers can use to generate ideas to know how hypotheses etc which is what you want to use it for and we already took the next step and went from this text data through basic biology down to real experimental data so you find a find a claim in the paper certain gene if mentioned in the vacatur covered 19 paper dataset okay but is this gene actually expressed which means is it actually active in in the tissue I'm interested in this kind of question would be very very tedious as you will do it manually and what like I try to mention the beginning we don't just want to build a cool datacenter everyone else does that and it's it's nice it's a nice exercise so to say but it doesn't solve any kind of problem and what were to do is we want to build applications on top of this knowledge graph and we already started so we have a visual graphics program that was built on request by researchers by Y works it's it down here here you can can do more specific searches so yeah you can search for gene and you can specifically asked for neighboring genes and for publications that mention one or two or multiple genes so this sort of cocoa mentions are called citations and are very important and we have support from the Koreas and they they donated any Korea's enterprise license and with that we working with researchers because they can explore the graph themselves which can be credible useful and grow Fillion is already building the first board tabula a dashboard like interfaces and all of this we try to do on one request with reword use cases which is I think a super important okay that was a quick run run through of the cupboard graph and I think it would make sense to just continue with questions if there are any questions so are there any questions for Martin please feel free to put them in the public chat so are you able to stay with us for the Meetup yes sure yeah one last thing maybe so we are an open community go to college after dark get in touch join outset we need any kind of help essentially so if you work with neo4j if you have a background in computational biology if you want to do data loading if you have ideas on visualization interfaces everything so we have a very very good project management and we reach the very good project management or documentation level a short time there are open issues on github that that you look at so that's github.com slash profit graph and would be fantastic if if you join
