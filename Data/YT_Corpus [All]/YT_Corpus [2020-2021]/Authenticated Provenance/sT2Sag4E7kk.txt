 Good evening everyone and welcome to our panel discussion tonight on "Building Resilience Supply Chains with Blockchain." My name is Sophie Rifkin and I am the Senior Associate Director at the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business. We are delighted to host a virtual program tonight and are very thankful to our panelists for being with us and thankful to all of you listening in for joining us as well. A few points of housekeeping: just a reminder that this session is being recorded and will be posted to our website in the coming days. We will have 15 minutes for questions at the end of the discussion. To ask the question, and you're welcome to submit them throughout, please use the Q&A button located at the bottom of your screen. And now I'm delighted to introduce Tensie Whelan, the Director of the Center for Sustainable Business and Clinical Professor at Stern, who will moderate tonight's conversation. Tensie turn it over to you. Thanks so much Sophie and really a pleasure to have everyone here tonight. For those of you who don't know the Center for Sustainable Business, our mission is to help current and future business leaders embed sustainability core to their business strategy and drive innovation, operational efficiency, employee engagement, and value to society of course. We work in and have educational programs, we have research programs with companies, we have the events and we're always happy to have partners so if any of you are interested in working with us more closely please feel free to reach out. So before I introduce our terrific panel I'm really looking forward to the conversation I just wanted to level set for a minute about blockchain and what it is. So blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a constantly growing list of transaction records and these records are referred as blocks and every block contains a link to the previous block. So in effect it's an open ledger that captures transaction data between parties in a permanent and verifiable way so if you're thinking about a sustainable and resilient supply chain you'd be thinking about the fact that you're going to have records for each stakeholder ranging from let's say the farmer all the way to the retailer and even potentially to the consumer and in each part of that journey a new permanent block of information is created which enables you to have more transparency, traceability in your supply chain. I just want a one cautionary note right is that like anything else garbage in is garbage out so let's just say you have a sustainable supply to your own coffee and the coffee farmer is not adequately verified that indeed his or her practices are sustainable but is signed off on is sustainable and goes into the blockchain that way that then becomes a permanent record as a sustainable coffee when in fact it isn't. So we just need to be clear that this is a really important tool but there are other things that one needs to do in order to make it really as effective as it can be and we're going to hear a lot about this from our panel tonight. So let me move on to to the panel and I'm going to you seen the photo in the titles of the each speaker so I'm not gonna repeat that, I'm gonna ask each of them to do a brief kickoff to introduce their organization and then we're going to go through a series of several questions and making sure that we have time enough to for all of you to speak so I may be a little bit rude with our panel if we tend to go on too long and the enthusiasm of our responses to make sure that everybody has a chance to talk and you have a chance to provide your questions. So let's kick this off briefly with Caleb Ferguson who product marketing manager at BlockApps and also a Stern alum - welcome to you. Hi thanks, can you hear me all right? Yes. Hey so yeah my name is Caleb as Tensie mentioned. I'm a Stern alum  and I'm a product marketing manager of BlockApps. BlockApps basically provides a blockchain platform technology almost like a piece of software to build and run business networks. it all happens on our platform called Strato which it runs basically a super enhanced version of the etherium protocol if you're familiar with that and we've been around for about five years now we help large enterprises you know fortune 500 companies like the ones you see here they are Ticketmaster BHP Billiton you Strato to build blockchain into their business and I'm excited to be here and hear from the other panelists as well so let me now ask mark Hanna also a journal um CMO of rich line group at Berkshire Hathaway company to introduce his organization I thank intensely and thank you very much everyone for attending this will hope to make it very interesting for you so yes I'm a chief marketing officer of Richland group or part of Brooks or Hathaway and our attention really to chain-of-custody supply chain tracking goes back to 2006 with an initial regional blip of software called string we got very involved starting in 2017 updating what we were doing utilizing block saying which is far far far superior and robust and most importantly for us it was creating a chain of custody of trust because it wasn't all us in putting every node all the way along the way so it's technology we believe in we're very much we're in the precious metals and diamond industry so it's a technology that's important it might be nascent but it's incredibly important for the trust ability of the products we have going forward so thank you very much for inviting me Thank You Marc and now let me ask my Kaplan partner invisible not invisible if he could introduce his organization absolutely so thank you all for for having me and thank you all for participating first and foremost so invisible is a sustainable seafood company and we also built our own whole chain traceability system for initially for our supply chains but have since reapplied that technology to other supply chains as well most recently today we announced and shared the results of our traceability program with Estee louder tracing vanilla from Madagascar all the way through their supply chain to the Aveda brand this really brings together my background in sustainability to previous experiences one leading digital for Unilever is chief sustainability office and before that was implementing the EM fish initiative for the US Department of State so that brought together the experiences in the public and private sector applied those to seafood I'm worked with MasterCard at Unilever brought that together with the current business and created whole chain so that's me I understand people are having problems with hopefully that's that's fixed now let me now introduce Leandro Nunez who is vice president product development and innovation at MasterCard and labs thank you for joining us and oh thank you thanks for having me yeah my name is Lander Nunez I'm vice president of product development innovation as part of the organization MasterCard that we call nastika labs where we there is good introduction of new products and technologies to the market into the MasterCard portfolio being one of the initiatives we have here is NASA is the moniker blockchain where we develop the news case related to traceability and more specifically also was sustainability where we are the different industries food agriculture minerals Logistics great and also it's it's amazing to building this panel and having one of our partners you with us mark for invisible we are we have a real life blockchain production with them and um we'll be happy to discuss and learning and sharing sites with with everybody great thank you so much so let's kick off the discussion I'd like to start with a question a broad question about what trends are driving the need for blockchain in your industry as it relates to promoting sustainability and resilience to shocks such as komen and climate change and maybe mark Kaplan maybe we could start with you because I know you've done a lot of thinking about the 19 impact on supply chain a lot of you on this around traceability so love to hear your thoughts about these broad trends sure so it while it started really before covet I think the pandemic has really highlighted some of the weaknesses in supply chains and food in particular has been well-documented with a lot of the shortages and outbreaks in different facilities for us this really highlighted the reason why we created whole chain as part of creating a seafood business from the outset as a matter of fact we'll actually be creating a case study as a result of this because what traceability to each step of our supply chains enabled us to do was to quickly and in real time react to the nuances in supply chains that are happening at each stage on a day to day basis so particularly things like if we in given that we're a seafood company you can imagine a lot goes through Seattle so with the first one of the early outbreaks was there and we processed Cod salmon and halibut there so what we had to do was advanced production timelines in advance knowing that we had this coming up we knew the processor the source the packaging so by having tree to every step of the supply chain we ended up running parallel processes in terms of packaging packing production printing which would have otherwise been done in a sequence and that enabled us to advance our timelines which are enabling us to then react and actually have products on shelf in advance of when we were expecting to do so because we're compensating for shortages and other supply chains like beef pork and chicken with seafood talk about this issue more on the next questions or more about your specific seafood example but certainly I step back out like you know looking more broadly trends right yeah what do you see so and this is a lot of what informed us to create the business was this desire for consumer transparency mislabelling recalls I mean the real the the conduct and the realities of the food systems in their opaque supply chains have really created this demand for consumers to have visibility particularly to the provenance of their commodities and so knowing that the demand was there for traceability it's really enable to consumer to make purchasing decisions in alignment with their values I think the the realities of the food system and being opaque and the combination of that with the demand like the heightened awareness of nutrition and the ingredients and then combined with this overwhelming reality which I would say is more than a trend I would say it's a it's like an awakening almost where people are now really concerned about the values of the companies that are behind the dollars that they're spending so I think those are all the implications thank you mark Anna I'm wondering if you can add to that perspective in terms of these broader trends driving the need for black chain around Sahiban was lian's talked a bit about it from the Wester perspective as well as the customer and consumer perspective yeah thank you very much mark just hit the most important word which is Providence's it's somewhat it has been since the very beginning and I fully agree that the reaction worldwide and certainly in a business context for from Cobin is going to be an expansion of Providence to be sure that the natural world we touch the health potential good or bad from everything all the way up and down the supply chain is documented and clear and so I think that the importance of knowing every node in that supply chain all the way it'll something is safely delivered consumer has never been more important I think we were already also as Mark said oh this a lot of this started way before this pandemic that if she reporting certainly as you note NCSE reporting has become increasingly important along with financial statements for most public corporations and all the way down to carbon footprint and carbon neutrality and so forth but I think that impact investing is sort of founded on the principle of good management who's paying attention to the the SDGs and the sustainable world are more resilient are producing more resilient companies and and I think we're seeing that demonstrated in many ways it's not just maybe it's not just somebody you know writing a nice essay this is showing to be very very very real and most importantly as you guys showed at the NYU conference I was out recently that the markets are supporting it where some of the impact funds are 17 20 25 % outperforming the market so it is it is very important that if I take this more specifically tirelessly this morning I'm on the board of a the industry's sustainability leaders which is called responsible jewelry Council and it's it's about everything sustainable about the SGA's well we had a conference this morning with banks and investors and some of the major investors talking about exactly what the criteria and guidelines might be on the other side and to have them more assured that that the members of responsible council knows to get third party certified are ticking all the boxes not just a couple of them so I agree market it's it's becoming not just I'll look into that someday it's becoming a major pressure point right now to where are you where are you going and what are you doing about it and in the end now I'll come back and talk about this next time next time I share significant nation but it's trust and verify and lock saying is that verification I certainly don't know of anything better whether third-party audited or whether it's trusted to smart contracts that verification is absolutely the use of boxing thank you Mark Khalid I wonder if you could give us a sense from your perspective working with clients what where's the demand coming from what are they saying why do they what what are the what are the trends that they're responding to or around blockchain on sustainability and resilience yeah totally I think mark and mark and Mark both hit it on the head there Providence is definitely the key word and it's where we see a lot of our clients start I kind of put asset tracking down here because it's a really good tangible starting point for a lot of our clients and you can build that true trail of audit and I think in terms of kovat and the supply chain specifically I really like that you chose the word resilience you know the ability to bounce back as far as I can tell not much has changed about demand management since I took office management at Stern but the thing you need to really effectively manage demand and respond to a shock like we saw from Co vid is quality data from a single source of truth which is a term that you'll hear a lot of the time and so having that good quality data is really the benefit that's kind of unfolded out of coded being around and then on the sustainability front I can talk about it more later but we've definitely seen from our clients and increased interest in putting sustainability measurement and data recording in their blockchain project or program or network earlier in the process than they used to with BHP Billiton in 2017 we started working with them by tracking precious mining samples sort of a provenance project alone but nowadays we have similar oil and gas companies coming to us not just looking to do that one thing but also document carbon impact and things like that as well and so I totally agree with mark and mark their single source of truth to get the true provenance mastercards perspective and you're seeing the movement of information and supply chains and sustainability was Lindsay across huge ecosystems I wonder if you could give us your perspective on these global trends sure so the it's so it's what all of this means I'm here near its resonate to me all of these words are recall crowds and ants right how many billions and all of this so everything we we understand domestic are that you start with the visibility of the supply chain right and what we do are we trying to do in our daily base here with lighting besides I'd have to explain my stake is not on a credit card company anymore they go to give our partners the ability to scale right it is scalability you said very well at the beginning we you know we are not a block cane company only it is a MasterCard and we don't believe them block chains are gonna save the entire world with all of this there there is a combination of other things that you should put it together partnership is a you know it's something for us it's extremely important and what we do you know and every day we use a belong for the birthday and vast and then and we have incredible solutions that we can see here in the panel that we can we can help them to scale you know we come from a culture of over sixty years taking care of governance of networks helping companies to to scale and in scale the ecosystem in general through networks right you know connecting companies so it's where we don't want it to you know to lose our DNA on that and we think it extremely important to the adoption of blockchain to bring this expertise to you know to the ecosystem in general so we that's what exactly we are doing so we're we are getting this you know taking care of our partners understand with them what they need to scale put real real case you know use cases in you know in real life understand this in a way that you know our clients can start seeing results and blocking doesn't become anymore just a sales pitch or you know what I dream or something that's a future its year it you know we can prove it and it's in production you know and clients are getting benefits from that thank you so I want to ask the panel now to dig deep into some examples of how you're applying blockchain and how is it working you know what are the benefits what are the challenges and how actually how does it work because I think people also really want to understand this at that level so so mark Kaplan you had started talking a bit about the sustainable seafood work that you're doing and maybe you could walk us through that or as well as any other examples that bring this to life for us yeah no worries and what I'll do is I'll walk you through the workflow of how we actually implement this in practice because to Leandro's point blockchain isn't something that most people literally interact with directly it's through some other device and inner face that they interact with the technology and you can imagine seafood has has quite a variety of characters and faults in the supply chain so we typically start out by having a training session depending on what the environment is like you know you can imagine a multi-million dollar Alaskan fishery has a lot different looking field and the shrimp farms in India do and so the form factor of how we onboard our supply chain is very different but the contents the same it so we treat we teach how to use their mobile devices to enter data and we provide a digital identity card for our producers to scan in their ID their identity this identity card is typically tied to some kind of a license so in Alaska it's tied to their boat license which is tied to their fishing quota which is tied to a sustainability metric which is tied to our requirements so when we gather data directly from the Fisher's that's then shared to the next receiver in the supply chain and the message is sent very similar to attaching something to an iMessage the way it looks in our and our whole chain traceability system and then once it's received by the next the next received by the next receiver they authenticate that the information is correct before we write that record to blockchain and the reason why we do that is to validate that the information is shared is correct and have that next level of accountability now what it also does is it creates a fingerprint between that transaction right so then when the products then go from that call it the co-operative or the fishery from the fishermen to the processor we're then able to match up the data that was shared from the processor upstream to where the product is typically transformed from a whole fish into portions as example and if the weight as an example doesn't match of what's entered to be sent with what's received that then gives us visibility that there's a gap in the supply chain and we actually want to record the incorrect records as well as the correct records because that then gives us information on interventions that we may or may not need to undergo and so in order to make this a little bit more usable what we've also done is because sustainability is also verified based on certain certifications so we've templatized the key data elements required for seafood and port monitoring program MSC best aquaculture practice fair trade the global dialogue and seafood traceability and so by conforming the data standards that we aggregate to the industry standards what that does is it facilitates further interoperability and harmonizing data with our partners so we're able to get true sustainability and measurements out of our supply chain and product measurements so the next thing that we had to do and how this thing really works is we had to bridge that informal aspect of the supply chain to the formal aspects of the supply chain so that then the next step that we do when it goes from the typically supply side into the demand side of the supply chain we have to conform the data to gs1 standards through their EPC is protocols and so that then enables us to transfer it into the grow sure ecosystem from the supply ecosystem so there is a bridging function that happens and what we're going to get to in the next stage particularly exciting with the fair trade data standard that we've collected from most recently small scale Mexican shrimp farmers and off the in the Baja coast is moving to payment so where we're able to match identity with payment and product and that will give us ultimate insights into labor rights in the supply chain which is as elusive as ESG measurement says has been fascinating and as a seafood lover really important putting in your body right exactly yeah and also that I'm not you know stripping the oceans right so that's that's or financing slave owners yes exactly great so thank you so let me turn out to mark Hanna who I believe has a slide as well as to talk through some really interests and really interesting pilot project that he's working on thank you that was a great explanation mark quite exhaustive and quite thorough you save me a lot of discussion let's make sort of simplify so I'm going to give you an idea of real world twist pain program from a supplier we are one of our divisions is a major supplier to pretty much every national account in this country that we are now in a demand situation with some of those major retailers from really from Tiffany to Costco where origin matters but so does the entire flow throughout the entire supply chain in terms of responsible practices so I said we had really started in 2006 but we're where we went to in 2017 is we've created really for the the breadth of our industry from diamonds to precious metals we've created a system whereby from the time it's original origin which for us mostly means of mine and you guys probably unless you you really are on my side you've been seeing lots of articles about the difficulty with mining and they everything from human rights to conflict situations so having a our origin our mind very specific and very specifically monitored and third-party audited is incredibly important if we're going to start at the very point of origin and say everything from that point through is good so everything we do goes back to that that the mind that the gold cansada but the comes out of so in the very simple map that you're looking at there so this this was one one of our first pilots you know our system that we basis on our protocol was ibm's hyper ledger but we took gold from a mine in South Dakota we had it refined which means made into fine gold pure gold in Salt Lake City we sent it to our Attleboro facility to be made into fabricating barrel we sent those to our to our Mumbai facility in India waiting to create the rings we got the diamonds out of the mine in Canada we sent them to Antwerp for cutting and polishing we sent them to the same facility in Bombay we put this together created diamond engagement rings sent to our distribution facility and then we sent it on to a retailer in the Kansas City so made its way from the Midwest all the way back to the Midwest in quite a detailed and and quite a well-done example of how we can keep track of this all the way along the way how from the beginning to the end every player in that in that chain knew where it was and what was happening to it so our trust chain program does a couple things very very specifically that every member of the supply chain on that product from the time that comes out of the mind the retailer this eventually going to go to knows that came out of that mine when the retailer gets that the mine knows that the retailer got it and we are very very careful to make sure that we have a system of trust and that system a trust then was backed up with the idea that we had 30 party verification and audit of this all the way along the path and we did that with you well their auditors verified you know as mark before to a second ago that the ends in the house I sent it and you got it you referring that you got it and moved it on so we're very we're very pleased that we were able to create a very close network that we trust very much and on if you can see down the bottom corner there it's kind of hard to read but no we we established early on that there are there are five Keys that we want to pay attention to and track and trace is a couple of them but the most important one is trust so at the end that we've been able to document something very clear every point along the way has been verified and and to be sure again that at least initially and still at this point about a year and a half or two years into this that you you you can't even you're not even qualified to be in this supply chain unless you have third party certification from the response of jewelry Council on every one of your product your best practices so we've tried to put together a very clear very documented very transparent flow of product and lots of problem so that in the end the consumer has the ability to you know take take the retailer's word for it or or actually be able to to know exactly everything about it when in our original program we actually had this set up with Abu the consume interface is actually a Google map that you can drill down to scan your product code in and drill down and see every single person that touched yours all the way along the way and what they're responsible credentials are eventually from the I came out of the marketing school they were flawed but that eventually this is great storytelling this is this is the kind of storytelling that is truthful is exciting is thorough and is going to be repeated and that storytelling is very much the foundation of marketing at this particular point in time so that's that's a quick example of what we've done with this and now it's being expanded in a number of ways we're working with a couple of other very big companies and a couple of other protocols actually the beers tracer protocol is is excellent protocol different than ours but we're working together and another birthing company by name of ever Leger who is working in the color Stone part of it so between us in the precious metals and we're also in the Diamonds right now between us and precious metals and these other industry players we feel we're getting very close to having a very strong industry-wide system that's very true very believe and very transparent documented thank you so much Caleb let me ask you to talk to us a bit about the energy efficiency works or such shifting from products to energy and share with us what you've been learning in that work yeah sure thanks those are really great examples of you know the types of assets that can be tracked and traced along a blockchain network but you know you can also attract other things that aren't so physical and so one project for example that we launched this year that's very near and dear to my heart personally is around tracking energy usage usage as drawn from these very sustainable code generator units that generate much create much less co2 than their non code generator counterparts I am gonna just drop it a link to it in the chat but just kind of piggybacking off of what Mark said one really really good piece of advice I heard my coworker give the client once was to dream really big but start small and I think it's important and what we do in this project for example is start with one product type one set of small trusted partners and try to address one standard or one regulation at a time and expand from there otherwise as Mark Kaplan mentioned before that you do run into interoperability issues head-on and it can be incredibly discouraging because you haven't yet seen the beautiful Google map of all the information you're looking to him and so in this asset tracking project we've started with these code generator units they basically automatically report their readings to a blockchain ledger and then from there there's a proprietary calculation that's done to estimate the co2 reduction that's occurred as a result of using these code generators but to us and to green namely the company that's working with us this is just the first step we plan to sort of expand this to not just code generator units but other sustainable appliances refactorings you know you think LED light bulbs for example these are the types of things that can be added on to a network after the fact or live while it's in production but definitely you should start with just a small set of something and you know figure out the kinks from there when Mark Kaplan was talking about the fingerprint technique the fingerprinting technique before I think that's very interesting important because you are going to have you know unexpected issues you run into the new technology and you don't want to be out there too quickly such that those issues discourage people from wanting to use it more and let's see what else about the energy tracking project energy that's about it I can talk about a little bit more the benefits if you want but I just sent out the link in the chat so you can browse there as well thank you so much related to the circular economy and as you know the the circular economy is really about how do you design waste out of the system how do you create a more regenerative system I'm also I just apologize but I've just got an emergency family call so I'm gonna step off after this and turn it over to Sophie Rifkin who will take us through the rest of the panel my apologies to the panelists and my thanks to the panelists for participating and with that let me turn it over to Andrew and then after that to Sophie thank you no problem thank you so it's very interesting to hear all the stories and an MBO news case right with blockchain and the detail that we go and the and all the companies here are checking the you know this this video increased trust you know among the parties and from there when you check out the use case and one of this is the circular economy is interesting because you ever think about this ability on the source inside of supply chain and sometimes we we forget that it's more than that and I think elements you said that you know sometimes it is not only the profit per se but also what with the container or what you using to do the transportation of the product and in how can we this can be recite recycable or we can you know tackle sustaining the other children from this perspective it's interesting to see with you know projects we discussing here with cosmetic company saying I know I have Jesus recyclable plastic Anna mine from my product but I I don't have the visibility of them appear to two or three where what they are using and it's what I call I have a visible have viability but no visibility which is dangerous nowadays right because your consumers are telling you no new brand i buy from you you know i I wanted to understand what you're doing and so it's not cannot be a legal liability but it's a liability as a brand and don't have visibility it's really it's you know it's really complicated so these companies are going and say okay so I'm gonna try this paint where my plastic comes from I see they're doing exactly what I'm telling them they're they have to do part of the corporate policies you know in the past David you say if you want to supply something community you have to follow these rules and there was a checklist for this brand saying I'm fine with that if the company is saying they are doing the right thing by me good now this is this has changed right so we have you have to prove have to validate you know everybody seen here how we do it the classic is the same story so they're going back and saying I wanted to understand if you're telling me that your plastic comes from the you know waist that you have you know before so let's track it let's strike from tf4 you know downstream and in golden and you go in together to to my facilities so we're trying to do that in creating sort of digital credits for the supplier saying so we you know we cannot point then and sort of at organization of it that you know they can just as part of the evaluation of the companies we also as part of this adoption what we need to create it's not only for this use case but all for all you should understand all of this participant of the solutions what the benefits they would get right it's it's not only about the brands and something that sometimes concern me when I see companies addressing food flexibility or or any type of stress ability from only the big print perspective you know instead of just doing this for the whole participants so what were you doing with the circle economy is showing to that to others that they can get a good vantage of it so that supplies with the right thing from the sourcing side today they fight that big company they can be eligible to supply to other companies of the same characters so you start to bring a premium to your product right that yeah you know give the opportunity to expand your business so that you when you bring it just to the tail that you know suppliers and if it's more company seed value know why I doing this I'm not nobody's doing this because um dating because a big companies telling you to do but this because is the first the right into the second it's going to expand your business you can open all the doors with other companies that wants to be part of you know they want to do the right thing and and be ethical when the sourcing they're using so this incentive model is extremely important in particular economy when people ask me so why what is the key for that was the key point for this is really you have to identify the motivations from which one of the participants you have right when I started talking to my head and the other day is saying open you know any to make sure the material that we are using I also are recyclable as well so this is it's not only his concern is not only with the seafood you know what it comes from is also what he's doing you know to make the mystical to arrive on the Shelf to the consumers so so this starts to involve more people into this network and then you start to see benefits from all of them and I and from my experience here we will be seeing everybody gets on board when they see benefit by direct or indirectly but when I see benefit for for the circular economy if I can if I take a good takeaway here is just think about don't just don't think about only the use case but the benefit that you can bring so this is more companies there in this business as well great thank you so much Leandra and so just as a brief reminder to those with us if you have a question to us please use the Q&A feature below I have one more question that I'll ask of the panelists and then we'll move to the last 15 minutes two questions from you all so my final question and we'll start with Mark Kaplan is what's the future for blockchain and sustainability what obstacles still remain and how wait might we you know overcome those and mark I know and you have some interesting work underway around the agro biodiversity and also connecting that to some of the sustainable development goals as well yeah so I think the future of sustainability is actually going to transform itself to being more of a regenerative concept I think this idea of sustainability has become overused like the word platform or app it's just it doesn't have the same kind of meaning anymore I think that people have it have misinterpreted and I think that the current protests are starting to drive the broader awareness of a broader definition of the concept so I think that that's going to result in practices also being move forward as well and certifications moving from being a voluntary manual process and I'll get to the technology bit in a second but there's a bit of a lead up to it and certifications are going to become more rigorous as a result of this because they're also under fire for you know voluntary sustainability submissions so if we're relying on logos to to call something sustainable there has to be the rigor behind it so I think sustainability is going to transform in that sense of being something very regenerative both from a social standpoint and an environmental standpoint but then also from an economic standpoint sustainable products have been often out of touch to consumers and I think the accessibility in terms of Christ and education of consumers is going to increase and I think technology is going to be one of the keys to doing that as the broader proliferation of two things one the understanding of blockchain and other similar types of technologies and then as connectivity and the digital divide becomes increasingly narrow and more and more farmers and small-scale produce become more digitally connected I think that this that's going to be the tipping point for the mass market adoption of broadly speaking sustainable products driving the demand for traceability as a result of people's heightened awareness of the need to connect their values to the products that they're buying so that's just in us in summary how I think that's that's gonna happen and I wanted to also build on the idea of incentives as a result of this because the one the question was asked and two I think it's an important question to take forward that leandro brought brought up one of the things that we did with traceability was made the commitment to transparency traceability without transparency is a very good big data exercise for analysts and big corporations with traceability with transparency you're able to tell stories to consumers and actually let them know who's producing their food or mining their diamonds or what have you and that gives a sense of personal connection to source but it also gives market access to the producer and what we've seen by committing to price transparency which has been the most disruptive element of our business it hasn't been blockchain or traceability it's been price transparency with traceability we were able to define the pockets of value that were otherwise being consumed by big food and the result has been that our grocer partners are paying less for a higher-quality more sustainable product that's fully traceable and our producers are making more with market access and and transparency to their brand rather than just being behind the logo of some big company so that made it a very good debt that the business premise was that big food is dishonest and greedy and approved itself and that's the result of the business case right thank you Mark now to you mark Hanna do you think we'll see a renewed focus on global sustainability efforts post Kovan and will this increase demand and for ensuring traceability and sustainable supply chains I'm gonna pick up on the consumer comment that Marcus made that we've done quite a bit of work I'll come back to a post Colby but that we did quite a bit of work looking at is this really important to the consumer and we started with we did we did a study across we had two different universities graduate school businesses do the same study and we started with asking the question about would you switch to demonstrated equity or more socially responsible products and we got almost the same response rate in both which is 44 and 41 now that the people that we had over 600 respondents in this and for the two universities 65% were alumni the ages for 25 to 34 so we were targeting this out of millennial we also ended up with somewhat of an Athlon millennial with an average also then from leverage Houston income about $100,000 so that's 44 and 41 when once we showed them the trust chain program and showed them the transparency it could provide that number went to 68 and 71 so we're seeing a delta of 25 or 27 percent in consumer demand or consumer response based upon our abilities to provide this information and then we went on and ninety three percent of the respondents trusted the initiative and seventy three percent of this group are willing to pay more for it so we have very positive consumer results showing that can we do this the way we say or what we're going to do it there a very big market for us to take advantage of and you know we we plan to do that this is this is somewhat of our justification for a longer term project to make sure this all works I think again coming back to where we were started in this discussion there's no question to me and to most of the people that I talk to around this issue that this post Colvin situation has absolutely advanced the concerns of being a responsible company about treating the earth right about doing all the things right so these numbers might be even better if we did this survey today but these are already incredibly good numbers so as opposed to you know some of the things you're here out there that if this is in fact a solution in search of a problem we got plenty of problems to solve so I'm pretty happy with it yeah and some of the findings that you share mark connect to research that the center has done on our sustainable market share work as well so yeah it's it's I I think that the data really really shows that consumers demand for these products and their actual willingness to purchase them is only going to continue Caleb to you was the future looking question what what types of trends and challenges remain in the technology you know itself for the technology itself that's a good question there too I think again both both marks I really appreciate your almost revolutionary maybe badass stance in terms of going against these sort of big centralized powers that be I see a general trend what this technology will unlock more or less is this sort of decentralized aspect of a blockchain network will help remove the concentration of these like data stewards the large orders of information as opposed to anything else that we found usually capture up to 30% of a transactions value you and the sort of democratization of information and not to get too big and meta here but the transformation of the paradigm of data ownership to many people as opposed to a few large entities is definitely the trend I see that will impact sustainability but for blockchain it also represents a challenge because instead of there being one authority on for example food quality or any sort of standard like that who now decides what that standard should be how are the standards updated these democratic processes might make things a little bit more difficult or slow to innovate and for example for something like energy trading energy management even physical borders and regional differences between one country one city one geography and another can create you know base issues that can't be resolved by some sort of technology especially one that you know permanently codifies things into a ledger and in order to update a governance model for that kind of network or anything like that you really do need to have the buy-in of the participants and so much to mark Hanna's point earlier about scale scaling up and keeping these sort of important visions of decentralization are two things that are possibly at odds and that's why to me it's very important that the interoperability of whatever network you're on stays at the forefront of what you're doing for example block apps Strato has a restful api and so even if you're using a tool of another kind if you want to access the data within the strata or network as long as you're properly authenticated you can access that and use it in the way that you want and so instead of everyone having to be on one Strato network for example you can be a member that uses your data the way you want and share it with people who aren't on the network if that's something you're interested in and so the major challenge there is basically the tension between that but I totally agree with the sort of move away from central aggregators and stewards of everyone's information or authority really great Thank You Caleb and last to you Leandro to take us into cue a would love your perspective on partnership you know how do we bring more people into this work what type of collaborations do you think are needed and moving forward oh that's a great question end day I set aside the beginning partnerships and everything for us we don't believe or one single company can go to the ocean right and by themselves one tip that the to anybody was starting in projects in black paintings it's a look at the they kept at you know the ability of the company work with to bring partners because the solutions the solution involves right when and that happens you need to have partners with you provide you different 20 different solutions for example MasterCard in partner with IOT cancers we probably digitize document companies beside the fact that we we use partners as a the prongs hand we ended the industry expert for you know for to provide the solution we don't we don't go in the front end directly we also have partners because so it's when you talk about what we can do with traceability plus 13x it's impossible thinking that we don't you know we can do by yourself without partners so with one thing that I've been done that for many years in nineteen this before blockchain but now with ball chain is bringing nutrients this ecosystem bring the partners understand how one how they can grow how we can help them to scale and and and that's why we're doing that it's where you have a real example here with us with visible and that's what we're doing with other industries as well so it it's bring the the right company in help them and and hold hands and go wrestle their size like it's much more on you know how can you create this you know how can how can help to solve this problem you know you're interested in your client capabilities a to broad use case if you think about it and completely example of you know different partners they could help with that only even with the English side we can help with all of this open the source inside no we are bringing in casual eyes experience to to communities to farmers but I've never seen anything but cash that still waiting for the dealer to come to pay them back with no guarantee so and and of course we don't do it ourselves if you go you know to emerging countries we count on partners to that so I would say to everybody here and you know just don't try to do by yourself you know foster these partnerships take the good ones nothing the ecosystem because that's the way you scare that's where you cannot deduction that's where you could be you know like Caleb said before you know you can start small but women big and nobody can get you know that big if you don't think about partners with you great thank you all so much right on time to move to our Q&A there's been some great questions coming in I know we're not going to be able to get to you know all of them but to the panelists if you'd like to chat your contact information out we can share that if you'd like people to be able to follow up with any direct questions but I'm going to start with some of the ones that have been chatted in this isn't directed to anyone in particular so after I asked it if someone would like to come jump in please do so the question is when Providence is reliant on human input how can we ensure that the data recorded on the blockchain accurately reflects on the products being transmitted along the supply chain so I can I can kick that off as we touched on it a little bit before in our in our simple solution and supply chains the way that we validate correct information is we only record the current record the records we only record the the records to blockchain once the receipt the next receiver in the supply chain has accepted that the information that's been submitted to them matches the physical product that they received and we do that both on a lot number basis but then also on the case number basis so we are measuring down to the individual case of of units and that same workflow is persistent across the informal parts of the supply chain so we capture both transformation events like when a whole fish is turned into six ounce portions as well as consolidation rather aggregation and disaggregation events like a whole container of shrimp being consolidated into 10 one-pound bags that goes into a case that's then shipped on to a grocery store and we do that both through cell phone technology so capturing through an app which is necessary for small-scale and low connectivity environments as well as through enterprise IT systems and tablets which are often the interface used in warehouses and soon we'll be doing so with Internet of Things sensors as well I can add to that a little - yeah grad taalib I'm sure I think if Tom C was still here she would kind of screen out a little bit at this point and raise what she said at the beginning which is garbage in garbage out you know in a former life I was a management consultant and we always learned it's not just about the tool you know blockchain is a tool of technology but also the people and processes that surround it and sometimes we see with our clients you're modernizing not just the tools but the processes and the ways by which you actually track things like that consolidation or deep consolidation and I think more capital in your point on IOT devices is important too because increasingly I think we're going to get data from non-human sources it doesn't necessarily mean that the data isn't garbage but it does come with greater frequency and more reliability than for example one fat finger can type in and so I'm personally hopeful that technology will help augment some of our errors and and catch them through IOT connections but again it's really important for those devices to be able to access the blockchain that work in the same way and so that's why I'll just plug one more time the restful api and that Strato has it's so important for example in our energy tracking projects in any sort of provenance project where machine ways or measures something it really needs that good access Sophie it's a great question I just want to add one thing that it's this is the exact reason why we decided it wasn't just about the product it was about the supplier and that we felt that any supplier that was going to have employee along the way they had to be independently certified in best practices across many things OECD ILO for Labor Association so we we start with trusting a supplier because they've already established they should be trusted so we then we rely a little bit less but we do at this point in time through all the pilots we have actually had ul verified that the product that went in is the product came out and that same product came out again and what I already and again and it's not scalable I know how many times will use the scalability work today but and hopefully will accomplish that too accomodation military sampling and desktop but it's a great question it's important question and lack of this discipline would undermine everything we're all doing great thank you I'm gonna take on another question going back to the conversation around circularity so the question is you know I can see how you can trace your supply chain from raw material sources through production how would you approach traceability on the other end of circularity recycling an item that may get shredded or decompose and then part of a new product how do you handle or think about traceability when the item is deconstructed anyone like to tackle that one sure well we're war right now we're right now scoping a project as Leandro mentioned we were talking about this just the other day actually for us we're taking that packaging challenge a step further so we're doing is we're we've gotten agreement and this is a little bit forward looking and I typically don't like to speak about forward-looking opportunities but in this case so be it we're going to be tracing the amount of material that is recycled in our recyclable packaging so we'll be will be tracing back the source of raw materials for the outer packaging that we sell the seafood in and what that does is it informs the recyclability of that package so that we know that consumers can know that that package while it's perceived that all plastic is recyclable not all is and it'll provide the same kind of information that'll help consumers make decisions about their purchase to apply that to how they will dispose of their packaging post use what we want to get to is where we're working in a solution like Dell computer with next wave or a TerraCycle where our packaging can then go into a reused system at which point we would use the serial is that we would have a serialization on the packaging so that could be traced back all the way to the source of the raw materials to its recycled state but we're not there yet but we you know clearly from the statement you can understand like how we can get there yeah it's exciting it's the point is companies many different industry segments are having incredible hard time to measure this recycles or all of these materials exactly so the question is very good because you know it's not kind of a physical unit right so when you put a solutions like that like a magazine and then you start to be more clear on what the data sharing that helps this companies as well to achieve their the targets right there you have company really interesting targets and this waste material and recyclable material so you can help them by creating digital measurements to what they are doing into the real production so organization talking till tall way of sharing things you know the part the participants are the actors it's one of them so we can start to measure for example different supplies of yours you see the ones that are you know achieving their goals so and then they can also rely on the fact that is going to Bach watching to that information share this it's you know interested me data and and then you know we even avoid sort of a reconciliation process that you know these companies have a nowadays so that saves some time in terms of backups efficiency and also you know just the cost of doing this one of the things that when you reduce cause of things like that use case like that you you think about the companies to to get on board into the interns with us too so that excuse us I don't do it because it's more expensive than my real production no you can just put it away so it's it's actually important to you know also think about the cost effectiveness of the process great question yeah great so I'm gonna try to maybe speak in two more in the remaining three minutes so one question is what's the potential for more consistent certifications that are independently verified versus self-reported and the panelists think that in a future these will be more industry specific certification so when the panelists want to give a quick thought on that one sure um I'll just chime in yeah I do like I do I think that there will be more certifications that are more I mean we kind of address this a little bit earlier in terms of trend but I do think that certifications are gonna have to become more rigorous the some of them are actually being challenged for their voluntary nature I promise I'm sustainable isn't really believable so that's that's happening now I think there there's merit to industry-specific in the sense of I think mark Hanna's industry particularly versus food but in terms of certifications not solutions I think certifications are relevant specific but I think that the approach to solving them is going to need to be crossed across industry otherwise you won't be able to get the kind of national sustainability measurements you're gonna need for some of the really really tough problems like ocean plastic is a cross industry solution that needs to be addressed and you can't do it on an industry by industry basis so that's a little bit convoluted but does answer the question that's definitely just an incredibly tricky thing you know where do you draw the line for a certification there's a one type of fish for example or is it something even more specific than that how does that relate to another certification you know what are the commonalities between it I've seen personally you know sort of an ebb and flow between specificity and then an overall taxonomy and then specificity again and I think probably the rate of that updating will just probably happen faster and faster as we get further down in terms of figuring out what we actually care to certify versus the stuff that's impossible today for example hey so in the one minute left and probably opening a can of worms with this question but blockchain has been touted as being hack-proof and fraud proof is it I can give a one-word answer popcorn one sentence one sentence answer as secure a system is only secure as the weakest link in the chain and so much to mark Anna's point earlier about having trusted people in his network for his project the level of the capability of something to be hacked is only as good as the weakest person there that might give up a password or you know any of the current security convenience trade-offs we made today and Sophie I just want to add one thing that I think that now we're all at the beginning of this and we're all learning and I think it was Bill Gates is that the Internet is maybe overhyped right now and very under hype for long time that's what I believe about boxing and we are the authorities on this how to do it how to use that we got a lot to learn yet from api's you know to the secure of smart contract handshakes but we're getting there and also somebody posted in the QA about raised you know rising tide raises all ships that's also true as this extends across industries people understand the importance of it great well I think oh sorry ileandra yeah no I just think it's in your technology nobody you know can lie we know what the future is gonna be but I can if you come talk about watching think about the the architecture of our decentralized logic technology by definition you know should it be more secure than the we do nowadays more centralized you know database that you see some candles you know also it's easy when you you know when you don't have a source into just one single place I'm a technical perspective so there are some good indications that it can be yeah it can be safer can can address security you know for the future so yeah we're getting there today yes great well I think that's a great note to you know end on and I want to thank our panelists for joining us today a virtual round of applause we had as a high point 200 people listening in I hope you all found this as informative and interesting and eye-opening as you know I did thank you all again for joining us I hope wherever you are that you and your families remain safe and healthy we look forward to seeing you at another virtual CSC program in the future and of course I know we all are really looking forward to being back in person at Washington Square very soon with that thank you all so much again you have a great rest of your night bye take care of it thank you bye thanks everyone bye-bye
