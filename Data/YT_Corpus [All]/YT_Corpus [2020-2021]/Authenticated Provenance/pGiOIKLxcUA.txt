 good evening and welcome to our driven to abstraction panel discussion associated with our virtual exhibition art and authenticity in the age of fake news coming to you from the american university museum at the katzen arts center in washington d.c this program is a part of our contested space series of exhibitions designed to address issues relevant to the presidential election which is thankfully over we also dedicated the museum over to this purpose in 2008 2012 and 2016. but due to the requirements of fighting the kobe 19 pandemic all of the present exhibitions and programs are forced to move online but we are still here to see all our contested space exhibitions and programs online i direct you to our museum at home series the link is in the chat we hope you will participate in today's discussion please add your questions and comments to the question box we will field as many questions as we can at the end of the talk we're so fortunate to have nika elder with us today elder is a curator as well as an assistant professor of american art at american university she organized art and authenticity in the age of fake news with her students in the spring of 2020 graduate seminar on american art and the illusion of truth and now she has put together this most excellent panel elder's research and teaching focus on the relationship between art and politics from the 18th century to the present with a special focus on race and ethnicity she's widely published and her research has been supported by the metropolitan museum of art the american antiquarian society and the terra foundation for american art please welcome nika elder thank you so much for that introduction jack and thank you all for joining us this evening um i think one of the very few benefits of not being able to convene in the actual museum space is you can have your preferred beverages with you so please do um partake and settle in for i think what promises to be a really interesting discussion um so i will introduce our speakers in just a couple of minutes before we get going i wanted to offer a little bit of context for this panel and explain how it relates uh to the exhibition so as jack mentioned art and authenticity and the age of fake news is a product of a graduate seminar that i taught in spring 2020 and it brings together around 20 25 works from the museum's collection all of which push the boundaries of truth in art um in a variety of different ways so sarah if you could advance to the next slide um there are a number of works in the show that we would classify as portraits but which deviate in different ways from exact varicimilitude or from the idea of physical likeness um sarah if you could advance again to the next slide thank you there are also a number of works that reimagine historical works of art be they paintings or photographs or tap into broader painting traditions and then next slide please and then there are a small group of works that toy with the idea of authorship as we traditionally understand it normally we think about one artist alone in their studio producing a work of art and these are two of the works in the show that challenge that conception of artistry so the karo landscape on the left for example very likely involved the artist students as well he very commonly had his students work on his paintings and a number of them have a questionable attribution meaning um there has been so much student work on them that it's unclear whether karo himself should be credited as the artist this is not one of those this is definitely credited to coro but we can talk about the significance of that um as the panel proceeds the dura work is a bit of a different situation um durer himself etched the plate that the print was made from but he did not actually produce this print himself um it was made posthumously after he died so here too a number of different hands were involved in the production of this work that said neither of these examples um speaks to any particular attempt to deceive these were all common practices at the times that karo endure um partook of them but what the panel looks at today is um actual art fraud instances or a particular instance where there was a real attempt to deceive um viewers and in fact more specifically collectors and this gets at the term authenticity that's in the title of the exhibition i had originally wondered whether or not to use that term in the title because when you use the word authenticity in an art context it immediately calls to mind the idea of fakes and forgeries and the exhibition tends to um take a much more uh generous view of the term and think about authenticity in a real conceptual way but this panel tonight is a way for us to return to the real um kind of intent of the term and think about authenticity in a technical way so our focus of course is the documentary driven to abstraction um released in 2020 and produced and directed by daria price as you know it addresses the famed nodeler case um specifically de sole versus noodler in 2004 the de soles bought uh mark rothko from nodler for 8.3 million dollars in 2011 they sued ann friedman nodler 831 holdings which is the parent company for the nobler gallery for fraud and racketeering and in 2016 that case settled so those are the very basic facts of the case but as you likely saw in watching the film um the case and the film itself raise many more questions so we're joined today by several panelists to help us think through those um and i am delighted to introduce them to you so first off we have christine hate farley farley is a professor of law at american university washington college of law where she teaches courses on intellectual property advertising law

free to drop your questions in the chat i have a couple of questions to get the ball rolling but this event was really organized with the idea of answering audience questions in mind so rest assured that no question is too large or too small um so let's jump right in um let's start with victoria so um at the heart of this lawsuit uh and case is the fact that 40ish paintings that anne friedman and nodler procured from glafier rosales lacked a conventional provenance um can you tell us a bit about what provenance is what it normally looks like um and how it is compiled and i think we would all enjoy hearing him your thoughts on you know how you think that ann friedman and nodor were able to get away with not having a traditional provenance for these works for so long okay well first of all thank you so much for inviting me to join this panel i'm very happy to be here um just a little bit of background on provenance research um you know provenance is in essence ownership history of a work of art or another object and typically it comprises not just past owners but um also you know any transfers that happened whether it was consigned to an auction house a dealer held it for a period of time so really what you're aiming for is ideally a complete unbroken chain of ownership from creator to the present owner that's fairly uncommon it can be pretty difficult to establish a chain of ownership all the way back to creation especially for um obviously the older a work of art is the harder it is to to complete that chain um but we we do our best and um you know at the heart of provenance is documentation supporting documentary evidence and um you know that can be anything that can be um you know museum records bills of sale auction catalogs um archival materials wills um you know the um exhibition catalog so there's a whole range of primary sources that we're looking for when we're trying to establish provenance and some sources that you might think would you know be legitimate sources for provenance aren't for example a catalog resume um you know anytime you're constructing a provenance you're going to want to double check everything that you're looking at that you know that isn't you know very clearly a primary source um a number of times i've looked at a provenance and a catalog resume gone through tried to verify everything to find out that something was just blatantly incorrect or maybe and i can think of a few examples of this where different works of art were just confused and their provenances were kind of conflated um there's one painting i researched where half the provenance was correct and the other half was another painting by the same artist so basically um you know what's key is supporting documentary evidence and normally when writing up a provenance you you include all sorts of notations to to you know quantify what you're saying um you know not only do you want to provide sourcing for for an owner or an agent that you're including but if there's something that we don't know you want to be upfront about it and you want to add in a question mark or a possibly or probably and then explain why and of course that's where you know no learn where they got themselves into trouble um you know as part of my research that i did as an expert witness i was supposed to research the provenances of these paintings um you know of approximately 40 paintings that were sold by rosales to nodeler obviously i didn't find anything you know there was no paper trail for these paintings how could there be um you know shortly after i did my research and submitted my my expert witness report was when rosalis admitted that that you know these were all fakes um so of course i didn't find anything um but what what nodeler did or friedman or rosalis or somebody did was suggest you know suggest a certain provenance for these paintings um because um you know this david herbert individual was sort of there at the in the right place at the right time and he wasn't around anymore and so you know obviously i can't speak to their thought process but it's like okay well you know we'll we'll put him in there now if i were doing a provenance and i was researching some paintings and i found that there was some indication that you know david herbert had maybe been involved in the sale of these paintings what you might do is kind of footnote your provenance and say you know david herbert was you know involved with these artists and he sold these types of paintings and while he you know could theoretically have been involved there's nothing to indicate that he was actually involved in the sale of these paintings but as we know nobler put that provenance forth as as fact basically um [Music] and um you know you can't you can't do that i mean there was no supporting evidence for that whatsoever um as far as how were they able to get away with not having a conventional provenance well they they they presented it as if it were a conventional provenance and um you know initially nobody looked further because it seemed possible um you know herbert was somebody who dealt with these artists at that time period um so it looks like a conventional legitimate provenance but but it really wasn't um and i think that what people kind of glossed over because they were so kind of i don't know if starstruck is the right word but with this cache of all these paintings by these masters is that they overlook the fact that wait a minute these are really prominent artists we're dealing with it all of a sudden we've about 40 paintings that nobody's ever heard of before i mean just logically that doesn't make any sense i mean you know one or two you know unknown paintings by you know great artists is one thing or a bunch of paintings by an artist nobody's ever heard of but it just didn't make any sense but people you know whether you know willingly sort of subconsciously chose to to look past that well a follow-up question i think something interesting that you bring up is this idea that it's uncommon to have a clean stable provenance um because the film suggests that this noodler case was almost like anomalous that it tapped into lots of red flags and pitfalls and problems within the art world but that it was this extreme case but what you're saying suggests that it's actually kind of normal for a provenance or common maybe more common than we would think or hope for a provenance to be somewhat problematic or to have gaps or holes and might that also be one of the reasons why um people would have been a little bit or inclined to be a little bit forgiving of some of the ambiguities around us yeah i mean i in my experience at least there's usually something i mean usually you have something in the in the provenance but this was a case where they were brought to her with in essence nothing i mean if somebody brought a painting to me and said it was sold you know they got it from mr x i mean that's nothing what is that um so while it's you know common enough to have incomplete provenance as gaps i mean we all know the whole issue of world war ii era gaps i mean you see that you know quite frequently but to have nothing for paintings by rothko it would it would be very unusual all right thank you um christine um i have many questions for you about the legal aspects of this case but i'll start with just one um so um and it's about kind of the differences between a civil case and a criminal case because it sounds like this nobler situation um encompassed both so the dissolves brought um the charges the disallows brought against ann friedman nodler and 831 were fraud and racketeering and then it was the u.s government that charged glofier rosales with conspiracy to sell fake works of art conspiracy to commit money laundering um and other fraud and tax related crimes so can you maybe explain to us what the different stakes are of those types of cases sure let me just first say thanks so much for inviting me this is so fun i loved watching the film and really relish the opportunity to to speak with this group um about this really interesting case and and hear questions from the audience so i i think you know um people outside law know what the criminal standard is you know um beyond a reasonable doubt is is a really high threshold in criminal cases um when the buyers brought claims against these defendants um and there were a number of cases um brought against these defendants these cases were brought in uh civil court right in civil actions and there um there are a couple of standards of evidence which are much lower um one is a preponderance of evidence which is you know kind of more likely than not um or uh clear and convincing evidence which is that the facts show something which is highly probable but even still um each of the each of the claims that was brought against these parties and especially the claims that really went to ann friedman's um actions each of them had some element of knowledge or intent so as as part of the fraud claims for instance the plaintiffs had to prove um by clear and convincing evidence that anne friedman knew that she was selling a fake painting to these to these buyers that she had an intent to deceive them and intent to misrepresent them um and and short of actual knowledge um that under the law that can be proved by um showing that somebody was really acting recklessly right that there were there were obvious signs that they were ignoring right and i think that that standard really captures much better what you know what at least we saw from the movie and what i read in these cases uh in terms of what was going on right that um you know it doesn't seem like there was ever any evidence that was produced in any of these cases or discussed in the movie that showed that ann friedman definitely knew that these were fakes right she you know she met the artist in queens or you know rosales confessed to her right there was never any evidence like that but there were so many red flags um there were so many strange things um that you know that that probably should have been really clear warning signs to her and and maybe she acted recklessly with regard to those signs and then there were pieces of evidence that were really just disturbing right so um there was evidence that the diebenkorn family really raised some very serious questions about a few of the rosella's paintings um and apparently um the artist stephen corn had been kind of unusual in keeping very detailed records and there were no records of these paintings there was in 2003 there was an ifar report um that showed that the one of the pollocks had had kind of problematic evidence um the the pigments that were used weren't available then there were some other um kind of forensic evidence that was that was a big question mark so there were a number of things that kind of were staring ann friedman in the face and um maybe that would rise to the level of this knowledge standard now none of these cases um were tried on the merits and there was never an actual trial there were decisions along the way but the major decision on the merits that was reached in each one of these cases was the defendant's motion for summary judgment so what that means is the defendants asked the court to dismiss the case before the trial um saying that um they're not before the trial sorry but based on the evidence that was produced um that showed that um you know if you you know if you take the facts as they are the plaintiffs cannot meet their burden they cannot demonstrate some of these elements of knowledge and the court went through each of the each of the claims because there were many claims in the cases they went through each of them very carefully and found that you know under the standard for summary judgment um that really these were questions that needed to go to the jury so that the court shouldn't dismiss the case before the jury actually got to decide it that these were fact-based questions you know do you believe her that she didn't know anything about it or not and that was like a very good kind of question for the jury and based on the evidence that was produced you could imagine a jury might find that there was enough knowledge so by and large the claims were not dismissed against defendants and for you know most cases um don't fully play out in court and it's you know i know in the um in the uh documentary some of the people who were interviewed said was so disappointing that we didn't get to the conclusion in the case and we don't and we'll never know um but what generally happens is when you have a decision like that where the court says there's enough evidence here that a jury could find the defendants guilty that's when the defendant wants to wants to settle so it wasn't surprising after those decisions that there were settlements that is really fascinating i guess i i wonder like then if based on your experience like do you think that this case will occasion new kinds of laws concerning the regulation of the art market or how to how do you go from like a case like this and i think like an outsider's view of it is like is this going to be the pivot point where things change or is it the case that um the law worked as it should in this case and it's just that they broke it you know but but that things were stringent enough they got caught and that there was legal recourse yeah you know um i i don't see this this case i mean perhaps the case developed some of the questions in the law for future cases you know that you know i think i think the judge did a very careful job um going through the evidence i mean the decisions were very long and they were numerous um and it was the same judge in each case so i i kind of felt like the judge was devoting years of his life to to this story um so um you know on those questions of knowledge um perhaps the law developed a little bit in a way that would would help in future cases um but i think that um you know there was nothing in the case that was like you know no way can we accept this we we've got to go back to the legislature and you know have have the law reformed or create new standards or anything like that in fact you know part of what the what the judge was working through was one element of one of the claims was was it reasonable for the buyers to rely on this right so when you look at this providence what we just heard from victoria you know it was there was nothing right there's nothing here you're going to spend millions of dollars on a painting and i remember in one of the cases of the rothkos the providence simply said purchased from artists um from collection in switzerland that was it nothing more right and you know if a buyer is going to spend millions of dollars on that was it reasonable to rely on the statement from ann friedman that that wasn't in the providence um provenance and you know none of these people just happened to walk off the street into the gallery and you know were bamboozled by her these were all you know serious art buyers had had purchased art before um in particular the de soles um de soleil himself was a lawyer you know he was the ceo of gucci i think as the ceo of gucci he's probably given some thought to authenticity and fakes and things like that you know um he's since become the chairman of sotheby's so you know he was he was a very sophisticated buyer was it reasonable for him to just rely on this or not to and not to investigate the facts more himself the court concluded it was reasonable that you know if you know if a reputable gallery couldn't you know couldn't come up with more facts on the paintings then certainly a buyer wasn't going to be able to but i think the law does does properly put some onus on purchasers um that they can't just you know believe everything they say and then turn around and sue when when that seems really unreasonable to do great thank you so much um lena i'm very fascinated to hear your opinion on kind of the documentary as a whole um in watching it i kind of thought that the thesis boiled down to like one of the last statements that's made the new york times reporter um who's interviewed quite a bit in the film says the art world lacks transparency and that is clearly a point that the film is working towards throughout um and as a documentary filmmaker like who who do you think they foresaw as the audience for this film like who were they hoping would hear this message sure um to me i think you know uh the art world lacks transparency i think that um they're addressing that to all of those in the art world every person who is either a creator or any part of the art world i think that's who they're addressing it to um i think that this film is not made for a general audience you know because you really need to know enough about the case i think this is it assumes that you know the art world and you know the detail i mean we learned a lot about just in this panel from victoria about provenance and that wasn't really discussed in the beginning of the film so i think as a general viewer walking in um there's just too much detail and uh i think the film was really well researched and maybe too well researched at some points where you kind of forgot to see the bigger picture and we're just focusing on sort of the smaller details um and so so those are things that i think that uh that kind of came up to me when i was thinking about it as a filmmaker um from that perspective but the idea of the the art world lacks transparency i think we can fill in anything right we can put the government lacks the you know the music industry the education higher education i mean we could go on and on and say that but i don't think for the general population we think about the fraud fraudulence in art you know we because we're in this world we might think about it a lot more but maybe not uh not so much for the general population and so i think that could be an interesting makes it makes it for an interesting case for somebody who is on the outside um to look to look in what would be nice is from the from seeing from seeing this film is if the institutes that can make change you know like the museums like the sotheby's and the christie's uh will actually start to look and make some changes from that i read somewhere that sotheby's and christie's have a policy against repayment five years after a sale even if the sale is found to be fake um and i don't know if that's still continuing and maybe because desoto i didn't know that was is now a chairperson at sotheby's maybe that's going to shift and change uh some of the ways that they practice uh which would be interesting but even in the movie we we hear this line that you know most to me it was one of the more disturbing things was that the museums decommission the work once they find out that they're fake and then the painting gets sold or it gets sent to a smaller gallery or it's still in the market it doesn't rem it's not removed from the market it just continues to someone else who might be another poor sucker you know along along the way and so to me i'm hoping that that this film will maybe look at those practices um one of the things i wish and i know as a documentary filmmaker you don't always get the access that you want but to me the more interesting story would have actually been to follow um anne freeman or glaffira rosales i think they're them as characters i felt in a lot of ways the film was aptly titled with abstraction because we were really hearing about them in the abstract right um and by all of the experts and it sort of felt like a visual game of telephone you know you're just sort of feeling and hearing about these people but not really ever hearing their voices not even in news stories right not even in like interviews previous interviews or any of that and so for me i was uh missing that element but i also understand that you know um that why they wouldn't go on record like why wouldn't they go on camera to say all of these things but to me um i would have like again going to the question of authenticity i would have loved to hear their authentic voices coming through this this documentary um because it would have given me a whole another feeling you know about about the film and seeing that yeah thank you so much and i um read that there is going to be another documentary about this case coming out um and the trailer shows that that um filmmaker was able to talk to anne friedman i believe also to rosales's ex-boyfriend but i think rosales doesn't appear in that film and neither does pay shen chen either um although apparently other people have been able to contact him for interviews but um it definitely seems like they the two of them were in much more precarious positions um as far as this case is concerned so i could understand their reluctance to to participate um even if they were asked but who knows i think as you're saying if they in fact were um so we have some questions coming in in the chat here let me scroll back and see um so margot asks why did glafier rosales get such a modest punishment was that a surprise or expected is that in line with what a legal expert would expect so christine maybe you could tackle this one i'm playing the role of legal expert i suppose huh yeah so you know i i didn't i didn't look at the criminal case um and i don't you know i only know what the viewers know from the documentary about why the judge was so lenient with her um but i guess she and even other people interviewed in the um film seemed to be very sympathetic to her so i think the testimony that came out in the trial um was very convincing that she really was under threat you know that she wasn't um free to act you know the way she wanted to but she was really being controlled by somebody else um so you know i guess um that combined with the little bit of time that she'd done um explains the leniency and i think it's hard to compare that case to any other it seems you know quite specific um she was the face of the operation but she wasn't the whole operation um and um and the judge believed her story yeah i might not uh you know i i don't know i would question the idea of leniency because she was um she was ordered to pay 81 million dollars you know back and um she spent nine months house arrest which seems you know seems lenient in three years probation but you know ann freeman is start is working at another gallery you know created her own gallery so i just kind of questioned that balance a little bit about uh whether or not um you know who was who who became the sentence became much more lenient i think for for the establishment than it was for for for rosales great thank you both um another question here let's see um geneva based switzerland's fine art expert institute's chief john walter claims that estimates of 50 percent of art circulating on the market being forged or misattributed are likely on the conservative end of the spectrum what does that say about what we aesthetically value in painting and sculpture when we can be so easily fooled um i think there was a similar question to that one that came in in advance that phrases it a little bit differently so let me ask um that one too um so that person was asking um what does it say about the art world's fetishized notions of authenticity if an unknown artist was able to produce works that even top art professionals enjoyed so a big two big questions for sure nathan i think one thing is that the art world is it's largely dependent i mean it really thrives on opacity and and somebody had written in the comment that as long as the art ruler allows unknown buyers and sellers that fraud will continue and that i mean that's correct i mean there's so much money laundering that happens through art um and i i think that just as you know and friedman um i mean you know she she claims that she was duped um but you know if this can get past all these experts who supposedly gave you know the paintings their blessings and said they look good as they say i mean of course in hindsight that's they say that no that doesn't mean that we were saying they were authentic um but if these can get past the experts of course they're going to get past your average you know run-of-the-mill buyer and and so many art transactions are cloaked in mystery and art world players want to keep it that way that nobody's going to be able to get to the bottom of provenance's or or anything like that and i think the cycle i think it's just going to continue um nika i think you had asked before about was anything going to change because of this case i really i don't think so i mean you know people like when i worked as you know an independent provenance researcher and art consultant we're always telling people do your due diligence before you you you know buy a work of art i mean i i don't know if if more people are doing that now or not um and i don't think i i think it's going to be pretty hard for any more regulation to to you know need to be applied to the art world i think that our i think artwork players are very resistant to change and i think that you know so many collectors and buyers depend on this anonymity that and those are the people that are needed to kind of keep work circulating yeah and i also wonder too like something that i see um in both of these questions is this assumption maybe that these collectors are looking for works of art that they are going to enjoy or that they respond to in some visceral way and i think that's probably true in some cases some of the times but i think when you are on the hunt for like a rare rothko and a rothko all of a sudden appears and you want it maybe you like rothko but you're also looking at art not just as a source of enjoyment but i think also as an investment and i think that's one of the things that is that is willing to go to whatever lengths for a painting they love but that they are going to these lengths um almost you know in the hopes that that this gamble essentially is going to pay off and it and it is going to be a rothko um i think it's different for different collectors but that's something we might also want to keep in mind you know one of the things i wonder about and i don't have enough information um to really reach a conclusion is um about the buyers and the and the and the prices that they paid for these paintings because certainly um ann friedman was paying a rock bottom discount price right and that again was one of those warning signs you know it didn't seem like she paid over a million dollars for any one of those paintings and at least one of them she um sold for 363 percent more than she paid for it right that was that was like a bad fact for for the gallery like again a warning sign about knowledge but my guess is that the prices that she sold them at because of these concerns that she probably harbored were lower than the market value and so i wonder you know just as as you've said whether the buyers were really buying them the the question talks about aesthetic value so whether they were buying them for the aesthetic value or as you say the investment value that you know this is a good price i can display it here and there i can lend it you know i can i can i can add to the provenance and um then i can then i can sell it um and and that you know um and somebody else asks you know where are the other ones where the other of the 40 where are the others and and they're out there and and maybe that's what those those buyers are thinking yeah to me i think this also brings up the the um question of gatekeepers um and uh you know the history of art in general right um the the fact that the rothkos and the rauschenberg's and you know all of these the pollocks everybody like the patient was able to replicate multiple abstract artists right in ways that fooled so many and um to me i think about that talent and you know um what about the ability for him to have succeeded in the art world uh and what who was stopping that and who were the gatekeepers that were preventing that and so that brings up the the idea of class and race and you know all of those kinds of things to me not on top of all of this other stuff but to because clearly he would have had what i think is more talent because it's very hard to rub it to to duplicate and replicate um other artists and in art school that's one of the first things that we have to do right you know we have to like kind of modify our own work to try and uh replicate another artist and that's not an easy thing to do and so to me i think that's really uh um a deeper question that i would have loved the film to have gotten into a little more and i would say that this this scandal is not just just in paintings but um a few years back i worked at a photo gallery for uh many many years and we we were part of the um uh art association's international art association dealers fair um and there was a big controversy in 1999 with lewis hine the photographer louis hein he was a well-known early document early 20th century documentary photographer really kind of pioneered social documentary and um he's known for making the photographs that inspired upped in sinclair to write the jungle and you know really changed child labor laws and there are a couple of his images that were quite quite famous and um when he died he died penniless and he didn't really care about the way that the images looked you know he sort of printed them with um scratches and dust and everything because it was more about the idea and the content of the image rather than like you know the the value of the photograph and uh um walter rosenbloom and his wife naomi rosenbloom were really well known photographer walter was a photographer himself naomi rosenblum wrote the book uh on history of photography so these are you know sort of again the gatekeepers in the photo world they had his estate for they had his negatives in his prints for a short period of time before they donated it to the eastman house and during that time it it it's now sort of coming out that he printed a couple of the more famous lewishine images as his own and then um authenticated them as being vintage and vintage means printed at the same time that they were taken and the art market the photo market has made those prints more valuable than you know something that would be reprinted now um and so so we're see we don't these these scandals will keep coming you know i think we're just waiting for the next big one and we'll just see it in different in different ways thank you all um another which i think probably came up for many folks watching the film is how is it possible that ann friedman was able to open another gallery how do you explain that people trusted her even after the trial i would add to that too what does that say about the art world i'm gonna look to victoria i can't understand that that's possible i mean i i wish i had an answer i don't get it um i don't i don't know i don't understand um admittedly i don't know how her gallery is doing um if she's had success there but i'm sure that there is an element in the art world who has stood by her and looks at her as she does herself as a victim um people who could maybe see themselves being in her position as she continues to maintain her innocence and i'm sure there's a number of people that stood by her and um you know going back to the ideas of of class and i i think it may be easier for some people to to see her you know this um you know president of this well-established gallery as a victim and place the blame on rosalis and chen i think that that might be easier for a lot of people in the art world to to stomach and then you know we haven't talked about hammer um who who you know kind of i guess seems to have inherited the nodler gallery and had this holding company that siphoned off millions of dollars after the fbi started investigating the gallery um but you know he got off you know when when lena was talking about relative leniency relatively leniently um and part of the embarrassing facts that um swirled around him in the cases that i read was apparently he um uh stated that he wasn't even familiar with the artists involved in the scandal he didn't he didn't know who they were he didn't he didn't know the names i don't know how that's possible but um he was so clueless and checked out of the nodler gallery um that he actu some of the claims against him were actually dismissed um not everything but some of them were dismissed because he was just so out of the loop thank you on the opposite end of the spectrum here um someone's asking about patreon's paintings um it seems remarkable well do we know for certain that he painted all of these paintings it seems remarkable that he could copy all these different styles so successfully and what does the art um he himself makes or made look like um i have a couple of insights into that but does anyone want to speak to hey chen's work um i i did a little bit like as as is possible like the extent possible of a deep dive on him and that you can find a really interesting um interview with him that was conducted by abc news i think and he continues to be a practicing artist in china um you know he was very adamant um i personally believe in that he didn't realize that these works were going to be sold for this amount of money as he understood it he was not making forgeries he was making copies for people who couldn't afford the real thing that sounds in the context of the history of copying and particularly in china that sounds completely plausible that has been a common practice there um for centuries so um he you know was executing these works in all these different styles but i think you know that really was part of his skill um his own work reads as kind of a pastiche of not just abstract expressionism but like post-impressionism it's like a combination of a lot of different things but he apparently has had gallery shows in china um and has shown his work there so i think he ended up my sense of it from what i've read is that he ended up being more successful as an artist in terms of showing his own work in china than he was um in the united states so let me check our q a box here um so are there standards and or ethical requirements among art dealers on provenance for example why are collectors allowed to be anonymous are their business records available for inspection i think that may be a victoria question um yeah i mean collectors have been always allowed to remain anonymous and that i it's going to stay the same um you know there are a number of galleries um you know for for instance no there's old records i mean they're all at the getty um and you can look at them i forget what what date that that goes up through um a lot of galleries do donate their records to various museums and archives um in terms of you know going to a gallery and saying hey i want to look at you know your records for a recent purchase or a recent sale um i i don't know that they're going to let you know that they're going to want to make that public i mean if it if a dealer want even a seller or buyer wants to remain anonymous um at least in the short term a gallery is not going to let somebody come in and see you know who the actual um you know buyer or seller was i mean the gallery otherwise nobody would would trust these galleries to to maintain their own anonymity um so you know typically um you know unless a gallery has donated their records or maybe perhaps it's a very large gallery that may have its own archive that you know you can make appointments to view um you know they're not going to just let somebody come in and see the actual sales records that root disclose who that anonymous buyer or seller was well one last question picking up on that one um someone asks what are the pathways and pitfalls to a more regulated art market and i think you know what the film would say about that is it is this um you know primacy that's placed on um privacy and protectionism but what is driving this um like the allowance for this level of privacy and this level of secrecy that extends not just from the galleries themselves but to all affiliated institutions and parties because it is you know it's not just the galleries like these works that ultimately may end up in museums it is a broad you know network of entities that's involved i think victoria probably has more to say on this than i do but i i guess i'll just say that um i mean it's not surprising at all to me that there's so much privacy in this space when you think about whose privacy interests are being protected you know our discussions of privacy kind of take on new resonance every day and all of us have you know have you know have all these incursions on our privacy um but the privacy that's really being protected here is you know people's estates people's money right um people's investments and i think the other interest um that's served by all of this um lack of transparency is um reputations um you know i was just as victoria was talking about provenance and and all the mistakes that you know she's found in her career i mean it becomes very you know when when everything is you know out in the open for people to inspect i think you know we'll see all of these fakes that are that are circulating and all of these mistakes and provenance and you know it it hurts people's careers so i think the insiders don't see that they that they would benefit from more transparency yeah i mean i'll just add that there would be no there would be no real benefit to it um they want to maintain their privacy their investments as christine said um i mean i i don't i don't know that there's that much more more to it than that i mean it's just there's a lot of secrecy a lot of opacity and um you know um i don't know that anybody would gain at this point by suddenly you know disclosing all the names of buyers and um people want to protect themselves um and i i just don't think there's any motivation to make things more transparent for the actual people involved in these in these transactions and that's not a very satisfying answer but yeah i mean in even in the galleries right um we would when i worked in the galleries we wouldn't share our mailing lists for those same reasons you've established a reputation with your clients and you know they trust that you're you're not going around and sharing that information and that they would come to you if they wanted to buy something or if they had to sell something so i can't imagine that that would work well for for um the dealers at least yeah i'm thinking back to you to the other example you brought up um of the lewis hines photograph selena and how like you know the documentary like does this great job of showing how insane the facts of this specific case are but they really dovetail with a lot of other cases too and so like you could see the entire market collapsing in a sense if one little thread um is pulled here yeah and in that case in particular you know it was actually a gallery owner who um who had sold the image to somebody that started the whole case uh opening because they were they were trying to see you know if they thought that this was um a forgery but the person who forged it was the expert and so you know it goes back to the same thought of the gatekeepers it's like well you you know that cycle just keeps fulfilling yeah mm-hmm and i think this came up a bit with the the comments on um patient but like it's really the artists who get lost in this whole um michigan here you know that once the painting leaves their studio it enters this entirely different universe where their name basically becomes a brand um on that very cheery note i think we'll need to wrap up hopefully we have not burst all your illusions of art you're still able to find enjoyment in it while taking a critical view of the worlds in which it operates but i want to say a huge thank you to all of our panelists today this was really wonderful and i enjoyed hearing your thoughts on all of these wide-ranging topics um and i'm sure our audience did too so thank you all so much thank you all for coming um and welcome back jack thank you nika thank you panelists that was great i'm really sorry it's ending and i want you all to come back and maybe we'll invite some uh some art dealers and uh and other other people to contribute to the discussion but it was it was fascinating thank you so much i just want to remind you that you can go to our website uh and look at all the contested space exhibitions and programs we have online please visit museum at home and i look forward to seeing you in the future thank you all so much
