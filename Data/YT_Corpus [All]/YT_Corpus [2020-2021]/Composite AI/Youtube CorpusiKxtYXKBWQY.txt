 thank you so much for joining us here at ignite my name is arun ulag i'm the corporate vice president of the business intelligence platform on the engineering side i'm joined by my colleague priya sathi between priya and i we're going to talk to you about where we are with power bi and some of our areas of investment as well as some of the exciting announcements that we have today so let's get started um you know that we all know that everything has changed for pretty much every organization around the world in the year 2020. satya said it best when he said that we've seen over two years of digital transformation in just two months things have changed for individuals as they've had to work from home and will adapt to you know never seeing their colleagues on a daily basis things have changed for teams because they've had to learn how to share and collaborate with each other and things have changed for organizations as a whole because they've overnight become remote workforces so in this environment the way we share and consume data really has to change and change very very quickly so in the power bi team we're really focused on empowering every individual so that they can get the insights they need to be able to make the decisions in an uncertain environment they focus on empowering every team so teams can work together they can collaborate and share their data and their insights and they can make decisions in a environment in which they're not actually seeing each other every day and lastly we're focused on empowering organizations so that they can make scale insights across the whole organization make sure that you know everybody's on the same page and they're making decisions based on trusted and accurate data sources and that's kind of how we think about driving a data culture in today's environment so i'm going to talk about power bi and i'm going to talk to you about how power via helps drive a data culture where everyone can help make every decision informed with data at any scale now power vi is not alone power bi is part of the power platform family and the power platform family is a single no code application platform that allows you to get insights with power bi build applications very quickly with power apps automate business processes either through apis or ui flows with power automate and then you know build chat bots in record time with power virtual agent because all of these products are built together they're designed to work together that really makes it easy for you to build entire systems in hours and days as opposed to weeks and months weeks and months and that's really really important in today's environment the entire power platform shares a common set of data connectors there's over 300 connectors across the power platform that connects with pretty much any source um in the cloud or on premise uh it uses all of the power platform has a lot of ai capabilities so that you can extract insights from data and the power platform shares a common low code data platform which is the common data service so today i'm going to really focus uh on the on power bi but you i would encourage you to attend many of the sessions in ignite where we cover the other members of the power platform family now power bi um as the first member of the power platform family has been in market for about five years and this has really allowed us uh to mature a global cloud service you know so that customers can expect the kind of scale performance and reliability that they expect from microsoft so today power bi is available in 43 languages it's deployed in 45 data centers around the world including three national clouds us germany and china and it has a host of certifications so customers can feel confident betting on on power bi as they make um you know data-driven decisions uh which is why when gartner came out with a magic quadrant in february this year they had power bi as the clear leader on both axes ability to execute as well as completeness of vision and microsoft power bi has been on the gartness you know as a leader in the gardens magic quadrant for pretty much a decade so you can really see the maturity the platform and all of the capabilities we provide when you look at what forester has to say they pretty much agree so forester when they came out with their forester wave in august of 2019 they pretty much had microsoft power bi as the clear leader in both axes as well which is why many of the organizations around the world are our standardizing on power bi because of the leading bi capabilities we have um this one of the things that's made a huge difference for these companies is the level of investment that power bi has put especially in areas like trust and governance we know that as you move your work with your data this is some of the most sensitive information that your company has and we want to make sure that it's fully governed it's fully uh secure it's fully auditable and we've made a bunch of investments on the security side things like microsoft information protection things like bring your own key support for virtual networks etc that give you confidence in moving your data to the cloud and lastly um we know that today is a very very difficult economic environment for our customers the fact that power bi is anywhere from 25 to 75 cheaper than alternatives really provides an incredible economic advantage for our customers so that they can actually put their dollars to good use in a time in which dollars are scarce so we're excited to see the level of adoption that we've had um over 97 about 97 of the fortune 500 use power bi in some way shape or form and many of these customers power bi is used with by tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of employees and in others they've begun their power bi journey in several departments and you know that's it continues to grow so we're really seeing massive adoption of power bi pretty much in every geography and every industry i wanted to call out three customers uh t-mobile is getting a lot of benefits by moving from multiple bi tools and having power bi pretty much be pervasive across the whole organization and this allows them to move the power back where it belongs to the engineers and the end users humana is another great example they moved from 47 different uh you know systems to just power bi plus azure again helps them drive a data culture and also realize the benefits of of scale as well as the economics of being on a single platform and lastly electrolux uses a lot of power bi's capabilities and in order to drive a data culture they also use a lot of the ai capabilities in power bi to be able to get better insights on their data so i wanted to switch gears and talk about the areas we're investing in we're just investing in three primary areas the first is an amazing data exploration experiences that really empower every individual and we're really trying to make sure that power via as simple to use as powerpoint so we call that powerpoint for data but we really try to make sure that when every user comes into power bi it's instantly familiar that the billion users of office around the world are already at home when they use power bi for the first time the second area we're investing in over here is in ai infused insights using a lot of the artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities we have in microsoft and creating simple end user experiences that really focus on business users and business outcomes the second area we are investing in is to empower every team and we really focus on making sure that teams when they work together can share and collaborate around data so the first area of investment really here is to uh you know bring power bi into teams so we're excited to announce that ignite that power bi is shipping a new teams app it'll be there on the left-hand side of teams you can pin it by default if that's what you choose but it really makes sure that power bi your data and your insights are just a click away for all of your teams users the second area of investing in is in productivity we're really making sure that you don't just have to come to power bi to get your insights the insights you have in power bi are infused across all of your office experiences so for example if you're using excel right from within excel you can uh you know by discover your power bi data sets you can build pivot tables you can connect power bi to to any table or any data and it's all fully accessible right there it's this level of integration that makes it easy for customers to be able to you know get the insights in the office applications they're already in and lastly we're investing uh making it really easy to go from insight to action to automation so this is where we're integrating deeply across the power platform so we provide the set of capabilities that help you build entire systems uh in hours and days uh you know all with single no code experiences that are all completely extensible through azure the third area of investing in is really to make power bi scale and meet the needs of the most demanding enterprise organizations and here's where we're trying to make sure that power vi can scale to hundreds of thousands of users so this is everything from the deep integration in the azure stack to be able to support self-service data preparation at scale directly on azure data lake to enterprise great semantic models pixel perfect passionate reporting the list goes on and on however it's all anchored by trust they've made fundamental investments in microsoft information protection microsoft cloud app security as well as a lot of the security capabilities in azure so that customers feel very confident as they work with data in their cloud so in this session priya's going to focus entirely on how we make power bi scale to the needs of the most demanding organizations around the world if you're interested in getting learning more about the first two areas of investment i'd encourage you to attend the session that i did with kim manus where we covered the first two areas all right so with that let me transition over to priya priya take it away thank you arun hi all i'm super excited to be here and talk about the new and upcoming features in power bi that empower every organization in fact i will be talking about some of the power bi and azure capabilities that enable users to build reports and get insights at scale and all of this without compromising security compliance governance performance or meeting the most demanding needs of the enterprise so let's get right to it first let's start about talking about how do you ingest and prep data with rbi data flows and machine learning a report with predictions is very easy to build in parvia now contoso is an electronics manufacturing company and contoso has a report that provides them opportunity analytics it's very easy for them to go look at the opportunity the predictive status of whether it would be won or lost and the top factors that go into predicting that status whether that be product manager industry etc so traditionally a report like this might take a few months to build and a little bit of back and forth between a business analyst and the data scientists but let me show you how easy it is to build this with power bi data flows and power query and machine learning so first you need to connect to your data and bring that data in order to start building these reports rbi supports over 350 different connectors and these include first party microsoft connectors and third-party connectors we are constantly enhancing these connectors and adding new connectors as well in fact over the last few months we've added new connectors to tibco microstrategy and if you're in healthcare a fire connector we also have a databricks connector we made improvements to single sign-on with the snowflake connector and it's really easy no matter where your data is on-prem or in the cloud to connect to that data source and bring your data into data flows once your data is in data flows let's talk about how easy it is to apply to machine learning you go to your entity in this case the opportunity entity and you add a machine learning model you go ahead and pick the status you want to predict now power bi looking at that field automatically knows that the right ml model to apply is a binary prediction you go ahead and choose your labels text you want to display and that's it you can probably customize some of the fields that you want the model to study or you can just settle for the defaults that rbi picks over here you can then go ahead and name your model add a description change the training time or you can just select all of the defaults and then hit save at this point you have an option to refresh this model right away or schedule it for a refresh and as you can see i've done all of this in just about five clicks without writing a single line of code within power bi now if if you don't want to do that users can also leverage machine learning models that have been built in azure machine learning it's very easy to do that if the user has been given permission to that machine learning model it's automatically available to them within power bi as you see over here so the user can work with their data scientists get access to that machine learning model that's been built using azure machine learning studio and incorporate that in their power bi report in this example here you see an image classification model being leveraged now one of the other things that users love to do is reuse their data in power bi across their organization across azure services and across dynamics applications for this we support the common data model format and the common data model format is really an industry standard format for entities such as sales orders etc and these are fully supported within power bi you can very easily prep data with this cdm format now for those of you that are already familiar and using it support 4.9 is coming very soon once these reusable building blocks are created these are stored in azure data lake gen 2. now until recently our integration with azure data lake gen 2 was at the tenant level so everybody in the organization everybody in the tenant had to use the same azure data like storage account but now we have this available at the workspace level and we are now enabling departmental scenarios so an individual department can go attach their azure data lake storage um and use these cdm models so what i'm excited to talk about next is visual data prep so this is a capability that's coming soon it's called a diagram view and gives you exactly that a visual representation of the queries that go into data prep for example here you see a visual representation of two queries customers and orders that have gone into figuring out top customers by purchase order now where this is really really important is when you have very complex queries with a lot of subqueries a lot of relationships and entry dependencies you can very easily visualize these very easily visualize every single step along the way whether you're filtering the data selecting rows removing duplicates and as you're performing these steps you can also see the data rendering at the bottom now this is a feature that's going to be coming soon in power query online which means it'll be available to you in power bi data flows as well so let's move on to the data stack integration we've integrated power bi very deeply with azure synapse analytics which is our modern data warehouse now we announced this at public preview at our build conference earlier this year and with this integration you now have the capabilities to build power bi reports on large volumes of data in the synapse data warehouse and author these reports from right within the synapse studio and publish these reports and make them available to your users now what i'm super excited to talk about and show you sneak peek off is what's coming next which is the power bi performance accelerator for synapse now if you're a data engineer you probably know one of the biggest challenges is performance as a number of users and the volume of data scales in the data warehouse in order to give your users optimal performance you probably have to go through a cumbersome process of figuring out queries the usage patterns and then figure out the materialized views that have to be created in in the data warehouse now with this deep integration with power bi and synapse we are introducing this capability where power bi collects the query patterns we know the users user usage patterns and we determine the materialized views to be created this is sent over to synapse synapse creates the materialized views and then future queries fabia of carbia are directed to these materialized views giving you really superior performance now this is in private preview today and if you're interested in joining our journey in this private preview and being an early adopter contact your account team or participate by signing up at aka.ms slash ipa preview now here's a demo that i'm going to show you uh with the performance of the power bi performance accelerator for synapse now here is a report that i built on synapse there's a few billion rows of data that this report is built on this report is not using the performance accelerator what i'm going to do is i'm going to turn on my performance analyzer and i'll refresh this visuals and you'll see that this report takes quite a bit of time to render and refresh what i'm going to do now is switch over and i'm going to show you this is set of tables and synapse what i'm going to do is i'm going to switch over to sql server management studio and i'm going to turn on the performance accelerator now when this comes out into public preview you will have a user experience within the synapse studio itself to turn this on and turn this off what i'm going to now show you is i'm going to show you the views that are getting created in the system as you can see there's materialized views that are getting created in the system let's go back to the report and let's go back and refresh the visuals as you can see this go around the performance is a snap it's much faster as these queries are now getting redirected to those materialized views getting giving you much finance performance talking about enterprise semantic models we have uh exciting capabilities coming out here as well so for those of you that are new to power bi semantic models are business definitions of data example they contain the rules behind the data the business logic behind the data maybe metrics behind the data in carbia we call these power bi data set um and power bi data sets we've made them open and flexible so not only can power bi access and update them but other tools such as excel but even third party tools such as microstrategy and click and tableau can use power bi data sets and access and update them so if you are a bi pro in the audience you probably know that there is not one corporate definition of a semantic model there probably is one that it creates and every local subsidiary might have the need to have their own local data set however blending these together and creating a composite data set is something that wasn't possible before and we are bringing you that ability pretty soon in the next few months via a feature called composite models and i'll show you a quick preview of composite models so here's going back to conchoso and the sales data set you have the sales data set that is owned by the sales department now sales wants to compute and add margins for this they need access to another data set which is the finance data set that is owned by the finance department over here you see i just clicked on it and brought in that finance data set very easily now able to join these two data sets together by just bringing together the dates and the uh customer ids and create the relationship between these two completely different data sets all with just a few clicks and not writing any line of code or any complexity and that's it so i've been able to combine these two data sets and create a composite model and now i can go back to my report and i can create a simple quick measure for margins and i can now include margins right within my report with and with that i've just created a composite report out of these two different models this is coming soon to you later this year i'm going to talk about enterprise reporting so enterprise reporting we've had paginated reports in power bi for a couple of years now which same set of on-prem ssrs capabilities we've brought into the cloud you can author embed these distribute these and we support multiple formats with row level security and we also support subscription based bursting so somebody in the sales team can send out a paginated report to the entire sales team but sales members would only be able to see the data for the accounts that they own and not everybody else's data now what i'm excited about is what we're bringing to you soon in the next month or so is the ability to for you to move your rs and as workloads to the cloud much faster we're gonna have the ability for you to use your azure hybrid benefit to deploy vms either as or rs vms supporting 2016 to 2019 sql server versions directly from the azure marketplace this makes it easy for you to bring your on-prem workload to the cloud and then use your existing tools and familiarity with those tools to then move into a full sas service like power bi so the rs workload support uh the rsvms are coming to you in october and the asvms are coming to you in the marketplace in the november time frame next i want to talk about lineage and impact analysis so we've had the ability to do lineage in power bi understand the lineage of power bi artifacts for quite a while in power bi what i'm about to talk about is end-to-end label inheritance from azure synapse analytics into power bi so this is a capability that is coming soon later this year and let's walk through an example here so here i have a sql db and i'm going to apply sensitivity labels on a few fields within my sequel db marking a few of these fields as highly confidential i'm saving it and let's go into perbia as you can see these data sets and reports don't have any sensitivity labels at all however when i refresh my data set that sensitivity label from that sql db is actually carried forward through and you see that little lock sign that shows up on that data set and on those reports that's it that label has been inherited and to end and i'm super excited for that coming this year lastly i want to talk about management and governance you've built these reports and now you have the number of users scaling on the platform and you want to manage these and the reports and you want to give your users great performance you need the ability to understand where your performance bottlenecks are and so what we are doing is bringing the ability for you to monitor performance with your own azure log analytics bring your log analytics and attach it to power bi here's simple experience of what you're going to be able to do to set up your own azure blog analytics once it's set up what we will start doing is sending all the performance telemetry that we've had within power bi into your log analytics so as you know performance when a report is slow could be anywhere from the report the queries the data source could be in the network it could be anywhere now i'll show you an example of how easy it will be for you to monitor your reports and evaluate performance so i go into log analytics and i open my logs right here and i can run very simple queries and look at the telemetry here's an example of a query that gives me the telemetry of the performance of my 95th percentile reports and that's how simple it is what we're going to do when we ship this later this year we're gonna ship this with a few um sample reports that'll get you jump started uh and we will eventually have template apps as well now in addition to that what we're working on with the synapse team is end to end monitoring so you can get power bi and synapse report performance monitoring and this will also come to you later this year where you you will be able to correlate your power bi queries with your synapse queries so you will be able to pinpoint exactly where your performance bottlenecks are lastly i want to talk about next generation power bi premium so today we're super excited to announce that power bi premium gen 2 is coming soon to you this november as you're aware if you use power bi premium today probably use it and love the premium features such as paginated reports and ai you probably also love the unlimited uh user distribution user access we're bringing that same capability with the l with a per user licensing model so not only are we licensing by capacity which we do today but we're also going to bring the ability for you to purchase per user and enjoy those same premium features and capabilities that i talked about now generation 2 is built on a new architecture and will give you up to 16 x performance boosts in addition uh in gen 2 we will give you the ability to scale capacity when and as it's needed with a feature called auto scale auto scale will come to you in the early part of next year and auto scale when turned on you opt into it you turn on we will automatically sense when you're having user spikes so think about the scenarios where you have a monday morning spike you have a seasonal spike you have a quarterly spike and you don't have to worry about managing capacity we will incrementally add a core for you and when we sense that you no longer need that incremental capacity we will remove that core lastly gently also gives you utilization analysis at a workspace level and in detail so you can do consistent reliable cost management gen2 with premium per user is coming to you in november but we are in private preview today so if you're interested please contact your account team and join us as an early adopter or participate by signing up at aka dot ms harvey pbi premium v2 preview i want to wrap up with the call to action we have a lot of exciting sessions and i would encourage you to go watch them um the first one is really a gen 2 focused session which is advancing power bi premium to the enterprise market and beyond um if you're interested in etl and data flows then watch the enterprise grade etl session if you're really interested in some of the aspects of bring your own log analytics understanding usage and performance watch the insights again insights into usage and performance of a power bi report session and lastly if you're interested in our ai capabilities watch the enhance your bi solutions with ai session with that i want to thank you for watching this session please don't forget to evaluate the session and enter your feedback thank you very much and stay safe stay healthy
