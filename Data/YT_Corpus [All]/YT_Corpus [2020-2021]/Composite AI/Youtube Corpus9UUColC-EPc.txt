 It’s all photo compositing. It’s a manual process. It’s a combination of digital painting, photo compositing, borrowing features from not only the photos we have of Asha to create the age progression, but biological reference photos. It’s me looking at the images. It’s subjective on my part. But I can get that feedback from the other artists that work here at NCMEC. So, it’s not just me looking at the image; it’s the other artists looking, too, and giving their opinion. And it’s sort of a big collaborative effort to put out the best possible image of what this child might look like at 29 years-old. What we’re trying to do is provide hope-based images—tools to help families that have these long-term missing children in the hope that, as part of the collaborative effort here at NCMEC we can create an image that might have a child brought home.
