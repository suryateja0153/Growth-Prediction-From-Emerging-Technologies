 welcome back to our Blender to HitFilm master class in our last tutorial we had gone through the tools for adding depth and detail to our cargo container we do recommend you going through those tutorials but if you want to just jump into this one and follow along the HitFilm and Blender files are down in the description in this tutorial you can use either HitFilm Pro or HitFilm Express to follow along we want to make sure that everyone can experiment and enjoy this tool just know that if you want to actually export the scene from HitFilm Express you'll need to purchase the 3D: Model Render add-on from the store link in the description or it'll render with a watermark let's start off by exporting our model out of Blender first we're going to need to triangulate our faces this is because it's much much easier to calculate and render triangles rather than quads yay Pythagoras have your model selected and head into edit mode we'll select all the faces by tapping a right click and go to triangulate faces you can also do this from using the shortcut ctrl + T we're all set and cleaned up for export jump back into object mode and head on over to file and down to export a new window will open and we're presented with a few options the most common 3d file type for HitFilm is wavefront .obj and .FBX obj is much simpler format that keeps geometry and UV data FBX is more advanced format that can hold a lot more data such as models UV data joint skinning information animations we can dive into the settings of FBX another time so be sure to subscribe and not to miss out as this is static let's go with wavefront obj open the drop-down tab and we'll tick selection only and objects as obj objects under geometry we're only going to keep write normals include UVs and write materials now we can go ahead and hit export with our model set let's jump into HitFilm I have my footage open and ready in a composite shot but before we start we'll first need to import our model head on over to the import tab and hit the arrow beside it we're going to of course choose 3d model find your model wherever you exported it the import should come with textures attached but if not you can relink them from this icon we're going to first sort some of these faces popping by going into advance tab and setting the method to generate faceted we can hear update preview to see what we've now changed now let's tweak some of these material settings set lumination model to cook torrents for a metal starting point I dialed my roughness to about 20% and specular to 2 for some fun customizations later we're going to be using the new animated texture function but to do this we'll need to import the maps which you'll need to enable from this icon beside the model name you'll see in the media panel that a folder has been created with our original texture great hit ok let's first prep and map out our scene I want to keep the existing containers to act as a reference and help sell the composite so using the freehand mask tool I'll mass the area I want to keep I'll speed through the masking process but if your new to HitFilm and this is far too fast we have a bunch of tutorials on masking and other compositing tools to help explain this process once the area is masked I'll bring in the sky image and place it underneath my footage tweaking it into an appropriate position and there we go we can now map our scene generate a new layer and set it to 3D a new camera will automatically be created for the scene apply a grid effect from the generate drop-down of the effects window will now use the camera orbit tool to move the camera into a similar position of our live footage using our grid as a guide with a grid aligned grab our model and throw it into the scene placing it between the sky image and our footage to keep up masking let's start off by positioning above this existing one that we have here now in place let's light the scene go to new layer icon and create a light as we shot this on a cloudy day I'll be changing the type to an ambient light in order to mimic the natural lighting of this scene be sure to move the light beside your model for it to be affected let's also turn off the grids of visibility well that's embarrassing if you're like me and miss the mark a little bit you may need to make a few alterations I'll also adjust the intensity of the light to match the scene's exposure once happy with the lighting the one thing you probably notice is the containers color is off like completely off to fix this we're going to be customizing the textures let's grab the texture we imported with our model and turn is a composite shot by dragging over the new composite shot icon in here we'll make the adjustments then link it back to our model let's drag in our footage this way we can take a color sample from the existing containers I'll just make a quick mask around the area I want create a new plane and set the color to a mid tone of the container to help compare let's keep this sample as a top layer enter the controls panel of the plane layer and change the blend mode to overlay great that's given us a good baseline to work with create a grade layer and in here we'll make some adjustments starting off with color temperature to match the one used on the day of filming followed by a curves effect to raise the blacks boost the greens and add a touch more blue if we jump back into our main composite shot we can see that nothing has changed yet we need to link them select your model and go into the control panel open the models drop-down and head over to override materials here we can relink of material sources for our model using layers and composite shots drag in the material composite shot we've been working on and bring it into this timeline placing it in the bottom of our layers with this brought in changing the diffuse map source to use layer a new tab has been created to select our material composite shot now that we have the new texture applied I'll just my light intensely once again we can now make a structure of containers by duplicating this model ctrl + D then repositioning it using the access controls be sure to keep the layering in this timeline to match the depth of each object to avoid overlapping to customize a few of these containers we can repeat the steps for the material creating a new composite shot or duplicating the existing one linking it to your model then amending the material by altering the colors or perhaps add assets like rust or logos to elevate your scene into the living world down in the description of this video we have the project files available as well as a couple of logos and assets that you can use to customize your own containers for additional flair and compositing detail check out our compositing tutorial playlist you may now be thinking is that it from us but no we've got more for you now that we've covered the basics made a model and know how to composite we're gonna be learning how to do some simple physics simulations to use on your model so be sure to subscribe and hit the bell icon to avoid missing out and we will see you in the next tutorial
