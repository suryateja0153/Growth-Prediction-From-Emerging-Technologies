 [Music] hello mortals this screen is made up of many atoms and so are your eyes [Music] and so is your brain in fact we are just a bunch of atoms that are trying to understand themselves here's a funny way to think about the history of these particles in ancient greece some pre-socratic clumps of atoms asked themselves what will we see if we zoom really really deep onto ourselves because of their lack of technology they could only make philosophical guesses about it and so they came up with the idea that everything is made up of indivisible particles called atoms so that's the first instance that a bunch of atoms acknowledged their own existence during the middle ages atoms forgot about themselves because of the church and only in the 19th century the theory became mainstream by now you might think that everything around you is made up of atoms but you'll soon see why this is not correct thanks to manscape for sponsoring this video during the last two centuries the so thought indivisible atoms were discovered to be made up of protons and neutrons at the nucleus and electrons orbiting them and nope that's not how an atom looks like this is more like it the electrons don't orbit them in the usual way of thinking along circular orbits instead they exist inside these probability clouds because of weird quantum physics we can't really pinpoint their location in one place instead we can only approximate they are most likely to be in the darker regions and less likely to be outside of them but aside from them there are many more particles in physics that have been discovered luckily for us scientists have arranged them into a table called the standard model but if you take a look there are no atoms no protons and no neutrons the reason is that the standard model only contains elementary particles that is particles that are not made up of anything else or at least that's what we think at the moment atoms are composite particles as previously shown and so are protons and neutrons they are actually a combination of three particles called quarks which can be found in the standard model quarks come in six flavors up top bottom down which are not the same you can thank the very creative scientists as always and there are also the charm and strange quarks the up and down quarks make up almost all the atoms that you can see with their charge of positive two-thirds and negative one-third they make up all the protons and the neutrons and are held together by gluons the mediators of the strong nuclear force basically flex tape the rest of the quarks can only be observed in particle accelerators with the exception of the strange ones they could hypothetically clump up into bits of strange matter and destroy and convert anything they touch here's our video about it fun fact quarks never like to be alone if you try to pull two of them apart with a lot of force they will use that force to generate two more quarks next up are the leptons first the good old electron it orbits the atoms as you already know it also makes a zzzzzzz sound when you put a fork in the socket electrons aren't made of anything smaller however at temperatures close to absolute zero and extremely tightly confined they divide in three quasi-particle spinons orbitans and hollands as if they existed independently next the muon the big brother of the electron it is 200 times heavier and leaves quite a long and boring life you could replace orbiting electrons with muons to create say muonic hydrogen muons could also be of help in developing cold fusion that is thermonuclear reactions at room temperature next up are the tau particles if muons were the big brothers of electrons tauens are the ultra mega big brothers they leave for a lot less than the latter though therefore they aren't really observed in the real world we have three more particles left of the leptons and they're all neutrinos each corresponding to the particle above they are created from the decay of other particles because neutrinos are electrically neutral they don't interact with the electromagnetic waves and can pass through a lot of matter before hitting an atomic nucleus that's why they require some very huge underground detectors there are trillions of them passing through you right now and they might be coming from billions of light years away produced by very energetic processes they're also the smallest elementary particles known to date all right so we're done with the fermions now oh god what the heck is this oh right every fermion has an anti-particle counterpart the only difference is that they have opposite electric charge that way you can create an anti-hydrogen atom from a positron and an anti-proton make a lot of them and you've made an anti-matter bomb the most devastating explosive possible but making antiparticles is really expensive 62 trillion dollars per gram and that's not including shipping costs and what the hell scientists why isn't an anti-bottom quark the same as a top quark or this anti-charm is this a quark name or an insult towards me moving on bosons particles that carry a force and as we know there are four fundamental forces in the universe air water no gravity electromagnetism the weak and the strong nuclear force as previously mentioned the gluon acts as glue between quarks and as a carrier for the strong force photons are the carriers of the electromagnetic force and are the reason you can see this video right now apologies to my blind viewers the znw bosons are carriers of the weak nuclear force responsible for the decay of particles so what about gravity sadly we don't know we hypothesized that there should be a particle called the graviton which mediates the gravitational force but until now scientists haven't been able to integrate it into the standard model thank quantum physics for that but what's up with this yellow fellow you probably heard the name the higgs boson it was discovered a few years ago it is the reason particles have mass think of the higgs field as an ocean and everything passes it has to push through the water to move some may have to push harder that's why different particles have different masses fun fact olympic swimmers shave most of their body hair to glide faster in water and oh man do i have a great offer for you we have partnered with
