 (speaking in foreign language) - [Narrator] Neo4j is the number one database for connected data, built from the ground up to leverage not only data but also data relationships. Neo4j is a native graph database, which makes it critically different from other data stores. But what does native even mean? Neo4j is designed to run a simple yet powerful optimization. Each data record or node contains direct pointers to all the nodes that it's connected to. These direct pointers are called relationships. All the information needed to find the next node in a sequence is available in the node itself. The native storage layer is a connected graph. That's what native means. Because of this principle, Neo4j doesn't need to compute the relationships between your data at query time. The connections are already there, stored right in the database. Because of this, queries of densely connected data are orders of magnitude faster. Other databases don't save direct pointers between records. They need to compute connections by searching through a separate data structure called an index. This lookup process, which has to be done repeatedly to find each connection, is extremely expensive and gets exponentially slower as the data size and query complexity grows. This makes them inherently slower than Neo4j for relationship-intensive queries. Over the past decade, Neo4j has made graph databases a key technology powering modern applications for hundreds of Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and NGOs. Neo4j is used to detect fraud, enhance artificial intelligence, manage supply chains, gain a 360 degree view of data, and much more. Learn more at Neo4j.com. (presenters speaking in foreign language)
