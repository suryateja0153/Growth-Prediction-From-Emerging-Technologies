 i once called a scientist to ask them about downloading our brain like you know slicing it up and downloading it into a computer and he said to me let me put it this way i don't plan on dying in this body on this planet or in this century can you believe that i was obviously taken aback but this is not what's gonna happen at least anytime soon but i love his moxie i mean i'm not an expert but based on the people i've talked to other than him we got a long way to go before that immediately i think what we want to do is tap our brains potential we're going to be keeping the life inside of our head for now but we're going to be using that as kind of the cpu of whatever we want to do whether that's plugging an arm into the brain or using the brain to power something else think johnny mnemonic or the matrix which actually brings me back to something i wondered which is like why does keanu do all the weird brain movies but you know that's neither here nor there how far off was this scientist can we read and write to the brain well enough that we could use it like neo can we download the brain or at least use its processing power to do something else let's kick into it and find out hi hi hi jelly heads trace here this is episode four of five on upgrading our brains we've already covered connecting to the brain and reading and writing to the brain we've talked about how we get information out and how we read what's going on and mimic what's being put back in and today we're talking about downloading uploading and augmenting we're talking about living inside of the machine we're going to talk about roboticizing i mean within reason we're still trying to ground it in reality here i'm going to stay right at the top we cannot download a brain we cannot download your consciousness we cannot take you and put you in a computer like the matrix or antonzola or anything like that but we can still do amazing things even in 2020. for example we can convert the actual neuronal activity of your brain to sound this is from a rat spray there are 21 action potentials in this one second clip now a computer would read that information they don't need it to be sound they can do it without converting it to that called sonification but they can read that the computer has an algorithm that will smooth out all the noise and understand what the action potential is and what they want it to do based on where in the brain it's coming from and all sorts of other factors the university of connecticut yukon had a bunch of people's brains that they eeg'd and the participants listened to notes played on a piano while getting their eeg read and because they knew which sounds the participants were hearing they used that data to convert the eeg signals into sound holy crap right isn't that amazing that is actual sound from the brain converted into audio that we recognize as music and this is done via regression algorithms a regression algorithm can pull the note back out from the neuronal activity regression is used in statistics and mathematics to get relationships between variables so for example you have lots of data you want to know something that's happening you can use regression analyses this is great for stuff like weather let's say we want to know rainfall but there's so much weather data out there we can use regression to get just the rainfall percentages economics is another example stock market behavior gdp growth and so on and so on anything with lots of data and we want to filter out something specific regression analysis getting the musical note out of thousands of brain scans does the same things and they do this by playing the same note with many many eeg scans the same note again and again this meant middle c and that was a sharp or whatever and we know that after lots and lots of data more research is needed we know the stimulus and we can find it within the data and we can take that and use it to make regular music it's not super practical but it's amazing speaking of practicality prosthetics bcis are currently being used to try and give people who no longer have access to their limbs access to an alternative limb this is jan she is eating a chocolate bar which is amazing because jan is a quadriplegic she lost the use of all four of her limbs quadriplegic and this happened due to spinocerebellar degeneration it's a rare genetic disease in 1996 jan had a completely normal life she had children a family a job but by 2003 she could no longer move from the neck down it was a fast progression from tingling to complete loss of function it's heartbreaking but in 2011 she applied to a university of pittsburgh study to try and get control of a robotic arm they used an eeg to monitor her brain so they could determine where to put the electrode that they would have to implant directly on her brain tissue now that we know all about the eegs and what they're looking for and the difference between that and the other bcis you probably know why they want to do that they want faster speeds they use that eeg and fmri to find a good place for her implant the eeg is a bit slower but less invasive we know this and they used algorithms to filter out the noise from the rest of her brain which we also talked about already and it's getting better all the time but participants are asked during these eegs and fmris to imagine moving their hands and feet can you imagine moving your arm yeah that's all you're doing but your brain is mirroring what you're thinking about if you see someone else moving their arm your mirror neurons inside of your brain your brain is literally moving inside of itself in the same way that you're watching someone else do it when you imagine that you're moving your hand or even just watching me do it inside of your brain something is going just like this brain scans assume active areas are where they need to put their elections once they knew where to put the implants they had to cut open her skull and implant two utah electrode arrays directly onto her left motor cortex the left motor cortex normally controls her right hand once the skull was closed up they left a little hole for the wires to come out and then put caps on top that they could attach the computer to antibacterial gel was applied often because they didn't want a brain infection to get in through those holes the plugs were quarter sized and they're on the outside of her head to connect to the computer and she named the two plugs because this is just how jan is lewis and clark but the arrays they're not measuring one neuron at a time they're actually measuring the voltages of hundreds of neurons so they have to use those algorithms again to guess where she wants her arm to go based on lots and lots of data and that smooths out the signals and motions in real time too much regression then jan has no agency she's barely thinking and the arm does all sorts of stuff too little regression and jen will never learn it's too hard to see the progress it's like a video game or a flight simulator you need to start easy you need to sandbox them and slowly give the player more control we record those voltages and we kind of regress them against where we think the person might want to move and based on some mass that we happen to know exists in the brain we can you know linearly map this these voltages that we record from the electrodes to what we think the person's trying to do when they move over time with training the human brain can be taught to move mouse cursors type on keyboards push buttons move arms and guide wheelchairs we can send those velocity commands to basically anything you want you could set it to a blender if you wanted to just push the power button my current lab uses computer cursors but you could also use any number of assistive devices one big advance since jan's time is back and forth communication we can read and write to and from the arm maybe you remember this clip from earlier at the time that was still considered a little iffy pardon the pun reaching but with a bit of bioengineering and a bit of psychology this robot was able to sense touch that guy could feel obama fist bumping him isn't that crazy and it sends those signals back into the brain and says hey you're being touched right now here's how it mimics action potentials seen in other touches in other brains and it puts it back in the same place but it also helps that that person can see their hand because our brain relies on other senses too do you remember the touch series from a couple months back the phantom hand illusion where you block your hand and you put a rubber hand on the table and you can go back and watch that the regression works both ways a prosthetic arm that is robotic your brain takes it over it owns that hand it is my hand the regression though works both ways you have to regress output you can't make it too easy or too hard to move the arm but you also got to regress going back into the brain because you can't overwhelm the brain with input it wouldn't know what's going on you have to have agency over the hand but you also want to make sure you're getting clear feedback the funny thing is though doesn't have to be that clear your brain gets a weird fuzzy signal it's like i'm not really sure where that's coming from but i see my thumb touching so it kind of jumps the gun so those sorts of things kind of work to our advantage and that we don't know exactly and electricity is not a very good um specialized tool it's kind of like you felt something what i think would be amazing is downloading things from your brain like your dreams like knowing my dream when i wake up and being able to kind of watch it back or know what it was about that'd be amazing right i feel like i dream really amazing stuff and i'm like oh my goodness i can write a whole fantasy novel series about the things i dream about and then i forget that's definitely achievable i i i i think from the study i saw and it was a while ago they weren't able to recreate very clear images but they were able to get some kind of blurry image and i i just thought that was wild now i'm not exactly sure what liesl was talking about exactly we couldn't find the exact study and i'm no mind reader but i did find a kyoto university in japan study where they used fmri scans and it was the same as the brain music one where they knew the image and they knew the stimulus images and they used lots of fmri data and then they tried to get a computer program that would reconstruct the images from the stimulus they look like this so the researchers trained an algorithm with all these images then using brain scans just like the sound experiment were able to pull this data out of people's brains a bit messy a bit messy not the best the letters though super creepy right you kind of have to think of it like this imagine you're listening to your neighbor's radio through a brick wall and it's not particularly loud you're trying to guess what the song is and then sing it to your friend who's in the room you're not going to be able to hear the song very well and you have to record it and it's not really direct and it's not digital definitely not clear but it's a start and you have to then relate that song to someone else that's essentially what this computer program has to do and slowly it's going to get better at it if it has to do it all the time more research is needed do i have to say it i had to say it yeah we need more brains the first time we started using google for example to search the web google had no idea what we were going to search for it could guess but then it ran 10 million searches and then 100 billion searches and now it's like oh you're probably looking for sandwiches i'm just going to put that out there because i mean to be honest i'm looking for sandwiches like most of the time we definitely need more data like data is the answer to everything at this point so aside from improved technology we just need more data that's why i try to get more people excited about this field so we can bring more people in um and and with the more research researchers we have the more participants we can have in our studies and and i think that would contribute so much to the knowledge base and we'll see an acceleration of these advances eventually with enough data and enough research we're going to be able to put on a thing and it will tell us what our dreams were about this is totally achievable there's keywords and tags and guesses i'm not saying you'll be able to watch it in 4k or something but knowing what your brain was generally about might be achievable might be real not tomorrow maybe in like 100 years maybe 200 years we'll be able to see pictures and learn from our past thoughts but for now this is already pretty incredible and in all this future sci-fi you know i don't want to get lost in the reality so i'm going to relate to you a bit about jan's surgery she needed those utah arrays in order to control the arm which by the way she had named hector the four millimeter square metal arrays were injected right into her exposed brain tissue i haven't been able to move my arm for 10 years so just being able to physically move something else i can't wait this would be so cool jan was eventually able to use those electrodes to move two arms with that one left motor cortex and again she named the arms hector and then the second arm lecter she also participated in a darpa study where she used her implants to fly a single-engine cessna and f-35 strike fighter in flight simulators she'd never flown before she did so only with her thoughts right now the technology is the stuff of sci-fi jan who has no access to her own limbs had access to two arms and was able to fly a plane and able to feed herself chocolate which was her ball so well for a woman one giant fight for hcr are we going to download a brain though not anytime soon i love the moxie of that scientist from the beginning of this but even if we can learn to simulate a brain in a computer and then simulate someone's brain before we actually download their real consciousness we're talking about upgrades and with this kind of technology we're not there yet where we are is here my name is neil harvison and i'm a cyborg i'm not using technology not wearing technology i am technology he's a cyborg more on that next time thanks so much for tuning in to this episode of uno dos of trace about upgrading our brains this was episode 405. there's still one more left all about cyborgs it's coming on wednesday i really hope you come back and check it out make sure that you tell me down in the comments if you have ideas for future series or any of the thoughts that maybe came up inside of your little jelly brains while you were watching this video because i had a lot of them thanks again for watching i love you all i am trace and i will see you in the future
