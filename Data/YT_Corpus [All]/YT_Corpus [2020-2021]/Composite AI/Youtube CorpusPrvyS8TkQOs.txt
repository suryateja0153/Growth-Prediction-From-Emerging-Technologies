 [Music] everybody's stim with Tim boy photography this week's tutorial is three bird photography rules that are getting broken because of technology changes in cameras and in the software that's available for us so the first thing I want to talk about is the five stops of image stabilization that's available in the Olympus camera systems right now so there's the m1x that has this there's the m1 mark three that has this canons got a camera that's coming out with five stops image stabilization in the body this is a real game-changer for bird photography because with five stops of image stabilization we don't need tripods anymore there's no need to carry a tripod maybe if you have a 600 millimeter f4 lens you're still gonna use a tripod but for most of us out there we're using smaller lenses because we've gone with Micro Four Thirds or we're using smaller lenses like the 100 to 400 zooms that Nikon and Canon and a bunch of other people have so this is a real breakthrough for us this image of a black and white Warbler I never would have gotten this if I was using my old 600 millimeter lens on a tripod the bird was just moving around I'm foraging too much as it was being able to use a super light lens like the olympus zuikou 300 f/4 is pro lens and the m1 mark 3 camera from olympus i was able to handhold that have a fast shutter speed and follow this bird around really easily so that's a real evolution in bird photography is that having that five stops of image stabilization in the body and then with that particular lens the 300 f/4 lens it has two stops but together they combine to have seven-and-a-half stops of image stabilization now that is remarkable that is fundamentally ground changing for bird photography and if you're not a bird photographer you can still handhold these lenses and lens combinations like this you'll be able to get images that you normally wouldn't get because you'll be able to handhold the image at a slower shutter speed now with bird photography the bird might move you still might need a higher shutter speed to freeze the action but image stabilization in body working with the lens you're going to be much better off than if you had traditional DSLR equipment now the other thing that I like about the mirrorless cameras and you can do this with some the DSLRs but not all of them is that there's a fully articulating screen on a lot of these cameras and so you can get the camera really low to the ground you don't have to lay in the wet sand anymore and you can get low angle points of view really easily and that just makes this also much easier I mean I can flip out the screen rotate it lower the camera to the ground drop to one knee this just makes it a little bit easier for everybody and then here's a tripod being used in a way that I'm not sure I ever saw before but I think she would be better off not using the tripod the second evolutionary point that I want to make here is that the technology that's coming out right now with the software programs this one happens to be topaz denoise a I on the right-hand screen you can see that the background is clear and this bird's pretty sharp up in here you can see that this background is grainy and it's a little bit fuzzier in here this is a ISO 12800 image topaz is cleaning this up just by putting it on auto I haven't even gone into the manual mode to fix thing topaz denoise AI is a game changer for us the technology that's involved here if you shoot with a Micro Four Thirds camera or a crop sensor camera no matter what what brand it is you're going to be able to get really clean backgrounds so here one one-thousandth of a second ISO 12800 you can see some of the grain in here and after its processed this is all cleaned up it's so much of a game-changer it just blows my mind if you're not using topaz denoise ai try it get a trial version of it and go back and process some images I used to have the 50 D from Canon and the 20 D from Canon and I am going back and fixing images with the Topaz denoise ai because it's that good all those images that I kept because I liked them but I thought they were garbage because of the noise I can fix those so noise doesn't matter anymore sensor size doesn't matter anymore all because we have this brand-new technology that really helps us clean up our images the third evolutionary change that I want to talk about in this to me as a game changer as well as that with mirrorless cameras you can see the highlight alerts and your exposure before you take the picture we can change the exposure while we're looking through the camera and we're going to be able to get these really nice images like this I was overexposed I had the highlight alerts on I could tell where I was overexposed I increased my shutter speed so that I would have a correct exposure and I was able to get a really good exposure before I started taking pictures this to me is a game-changer now there's no reason that we should have blown out highlights anymore because we can see the exposure we can see the blown out highlights the overexposed highlights before we take the picture if you want to improve your bird photography and take better bird pictures hit the subscribe button it's in the lower right hand corner and then click on the bell icon so you don't miss any future videos I also want to reassure you that most of the rules of bird photography and I use rules in quotes here because they're not really rules they're guidelines I did this one 10 rules of bird photography a long time ago I'll put a link in it up above it's these things still pertain in the seven more rules of bird photography those things still hold true to learn even more about bird photography and get better at bird photography pick up a copy of my book learn the art of bird photography it's available on Amazon as a Kindle and a trade paperback thanks for watching this week I'll see you in the next video bye
