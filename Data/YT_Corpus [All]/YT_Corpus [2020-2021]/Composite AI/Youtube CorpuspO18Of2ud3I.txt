 hello hi good morning sorry of those map Thanks thanks for coming this morning first thing to establish is I am extremely old and hence of basically just been doing things for a long time there may not be anything expert about what I have done I've just done a lot of it so that's kind of basically I think what Ben and Alex asked me to come and talk about is just all the things so it's so is theirs is it the LM is maybe hopefully a string of coherence through it but its career is also a verb so it's you know there's a lot of a jumble of things in here Alex asked me to sort of talk about my my my journey windy as it is so as I say old in the 90s 1990s I was at Cardiff University for about five years and I studied to be an architect and in about well first of all I was extremely terrible any of you studied architecture or nobody anybody who studies architecture or back then you one of the things he had to do was make a lot of models physical models I was really terrible at it so as a result I taught myself to use CAD and so I was hanging out a lot in the CAD room the computer room in the architecture school and in about 1994 people very excited about the internet it was mainly sort of chat rooms and sort of news groups and things like that and then in 1994 a thing called the web got invented by Tim berners-lee and the first web browser and I started making things on it and so a lot of this is to do with just like curiosity and luck as with most things so just sort of being in that room and being exposed to that sort of thing led me to just making websites and because it was the beginning of the web I ended up sort like making I think like one of the first 50 websites about architecture you know it's just wouldn't any so as a result you know people even if it wasn't any good which it wasn't I'm very glad it's not right anymore but I hope that none of you've got like good detective skills that you can dig it up because it's bloody horrible anyway I did I did this website and it ended up like getting you know featured in articles in architecture magazines about you know there's a thing called you know so I got um I again just like luck and curiosity and circumstances in 1994-95 when I was graduating architecture school it was a massive recession so massive particularly in the construction industry no one was really hiring architects so all of us like education that I'd put in five years went to do seven but I sort of gave up and after after five years and decided to take a leap into technology and sort of particularly sort of designing and building websites which he had to do a little bit of everything back then to be able to but when put when live so it wasn't really the separation between engineering and and design that perhaps you so see in modern you know the modern practice of such so this is a bit of an edited timeline in 1997 oh you know I was extremely experienced 23 year old I've been doing it for two years come on you can you can put me in charge of designing the BBC's first news website yeah totally well that's what I did so a team there to do that and that was again really sort of like wandering into your place where and the rules would be you know there weren't any rules so you could start to experiment with what what the rules could be or should be so I did that for two years still very proud of some of the things that we did there originally then I went to work my first dalliance with America I I thought you know yes I was about so I know 24:25 but pirates like to move to and the move to America is gonna be amazing and so went to speak to this company called sapien well actually went to speak to this design company called adjacency who I'd met that the sort of founder of a couple of times and just really liked them they were like this small really experimental design oriented company they like did start it off like making the first website for specialized bikes and got paid in bikes and then so it's all ready to like move to the American Midwest to go and work for them and the fans are like call me up and said Matt I know you I know you'd like put in notice on you flatten Orissa and you're gonna move to America and you know really that sounds great however we just got bought by a really big company and they're starting a London office or they have got a London office but we're starting the design team there so I ended up not moving but going to work for them work for him a consultancy called Sapien which still exists but it's now like a big advertising at the time is like a technology consultancy it sort of morphed over the last sort of 30 years I supposed 20 years into an advertising agency so did that for a little bit that was really good Matt loads of people who are still good friends of mine and it was sort of I suppose that time even notice of only two years that was sort of like my master's degree in something like that you couldn't really study so that was I met loads of really as first time I'd ever really met professional designers I suppose so lots of people who particularly at least in my experience in America in North America at least designers incredibly professionalized and like very you know it's seen as like very serious thing rather than like you know maybe through the 80s and 90s in in London and the UK designers a bit more on know punk rock or something it was kind of like much more sort of deal actually came out you know most of the big graphic design names that you know would have come out of the music industry or their interface with a music music industry right whereas in the state's much more kind of like yes we've just been designing things for you know big companies for like 80 years and making loads of money doing it so that's my sort of first exposure to that sort of very professionalized world of design rather than something which is more perhaps out of the British tradition of sort of more art school music you know creativity you know creativity whatever that is side of it America much more professionalized much more about delivering a service you know working to sort of business clients and nuts or things so it was like baptism of fire in all of that and then went back for another sort of stint at the BBC for another two years and that's where I first met Google because I worked on the the first search engine that the BBC ever did first and lost switch back then it was like you know we're the BBC and you know Britain deserves a Britain deserves a British search engine you know rather than these bloody Americans coming over or so so it because he decided to make a sort of public service search engine sort of more prioritizing kind of non commercial content and those sorts of things you know pretty noble ideals for it of course they had to power power of a thing with with Google Tecna so we went to visit Google in California I think they were only about of two or three years old at that point so it's kind of fascinating to meet all of the people who were like the founders really and talked to him about it and we were like wagging on about public service and like the BBC yeah yeah yeah yeah and just like does anybody ever know if you you you you probably so beautifully and aware of what modems are has anybody ever heard a modem how it sort of like speak he's like that's what the Google people sounded like to me what NATO is like it was like get like you know when or when you sort of phone the other thing is like when you find a wrong this is like again like a pretty old person metaphor but when you phone up the wrong number and you find that you phoned up the fax machine and it starts trying to talk facts at you that was what like going to visit Google was like as a designer you just sat in front of these engineers talking like fax machines at you so that was my first exposure to that I think I've got better at speaking facts since maybe so did that for a little bit and then I moved to Finland I went to work for Nokia which again is like once upon a time were you know the the kings and queens of the universe and you know everything was you know they basically dominated mobile phone technology and you just had the Nokia team everywhere you went went to work for them working on so like future concepts and stuff like that which was super interesting moved to Finland they interviewed me in May in Finland and it was sunny and warm and then I started in November and it was not so I did two winters in Finland and then moved back to London actually Farnborough and for a long time and that's first of all where I started meeting a lot of people who were graduating out of a course at the Royal College of Art which was running through sort of that early part of the 2000s called computer-related design it was started by a lady called Gillian Crampton Smith who went on to create a college about that time 2003 2004 2005 called Ivrea in Italy and that's where I think I so really found my tribe if you like people who were thinking about computation and software as a material a bit like if you were a woodworker or a silversmith or a fashion designer like you want to understand you've got like visions and things you want to do and you know a goal you want to achieve but there's also like a fascination with the techniques and the material and that speaks to you as well and it's you know it's not neutral it's not something that it's got things it wants to do so to speak and things it doesn't want to do and if you're a if you're a fashion designer or somebody works in textiles or as I say a woodworker metalwork whoever it might be those are the first things you learn right the first things you get taught as for sort of LEGO bricks of what you want to achieve and it's a funny you know it's sort of a sort of recurring theme I'll get to that a little bit later so that's a long and winding road to the actual talk so I thought it took mainly about work that I've done with friends a company called burg but we started and then I'll talk a little bit about some stuff at Google after I left I left Nokia and it was very fashionable to do a start-up back then so we did it we did as a start-up or as they should be more reasonably called tiny companies with no money but you work in above a pub but has a day every Tuesday where they cook fish it really smells so we did a startup called Doppler which was sort of like a very you know at the time that Twitter was starting Facebook was getting starting social networks who would like to see we were trying there like experiment with social network so we were doing it around some places and times and coincidences like when when would you and your friends be in the same place at the same time so we're trying to make a social network which was more about the physical world and location and those sorts of things you know bit influenced by lots of things that we've been talking about a Nokia about mobile telephony not really being about phone calls anymore so much as you know and that was sort of like the downfall of knock you in a way as like they didn't realise what a phone was gonna have an e meaning it was gonna be something much more so a lot of it and a lot of it for me as a designer on the team was about trying to acquire a client what other things have always wanted to try and do that if I if I if it messes up it's my fault sort of thing I can't blame anybody else so it's like what am i it's sort of forced me to sort of think about what I think and like do it and some things were terrible ideas that's result some things I think still stand the test of time around some of the things that we did around the interaction patterns around social networking which we sort of tried to do it very differently from Twitter and Facebook about those things some of the things around like using using the web and Web API is as a way of pulling the services and other bits of data into into an interface some of the things around info goes and of those such things I'm still pretty happy about but as a phone miss yet when I was looking did researching his talk I'd like to talk tin top let's see if it was still anything anywhere on the web about it and it's now like I think I can buy the domain back for like two thousand dollars from someone in China or something and then this is for startup cemetery I didn't know this existed but it's quite good a big resource where we've collected why a hundred big companies have failed also really tiny ones like us cause of failure acquisition flew which is a really nice way to say we got bought by Nokia weirdly not weirdly they were like oh you left us because we weren't listening you went and made this thing we like buy you back and do it all right by that time I'd sort of left anyway ATS of in a way cuz I you know setting up and doing the initial design work was the thing it was exciting and then the rest of it was sort of like the business and so I didn't have to go back and work for Nokia for another two years as part of that thing which was very good so I ended up working starting sewing with some friends of mine so two friends of mine Matt Webb and Jack Schultz have been working together in an imaginative lee named design parchment partnership called Schultz and Webb for a couple of years and I've actually been their client at Nokia I just really like the way that they thought on what unhanged out with them and all of their stuff was very much around sort of thinking through making and this sort like very material approach to technology and so I said I want you know can I can I come and join you and like see if we can grow this thing so we ended up making a little design studio sort of accidentally to start off with and then deliberately much more which we call burg mainly because we couldn't agree on a name and we asked a friend of ours who was a comic-book writer to nameís am I allowed to swear okay we had lots of terrible ideas for names the worst one I think was and sorry fish's offense it is offensive but we were so frustrated we like why don't we call herself shark just because we thought it'd be funny to go and talk to the business banking person at that West and so we want but we quickly shelved that idea apologies for the profanity and if you're a particular lover of sharks but so we ended up being called Berg which was a very obscure reference to a science for it'sh science fiction TV show and set of books Berg actually is an acronym in this 1950s 60s TV show it was a British version of NASA it was called the the British experimental rocket group and so that's what Berg stands for but we ended up working for a lot of people in Scandinavia thought because it's in a lot of Scandinavian languages it means Mountain so every god you egomaniacs you've called your studio mountain it's like prog rock or something oh really yeah all right it doesn't anyway so so I keep saying this is the beginning of my talk this is sort of a beginning of it so the main thing I was gonna try as I sort of thread or something that maybe you know it might be semi semi useful is this idea of exploring material as a place to start simultaneously or sometimes before you start thinking about what you're actually trying to do and and we were pretty we were pretty obsessed with this idea we didn't really have much of a design process other than you have to do material exploration before anything else like you have to understand what you're working with I'm Timo another one of the founders of the studio who's now gone on to with Jack start a games company called play do and who are doing really interesting stuff with AR and Gaming is as I say it's like getting you know getting to know the grain and flaws of what you're working with so you can like really exploit it and stretch it and also get inspired by it Jack who's very very tall that's you know as two stories of a building I know he's very very tall man so this is from an interview which I'll send our Center Alex to send around that they did I think about a year or so ago and it's like this idea that it is about like true curiosity about the technology but you're working with like like having that curiosity that a a woodworker would have about something they you know just almost like an obsession obsessive curiosity about technology how it's made what it does how it breaks those sorts of things and I'll skip the whole thing of it but it's this idea of like no one would design a building without looking at the land and the environment that is sound and the materials you make you know is like this whole in a weird way user centered design sort of like puts to one side all of that context that you're building with it's not that you shouldn't think about you know making things but are useful and easy to use maybe maybe you don't want to do that maybe you want to do something much more critical something which asks a lot more questions I'd know you know particularly in this in the time and setting that you have here you know that's that's for freedom that you have but it's that idea that you know it's a place in industry at least you know it's almost like price over everything that you're sort of delivering that easy interface to like create sort of business value but in lots of other most other fields of design and creative output there's an examination or of you know the material that and the context materially that you're working in the actual context you're working in physically and then also the cultural context you're working in right so where does the thing that you're making land in reference to the cultural context or you have a particular sub cultural context you're working in and we don't really do a lot of that it seems in at least in commercial design for technology just to sort of give try and give myself a bit of intellectual heft as I'm speaking at a college this is one of the most favorite it's not the right word because it's not you know it's not like The DaVinci Code it's not Harry Potter it's not like a something that you'd like I must read more but is that actually what it was quite good to read it but one of the most impactful I suppose books on the way that I think about my work was this but the nature of Technology it's a book by an economist about technology and Brian Arthur Harvard economist and he was just curious about like why overtake you know why technology in the technology industry is this like giant you know crazy huge success stories of at least you know economically why does it why do these companies create so much value at least you know in market capitalism terms and so he looks at in this like very forensic like almost like almost a bit like a you know a zoologist looking at Tigers or you know it's like why are they it's not it's not really loves technologies in the industries like why why does this thing work that way I need to understand why it's so peculiar and he so really really does it from like because he is such a sort of forensic mind so it starts from like the very first principles of like what is this stuff so he starts uh sort of like scientific phenomena somebody discovered you know back in sort of a 1920's 1930's you know a number of phenomena were discovered by scientists in labs whether it's like how to transmit information or you know Claude Shannon or you know stored-program computer john von neumann Alan Turing how to make semiconductors how to make chips you know these Oh like how same you know semiconductors themselves like there are these weird properties of these sorts of materials that mean that you can make these tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny switches right phenomena and then on top of that is like right that's great how do I actually build that as a sort of engineers viewpoint on it how do I build semiconductors 1947 50s how do I build computers on top of that 1960 70s how do I build personal computers on top of that seventies eighties lalalalala right so this huge stack of stuff going right from phenomena and so this this idea of like cat like he's you know basically all value in technologies about capturing most phenomena and bundling them in some way it's also about like the combination of those bundles which is sort of a design mind in a way coming into it so this quote which while I've been rambling hopefully you've been ignoring me in reading you know invention falls into two broad patterns it may start from one end of a chain from a given purpose or need you know as I say so like user centered design right and find a principle to accomplish this finally find the tools and materials to do that or it may start from the other end from phenomenon or effect usually a newly discovered one and envision it in some principle of use neither pattern the process is not complete until the principles is translated into working parts but he goes on to say and this is a bit wordy but as I was saying like technology because complex of these interactive processes a complex of captured phenomena and they're all talking to each other but it's not triggered in some like sequence like competing code it's ongoing and continuously interactive and I think this was of in a way this very worthy forensic quote by an economist was really what we were powered by at burg was this idea that there's all of these different phenomena and you can combine them in obvious ways or you can be really stupid and cover like we we often were and just try and see what happens when you move one thing out of the room it's meant to be you know out of the box it's meant to be in and put it in another box and really that is where of a certain material exploration sort of foundation comes in is that you're able to do that faster and faster and more intuitively the more you start to have that kind of under your fingernails enos that a woodworker or a metal worker or a textile designer might have so moving on from work wordy quotes to more relaxing just watching videos together which is my the main thrust of what this will be or gifts this is a very early project by Timo and Jack and some folks are home University in Oslo in Norway this year you can sort of see before the green measles go over it this is the exact same component that's in the gates of the ticket barriers of an oyster or any other kind of contactless interfaces NF NFC reader and as you know oyster and other things like that and contacts the contactless payments and all of those sorts things very much sold on you know touch your phone to the to the gate but it's not not as is not a pressure sensor in there right there's not a switch that's making a contact it's a radio field this is emitting a radio field and that is sensing a radio field and it's not really about touch at all it's about this bubble of radio being close enough to this bubble of radio and the chip inside going oh that's a thing that will talk to the humans about as touching there's not really and so this is what's really happening and this is this kind of material exploration mode in a way so in a accessible toilet in Norway which you know in a similar to this place very you know nice and new and so you can't really like switch four lights off anywhere with a switch other than in the accessible toilets so that was the only place that was dark enough to do it in a sort of mounted this and what you know why of it you can see coming around the back there he's actually going to need a prop massachusett is going to basically a stick imagine this is a stick and on the end of the stick is an LED and the LED when it's inside the detectable radio field lights up so you film that with a long exposure and you start to get well basically you poke it hundreds of times and it lights up you know when it gets into the detectable field so you're painting with light the actual properties of this technology you know it's as near as you can get and as we're trying to make it as concrete and be reduce the abstraction as much as possible with these experiments and so you start and the other thing about like these you're making these images out of this and then sharing these images is to try and sort of get into people get this or that these behaviors into people you know when you go and look at the oysters in you know Peckham rye station hopefully you'll see green mushrooms over all of them you know it's the ideas like getting it into your head with imagery rather than talk about all of the technology you know there's an actual truth to how the image was made but the images the thing that gives you the the theory the folk theory in your mind about what's happening there so with the success of that these two gentlemen in R&B on their part they would teacher our hope but they also run a consultancy called boy Oslo who do really lovely things and they with Timo went on then to make a much bigger version of this so these these LEDs on this big stick are lighting up in response to Wi-Fi field strength so same tactic long exposure photography not poking the field this time but wandering around Oslo late at night painting like painting the Wi-Fi fields and so hopefully this will play we're just we won't watch all of it but you'll get you'll get the idea is a saint okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] one of the nice things you start to see we start to serve put together you know is it to do with I think it's an image soon least you know you can you can sort of just in your head like do the make me intuition oh that's gone down there because there must be you know something really blocking the signal there might be so you start to make up the rules in your head from the imagery rather than having to be told the rules [Music] anyway you get the picture turns out Oslo is the sort of city where you can wander around at night with something like that and no one's arrests you [Music] it's kind of interesting love the shadow of the car like big metal objects affecting the radio anyway let's get back to this is Jack again in one of our first studios making another piece which was to do with this entire research program around RFID and well we called a lot of this stuff about but it's not really touch but it's about nearness service miss film is called nearness a lot shorter but very fun and has an oyster card in it who's familiar with a piece of work called the way things go by fish lien vice so Swiss artists also like all less highbrow sort of big Domino rallies where you know Domino's get knocked over and everything you know one thing happens after another that's basically what you're seeing here but none of it on all of the dominoes are radio or at least on the electromagnetic spectrum nothing is touching is the gag which I've sort of given away but you'll get it 2009 still no iPhones see it again like trying to make fun popular communications are quite technical ideas as part of this project around touch and RFID that was done in collaboration with our hoe as I say we're done here well done I cannot use computers sorry the next thing I wanted to talk about is is sort of like this notion of using film and mainly because we had Tebow in the team who's a brilliant brilliant filmmaker we we found ourselves using film and awful lot or just for medium of like making videos some of them were like very rough just like shot on shot on our cell phones to kind of get the idea like so on it like sketching with film as well sketching with video and why we you know why that was so important to us is just the element of time in interaction design you know which is essentially kind of like the thing that you are working with more than anything else and so the fact that you have to if you're Pro if you're doing like a really sketchy film using your iPhone to film it you have to act it out you have to act out in time with your hands and so you get this again get this like intuition this of almost like material intuition about time and timing in the same way as an animator or filmmaker would have about what they would do in their craft and so as so much of interaction design is about kind of like what feels right in time and space and hands and movement film is you know for us at least was an incredibly important medium this was a prototype we did in 2010 for a Swedish company called Bonnie a around so they wanted to sort of explore like digital magazines they're a publishing company probably most famous for publishing popular science sense of cookery magazines and things like that and so we made this little video all of which is kind of like based on and it you know and into the set of interaction design patterns that are pretty regular rigorously worked out but we you know and we were prototyping this in video as well so we were making little as are so sketchy versions of this with little paper prototypes and stuff but video 8 videoing the paper prototypes in real time to like try and act out how it would work over a sort of a time base and get those timings right even before we go into something much more polished than this and of course like the tabla is a block of wood with green paper on it to be able to register it in in after-effects more easily but rather than doing the after-effects as you know a as you often sort of see a abstract screen of a phone or a tablet or something in us of masks of a phone we thought it's really important even though it's a massive headache to composite it on a on on something in the world because then you start to sort of see what it feels like to have it if you go back to the beginning of that little clip you know there's a behavior when this person picks it up off the table you know it's something very lovely about that interaction and a lot of it is about the ergonomics of it and how it feels you know doesn't look like a magazine but perhaps it feels like one is what we were trying to get to the nice thing about this was it got seen by people at Apple who were about to launch for iPads the first iPad at the time and they were like how do you know what we're doing well we don't but we know there's gonna be tablets and we know that humans have fingers so I mean to an extent right you can sort of it's like these aren't changing for hopefully 100,000 years or so at least so there are only so many things you can do with fingers and something that big and so and the things that might be successful smaller than that so it's not you're nicking it like spying is like well people have fingers so you're like alright fair enough so we want you to build that for the launch of the iPad it's in ten weeks we got it's a it's a it's a lie it's a we it's a video it's not real software no yeah but you know we want you to do it we're Apple crap alright then and so we did it one of the other things about this was via you know the actual prototype iPads of which they were probably like a hundred in the world or something like that and probably a thousand to that point was given to Bonnier here a Swedish company by Apple that was where the deal happened so we had to go and to go and debug the code Nick the engineer who worked on it basically had to fly to Stockholm where the iPad was chained to a radiator by handcuffs with a security guard looking over him while he was like sweating debugging with the C++ anyway that would that was maybe all worth it because then we got mentioned by Steve Jobs for 20 seconds I will take that over anything else that I've done I mean you know anyway made me very happy very happy some more fun videos so Steve Jobs talking about their work really great the next video is something I never thought would happen in my design career is having your work explained in a sort of sneering sarcastic way but actually very clearly and very well by Jeremy Paxman is it gonna work Oh wrong one I have to press play on this one that's awful news night tonight before we leave you an advertising agency called Dentsu London and the film company called berg playing around with tablet PCs recently in search of ideas and came up with this and take an iPad and move it along while the screen flashes up a series of 3d letters as seen in cross-section like this and if you photograph what you're doing on a one single line exposure shot it looks like this so they made a movie of it and here's an extract [Music] [Music] [Music] I'd still really love that work you know again it's like taking something digital and playing with it and trying to get to like my material understanding of it and then and then sort of trying to make it something work you when you're looking at it you're not quite sure what you're seeing but you can sort of work it out one of the other things that sort of like was really interesting about this project was like like Matt Brown who was in our studio at a time composed the music and we sort of were curious about like are can we like put it on iTunes and try and sell it so he looked like again like trying to find it like a lot of the stuff that we were doing was also not just like curiosity about like the surface you know this is a very in a way like quite a surface aesthetically LED piece of work but then one of the other things in the studio we were always really curious about we're like the systems behind everything like some of OTUs like what does it mean to like you know how do you get music into the world now like how do you put it on iTunes how do you get onto a streaming platform we're not musicians but we're really interested in like how this like big change has like affected that world can we figure out how to do that which this isn't show this very quickly this is just another software I was digging through sand there one of my favorite things this is like the this is a are using train tickets so the theory behind this was we know that you're on the train you've got a ticket so we we know exactly when you're gonna go past things on the train track so 11:34 you're gonna see this so if you look at your ticket so you've got these little like deck of cards that came out with your ticket and you're just a bit bored and it's 11:30 for you look out the window and you see the thing but there's a lot of effort to sort of do that but it was kind of against it like this was part of a bigger project about kind of thinking about connected printing systems and how you could use those to kind of like effect you know but if you think about ticket machines is like print-on-demand machines that could like bring you anything if you really wanted to they mainly print you tickets to get onto trains but why can't you know what else could they do so that was like a really anyway I was one of my favorite things we actually going to zip around a little bit and just on that point of the systems behind things we got to make a comic book which was complete wish fulfillment on our part to an extent where we serve came up with the premise of the story but then we got Warren Ellis comic book writer and you know all round brilliant writer of fiction and science fiction to come up with a world and a story based on something that we were again like fascinated by which was the beginning of of a are I suppose and so like alternate takes on on a are svk is a comic book about a secret bit of technology that gets invented by us of sinister technology corporation like I won't mention any names of it it's gets leaked and it falls into the hands of this person who's a sort of mean-spirited but sort of you know some modern Sherlock Holmes I suppose but we thought we'll make up well again we'll like do printed a are so when you buy this comic book well no there are no thought bubbles from any of the characters at least that's what you think you read the whole thing without seeing anybody's thought so in comic strips you're always like seeing what people are thinking right except we print all of the thoughts in UV ink that you can only see with the UV torch but in the comic book the magical piece of technology is called svk and it's a thing that allows the hero sort of antihero to see see people's thoughts that's for story in the book there's a sinister surveillance technology that allows you to read minds falls into his hands and suddenly you can he can read thoughts and you can too because you've got the special torture allows you to so there's a lot of fun anyway the main front of it was this which is UV ink it turns out again material exploration turns out if you want to do a project with UV ink you have to be security checked by the authorities to prove that you're not forging banknotes so we all got security checked and we had to go to the printers who were security checked so there's only one printers that know it's only one printers that does it in the UK there were people who print the they don't print back no Spade print all of the catalogs for Sotheby's and and like our auctions and things like that so like it's amazing print printing facility in Essex that we went to which would be on this film if it were to stop buffering there's a little bit disappointing anyway you can go and look at that and over time more than the first three to six seconds of it oh well so I'm going to zip back from that but the other thing about that comic book because we were actually so experimenting with the systems of selling things because we had to sell we didn't sell svk through shops or anything we sold it directly online and at that point we we knew that we wanted to sell make and sell our own products but we wanted to experiment with something that wasn't as complicated as like a piece of technology so we we sort of used that project of sell you know doing something really really fun with comic books and like little torches that we we got like manufactured specifically for it to learn about like short-run manufacture and learn about warehousing and learn about kind of like customer service and like returns policies and things like that which you know are really really boring but you have to like be able to that's again part of the sort of systems design of like having to do these things this is a project we did for Google which is again like this was 2009 2010 so this was again experimenting with AR though this was about kind of like computer vision looking at the world and then projecting the results into the world so no no screens just projection so as you can see by Andy's face there it's a lot of measuring and calibrating how you know got a Kinect there we've got a webcam projector in a in a rig that we made to get the angles just right in order to have to make your own software to do any of this and so what results from hopefully the Internet is back you know we were having to sort of like make sort of roll our own everything really at this stage for dude computer vision in the world and projection and sort of AR maneuvers so we did this with a in collaboration brilliant Eliot woods from kimchi and chips brilliant technologist in creative technologist and yet had to do everything which is like an against like this almost like the extreme of material exploration where you're like ah God you know it's kind of like if you're if you're a metal worker or a wood worker it's like oh god we have to go to the we have to go to the forest and chop everything down before we get it to the studio oh no we have to Grover forest before we can shop with it so like this was like ice is a bit too far but it's just because there wasn't anything at the time and of course now you can do all in like a arc or a arc it but you know there's a little bit of that kind of how far do you go like what's the what's the right amount of being curious about this stuff before it you could fall off the deep end into oh god I've got to become a you know software developer and like poke at things I didn't really want to have to poke at sometimes you have to write if you're trying to do something completely new or you know a arc it you know the tools that you've been given which get you places really really fast don't do the thing you want to do then suddenly you fall off another edge right which is that you so you do have to go and go to the forest and chop down some trees but this you know this ends up with kind of like some really in you know in doing this though even though it was horrible you know you start to get that kind of like interesting insights from a grain of material I like the fact that this you know slightly janky version of a arc it but we were trying to make 10 years ago like is this quite organic kind of unsure wiggly line instead of like ah you know which you know we're all very grateful for is technologists and creative technologists now but it was something quite lovely about the mistakes it made in those sort of like early pieces at work at least that's what we tell ourselves so we don't cry ourselves to sleep at night of a wasted hours and years so that ends up with against of how am i doing for time Bob we're like all right sorry okay I've got a few more things to show but you know okay cool so this sort of ends up we've kind of like a design outcome of we did lots of work around this but one of the main desire not kim outcomes was like what happens if you just have instead of having smart things you have smart light so what if you have like video players that are just made out of blocks of wood with fiducial markers on them so this is it's quite hard to see in this light but this is basically a functioning YouTube player that has no electronics in it it's just it's functioning by being seen by computer vision and then the results being projected on the screen by a projector so it's sort of like a weirdly cartoon extreme version of what's happening with cloud computing in a way right there's like nothing you know all this happening on your screen most of the time these days are just pixels that are coming from somewhere else this is a lovely extreme so this is like the scrubber which is just a pulley that turns the marker to tell the machine vision to advance by so much right very weird extreme this is this is a lovely one this is a music player and these are switches that are being completed if you like you know the circuit is being made by making the visual symbol complete in the machine i we found out we found a pigment fluoresce is in IR which could be detected by the webcam so we could paint those most codes invisibly on an object and then the other thing that we're doing is we're doing sort of like tiny tiny projection mapping on these objects and it when it doesn't look brilliant on a screen but you have to sort of take my word for it but when you see it in real life it's like really really spectacular looks really lovely anyway again so a little bit of us of provocation really rather than anything else we didn't believe that the world was gonna go this way we just thought it'd be funny to kind of make completely dumb objects that are brought to life and animated by smart light and we were able to charge Google money for it and eventually I got a job there so they must have liked something about it this one is another AR project you know early days about 2010 2011 I think this swabue he's a well I'll let the video explain oops which didn't work wait play we were hoping to launch an AR toy empire my favorite things about this film is in the next bit pants contain environment so the swappable pants on each of these characters select their identity is at the top part of the Domino if you like the bottom part of the Domino's changes the environment that's then seen when it's mediated through they are this weirdly ended up in in MoMA keep up on that in an exhibit which was really not what we intended we intended to like invent the next Pokemon and become gazillionaires somehow but unfortunately for us that didn't happen the advertising agency we work with did actually left London moved back to Tokyo and it ended up in the Museum of Modern Art in New York which is fine I suppose but not what we intended but really lovely little project that so he went on to write here's how we're really going to be millionaires we're gonna make a tiny printer and so we spent a lot of time and effort working on on this guy [Music] so it's a tiny printer that sort of gives you the equivalent of light scrolling through your phone every morning on a sort of basically using the print of us in shop tills who's incredibly cheap with impotent so we saw it saw it as like a choir alternative to like being in grocery fun and it prints its own face and its face changes every day like a like a tamagotchi or take care of it and so this was like also and you know this was a product that was also a an experiment into a lot of different things can what what's it you know this was a time where people starting to talk about internet things what does it mean to make a thing that you want to have in your house that you so treat like you know a piece of furniture or a character rather than as a piece of technology can we make it can we sell it can we make a platform but this all runs on can we get partners to work with us on this so there were a lot of agendas in this kind of like quite charming odd product and it was incredibly complicated and hard to make and you know the real sort of the strategy behind that was turning big was turning from a sort of design consultancy into a product company and into a product technology company and what we wanted to eventually become millionaires from was this of IOT platform but we were you know this was sort of like that Petrosian printer that the platform would kind of come from under and so actually you know I worked in 12 under the printer I wanted to actually show some other things so it should have came from the platform side of it which should perhaps aren't as well known in in any of our stuff is well known at all but so these are two projects which saw based on their platform one is I think you I wish this existed still this is pixel track which is a signage system but it's a signage system is basically a display but in working with the electricity's cut upon a shut researching and pixel track is effectively a little toy train that instead of change you know running on train tracks a changes the track that is on so there's a lot of research into making mechanical pixels basically and this is where we net it out which is something where the Train is flipping over print pixels with a little sort of print heads that it has as it goes over the track so you can make the three ideas you can make four pixels incredibly cheaply and they don't require any power so you can put them in places which where you know you don't want to use a lot of power in public spaces in you know libraries and hospitals and those things and this little train as you can see flips the pixels over each each to create the display really lovely and I'm sort of running on the on the platform second one I wanted to show you is a washing machine and this is again sort of trying to prove out the prove out the platform and this is where we're sort of trying to show the value of what we've invented to people people like Bosch and me Leigh and so you can prototype these sorts of interactions really really quickly so you just put this is the board that we made for us of that form and you can start to prototype interactions using connected apps really really quickly and this you know this is a real thing and then we can start to also further on the project we took you know then that leads us sis of how quickly can we prototype new interfaces and new interactions you know things that don't have screens or shouldn't have screens domestic appliances those sorts of things and make them sort of connected see can watch that your leisure again sadly the world of washing machines was not ready for us maybe and this sort of time you know Berger transitioned from being a design consultancy to up to a product company and so we've taken vici we take an investment to try and you know push this idea of an IOT platform sadly didn't work out and as you know we moved from being a consultancy model to something where we were start model and we ran out of money and so Berg closed its doors in about 2014 by which time I'd left which leads me to the final chapter so in 2013 after working with the creative lab at Google on things like that lamps project and then being familiar with Berg etc two things happened actually three things - two things arrived which are my children and suddenly a salary became something that grew quickly attractive to me as a human being as a result of you know being being in sort of startups and interesting design studios and things like that was great but then yeah big technology came a-calling I moved to New York initially went to work for Google in there in a bit of the company called creative lab which is sort of an odd offshoot of the marketing department basically and it was full of people who I'd never worked with really before from more of an advertising and creative communications world people who film no film makers who come much more from marketing and narrative copywriters never work with luck writers before that was amazing writers incredible they can like their writers of a fastest designers cuz you know the really good writers can just conjure a world in your head with a sentence you know oh right yeah oh I was gonna like do all of these prototypes to that but that's exactly what it should be and it was a great it was doing two and a half years doing that just quickly show you two films that we made like two projects from Emmys are sort of like films but the character and tone of the films that you've been seeing from Berg are in market contrast to what you will see from the marketing department of Google as a very big tonal change is about to happen but with that so there's this giant power plant in the sky and it's creating free energy for anyone to catch but most people aren't catching it because even though it could save them money on their electric bills getting started can be pretty frustrating there's all this stuff to figure out like how many panels do you need who's gonna install them how much would you actually save and how do you tell if your house even gets enough Sun a lot of people ask Google these kinds of questions so we started looking for a better way to give them answers and that's when one of our engineers got an idea if people are getting lost trying to find answers about solar why don't we give them a map we could take the information that's already in Google Maps and use it to show how much sunlight falls on a roof then we could combine that with all the other stuff people need to figure out and create kind of a treasure map of solar energy it could show you how much solar power your roof can generate and how much you could save then it could even point you towards an installer in your neighborhood instantly it's an idea we're calling project sunroof and right now we're just starting with a few places like Boston where the sunroof team is from the San Francisco Bay Area where Google is from and Fresno where one of our engineers mom is from pretty soon it'll grow to include the entire country and maybe even the whole world that way anyone anywhere can start caching energy from that power plant in the sky they didn't let me anywhere near these sorts of things I was a you know I was probably like one of the first product that interaction designers are they made sort of employs I was a bit of a weird fish in there but I was working with the engineers who were featured in that about this idea which was like still to this day like one of these like brilliant one-in-a-million ideas of like well we've got all of these maps and we can actually use basically you know basic geometry from and machine vision on top of those maps to understand the angle of people's roofs and where the Sun will be and make a model of how much centers can be falling on that roof and so like a brilliant again select piece of material exploration and way like understanding what you've got but then like re combining it to come up with something really brilliant which is still going to stay I think it's in think it's in the UK now as well by this time I'm not sure on a skip over the next one in the interests of time and talk a little bit about this so when I I worked in that department in marketing for about two and a half years and then moved over to Google research and particularly sort of AI research about three and a half years ago now and this was one of the first products I worked on and if I'd remember I had I have one of these at home and I forgot to bring it in apology so I'll bring it in another time that I visit um but it it's a camera it's a camera that also has a photographer inside so there is a tiny AI inside this that has been trained on things that most humans like most humans like other humans most humans like other humans when they're smiling most of the things most humans like puppies and sunsets and things like that so out of the box this device knows more you know knows that if I'm put in front of a smiling human and a puppy my owner might like that take a photo this button is the only button on the whole thing that you can switch it on and off by turning the turning the lens but this is the only other interaction that is a button that looks like a shutter button it sort of is it's also a voting button to the AI to say I like this so you've taken a photo but you've also voted you've also said to the AI buts inside there I like sunsets reflected in the grimy pebbles of Peckham Roy and so it would train the neural net that's inside this to remember that to activate next time so we are doing this as a as a project again a little you know is a it was a product that was sold for a little while by Google beause really also an experiment to prove a couple of things one is that the advantages that the value of AI doesn't necessarily have to be in the hands of the corporations that make them it can be in your hands so this is a tight you know device which is like this big that is self-contained it's it's an AI in a device on device AI which is predominantly what the group by work we've been researching so you're actually putting the competing and the neural networks and the you know the m/l systems inside the device this could go for you know years without talking to the network and still behaving in and learning in a way that I've described it's also Udall AI it's you know your model of what you've been voting on and teaching it is yours it's not an averaged you know comes out of the box with oh I think most humans like puppies but once you've trained it is yours and it's that kind of principle of you know being a manufacturer of billions of a eyes rather than just a maintainer of one giant AI in the clouds which is the kind of research agenda behind this project and this is a you know this is a trend which is continuing over over has continued of it was this the genesis of this was in around 2015-16 and so this has been continuing I'll skip over a bunch of it and I'm think you're all pretty familiar of teachable machine and things like the marshmallow sorter okay well I mean the marshmallow sorter is actually built on teachable machine but it's also built on hardware components called coral which is a output of our team as well which are development boards for prototyping things like clips you know clips was like with like can we do this and then coral is like right can everybody do this there's a little bit of a connection back to some of the things we were doing at Burke load the last thing I wanted to show is some work that I haven't really shown that much outside of Google which is about my last year's been doing a lot of research and design research around agents so rather than so if you think about like Siri or Alexa or all the Google assistant you have this kinda lot over you know this this paradigm at the moment of so like voice assistance and sort of things which are effectively sort of intercoms to all you know you basically like phoning up Apple or Google or Amazon and asking for something then Apple Google or Amazon are doing something for you they're rendering it as a service back out through the speaker back out through whatever it might be so in a ways it's there's an element to it where there's a lot of AI involved perhaps in like understanding what you're saying but after that it's really kind of business as usual when you think about agents and agents have like a you know large component of this kind of personal AI within them so what was describing with clips you know once once it's yours it's yours right it's your it's your agent it's your devices your model your training it the value of that training is yours as soon as we leave the shop with our two agents are too personal a ice they're gonna start to dot you know yours are gonna start to become yours and mine's gonna start to become mine there's gonna be some things that they sort of do kind of the same probably cuz we probably both like to catch much is it buses on time and things like you know is but there's other things where it's gonna diverge a lot and so it's a gender of personal AI and personal AI agents is what we've been looking at for the last two years or so and one of the things that we've been looking at a lot is kind of the idea of moving from this candle like quite again like the overriding drive behind Siri elects a Google assistant is just tell me what you want an arm you know don't worry about it I'll magically do it and get you a result which is you know a lot of the time good and a lot of the time very useful and you know saves you time saves you headaches whatever it might be there are things where you don't want that you want it to be more like co-piloting or you want it to be something where it's more kind of that it's augmenting you doing something rather than it's automating something away from you if I make sense so a lot of our work has been sort of like looking at trying to create a spectrum of how own like we also tend to talk a lot more about owners rather than users when we're so I think just does it remind ourselves of the fact that of a relationship that you might have with this thing but it's kind of very much yours but kind of you know there are gonna be sorts of things where it's very low risk is very high confidence on behalf of the agent it can deliver something for you you know tell me when the next bus is yeah I can do that totally automated high confidence low risk we're gonna be a load of things where the agent is gonna have low confidence that it can do a good job and that maybe the first time around it's gonna be kind of high risk perhaps it's like a high risk contexts for you personally and something you know you should just a bit that there's going to be a lot more input required by the human part of the partnership if you like but you want to be able to like shift gears and go back and forth up and down with spectrum and that's a lot of what we've been working on are sort of UI patterns and technologies that allow us to not just do this kind of like voice assistant personal assistant model over here but also do things which are much more like AI agents co-piloting complex tasks with you and then a bunch of things in the middle and just once a like little example of that it's a little bit the trivial one B is kind of interesting we did this with a a little company who were up in Hackney Wick called Nord three people prototype brilliant design prototyping shop I've done a lot of projects with them and one of the things about these can like personalized is we could probably train them to do lots of very objective things like like things where their answer like value judgments involved as it were but one of the nice things that may come with this being more of a personal model is it can start to learn more subjective things about you which is something that you you know doesn't you don't wouldn't feel particularly comfortable with a big technology company doing that perhaps but something manufactured by a big technology company that then is yours and his private to you and can't be introspected or inspected by anyone other than you perhaps you perhaps you would like it to learn particular things about how you like to do things right so does the change or we're trying to examine here not just in this little like UI patterns but also in the attitude to the technology does the change in the architecture that the technology allows you to push you know rather they're being in a cloud being in the data center you know maintained and owned by a private company you have a company that's making something for you and then it's yours does that change your attitude to how you relate to it how would you know that it is truly yours how do you trust it how would you like test it check it make sure that you know it's got your agenda rather than anybody else's so it's working to all sorts of things like that we've been doing loads of research around but just to bring it back to gifts of interfaces thinking about subjective tasks this is a visualization so you know this is not like particularly there's a pretty you know everyday mundane use case like trying to find something you want to wear and doing this is something where you know this is something where you're gonna have a lot of subjectivities brought into it there are some objective things like you know how much is it is it going to arrive in two weeks time or two days time is it made out of natural materials is it ethically sourced or things that you can serve just like you know that the agent can sort of tick the boxes of there gonna be some things we're like what what's what's you know I want something a bit you know adventurous or I want something a bit minimal well that's you know mark my version of adventurous and your version of adventurous will be very different I hope for you so they should be different for everybody right and so your agent should be able to be trained in what you mean by those subjective things to help you serve search you know this large space of of of tops this is a visualization about which is being this is a co-piloting surface or a copilot co-piloting UI whereas being drawn in real-time by by an AI and you're manipulating in real times of also able to Train it so the second part of this UI is that each of these purple bubbles is one of those sort of subjectivities and you can train it so you go to this next interface was a bit like a sort of mood board Pinterest II thing and by just training it on something like it doesn't need like very many data points this technique that has been researched by colleagues of ours computer scientist colleagues of ours called concept activation vectors or calves becomes really interesting and important so calves are a technique they were researching around being able to explain what machine learning models are doing like why is this model you know it's like a big topic why is this ML system doing what it's doing is it biased is it excluding people is it returning unfair or biased results because of a way that it's been trained so one of the you know one of the very active fields of research in Google research around knees you know its topics around explaining what ml systems are doing and being able to like diagnose them and fix them if you like and Cavs is part of that but we sort of talked to the computer science said let's see this is gonna be really great for us being able to explain a personal model back to an owner and having them train it and it also turns up by using this technique you can train it incredibly quickly with with like not very many data points so you to like add and subtract a few things from this mood board and it learns on device so this again is it a personal AI this is a personal machine learning model that's training on your phone doesn't go anywhere else so you're adventurous is you're adventurous on your phone different from yours and so we've trained it with like this nice little fun interface takes about you know a minute to do and then then you can start piloting around this space with your agent that now knows what you mean by adventurous or minimal or you know glamorous or something you know something very subjective and can sort of help you wander around and augment your ability to kind of search a very large search space so so trivial example but something that we're really excited by around like a fundamental computer science research output then being able to be applied into kind of like an interesting useful probably hopefully valuable in something like a shopping search engine thing but also has like quite what we or we think kind of is trying to do the right thing around kind of personal privacy agency trust in these sorts of systems and again sort of coming out of trying it when trying to do select material exploration around what calves are and what this technique is that's it thanks for paying attention [Applause]
