 [Music] hi everybody it's tim with timber photography this week's tutorial is getting sharp images when photographing birds through foliage and so you can see from the cover slide here that what i'm trying to do is create a different kind of bird image one that shows it in its natural habitat and show it just a little bit more in a mysterious way not the direct front lighting clear soft background kind of traditional bird photography image let's add some soft out of focus foliage in the image that will kind of show the bird in a different kind of way and here's a kind of a straight shot i've got foliage in closer to me here and here and it's not right up against the bird and so it kind of softens the image a little bit and it adds a different kind of a mysterious or unique aspect to the frame here's kind of a traditional shot with direct front lighting the lights coming from this way there's no shadows on the bird and this is a great image it's traditional and what we're trying to do is put a little bit more art in our image and try to figure out how we can do that by having a softer foreground and having something soft in between us and the bird and then here we've got this killed here again but we've got all this soft foliage blocking parts of it body but the eye is sharp and the eye is visible and that's the key thing here i think if the eye shows through then it's going to work if the eye doesn't show through it doesn't work as well this one doesn't work as much because we can't see the eye and as humans we like to see the eye of the bird we want to connect with the bird by seeing its eye this one works a lot better because we can see the eye we can connect with the bird it's got a little sparkle in the eye all of that adds up to us being able to make a connection with the bird and then all of the foliage in the foreground this is a little bit closer to the bird but it's still out of focus it just adds to the ambience of the image and makes the image a little bit more unique and a little bit more striking we have to be careful about this because we don't want to have the foliage cut off parts of the bird or block part of the birds and this one is okay but i don't really like that this reed here is really sharp it's not really blurred and it's not really adding anything to the image it's kind of cutting the neck off this one i like a lot better because we've got this strong diagonal line and that of course we know adds to a composition and then here probably my favorite of the three series here with the lesser yellow legs this line doesn't interfere with the bird's bill head and eye and so it's just a much cleaner image and we've got foliage in there the foliage is a little bit sharper than i was going for but it still kind of works how do we do this well i think there's two or three different ways to do this and one of them is kind of the traditional way of just leaving your camera on autofocus and getting a very small autofocus point and then trying to get that right on the eye of the bird here's the standard focus point in olympus and the other one is just smaller so the other thing we can do is change the case sensitivity it's a case sensitivity in canon system i think all camera systems have this they call it something else in the olympus world it's continuous autofocus sensitivity i have it showing you plus two here for this kind of photo i would put it on minus two because minus two in this system is more sticky it's going to stay with the bird and not be impacted by stuff that comes between you and the bird so i think the third kind of way that you can do this if you're just not leaving it on auto focus and trying to get the small focus point on the eye or if you're not going to change the case sensitivity of your camera the third way to do this is to put your camera on manual mode and manual focus on the bird and then when it goes behind the foliage you'll still be sharp on the bird so those are the kind of the three things that i do when i'm trying to get this kind of a shot here i was able to shoot through the foliage and get this greater yellow legs catching a little fish there's vegetation between me and the bird and that's making it look like the image isn't very sharp but it's just some short grass that it was between me and the bird kind of adds to that soft ethereal mysterious look that we're trying to get here and then here's a lee sandpiper and there's a bunch of foliage between me and it my camera is like resting right on the ground so i'm shooting through grasses and everything but the eye here is pretty sharp and pretty clear it's got a nice little reflection gleam in there and then here there's more grass here the eye is pretty clear but not quite 100 clear but you can see that by shooting through foliage we're going to be able to create some unique and kind of interesting images more mysterious more ethereal and also show where the birds live show their habitat a little bit and then in this one this is kind of a straight shot and then this one is a little bit soft and that's all because there's some foliage between me and the bird and then here again we've got this stuff coming around here and that works out pretty good if this was tack sharp it might seem like it was blocking the bird so anyway if you want to learn more about bird photography pick up a copy of my book learn the art of bird photography it's the complete field guide for beginning and intermediate photographers and birders also on amazon you can pick up a copy of my book the bird photographer's guide to bosque de la pache and in another month i'll have a second guidebook out it will be a bird photographer's guide to san diego county so look for that in the
