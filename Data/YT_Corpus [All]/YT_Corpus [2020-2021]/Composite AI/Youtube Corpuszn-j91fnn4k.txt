 Hey guys! Welcome to this Blender tutorial. SO, in this tutorial I am going to show you how you can add this bloom effect in cycles. So first of, I am in EEVEE and I have these cool Lightsabres. So, in EEVEE we can add this cool bloom effect by turning on this bloom setting right here. But when I change my render engine from EEVEE to Cycles as you can see; we have no bloom effect here. So, we don’t have the setting for the bloom effect. So, we don’t have the options for all the filters like we had in EEVEE. So, how do we achieve the same effect in cycles. Okay, so you can use any model that you want, the only important thing is that it should have an emission shader. Okay so now that I have these lightsabres, I’ll just go into the compositing. Now, we have 2 nodes by default. We can’t see our render now so I’ll just quickly render my image. Okay, so now we can’t see our rendered image so for that I’ll just tap Shift+A on my keyboard and under the output section, we need a viewer node. I’ll connect the image output into the image input of the Viewer. Okay, so now we can see our render in the background. So, now for the glow I’ll just tap Shift+A on my keyboard and under the filters I’ll add a Glare Node and I’ll pop the Glare filter in between the output and the render Layer. And as you can see, we have some crazy glow in the background. I’ll also add the output of the glare into the input of the composite node. Now there are a couple of settings that are quite important. So, by default the glare mode is set to Streaks, so we don’t want that so what we need is a Fog glow. So, now we have that smooth Gaussian glow. So, in the quality set it to High. Now, these 3 settings are quite important. Okay so you can set the mix value to -0.8, that works for me. The threshold you can leave it at 1 and you can change this size to 9. So, that’s how easy it is  to add a Glow in Cycles.
