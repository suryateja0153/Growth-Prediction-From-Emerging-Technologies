 welcome to my YouTube channel this time we are going to give quality to this photo in a super fast and simple way this time we will not use Adobe Photoshop but we will use the application shown on the screen you can find this application totally free in the Play Store for Android and the App Store for iPhone and iPad with that said let's get started after downloading the application we open it and wait a few seconds for the application to load once the application loads this interface will appear where we will have different options we are going to select the enhance option and a tab will open where we can select the photo that we want to improve we simply select the photo we want and the application will show you the photo you selected let's zoom in on this photo to see that it has a very poor quality but this application thanks to artificial intelligence will restore it we confirm that this is the photo we want to restore and the application will start loading when the application starts to load you will get an advertisement that will last from 5 to 15 seconds this happens since the application being free must or an income from the advertising once the advertising ends we give it to close and see the process of the photo that we select here we will have this line that we can move to see before and after the photo we can see that the application has done an incredible job giving details in places that almost nothing could be seen we can zoom in on the image and see the incredible result that we obtained in such a short time to save the image we just have to go to the upper right of the application and select the download icon now we can also give a little more quality to this image we just have to repeat the same steps but with the image we just saved we performed all the steps we did previously and see how the photo got a little more definition again we can see the optimal result that this application gives us in a few seconds I recommend that you use it and leave me your opinion in the comments this has been all for today if you like this video don't forget to subscribe to this channel since that would help a lot to grow thank you very much for the support see you next time
