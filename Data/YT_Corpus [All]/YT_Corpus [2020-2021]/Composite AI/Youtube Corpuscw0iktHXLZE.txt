 for joining us today at the first ever virtual mbas uh we're incredibly excited to be talking about the brand new updates to the power platform in this session we're gonna be talking about how you can empower your organization to do more with the power platform my name is charles lamanna i'm cvp around powerapps power automate ai builder and i'm joined by arun ulag who's the cvp of power bi um before we dive into all the new exciting news and updates i first want to talk about why microsoft is so excited about the power platform as core it's because things are changing dramatically for enterprise application development bi and automation in the next five years there'll be more applications built than in the last 40 years over 500 million apps will be created the demand for mobile apps as part of this is growing five times faster than it can satisfy there's a huge and growing backlog of applications additionally even if companies want to hire more developers they can't do it 86 percent of organizations struggle to find technical talent to go create and solve these digital problems and of course 85 percent of organizations are struggling to analyze their unstructured data so just huge demand huge gaps and more important than ever to find ways to move quicker and empower new and different types of users to become developers and that's where low code comes in in the next four years gartner predicts 65 of all enterprise application development will move to low code and that's where power platform shines it's the single low code platform across all of microsoft for office 365 dynamics 365 azure as well as your standalone applications it includes four compelling incredibly strong individual products power bi for analyzing data power apps for creating web and mobile applications without having to write any code power automate for robotic process automation and digital process automation and power virtual agent the newest addition to go create chat bots all without having to write code host vms or manage infrastructure all this is powered by common components like the common data service ai builder and the data connectors to provide a single integrated solution to go solve enterprise application development needs in a very fast and rapid way whether it's professional developer it pro or citizen developer business user inside the company and we've been very fortunate to see incredible adoption over the last year 97 of the fortune 500 now uses the power platform to solve their business needs whether that's applications bi automation and more and beyond the fortune 500 which of course i care about what i'm super excited about is the amazing community that is flourishing around the power platform and i know a ton of you are listening to the call today and i really thank you for your time but there's over 1.6 million active monthly community members we have hundreds of independent user groups around the globe if you go to a major city there's almost certainly a power platform user group there there's a huge number of conference attendees thousands upon thousands and now with the brand new virtual conference format tens of thousands and i'm sure we'll break a hundred thousand in no time and of course we have the additional power platform champions and fire starters who are the particularly active community members who are really keen to go going helping our customers and our users adopt and learn more about the power platform and if you aren't already involved in the community and you're watching today please check it out it's available online right inside of all the products it's a great way to go learn more give back and find a set of people that can help you move faster and for that community and based on the great feedback from that community and our customers we have a ton of amazing announcements today at mbas we have the mixed reality capabilities inside of powerapps which you saw in james keynote already we have robotic process automation so you can easily digitize and automate those legacy applications which don't have apis and can only be consumed and leveraged through windows ui automation we also have power virtual agent and a whole host of new chat bot capabilities but my two favorite new additions at mbas is the common data service now supports direct query inside of power bi so you can get real-time views and without having to worry about refresh or security and you can now use t-sql therefore sql server management studio any framework and so on to connect to the common data service and write queries and i'll dig into some of these and show in a demo but a lot of big announcements and enhancements today talking about the t-sql endpoint um you can see that all the sql tooling that you already know and love will just work as a result of this new feature you can open up sql server management studio to walk uh the uml you can go look at the tables the columns uh you can also go write very complex queries all using the tools you already know and love and what's great is it's not like you're connecting directly to the database underneath the common data service you're connecting to the common data service so authentication authorization plugins rules all that advanced capability that you want in the common data service is readily available to you right inside of those sql tooling you already know and love and this is the foundation for tons of other new updates that we announced today like the power bi direct query capability this is the same endpoint that behind the scenes power bi is using so you can now get real time updates real-time views real-time slicing reporting and so on inside of power bi desktop as well as reports and dashboards on that common data service data that means security just works because it's still running through cds and supports sso which means that all your filtering all of your trimming all of your field level security it just works inside the report gone are the days for dynamics 365 customers or powerapps customers where you have to go export all your data to a warehouse and then do security trimming on top of it you can just go directly to cds and behind the scenes we have all kinds of great technology like creating read replicas and so on so that you can build these reports without having to worry about taking down your transactional system and it's not just the reporting but also the understanding of the cds data inside of power bi relationships the way guides are represented option sets they're all simplified so you can very easily build reports and dashboards on top of all your common data service data without having to worry about recreating all the logic you already know when you say use cds inside of powerapps or dynamics 365. we think this is going to be a game changer and i'd say if we were in person i would hope that we get a little bit of a standing ovation right now but i'll i'll just uh do it alone in my living room so another great update is the rpa capabilities about a month ago we announced that all the robotic process automation functionality is now generally available inside a power automate that means you have a ui flows connector which is just like any other connector inside of power automate it also means that you can record mouse inputs keyboard inputs and a bunch of other capabilities when you do the recording functionality for ui flows allowing you to go interact with legacy applications across the board and all this is packaged up in an enterprise-ready solution so you can easily monitor and debug issues as they arise and after the fact and and one of my the neatest features about this is you can now actually get a gift for a little video whenever your ui automation fails after the fact so if you have a hundred vms running unattended bots you can very easily find the needle in the haystack and why a particular fl run failed using this brand new debugging capability and this is a really great capability inside the platform for powerapps we also had a whole bunch of new updates um it's the mixed reality one which we've demoed already today with ikea makes it possible to visualize 3d assets from a mobile or tablet device this is the beginning of really bridging the gap between the physical and the digital world making it possible so that you can start to interact and track in real time and in real space uh things out there and it's just the beginning and a whole bunch more improvements planned for mixed reality the rest of the year additionally as i'm sure everybody is realizing these days given the work from home situation people are spending a lot of time inside of teams a lot of remote work is happening right now for power apps we have a brand new responsive template as well as deeper teams integration so you can more easily create power apps that run inside the team's mobile app or the team's desktop app this makes it incredibly easy to leverage all of your great assets that you've created with powerapps with the connectors with the common data service where your users and employees are today additionally another great capability which is we finally brought together canvas and model driven applications inside the single powerapps player so you can now launch either type of application and use either set of capabilities in a single player um and i know this has been a very long-standing request from our customers so very excited to have this available uh today and if you look at power virtual agents on the last one we're going to look at before we dive into the demo we have a great chat bot capability which we announced last december and have a bunch of new improvements to more easily reference power automate and other steps we also have continued to extend and improve the different channels available inside of power virtual agents so it's now possible to integrate with users or employees in whatever form they prefer making it possible to have your bots reach more and more users uh and lastly power virtual agent also has great support so you can now connect to all of our data connectors over 350 of them to not only expose information in your chat bot but also take action and this is important because we always talk about analyze act automate as the three a's for power platform this allows you to act in response to user and customer information and not just expose information which is a really important part to really transforming the process so i know that was a lightning bolt of information but uh we're trying to get through in just 30 minutes we have so much good news and a bunch more sessions for you today and one of my favorite ways to show a lot of this of course is in a demo so if i'll switch over to the browser real quick um i'm inside powerapp studio to just kind of set the stage um gsk is a big power platform customer and user and they have a mobile application called zero accident promotion or zap which is all about focused on tracking hazards in the workplace as well as reporting and tracking fixes for those hazards this is a mobile application um that is running inside powerapp studio um that's why it has the boxing around the left and right you can see i can easily drill through and i get that rich map control that we announced at the vle a month ago as well as all the different zaps available near me and where i am physically and this is great for a worldwide company like gsk which is really focused on driving serenized processes across the entire company and if i say go drill into one of these zaps we can see that there's a bunch of information that loads about what the hazard is i can go click through and i can actually assess in a very structured way this the risk score and this is great because it makes it easy for all the frontline and first line workers to have a single view of what it would take to actually uh basically if it's a big hazard or something that requires immediate attention because you can see as i click click through here the risk for updates and at gsk one of the great cultural elements they have is if you see something do something if you see a hazard do something about the hazards so you can also record the actions that you've done to go try to mitigate that particular hazard and all of this is now tracked inside of an incredibly powerful power app connecting to all the different data sources that gsk already has on their back end and for example if i want to go drop on that map control just to show how easy that is you can just drag and drop and you get a map control right away and you can bind all the data sources that you already are used to inside of powerapps and it just refreshes in real time no rebuild no republish no recompile makes it very easy to build incredibly powerful data connected applications inside of the power platform and what's great about this example though is like any digital transformation it's not always that easy in some parts of the business they don't have mobile apps and for them they still use a form like this pen and paper which gets scanned and faxed and data entry and in these cases where it's pen and paper how do you marry that that paper with the mobile application is where you can start to use some of the ai capabilities in the power platform so here i'm inside of ai builder now and i have a model around forms processing which allows me through machine teaching where i upload a few example forms to train it i can build a model which will detect fields in this digital paper so say if i go upload this example and what this is doing is it's going to go understand the format of the digital pdf and this will allow it to extract key value pairs and understand the relationship between fields it is a lot more advanced than what you would see in ocr and we're just about to announce brand new supervised learning capabilities here as well so if we look here we can see that it knows that this is the observer's name alibelu we can know their function we can know what happened and you can even see that as understanding that risk score the severity and the likelihood and the risk of computes it can do all of this automatically and even go across multiple pages and understand tables all just through ai without having to write any python or know anything about data science for all these forms that are under that are out there and of course the model is only one piece we have to act on that model and that's where power automate comes in we can see here inside the power automate designer i have created a flow that will run whenever a new scanned document one of these things arrives in an inbox and whenever one of those documents arrives i want to do a prediction using ai builder and i'm going to use that model that i just was testing and showing on the left screen and what this does is it extracts all of the information from that form so i can very easily know what happened what the risk scores things like that and it stores it in a sql database it turns out that sql database i'm using right here is the same sql database that i'm using inside of powerapps that's what's right over here inside the data connector side we can see all the instances of sql server so i'm able to go bring from paper over email with ai insert in the sql database and empower frontline workers to basically have a an experience on the go to record these issues and these hazards so really easy way to gradually transform parts of the process but it doesn't stop there at gsk if it's particularly risky in a particularly high hazard then they want to go run a process where they input the information into a legacy application and for that legacy application there is no api for that case whenever a zap is created with a score above eight they're going to have a trigger inside of power automate they want to go run a ui flow and what the ui flow is doing is it's taking the data from that sql database and entering it into that legacy application so if i click through here we can see where i've already recorded the ui flow beforehand and we can see it actually has screenshots of all the ui automations i've done the mouse clicks the keyboard inputs and it flows the parameters from that sql database all the way into that application and what's great is this whole experience is very easy to build i just drag and drop and build one of these ui automations without having to be a deep rpa expert is the same low code experience that's accessible to pro devs it pros and citizen developers like the rest of the power platform and that's just maybe not the only part of it there's another piece to it which is maybe some of the users don't have don't like using an app maybe they want a conversational experience so gsk can also use power virtual agents um to integrate with teams so that users can walk up and actually um have a very conversational experience where they can ask about zaps that are near them or assigned to them or they need to go action on uh and this zap bot will actually go connect um to the back end using the same sql database it's all that one data store no copying or anything like that and you can even start to take actions right inside of teams using adaptive cards to escalate reassign or resolve issues all without having to be dropping into a different experience and the way that's built is in power virtual agents i'm not inside the power virtual agent designer we've got them going across all the parts of the power platform and we can see on the right hand side of my screen there's a very simple visual design surface to build these chat bots the same way you build something in power automate power bi or power apps you can do it inside of power virtual agents and you can see right here there's even individual steps where you can go call out to power automate to run workflows in the background and on the left hand side um you can see that there's something called tracing which allows me to debug in real time my chatbot and this makes it very easy to keep improving iteratively and making the thing better and better over time you can see how it triggered here and this kind of is consistent with what you see across all the power platform there's no build there's no publish there's no compile whether it's power bi desktop power app studio power automate or power virtual agent it's always highly interactive and that's key to going so quickly and if i go over here uh the power bi the kind of the the p the the capstone of the entire project is now that all this information is tracked inside of sql from the digital paper that comes in email with ai builder from the powerapp that's out there as a mobile experience from people who are taking actions through teams all that comes together to feed into a sql database which i can now build an incredibly amazing uh dashboard to understand what the major hazards are of course this isn't real data from gsk but i can go look and see hey at this particular location the number one hazard is trip false and i can go through the different sites and physical locations to actually make determinations about procedural changes or management changes that maybe i need to do to go improve safety which is so important to gsk and their workforce so this ability to go get insights and intelligence on top of all the data you gather is only possible because gsk is digitized all different parts of that business process and now if i zoom in here this actually is a power app down here as well so it i can do an analysis and then go take action through powerapps so again i know that was a very rapid whirlwind tour of all of it uh all the different pieces of power platform but the one last thing i i'd call it the bonus demo is i want to show the t sql endpoint and this is not related to gsk this is just an example of using it on top of the emergency response application that we built we can see that i'm connected up here in the upper left to a common data service instance and underneath tables in sql server management studio this is the same one you used to connect to sql for the last 20 years i can see all of the of the entities are tables and even all of the columns mapped to the fields stored inside the common data service and things like relationships and primary keys are tracked and what's great is i can write simple queries like this uh which will go pull back uh let me just refresh my token um while i was waiting and timed out um but basically refresh my login um and basically what this will allow me to do is i can very easily run a query which will or maybe i won't um let's see one second that's the the danger of i guess setting it up beforehand so that's also how you know it's real um let's see okay all right well that's what it is what it is um the the just to save some time the one other thing i would show real quick is inside a power bi desktop uh we have the ability to also use a brand new t-sql endpoint uh to do uh direct queries so in this case i can have an entire power bi report which can go look at all the data and relationships to very easily know all the different fields and basically data inside of the common data service to build a real-time highly immersive experience on top of the common data service so with that um i'm going to go kick it over to arun to finish off the session where a room will go deep on power bi as well as some of the other cross power platform improvements all right thanks so much i'm really excited to talk to you about where we are with power bi and where we're going the areas of investment we have a ton of exciting announcements to make today i will come cover some of these in my session right now and we'll cover more of them in the power bi sessions later ever since we started off with power bi little uh almost five years ago uh we've been pretty much talking about just one thing how we help our customers drive a data culture for everyone associated with the organization their employees their customers their suppliers and even their citizens what i'm going to talk about today is a major areas of investment that we're putting in to help our customers drive our data culture the first is really amazing data exploration experiences and this is really the beating heart of power bi so here we're focused on two areas the first is to make power bi really simple to use by building on many of the experiences that billions of users around the world are already familiar with an office so we're taking a lot of cues from excel from powerpoint so that when you use power bi for the first time it feels instantly familiar and you're already at home the second is just like charles uh showed off in the app section uh we're leveraging a lot of the ai capabilities that microsoft has been investing in but creating business user and business outcome focused experiences that really help you get insights from data because we know that there's a lot of data out there and a lot of the data is unstructured data which is often harder to work with so in this area we have a bunch of exciting announcements today the first is visual personalization so what this does uh is that it helps an end user completely personalize the visual to exactly the way they want to see it so an end user can go ahead and change the visualization type they can change a dimension they can change a legend and what's really cool is power bi maintains the connection between this personalized view of the end user back to the you know the original report on the original data model so that even as the data model evolves as the data set evolves uh the report is still fresh and it's completely up to date so you get the best of both worlds the second area is we know that a lot of our customers really use our mobile experiences it's very very widely used very widely deployed so we're creating a brand new capability that helps you create amazing mobile experiences directly within power bi desktop and get that to end users so that's good that's available today as well the third idea i wanted to call out is just provide a sneak preview uh of something that's coming later this uh calendar year so we call the smart narratives it's the ability for power bi to automatically summarize all the data on the page to create a textual description of what's going on so a business user can simply read the text and understand exactly what's what's happening with the data what's really cool about this is as the user slices and dices the data because we know that power bi is a highly interactive experience this uh this explanation the smart narrative continuously updates itself to provide the view for that particular product or state or any other dimension that is sliced in real time very excited about our capabilities here the second year of investment for us is to help our large enterprise customers scale power bi to meet the most demanding enterprise bi needs and this has been an incredible journey for us because you know customers are deploying power bi not just to tens or hundreds of users but thousands tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of users so capabilities in power bi that help it or bi centers of excellence manage power bi scale deploy power b at scale have the single source of truth and power via are really really important things like enterprise grade semantic models where you can build you know very complex semantic models with hundreds of tables complex relationships and even thousands of calculations and kpis that can be used around the company not just in power bi but also in excel or with any other bi tool because we support the industry standard xmla protocol pixel perfect paginated reporting so the reports that show up in your mailbox in the morning can just be sent to the printer and it works exactly as you've designed it or even real-time analytics we have a bunch of exciting capabilities here as well to announce today the first is we're bringing full application lifecycle management to power bi so this is uh going to be available in public preview this month what it does is it allows you to take a power bi application and move that from dev to test to production it allows you to understand what's changed from one stage to the other promote it when you're ready and even understand the impact of some of these changes before you make those changes and notify downstream users that these changes are coming and the second area is lineage and impact analysis we know that customers bring over 45 petabytes of data to power bi every single month both from cloud and on-premise data sources with lineage and impact analysis which is becoming generally available this month uh what it allows power bi to do is trace where the data comes from whether it's on premise or uh or from the cloud you know which gateways it flows through which you know data flows which reports and dashboards so you get an end-to-end data view of how your data flows throughout the organization it also helps you understand the impact of potential changes before you make them and the third area where we're going to provide some really exciting capabilities is around enterprise semantic models we already shipped xmla read which allows power bi data sets to be reused across many bi tools and excel as well we are adding we just added xmla right so you can use all your professional tooling that you use with analysis services directly against power bi premium and the capability that i'm very very excited to announce is composite models so this has been the number one ask of our bi customers for a couple of years we've been working on it for a long time what this allows our customers to do is allows it to publish a central uh semantic model and it allows any business user to be able to tailor that business model by bringing in local data or tweaking a measure or adding a new measure so you really get the best of both worlds you get the central source of truth with it but you get the flexibility for business to be able to tailor it to their unique needs the third area we're investing in is really to take a lot of our bi capabilities and weave it deeply into the fabric of the organization so that means that we have a strong foundation of trust with openness compliance and data protection we're working with power bi and the azure data stack so it's deeply integrated third is as charles talked about we're working across the power platform to move from insight to action to automation and then lastly we're working closely with our friends in office to be able to infuse power bi across all of your collaboration experience in office 365. a few exciting announcements here as well the first is we've completely revamped our power bi experience teams so teams has become really really important especially today when most of us are working from home power bi in teams now allows you to have a very very seamless experience with all of your power bi assets you can begin a power bi conversation a team's conversation directly from power bi and you can also take actions in power bi directly from within teams using the new adaptive parts capability the second is we are doing a lot of work with azure synapse analytics as you know azure synapse analytics is the next generation of azure sql data warehouse it allows customers to bring in data to put in the data warehouse to build machine learning models and visualize and analyze the data all in a single integrated development environment we do we're going to provide a sneak preview of a major capability that will ship later this year which is called usage based optimization where power bi and synapse work together hand in hand to analyze the query patterns of the users using power bi and automatically build materialized views in synapse so that it continuously optimizes for performance so between power via and synapse they work hand in hand uh to learn from end user query perform queries and continuously fine-tune the system the third area and my personal favorite is the work we're doing with excel we know every power bi user is also an excel user um so here we're doing two things one is we're bringing power bi certified and promoted data sets or shared data sets directly natively to excel so you can discover them build your pivot tables all without knowing where the data set lives or having to have a connection string and the second is we're actually allowing excel to recognize data types that are in excel that are bound to power bi data sets um so this is going to be really really exciting it's also coming later this calendar year uh i want to switch gears and talk about a few areas where we're investing across the power platform the first is in a connectivity stack we have over 300 connectors that connect to a wide range of data sources on premises or in the cloud it allows you to work with data wherever it is it allows you to respect the security model uh this really makes it possible for you to work with any system you have your erp system your crm system without making any changes and seamlessly extended with the power platform the second area for us is that we're testing jointly with the azure team so you can drop from the low code experience than power vi or power apps support automate uh into a full uh development experience with vs code so you can extend power bi with azure machine learning or azure analysis services you can extend power apps with azure functions you can you know go from power automate to logic apps this really gives you the ability to have a single platform where you can go from local to full code and really have a seamless uh no clips extensibility experience and the third area is that we know customers are deploying uh power platform solutions at scale we're investing deeply in data protection as well as security and governance to make it possible for you to manage our systems end-to-end and we know that across the power platform we're making a number of other investments that make it really easy for you to build manage and deploy these solutions at scale we're not just focusing on the big ticket items we've also focused on the smaller ones um so all of these features that you ask us for on ideas sites we deliver capabilities across the power platform so that it makes your everyday experience so much easier so thank you so much for joining us at the microsoft business application summit uh there are many exciting sessions to be uh for you to attend today i encourage you to go join them thanks again i hope you have a great embassy
