 [Music] talking about work that's being done on thinking about misallocation of resources and and its implications for aggregate productivity so since i work heavily in this area i wanted to like pass on some things i think we've learned and some big open questions that there's room to work on so let me start by saying you know one thing i've encountered in teaching is people like what exactly is misallocation and i don't think there's a standard definition so i'll just offer one here and it's basically saying imagine that the government could feasibly implement taxes on some firms activities workers it could be an activity like r d or could be certain types of firms or certain types of plans it could implement taxes on one in subsidies and others to induce a reallocation of inputs like capital and labor across some firms or activities and others if in doing so that would raise um i decided to say raise welfare and then the question is who's welfare so let's say a representative agent so a fictional representative agent so some of this is just like all of what economics is about um which is the efficiency of allocation of resources um you could say a lot of economics though is taking into account heterogeneity and uh and welfare outcomes too so that's not quite fair but the reason i want to emphasize this first of all it's very broad but the reason i want to emphasize this is because occasionally some people will talk about misallocation in response to things like information asymmetries or um or things like transportation costs but so if the government could not implement something based on what what it observes information or for example it can't reduce transportation costs then the fact that there's a high rate of return to one activity somewhere relative to another place isn't misallocation if you can't really feasibly move those resources from the low marginal product to the high marginal product activity anyway so i want to get that definition out there the aim is for things that a government could do or could cease to do that it's currently doing um that could increase something like welfare in an aggregate sense if there's misallocation if if the government leaves something on the table where it could improve things okay so to fix concepts i'm just trying to boil it down to the simplest possible model so this is going to be a static model with just like ces aggregation of different products so the y i's or different products there's a fixed number of products m that's part of keeping it simple there's an elasticity of substitution sigma that's greater than one so that's the ces aggregate and picture these individual firms or products are just linear production and labor so labor is the only factor of production here and then picture a firm is just maximizing static profits which to it's going to take wages as given it's going to take an aggregate price index is given it's going to take this this tax that it faced think of it as tax just for the moment here think of it facing a revenue tax and it's going to take these big objects like the wage the aggregate output and the price is given and it's going to choose its only choice variable this price to maximize these net of tax profits and picture just to keep things simple um there's just labor is the only resource like i said and it's allocated across these different products or firms or plants or what have you or farms for that matter and the and exogenously fixed total labor and exogenously fixed number of varieties so the only resource decision here the only allocation decision is how do you allocate these allies okay so now one thing thought you might have is what the heck are these taxes why are you talking about them why are they eye specific that's what a lot of what i'll talking about in this concept portion is about is like what could generate dispersion in what what's like a tax rate across across firms um so if you look at the firm's first order condition for setting its profit maximizing price it sets its price as a markup above its marginal cost and the marginal cost is just the wage relative to its efficiency so this ai here is like a process efficiency variable so um so it would normally set it equal to a markup above that because everybody faces the same elasticity of demand the markup would be the same for everybody but because of this revenue tax that's like an additional source of marking up their cost so one thing to point out right away is that markup dispersion would show up as a tau i here and then you can ask if you try to measure productivity differences across firms the kind of traditional way to do it is to look at something like revenue of the firm divided by some measure of its inputs so here in this model let's call that this is a terminology coined by foster haltwenger and siverson is to to distinguish tfpr so not tfp not total factor productivity but revenue total revenue tfp to emphasize the fact that you've got revenue here not some real output measure in this numerator what's fascinating here is that this revenue productivity does not reflect efficiency underlying process efficiency at all in this simple model instead it affects entirely these tax rate wedges or these markup dispersion for example um and so that's doesn't reflect efficiency at all so i'll return to that in a little bit but just to keep emphasizing the misallocation thing in this simple economy then we would say you know there's a representative consumer with these preferences here um and then what they all they care about is getting a lot of output for their fixed labor endowment that they collectively provide to the economy and this is the expression for aggregate tfp in this economy and the socially optimal thing to do is to set all these tau eyes to some common level and actually the common level in this static model doesn't matter so um efficient thing is to allocate more labor to the high ai firms not all of it the max ai firm shouldn't get all the resources in the economy because of these diminishing returns because this exponent if we go back to the original production function sigma is greater than one so this exponent is less than one so there's diminishing marginal utility to any particular product so the social planner wants to allocate more l to the high ai firms but not all of it there's an optimal allocation okay the optimal allocation has an elasticity of labor with respect to ai of sigma minus one and that's what produces this uh aggregate tfp that doesn't involve labor but endogenously builds in this optimal allocation so relative this optimal allocation these cows are like sand in the gears that they're mucking up the market's efficient allocation of resources and you can't stare at this and see it very transparently so i like to use the log normal case imagine that a's these deficiency levels and these you could call markups you could call them idiosyncratic taxes and subsidies if they were distributed log normally across firms with certain means and and variances then aggregate log of aggregate tfp could be expressed as the mean of these of the log of these productivities they draw there'd be a positive term because dispersion sigma squared a dispersion in these a dies is good because the planner can allocate more labor to the high ai firms so they kind of like dispersion mean preserving the spread and productivities to the extent that sigma is greater than one and they can take advantage of that but here's the misallocation term over here this is this sand in the gears this this this variation in these tiles like variation in markups or taxes is misallocating resources and you can see it's doing that it's subtracting from aggregate tfp the more this variance and the higher sigma because when sigma is high uh labor is responding more elastically to these dispar um tax rate wedges or markup wedges and and misallocating labor more so so this is just a nice expression to see what the fundamental forces are behind that so there's one there's two other things here notice the mean of tau doesn't matter in this static economy that that doesn't affect uh anything um and the other thing that's kind of surprising is that um what's the what's the covariance of these things it turns out the covariance doesn't matter at all between tau and a but that's a special property of log normal so i don't want to emphasize that too much okay so what are some lessons we get from this model if you call these tiles wedges one is what i already said which is if you measure revenue productivity keep in mind that isn't the same as process efficiency that could instead be a distortion that you don't like rather than efficiency which you do like they could have prac and practice be correlated i'm going to argue later that there's some evidence they are very positively correlated um but that's one key conceptual thing to keep in mind that those are not the same thing aggregate tfp is decreasing in the dispersion of these wedges that's misallocation and if you just look at it this way you can imagine a data set where you had a measure of this variance and you had an estimate of this elasticity and you could get like an aggregate productivity loss and when i show you some data i'm going to argue this number can be quite big so it could be easily you know output is half what it could be if you had an efficient allocation of resources at least if you take the data on the cfpr dispersion at face value okay so that's a lesson um i already mentioned the mean wedge point or you mentioned the dispersion so let me move on okay so more on tfpq how do you get it if you have revenue data well if you knew this elasticity of demand you can actually back out it's like saying if i knew where i am and the demand curve and i knew the slope of the demand curve i can kind of back out the price and thereby back out the effective price and therefore back out effective output but it's important to keep in mind that this output here is not just quantity but any thing affecting effective demand so that matters because then if you construct tfpq as some measure of backed out output relative to inputs it's not just process efficiency you also have quality and variety and i emphasize this because one of the things the literatures i think sometimes really clear on and sometimes could be clear on is that they'll sometimes say well we don't have physical quantities so we can't construct tfbq but tfpq if you think about it this already has some measure of quantity quality wrapped up in it when you calculate it this way if you did have a data set with physical quantity measures then you can measure physical quantity relative to inputs um but that although interesting isn't interesting entirely on its own like who cares how many units of something a firm can produce if those units are lousy if nobody likes those units if their quality is something that's not appealing at all so the composite of this is arguably more meaningful than some measure of physical quantity per per output so but you can back out quality and variety separately from process efficiency by taking the ratio of those so that's just a constructive thing you can do with the data if you don't have unit prices you can just back out something proportional to output this way get this broad measure of tfbq if you do have physical quantities on top of that then you can back out process efficiency and something about effective quality uh separately which can be useful okay um i took the simplest possible model but there's a lot of different directions you could go that people have already gone to that are easy to generalize this you can add inputs like physical capital intermediates you can put wedges not just you know on on revenue but on all the inputs um you can think about overhead costs and entry costs and people have done that um there's harder things to to generalize because they involve dynamic decisions or or more non-linearities so things like um financial frictions that you know that are a function of you know obviously involve capital so dynamic decision there adjustment costs to varying things like the capital stock the people pursued that you can also think about you know the ces uh with monopolistic competition is special leads to constant markups but if you have things like a variable elasticity of substitution or for that matter non-monopolistic competition you can get dispersion in markups so i'll return to that issue even though i've touched on it that markup dispersion can be a source of misallocation there's some really nice work like this recent paper by bakay and farhy that generalizes to an arbitrary input output structure and even different returns to scale which is really nice and useful and then you can think about well the tfpq might be endogenously a function of these wedges firms face like their markup behavior that induces firms to innovate but the dispersion in it could be a good or bad thing for how it affects the allocation of research and innovation for example or for that matter the quality of firms when they enter okay so one thing to that i touched on i want to reinforce here is what is not misallocation well if there's tfpr dispersion due to measurement error i wouldn't call that misallocation that's just bad data if there's a unavoidable adjustment cost and transportation cost that's not misallocation either if there's things like a high rate of return to one type of capital or one firm's investments but that's because it has high systematic risk then that's not necessarily misallocation either so the the planner doesn't want perfect equalization of these um tfpr levels because of things like obviously measurement error but also adjustment cost transportation cost differential risk you can also think this is something where a lot of people have worked on this already this is actually a rather unexploited area which is a lot of dispersion in the value of the marginal product of labor across firms or occupations could reflect amenities and disamenities so what might look like misallocation might be an efficient response to these these amenities and of course one of the key things is as soon as you write down you know a production function you're taking a stand on backing out the the wedges so any mistake you make there is going to flow into your wedge implied misallocation so that could be a source for example if you said hey everybody's got the same production function so any differences in capital labor ratios are inefficient in misallocation that's clearly vulnerable uh or susceptible to wait a minute maybe the firms just have different production technology so some have much higher capital labor ratios but there's nothing inefficient about that okay so the kind of things that you know what are these wedges what kind of things do people think are out there and have been trying to measure them directly well there are tax rate differences and subsidies um so for example tax rate differences across u.s states but also across different size of firms often the bigger firms have higher tax rates in smaller firms certainly than informal firms um and you have things in the u.s like you know contrary to the pollution example where we should be probably taxing uh carbon polluters instead we have things like especially low tax rates and tax breaks for oil and gas firms a lot of countries have size dependent regulations meaning there's things like firing restrictions on bigger firms so that would lead them to not hire not fire in a way that might generate dispersion in the value of marginal product labor and generate some misallocation so but but one thing i want to emphasize is that these are like government failures potentially they could be internalizing market failures so they might not be but they could be government failures but you can have a lot of private market failures too so um there's things like financial frictions and and efficiency wages but there's growing interest in markup dispersion but also in uh dispersion and monopsony power of firms that might lead to uh misallocation of labor so in the same way that the that a high markup price markup firm you know it's like a monopolist that's raising their price and reducing their output they don't have enough output enough inputs relative to what the planner wants the same thing is true if you have a firm with a lot of monopsony power they can see that they can if they want more workers they have to pay more wages because they're such a big player so that means they're facing a high marginal cost of labor compared to their wage so they employ too few workers so firms with a lot of market power even in the output side or in the input side are generally too small and that's leading to misallocation okay discrimination is a potential source of misallocation you can picture it in the labor market but in many other markets already touched on financial frictions you can picture state-owned banks giving preferential loans to uh state-owned firms or maybe politically connected firms people documented that in various places um you can think of this is an example of a market failure you can think of information frictions leading to efficiency wages and the government conceivably improve on that if it knows some industries have big efficiency wages relative to others then the implication is that they're not employing enough workers and they should be subsidized um i think i'll skip now because i want to make sure i have enough time at the end for some questions before i go from one of my topics to another to the misallocation concepts misallocation facts um this one i was going to emphasize misallocation of talent the misallocation even though my examples have been very focused on a firm or a product or a plant you can think about like allocation of workers across occupations i think i'll leave this for chad because chad's going to talk about this a little bit but suffice it to say there's been big changes in the allocation of say white men white women black men black women across high skilled occupations that arguably reflects declining discrimination but there's a lot of misallocation in the fact that these fractions weren't equal because the distributions of talent were equal across the are always been equal across these groups so any difference here is reflecting misallocation there's still some but there's less but that's an example of a different type of misallocation that could exist and could still exist uh the united states and elsewhere in a way that that's leading to too little output too little innovation relative to what you would get in a efficient allocation okay um these are just kind of generalizations to multiple inputs so i think i'm going to stop there and make sure i have some time to get some reactions and comments from from you all you
