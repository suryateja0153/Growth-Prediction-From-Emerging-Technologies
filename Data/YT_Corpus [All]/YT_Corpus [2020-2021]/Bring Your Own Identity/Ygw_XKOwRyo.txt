 [Music] so hello and welcome to NPTEL course entitled introduction to cultural a series where we start with the new text today and the text it will start today is entitled questions of cultural identity by Stuart Hall I mean it's edited by Stuart Hall and Paul decay since through at Hall is only really seminal figures along with dick hemp ditch for any course on cultural studies so it's imperative that we look at through-holes idea of culture his theorization of culture cultural identity agency etc in order to have a better grip a better understanding of this particular course or a course like this now we have really had a series of introductory lectures at the beginning of the schools towards the beginning of this course but I think is important for us to revisit that kind of a stone so for instance we just covered the cabbages texts on cultural cities so in this particular lecture and a couple lectures from this point we look at will so rehearse some of the things which we have already covered by drawing on Stuart Hall's writings on cultural identity especially in relation to this particular course the way we have design discourse now what we'll do in this lecture and Alexis will come is we'll look at the introduction to this book written by holes so if you look at this book it's a really rich book it's got no writings by some of the key tankers and cultural studies so for instance the school writings by Sigmund Bellman's I'm just putting up the content page for you to see it's got writings by zip involvement Hall himself who needs identity this is a this is a essay that we will cover then it's got a writing it's got essay by homi Bhabha called cultures in between then bellman of course Marilyn Stratton Kevin Robbins you know Lawrence Krauss big salmon fruit necklace rose Paul D guy and James Donnell so some very big names and culture studies some some of the really important philosophers and theorists of culture feeds from this particular book so we'll start with the introduction D D the first s in our introduction the first essay in the smoke work Mahal himself and that is the question of identity so what is identity and how was identity important and culture cities and how his identity sort of formulated and how made that be examined that formulation may be examined in culture studies so identity of course as we know was a very complex storm it sort of factors in many many components of factors and psychological components political components linguistic components a logical components religious components so it's one of those terms like culture which is an isometric entanglement of different attributes sometimes very complex sometimes often seemingly ContentID three attributes so identity becomes a very important issue in culture studies now what hall does in this particular essay and the reason why we have selected it it brings in a range of perspectives and brings in psychology so uses Freud quite extensively he uses Foucault from perspective of historical studies so history psychology phenomenology you know culture studies there's always a certain mesh together in a more complex understanding of identity as theorized by home so this began with his essay I'm gonna do it line by line and then we'll look at certain selected sections especially the sessions on and Freud and then he ends with a very important study of no Jared potluck so it'll be important or be interesting for us because we have already covered Butler for this particular course but it'll be important for us to go back and so look at Butler from a different perspective so we have already seen we have already looked at Butler re-examined Butler when we saw study and hiking's the social construction of what that would be this would be a similar kind of study okay so this is what whole say is about identity and he talks about the entire sort of identity industry that has emerged and last two decades so different kinds of ways of looking at identity how identity becomes there a complex phenomenon political social linguistic religious you know a pissed to make phenomenon so you know how these things this phenomena come together in our understanding of identity in recent years okay so this is the the essay will dive right into it and look at it from very closely and study it in details hopefully this is Hall Stuart Hall looking at identity there has been a very table discursive explosion in recent years around the concept of identity at the same time at the same moment as it has been subjected to a search in critique it's a very important phrase discursive explosion so an explosion of discourses different kinds of discourses which are all sort of which all aim to examine the question of identity the concept of identity now at the same time the question of identity has been subjected to our search in critique so don't the whole idea of identity is critiqued by different disciplines but different perspectives from different perspectives where at the same time the question of identity has had a discursive explosion an explosion of different discourses which are also invested in understanding of identity so there is this investment discursive investment as well as a critique so that will go hand in hand and this is what whole situations in a very beginning of this essay this is a paradox at the same time he looks at as some kind of a tautology as well so it's paradox as well as something which is a natural extension how is this paradoxical development to be explained and what where does it leave us with respect to the concept the deconstruction has been conducted within a variety of disciplinary areas all of them in one way or another critical of the notion of an integral originally and unified identity so as I mentioned whole draws on a range of thinkers and writers so for Foucault to Butler Freud and then he also brings and Derrida quite a dressing rooms and Derrida appears quite a few times and as I say as a deconstructionist and how the to rid an idea of deconstruction may be fruitfully use you know instrumentalize and understanding of identity as examined by home the culture theorists so the whole idea of deconstruction as josé's has been invested in doing away with any integral original or unified understanding of identity so that unified integral understanding identity has been done away with in deconstructionist studies and history how is a plural understanding of identity which become pardon the critique of the subsys training subject at the center of post cartesian western metaphysics has been comprehensively advanced in philosophy so you know the entire idea of the cartesian subject as an autonomous thinking rational subject I think therefore I am so this autonomous rationality the self-contained self-sustaining subjectivity of the Cartesian understanding of the human self has been critiqued in recent times and in 20 of the rise of post-modernism etc so it is dominantly antique artisan as we know so that is a very common critique and on the unti ducati is an understanding of a subject so that's been something which has been doing the rounds in Western metaphysics Western philosophy for the past few decades so the question of subjectivity and his unconscious processes of formation has been developed within the discourse of psychoanalytically influence feminism and cultural criticism so already we began to get a range of so a sense of the range that Hall would employ in this particular essay so we have a psychoanalytically influence feminism cultural criticisms all these things come together of course deconstruction is a bit of up ironically is a bit of a meta-narrative which runs trawl this essay in is aimed to understand culture as a complex phenomenon the endlessly performative self has been advanced in celebratory variants of post-modernism within the anti essentialist critique of ethnic racial and national conceptions of cultural identity and the politics of location some adventurous theoretical conceptions have been sketched in the most grounded forms what then is a need for a further debate about identity who needs it so in a very short paragraph so as you can see whole gives us a very important understanding of identity from a postman turn his perspective his story sizes entire idea of deconstruction how this anti essentials critique which deconstruction and post-modernism have brought food have done things the question of identity so it so looks that identity is a non-essential is category etc so some of the some of the theoretical conceptions are described guys adventurous by home and quite performative as well so he said oh he concludes this opening paragraph by saying that animal is these are things which have been done by post-modernism and psychoanalytically influence feminism so what then is a need for a further debatable identity who needs this debate okay so whose is whose addressee of this particular essay according to home the two ways of responding to the question the first is to observe something distinctive about the deconstructive critique to which many of these essentialist concepts have been subjected and like those forms the critique which aimed to supplant inadequate concepts with true are ones who or which aspire to the production of positive knowledge the deconstructive approach puts key concepts under erasure so this is a section which is very important because it talks about the idea of deconstruction or the impact the deconstruction has had on cultural studies and it's important for us also because what Howell does it makes a very important distinction between deconstruction and destruction she talks about how our deconstruction puts things under erisa it takes away the semantics and Africans or certain things and then an open set up for pure possibilities or different semantic possibilities but it doesn't do away with that entirely so deconstruction is not liquidation deconstruction is actually reproduction to a certain extent it reproduces possibilities semantic possibilities you know ontological possibilities excetera so this indicates that they're no longer serviceable so you know a very superficial understanding of deconstruction would entail that and it does away with some categories and renders those unserviceable okay good to tank with in there originally and reconstructed an unreconstructed form but since they have not been superseded dialectically and there are no other entirely different concepts with which to replace them there was nothing to do but to company to think with them albeit now in the detour lies the deconstructed forms are no longer operating within the paradigm in which they are originally generated the line in the line which cancels them paradoxically permits them to go on being read and this is a beautiful expression of deconstruction and I know this is one of the key concepts which we need to keep in mind students of deconstruction and that is three constructions not destruction of meaning it's not liquidation of meaning but rather it's a you know it's a paradoxical permission of more meanings productive meanings so it paradoxically permits them to go on being read Derrida has described this approach as thinking and the limit as thinking in the interval a sort of double writing by means of this double and precisely stratified dislodge and dislodging writing we must also mark the interval between inversion which brings low what was high and the eruptive emergence of a new concept a concept that can no longer be and never could be included in the previous regime so deconstruction is essentially reconceptualization it and it confers more concepts it is just lodged and dislodging writing by the same time it's a it's a mode of writing as a mode of examination which examines the intervals intervals between versions which brings low what was high and the eruptive emergence of a new concept so it's oftentimes an act of innovation what is law is not becomes high so there's a carnivorous quality about deconstruction as well a concept that could never never no longer be and never could be included in a previous regime so the word regime is very important and that underlines the political significance of deconstruction so there's a regime of semantic possibilities a regime of semantic politics and you know the previous regime of semantic politics would not allow certain kinds of meanings but then deconstruction does weigh or dismantle so unsettles that regime the original the previous regime of signification and so it opens up more possibilities it opens up puerile possibilities it opens up newer concepts with which those sort logical categories can be examined identity is such a concept so identity emerges as a key concept and this kind of reading this kind of investigation identity is such a concept operating on the Eurasia in the integral between reversal and emergence an idea which cannot be thought in the old way but without with certain key questions cannot be thought at all so identity is one of those cons which I know kind of it's hot in the hallway you know it can go by can recover an old idea of identity but also the same time it cannot do away with a question of identity altogether so it's the liminal kind of ontological category it exists as well as you know not it doesn't exist right so a very important tool with which identity can examine Turkana - Holloway SP construction because deconstruction puts us under category on the erasure but at the same time that erasure is not a doing away with it so it's like it's like a word which appears on the screen and then you cut across it with the line so that word doesn't exist in a semantic field but at the same time it does exist as an ontological category so if I give you a word and cut a line across it you can still see the word you can still read the word so but then at the same time the word is not included in a semantic field right you understand what I'm meaning is still readable at the same time it doesn't appear in a semantic field so it's that it's not that so when the reader uses the under erasure category it it cuts across the concept deconstruction cuts across the concept but at same time it doesn't liquidate it completely it doesn't do I rate it completely it still died up as an illogical half presence and that half presence can then produce no meanings can produce more semantic possibilities so it inaugurates triggers new regimes are many new regimes of semantic possibilities which then become important which then become acceptable and different cultural conditions a second kind of answer requires us to note where in relation to what sort of problems does the irreducibility of the concept identity emerge I think the answer here lies in the centrality of the question of agency and politics by politics I mean both the significance in modern forms the political movement of a signifier identity is pivotal relationship to a politics of location but also the manifests difficulties and instabilities which have characteristically affected all contemporary forms of identity politics by agency I expressed no desire whatsoever to return to an unmediated transparent notion of the subject of identity as a centered author or social practice or to restore an approach which places its own point of view at the origin of all historicity and short leads to a transcendental consciousness I agree with Foucault that will work but will require is here is not a theory of the knowing subject but rather a theory of discursive practice however I believe well displease centering requires as evolution of Foucault swore clearly shows is not an abandonment or a bought abolition was subject but a rican sexual ization so does something that I just talked about they say you know what deconstruction should do or what critical practice should do is not an abandonment of a subject but a rican sexual ization of it and that's something which is very important ok thinking it in its new displays or dissented position within a paradigm it seems to me it seems to be in the attempt to RER tically the relationship between subjects and discursive practices that the question of identity records or rather if one prefers to stress the process of subjectification to discursive practices and the politics of exclusion which all such subject occasion of peers to entail the question of identification so what has been done in this paragraph as the movement away from our static understanding of identity is either living or dead under more dynamic understanding of identity as a process of identification so identification is an act of becoming under coming RIBA company so again we're looking at how Hall takes a draws and deconstruction and then gives an organic quality a dynamic quality to identity so it doesn't look at identity as an you know as a binary 0 or 1 and are either dead over life as a stating ontological being but it rather looks at identity as a process and as president piston a process as a process of appropriation as a liminal process so identification becomes the more important category of examination when it comes to identity so identity is not a stated category not as a dormant category not as an either of an aristocratic reign not as a living or dead category but identification as the process of becoming and also on becoming so that dynamism of deconstruction is so fused into the study of identity we're whole and that's something which is beautifully done as you can see the language is beautiful and also the the conceptual powders that hold us building up is just beautiful it's just so lovely the piston maker characters that is offering us and in terms of moving away from a rigid question of rigid identity into a more dynamic and plastic concept of identification which then becomes another key term for investigation so identification turns out to be one the least one of the least well understood concepts almost as tricky as though preferable to identity itself and certainly no guarantee against the conceptual difficulties which have beset the latter it is drawing meanings from both the discursive and his psychoanalytic repeat all without being limited to either so again he's drawing on psychoanalytic as well as discursive characters and repertory and not being limited to either but it's bringing in both fields so again we're looking at this very interesting entanglement of discursivity and sort of phenomenality the inside knee outside their disgust as an impetus outside with which you navigate and the phenomenal inwardness which is inside you know the way you navigate with the imagination with your thought processes etc so again the asymmetric entanglement of materiality and abstraction is something which has been highlighted Oh al so this semantic field is too complex to unravel here but it is useful at least establish as relevance to the task in hand indicate ibly in common sense language identification is constructed on the back of a recognition of some common origin or shared characteristics with another person or group or with an ideal and with the natural closure of solidarity and allergens established on his foundation in contrast with the naturalism of the stagnation the discursive approach sees identification as a construction so again as an activity and it's something that is highlighted by home identification as a construction as an act a process never completed it's always half complete oesn't liminal always excessive or inadequate always in process it is not that mind in the sense that it can always be won or lost sustained or abundant so again moving from the binary of winning or losing completing your non completing acquiring or abandoning etc so these dualistic a truism in dunno a way though not without as determinate determinate conditions of existence including the material and symbolic resources required to sustain it identification is in the end conditional launched and contingency once secured it does not obliterate difference the total merging it suggests is in fact a fantasy of incorporation so in the entire idea of merging of where the particular identity is a fantasy of incorporations where Freud comes in and holds analysis so the entirety of being at one with an identity is a Freud as a fantasy which is examined by Freud and his psychoanalytic study the Freud always polka fed in relation to consuming the other as we shall see in a moment identification is then a process of articulation a such ring as beautiful terms such rings like weaving in it's like a texture weaving and bringing in different kinds of textures and weaving and different things metonic lee in order to produce a certain kind of articulation and overdetermination not a sub sumption there is always too much or too little so identifications always an over probation or under appropriation is always an excessive appropriation or an inadequate appropriation but never a clinically complete appropriation an over determination or a lack but never a proper fit our totality so again we're looking at a trade non totalitarian way of looking at identity not as a totalizing category but as a performative category of articulation and we'll see in the course of this essay how representation becomes a very important category for home and inc so that's something keeps drawing on we're looking at identity and identification so how was representation tied ontologically as well as functionally were the question of identification like old signifying practices it is subject to the play or difference so again a very directly driven term has been used the way a difference which is to differ as where as a default so it is different as well as deferred it is delayed as well as different there is entire temporal and spatial or spatial temporal procrastination spatiotemporal you know appropriation is something which is highlighted by Holloway yeah it was different in terms of a no special appropriation it is also delayed in terms of temporal appropriation and hence the spatial temporal and quality difference is a spatial temporal quality especially important category it obeys the logic of more than one and since as a process that operates across difference it entails discursive work the binding and marking of symbolic boundaries the production of frontier effects it requires what is left outside its constitutive outside to consolidate the process so again the outside the powder is the external and internal that come together in terms of display or difference with which identification works and that's something that whole highlights quite clearly in this particular essay so as you can see the very opening of this essay is beautifully woven n so it's bringing different ranges different IDs from a range of disciplines psychoanalysis and race soon we'll move on to gender studies deconstruction is already a feature in the essay and this is a very beautiful example of our culture studies work and as I mentioned the very opening the hole is one of the founding figures of cultural studies along with analytic cabotage so as you can see how culture studies as a discipline is organically interdisciplinary so interdisciplinarity is a great organic quality it's a essential quality of vital quality in cultural studies as highlighted in this particular essay so as you can see you know DIF plays a very important role in terms of identification and identification entails articulation that sometimes overshoots the limits sometimes is you know falls short of the limit so it's always a misidentification that is a player yeah and this should remind us of the kind of colonial condition that talks that power talks about and the other question where the question of hybridity becomes very important because that too is the politics of identification this performative identification whereby the colonized attempts to appropriate the the sort of ontology we call the myself and the process of this sort of a misidentification a misappropriation either you overshoot the limit or you fall or inadequate compared to the original limit so identification and mimicry and colonial condition is quite interesting we have so correlative but what Hall says away is sort of true to cultural conditions in general and that's reason why we can select someone likes to at home like dick Hebda jazz more others core cultural theorist because they're speculating ideas suspect a lot on issues which have a macro significance they can be related to general conditions and culture how culture is formed so difference obeys the logic of more than one difference as whole uses that obviously it's an appropriation of the radar way of drawing on the radar to a great extent difference sort of subverts entire idea of binary it obeys the logic of more than once it's the logical possibilities of production of possibilities and since as a process it operates across difference it entails discursive work in defining and mocking of symbolic boundaries the production of frontier effects it requires is what is left outside its constitutive outside to consolidate the process so again I mean we have already discussed a section to some detail in some detail we see now the inside and the outside come together in terms of how difference creates production of meaning and produces more meaning in terms of identification so identification itself may be compared may be described as a process of difference because identification is a spatial temporal process a spatial temporal activity it occupies inhabit certain space inhabits also certain time at the same time the question of differing and deferring comes an identification as long as the process to which some some certain identities are articulated and articulation entails representation which in a way is misrepresentation because every representation is also matically an act of misrepresentation so in that sense the doreen indifference becomes very important in cultural studies and this is a very good lesson for us students of cultural studies how to use as I mentioned already how to use a range of perspectives a range of disciplines to understand what constitutes culture what constitutes cultural identity and as you can see already that Paul over here seems more interested in the question of identification rather than identity so identification is the process of becoming unbecomingly becoming these becomes were informed questions were home now it brings in Freud and psychoanalysis quite conveniently earlier and uses them beautifully in terms of looking at the question of identification through melancholia moaning narcissism etc so how these things become important tools of identification at a psychological level and it draws in Freud quite heavily way up and this is very important for us because if you remember at the very outset we talked about this goes as drawing on a range of disciplines including psychology phenomenology literary studies you know studies in race studies in language etc so again the question of inside and outside the blurring broad lines between inside and outside become very important for the purpose of this goes and as all seems to highlight it constantly that inner wheel draw and psychoanalysis will draw on psychoanalytically influence feminism and later on him brings and butler quite effectively so these become a very important lesson for us in terms of looking at how culture studies can be used as a discipline but drawing on other disciplines how it is inherently and organically interdisciplinary and quality this dialogue equality of culture is something that we must never lose sight of in students of this particular kind of way of looking at life in culture so now he brings in psychoanalysis so an acute and read out hallelujah from his psychoanalytic usage the concept of identification inherits a rich semantic legacy so you know there's a map of meanings that comes with the process of identification the concept of identification has always been associated with a map of meanings a rich semantic legacy Freud Cole said the earliest expression of emotional tie with another person in the context of the Oedipus complex however it takes the parental figures has brought love objects and objects of rivalry there by inserting ambivalence into the race center of the process identification is in fact ambivalent from the very start and morning and melancholia it is not that which binds wanting an object that exists but that which binds want an abundant object choice it is in the first instance a molding after the other which compensates for the loss of individual pleasures that primal narcissism so what you can see immediately is how ambivalence becomes a very important component of identification is it's a morning for a lost object as well as a desire for a minute something which is probably lost so it's grounded in fantasy in projection and idealization its object is likely to be the one that is hated as the one that is adored and as often taken back and with the unconscious syllabus take you one out of oneself so this very Freudian vocabulary of looking at identification it's used by a whole in terms of looking at how the process of desiring in the process of a boring so a boring and adoring go hand-in-hand when it comes to identification so you know that that's what entails the ambivalence of entire process that it is something which is desired and sometimes when images perhaps feared so phobia and fantasy they go hand-in-hand in the process of identification so identifications viewed as a whole lot lunch and frontalis note on or way coherent relational system demands coexist within an agency like the super-ego for instance which are diverse conflicting and disorderly similarly the ego ideal is composed of identifications which codes with with cultural ideals that an unnecessarily harmonious so lack of harmony seems to be a condition for identification of fragmentation seems to be a condition a precondition for identification so identification as a plural process the different kinds of identification so it's always identifications so he you know halt trots and love lunch and want a loose away having also used Freud extensively he looks at how the entire idea mourning and desiring go hand in hand a boring and adoring go hand-in-hand in the process of identification which is inherently ambivalent in quality and this ambivalence becomes part of the you know legacy of identification part of the articulation politics of identification the way whole studies that sir series that some of the key questions that whole keeps asking throughout this particular book in terms of looking at identity as a cultural quality as a cultural component and it very quickly goes on to say how identification is you know it needs to be a nonessential eyes kind of way of looking at self looking at the entire process of becoming ourselves so and it's move away from a centralized ation the move away from autonomy rethinking subject is something that post-modernism post structuralism feminism evolved being so designed to facilitate another small way from this rational thinking autonomous man which is very Cartesian way of looking at the human self that has been done away with that has been deconstructed and demystify to a great extent by the legacies of post-modernism and whole obviously is picking up on his legacies and is drawing on his legacies in terms of how looking at how these things can become cultural and quality how identification can become a process of social cognition so cognition is a micro activity a noodle activity a private activity where the same time is also a collective activity and again is constant movement between the macro order and the micro order is something that is quite interesting because it brings on psychology as well as you know cultural studies in an excellent dialogue with each other okay so then Hall goes on to say that how we are constantly looking at identity as a process of appropriation and you know how this discursive 'ti and identity go hand-in-hand and this again it connects us to what they call the concepts of this particular course that I've been trying to convey from the very inception actually and that is discursivity identity and corporal reality they entangled together in all cancer cultural conditions and that's something they're whole takes up quite interesting way as well and on the screen as a paragraph beginning with a section which is very important and I'll read out that in some details precisely because identities are constructed within not outside discours we need to understand them as reduce in specific historical and institutional sites within specific discursive formations and practices by specific and instead of strategies so notice how the word specific records it's quite similar the way that what particular records when I talk in this particular course there you go but the specificity and particularity of very important components and cultural studies because we always should resist in society of reification the idea of temporal reification but something becomes timeless and quality I mean timelessness is the you know is something we just looked at with suspicion and culture study especially it will take a sort of feminist post modernist perspective in culture and Holloway is quite clear about the consoie to quality of culture the conservative quality of discourse and how this discourses are produced in certain historical situations which are quite particular and quality which are quite specific in quality and a specificity something which is highlighted by home throughout this undestand as I say in troll is over a work actually and as what he says these are specific innovative strategies so enunciated strategies means articulation strategies in specific in the in unstated strategy sometimes become dominant dogmatic and dominant meta-narratives like nation for instance race supremacy language etc so these become specific enunciated strategies which become successfully become grand narratives and their own rights murabba they emerge within the play of specific modalities of power and doesn't the product of the marking of difference and exclusion then they are the sign of an identical naturally constituted unity and identity that in his traditional meaning that is an all-inclusive sameness seamless without internal differentiation so this myth of a seamless identity this myth of an identity without an internal differentiation is something which is busted by you know the post rachel is and deconstruction is way of looking at culture which you know which looks at culture and cultural identifications as play play away obviously it carries a ludic quality it brings an sort of playfulness through which mainly the produce reproduce and deep in different historical situations but what it also does at a more general level at a more immediate level is that it does away with this myth of unity the mid offer totality and any myth of totality is obviously a light to the myth of grand narratives to the formation of grand relatives so in a very interesting sense an array in a real sense this particular perspective in cultural studies in debunks the myth of grandeur enters the deconstructs it was designed to deconstruct the myth of any kind of grand narrative which when once they pass up as a given pass up as a meta discursive things so there's nothing called meta discursive in holds analysis and hold is quite clear in terms of situating the process of identification within discursive frameworks right so just within discursive frameworks that he can form identifications and reform identifications and that should remind us to a great extent of what do you know what Lyoto had talked about language games and how we navigate to different language games and how this navigation to language games becomes in an important way to which articulation and performativity take place and therein lies so the key commonalities but in all as a cultural theorist and LeWitt are as a post modernist and likewise you can also draw on the ideas of Butler and and all of us he mentions Butler towards end this essay which we'll cover very very quickly so but just to sum up no this is a process of deconstruction to see you know the grammar of deconstruction that all is bringing in in terms of looking at culture and cultural identities and he's less interested in identities and more interested in the process of identification how does identities are formed how there's identities that arrived at or you know non arrived at and how they're always showed how they have fallen shot off and this sort of a system a gap between the original identity or the desired identity and the achieved identity this gap between these two categories this is a gap which is quite political landscape and also a piston make because this is a gap which sort of highlights the Epistle my divisions which are operated within the process of identifications and that's something that a whole constant reminds us as a cultural theorist so we stop this lecture at this point and we'll carry on all this text in the lectures to come thank you for your attention [Music] you [Music]
