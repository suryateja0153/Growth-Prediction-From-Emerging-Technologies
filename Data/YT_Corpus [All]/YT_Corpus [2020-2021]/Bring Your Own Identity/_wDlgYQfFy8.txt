 - [Man] What is my identity? You see I choose not to be confined by any type of identity. I identify as a human being conditioned by no culture, religion, or spiritual being. My identity is not my culture. My culture is not my identity. My identity is Kabir. Kabir is pieces of identity from everybody else. My identities are my words, my mistakes and my lessons. I was a lost identity since my adolescence. I could not identify with anybody because I could not identify with myself. As time went on, I searched deep and identify with peace and good health. I identify with God because God has no identity. He's energy released through the King inside of me so God is my true identity. But God is in me like God is in you. Identify yourself and you will discover the truth that an identity is an illusion but don't get it confused. Your identity is in your soul. The illusion is just you.
