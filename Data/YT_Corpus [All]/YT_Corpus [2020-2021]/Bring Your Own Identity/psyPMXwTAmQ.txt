 Well again my name is Bobby Yang and I'm Hmong and I'm from Minnesota I was born in Milwaukee, moved to Minnesota, Milwaukee Wisconsin. I moved to Minnesota when I was 10 and so it was a big Hmong community there and so it's a core part of my identity and really blessed to be able to be immersed in my own culture and my identity. I don't think there there are many Hmong people if any at all who live here in Mexico and I don't think majority people haven't encountered Hmong people so sometimes people would ask me you know "¿Eres chino?" and (laughs) so I would just laugh it off and say no that's usually my response to anything and when I would say no they'd automatically go "¿Eres japonés?" again I'd I say no but then it gives me the opportunity to tell them that like I'm Hmong and what Hmong people are and where they come from and so I think that that's a very good experience being able to share with other people and then in return them sharing something with me and so as an Asian-American it's been a very interesting yet learning experience I just think being immersed in a new culture and a new location is is fantastic I mean I'm learning Spanish here and learning Spanish in a country where if the majority of people speak Spanish is pretty crazy but then you learn so quick I remember taking some Spanish classes at Augsburg University in the U.S. and you know I'd retain it but then afterwards I just never really used it again so here on learning class and then I use it everywhere I go when I'm around here so I think having that experiential knowledge is, is really important because then you feel all the aspects of the language and of the people in the country right out in front of you so yeah I totally recommend it for anyone I would say I noticed I noticed that a lot of people in just in general as well are are kind of shy when it comes to learning a new language they don't want to mess up and I know my family that that sentiment is produced a lot as well and so I would just say you know don't don't be afraid don't be embarrassed to get things wrong and be open to people like correcting you I think that that's one of the best ways to learn I get corrected all the time by my host mother and so but I can say that it's helped me learn Spanish so much better specifically for Asian Americans I think, for one there is places to get white rice so if you want some of that I think that's (laughs) it can make you feel a little home when you're missing it but I also think that it's it's it's nice to draw all the connections between our food here in Mexico and the usual food that you eat at home I think I think definitely just try a lot of different foods and yeah sure
