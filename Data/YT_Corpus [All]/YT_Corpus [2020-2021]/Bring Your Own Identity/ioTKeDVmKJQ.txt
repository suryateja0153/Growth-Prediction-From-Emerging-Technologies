 [Music] hi everyone and welcome to talks at google i'm mike collinsi today i'm excited to welcome micah rajanov to talk about their new book non-binary memoirs of gender and identity for nearly a decade micah has hosted the website genderqueer.me a community-based resource for transgender health and a platform on which micah has shared their engaging story about transitioning to become non-binary mica has presented numerous talks workshops and published articles on transgender health educating peers parents and providers about the diversity of gender identity the book which micah cohented with scott duane was recognized as a finalist for the 2020 lambda literary awards for best lgbtq anthology micah is currently pursuing a phd at boston university studying how digital technology impacts professions micah welcome hi mike thank you for having me here hey how you doing today really good great great and thanks everyone for joining i want to let everyone know we will be taking audience questions in the second half of the talk so please do add those to the live chat throughout and we'll get to them so micah before we get to the book i wanted to start by helping people to get to know you better on your website you talk about your personal journey and from reading the comments it's obvious to see how your story is connected with so many people so i was hoping you could start by talking a little bit about yourself and how you became involved in transgender yeah advocacy a great question um it actually started 10 years ago uh it's a long time and um i didn't really know what transgender was or meant and when i learned about it uh the kind of explanation that i got was you know you want to go from one gender to another and so i was like oh i'm not transgender end of story obviously not the end uh and then i kind of something kept you know drawing me into this world and i kept exploring i went to a conference i met some people and eventually i found out you know you can be trans and not have to be like a binary gender man or woman male or female and i was like oh that's me um and so i um i didn't know what that meant really but i knew that i wanted to have surgery top surgery i always say i transitioned backwards because i started with surgery and then did everything else but that was just very clear in my mind and so when i was doing research online i didn't really see myself represented um so there's like uh there were listservs and forums and blogs and i would just read about all these people and how they did it and why they did it and their journey and i was like that's great it's kind of close but not really me um you know can you get surgery if you don't identify as a man like that was a big question um and i didn't really know the answer but i was gonna do it so when that started i decided to start a blog just to document my surgery process and i was like well if anyone else you know will find this and it'll help them that'll be great and that kind of snowballed into today 10 years later i guess there was a lot more to process than just surgery so i started kind of just exploring my identity through my blog and people really responded and i would get so many emails a week being like i had never heard about this um you know i really see myself or i'm different but it speaks to me in a way that other trans narratives don't speak to me um and you know i was kind of questioning what does it mean to be non-binary what's my gender what does it mean to exist in this world where your gender doesn't exist so yeah and then i just started again i would go to a trans conference and not see myself represented there would be talks and sessions and workshops and i'm like but where's my workshop so i was like nobody's doing it i guess i gotta do it so i started giving talks in workshops and apparently that also resonated with people um and yeah and then i just kept kind of writing got invited to consult and started writing a book and here we are so that's the version of it it's 10 years yeah that's great i mean it's really really easy to see the the connection that you've made with people on your website and uh you know getting to that question of gender i wanted to turn to the book now and uh in it you write and i'm quoting gender is everywhere it permeates everything we do everyone we meet every place we visit every interaction we have and so you know you're talking about gender and given that gender shapes our lives in so many ways you pose the question right at the start of the book and it runs through so many of the stories and the question is what is gender what's your take on this question and how does the book reveal the many facets of gender um i think my take on this question and i don't know if i say this in the book but if i usually say it in my workshops if you come here with questions and you leave with more questions then i did my job because i don't think there's a simple answer to what is gender and i think what uh what we understand of better is we have our biology and that's kind of what we're taught you know there's males and females and it's a binary rigid system that's kind of predetermined by your genes or your physical appearance and obviously that's not the case um even biology is a whole spectrum and then you have kind of your expression and how you look um and again that's obviously we have a lot of flexibility in how we show our gender how we feel our gender and then there's like our identity which is very unexplainable and kind of ineffable sense of who you are and for some people it's very clear and for others it's not very clear but i think most cisgender or non-transgender people don't really ever question that of themselves um and so i think one big um kind of message that i wanted to impart with my book is that everybody has a gender you know so it's not just about you know people who are wondering what it means to be non-binary this is a really like a universal question that most people don't get to ask themselves and they really should because gender is very interesting yeah i mean one of the things that really struck me from both the book and your website is that this concept of a spectrum of gender and the different facets of gender like you said identity and expression biology it's really like an aha moment for people who ultimately identify as non-binary and opening up a whole new world for them and uh you know what's your perspective on that from the folks you've gotten to know um i mean i think for me it was a big aha moment when they're like no you don't have to you know transition from a woman to a man you can just you know be something different uh but and everybody has their different aha moment but what's interesting to me is when i give workshops at conferences and people will come up to me and sometimes it's like parents of trans kids who are cisgender they've probably never questioned gender and they'll come up and they'll say wow like i just had this aha moment about my own gender and what that means you know and maybe as a kid i was like this rough and tumble girl and that wasn't okay um and now i realize like that was just a different part of gender um so it's really like it's it's just not even like a a pole or a spectrum it's kind of like this web like people describe it so in so many different ways um and i think the aha moments are just very personal um kind of for you that you have this feeling that something feels right all of a sudden and something clicks and having one doesn't mean you solved everything because there's there's many parts to it obviously um but i i think i what i want is for people to experience those moments in themselves yeah that was something i found really interesting and insightful from the book the the fact that you bring together 30 different people's stories and it lets you see all those different perspectives and and facets because it's not the same experience for everybody right and in each of those stories like some people have it totally figured out and they're like i've been like this you know for many many years and others are kind of in that process and even while we were doing the books and people had to like you know it took six years to do the book so some people's gender kind of changed along the way and they're like can i update my story you know i have new things to tell um and so it was a very valuable process even for them and obviously very individualized too and different ages too people growing up at different times when you know the environment was different and the where the community was at at that point was different right and and just different um ways of exploring them so some people found it through sexuality others through like a community others through a website um others at school and especially now so yeah it's it's just kind of infinite universe so if we get into some of the stories in the book one of the stories in the book uh was from melissa and melissa describes their genderqueer backpack that includes all the things that melissa picked up over the years and i thought that was a great metaphor to think on how to think about the gender spectrum because like you were saying earlier regardless of how we identify we all different pick up different behaviors and styles and interests that define who we are yeah i uh i really like this piece um is one of our kind of first submissions and it's very simple but also very kind of captures uh the metaphor of gender as a backpack and you get to decide what you put in and what you don't and some things you kind of realize you're carrying unnecessarily um in other things are kind of by choice and so here in the story melissa tells about the various objects they pick up as a woman and objects that they've discarded or kept and then objects that represent manhood or male hood or masculinity and then there's a third section of objects that just are kind of these genderqueer objects that represent um this querying this like individualizing empowering owning their own gender yeah i thought that was a great story what another thing that that came up a lot throughout the book was language so i wanted to talk with you about that a little bit because language seems like you know it could be a major barrier for this concept of a gender spectrum you're just thinking about some languages where every noun has a gender with it or levi says in their story that names names are loaded with connotations right and i think the difference with like a backpack metaphor is you're you're carrying your own backpack and we forget that uh gender is you have a gender but it's also shaped by society and it's reflected to society and so the relationships around you shape your gender i mean you're born and you're assigned a gender not by your own you know willingness um and language is one of those that very powerfully shapes gender like even how we talk about it right male female masculine feminine um we've tried to come up with words that capture this different differentness about it um but so let me nerd out here for a second um there's a some really interesting research in psychology about uh different languages because some of languages are obviously uh gendered in terms of like the pronouns and how you speak about yourself and so my first language is spanish which was a big hurdle when i was kind of figuring out pronouns because i had to gender myself all the time and this research says that the word the language that you learn shapes how you um see and associate different objects so like in spanish ki is feminine but in german it's masculine and so people associate uh keys with very different attributes based on the language that they grew up in and so this is kind of this weird way of intersection of language and gender and kind of what we think of things now imagine what happens with people so yeah and language is something that the non-binary community has been kind of struggling with but also playing with you know because language is is evolving and changing and we get to shape it as well yeah that's really interesting research getting into how it you know it's it's yourself it's it's how it's affecting a person not just a an object and is that i wonder if that's gotten into language and how non-binary people reflect if you're from that country just about like the influences in the environment yeah and obviously it's you know there's a lot of cultural aspects about gender there's some cultures that have specific words for people who have historically expressed the non-binary gender and so we're trying to kind of find the word for what it means to be me and i use you know non-binary for myself but some people don't um some people feel transgender is a good kind of label for them others really don't think that fits them um even the title for the book was a big uh discussion point because it was like do we want to call it genderqueer but is that too much like of a current term does it have political connotations non-binary it's kind of like awkward like what do we even call this thing um and even within the the community there's there's a lot of discussion and debate about you know what word do we use to represent ourselves right right because that you know that's the term that you that you've landed on to to describe yourself as is non-binary and you do mention that there's a lot of different uh a lot of different terms people have have uh have explored to to describe themselves as well i can i can see that in what you just said about languages and trying to evolve language really to to describe your own identity right because there aren't any words really sometimes to say like well how do i say that i don't feel masculine and don't feel feminine um there's not like how can you describe your gender without saying masculine and feminine you know and and uh people have people are trying to find ways and are trying to communicate kind of what they feel inside um and i think a big part of being non-binary at least for me it has been is this notion of you have a gender that nobody can really truly understand because our society doesn't have the constructs and the frameworks for it so how i present myself is a close approximation but most people are trying to get there and sometimes like if someone is gender fluid and one day they feel very very masculine one day they feel very feminine when they they feel both how do they express this in the world when some of it isn't even allowed um so it's it's also not just kind of your own private gender but your public gender and others seeing your own gender um and recognizing that and so that's a big part of of i think the struggle that non-binary people go through is not just trying to define gender for yourself but trying to define your gender for other people yeah i wanted to talk to you about that about visibility as well it's one of the main sections of the book and one statistic that you mentioned in the introduction really jumped out at me when he said that amongst published articles about the transgender community non-binary individuals are mentioned only 1.2 percent of the time amongst articles about the transgender community yet non-binary individuals comprise about a third of the trans population and that percentage is rising so the fact that's rising seems to indicate that increased visibility is having an impact and maybe you could tell me more about what that progression has been like and where we're at now yeah visibility is um a double edge so it's good in that uh again i didn't see myself represented because i didn't it doesn't mean there weren't non-binary people transitioning or getting surgery it's just i couldn't find them so they weren't visible to me and i started a very public blog and became kind of a visible spokesperson so in that sense visibility is very good because it gives people a role model examples kind of something to grab onto on the other hand there's visibility when it's harmful because in a lot of places it's not safe to express yourself in a different way so this story hypervisible in the book is about someone and their blog is called the bearded genderqueer and so it's about someone who sometimes enjoys wearing a beard and skirts and they don't feel safe doing that and so they feel like they need to be invisible but that compromises who they are so it's it's a give and take of like your how do you express yourself in public but at the same time be true to yourself and then the other issue with visibility is just representation uh within the community and so right now um the stereotype of non-binary people or genderqueer people is kind of this white thin androgynous and like here we are um and there's not a really like people of color people of different body sizes people with different gendered combinations and expressions and so i think this diversity isn't really celebrated very much and so someone can be like oh yeah i see myself in micah great but i'm only one very small slice of who the non-binary community is and that's something i really tried to bring to the book is just this diversity of representations of gender but also just life and kind of your approach to it you know yeah and again getting to read all of those stories really brought that diversity you know to the fore and gave me a lot of different perspectives um on what it is to be non-binary and to to discover that um you know in terms of visibility and awareness i i noticed uh that you had retweeted when miriam webster added the singular definition of they into into their dictionary and i'm just curious what something like that represents for you i think that uh kind of brings us full circle in that it's uh it's it's showing us how we are shaping language um so they becomes like an official pronoun i know the uh the apa and the um associated press they've all a lot of news organizations have kind of updated their guidelines finally like it's a big battle about how to refer to someone in a news story with uh they them pronouns um and again like it's it's a win it means uh we're thinking about it uh outside of like our little niche community like it's it's in society people are aware of it uh you know like your mother your grandmother they kind of have heard about this uh sometimes you know random colleagues will send me articles um so it's it's there and it gives people something to to talk about as well and kind of to hang on to when they're not very familiar with it um but on the other hand like with pronouns specifically it's uh they then again it makes you very visible and so if i go into the world very few people are probably going to spontaneously use they them pronouns for me um what we try to do is uh ask for pronouns but then i'm the only one in the room who uses they them pronouns and that's kind of awkward and that sort of outs me right as maybe non-binary and maybe i don't want to be outed as that maybe i don't want to make it about my gender maybe i'm at work and so again it's a back and forth and it's there's no right answer and it's about kind of what feels right for you but also educating the world so that what feels right for you is okay in society and it's not something that uh people even think about like it just becomes kind of the everyday thing well yeah i have friends who use all these different pronouns and that's perfectly fine and i don't give it a second thought so hopefully we'll get there someday and as you're you know talking about language really making a a space for non-binary community and folks such as yourself to talk about talk about themselves and kind of fit into the language of the culture i want to talk to you about the community in particular the online community because you mentioned the book what a big impact that had in bringing people together in the non-binary community so it's really looking forward to hearing about that yeah i mean i think first when i say non-binary community there isn't one community right and i don't represent it uh there's it's kind of a a lot of people who identify a lot of different ways um but i found community online and i think a lot of non-binary people have found community online because it's it's not that it's a rare thing but i think it's something that is again not always visible um it depends where you live um are there people around like i don't think i had ever met a non-binary person knowingly as a kid so yeah online i i started a blog people commented would email me a lot and it was just my way of connecting with people and seeing myself um the other thing there's kind of this trope that everyone starts their journey on youtube because uh you know we upload our videos and kind of talk about gender and it's also a way to document the changes that we go through physically um and so uh there's there's quite a few very popular youtube channels uh of people who just kind of documented their process and again made themselves visible and created this community yeah i thought that was interesting about the use of video both as a way to you know you know really tell people obviously much more visually about about what's going on in your life and but on the other on the other hand also to raise visibility and um you know one of the stories in the book from jamie about you know learning from youtube about how people present themselves um so kind of going in both directions yeah yeah and obviously i'm more of a writer hence a written blog and a book but i did do the typical youtube videos of like this is my voice on hormones this is how it's changing and you kind of have that uh progression and i think some people there's something very powerful about an image but there's also something very powerful about a video and and kind of a casual video like in your bedroom like it makes it real right it's not just this person maybe uh far removed from me maybe uh in a magazine who knows it's like this person is like me in their bedroom um and it just brings it brings it to life really um and and it gives a way for people to see themselves kind of going through this as well yeah you can't you can't deny the presence of a video it it everybody sees it and everybody sees the same thing and you have to you know talk about it and and learn from it and uh and you know compare and and so forth so yeah i think that's great um i wanted to ask you about social media there's a question at google that we ask ourselves periodically which is what's one thing that's going well and what's one thing we can do better so i was curious about social media how well social media has provided spaces for the community to grow and also how can you do better oh this is a good question um i have a love hate relationship with social media i'm sure many of you do too um it allowed me to connect with a lot of people all over the world um and also have a platform for educating people on non-binary gender and having myself visible so that other people could see themselves and i've learned a lot from social media like things that i probably would have never known to even google which is part of a problem right you can google everything but what do you even search for there's things that you don't know exist like non-binary gender uh on the other hand there's um people can be very mean on social media uh i'll just put it that way and so when the more visible you are you can get some pretty pretty nasty things and i think there's a there's a story in the book by um uh jeffrey marsh who uh is a vine star and uh and has also written a book um and they got a lot of hate online like death threats and it's just i think people forget that there's a person at the other end um and maybe sometimes expressing your hate is not the kindest thing to do um even if sometimes you mean well and like someone messed up and there are ways of saying hey you messed up you offended me you can do better and there are kind ways of doing that i think and i think we have to do better and and find those ways yeah i totally agree the uh you know the challenges of content moderation are because there's always people out there who who will be mean and and finding a way to still provide a a great space for people to to communicate and interact and come together and things get lost in translation right like i've probably said some things which others have thought mean when maybe i was joking or i didn't know better and so it's it's a it's a very dangerous place to be and at the same time it's very fulfilling and i have really just sometimes made friendships uh from social media like one of my best friends i uh he posted something about um somebody doing research on trans health and i tweeted at him and then he was like yeah i'm gonna be there and then we met up in person and then we ended up like writing this article that got published so yeah it's magical you know that i mean that just from reading your from reading your website and the articles you posted it just really brings to light the value of comments and the comments that you know people responding to your writing about your experience and about other featured voices that you have on your website um it was great reading those articles but in a way it was even better to read the comments and just how people responded to that and you know found those aha moments or or just like well somebody's really talking about me now to get that feedback you know and and um what i try to do with my blog is really make it a conversation because it sometimes feels like it's you know just me putting it out there it's one way um and i tried to like ask questions and then what i did at the end i mean i was you know after a few years i was kind of i'm done with exploring myself a good you know here i am world uh and i still had this platform and i wanted to use it and i started the featured voices series and so i invited um people to write guest articles for my blog and i had different themes um like coming out like significant others and so just i got a ton of people writing in and maybe you don't have to write a whole blog maybe you just want to write this one slice of story and share it with the world and it was my way of capturing kind of this diversity of experiences that people have and just share it and yeah a lot of people responded i got one comment today on a really old post about um someone who transitioned in the equestrian community and someone commented thank you for for posting this but it's also like a way you learn and it's a way to to have a real conversation and kind of respond to people yeah it's it's awesome it's awesome reading reading everything that uh that people responded and you said you never know when somebody's gonna respond to something you wrote wrote a while ago because that's the phase of their journey that that they're at right now yeah so i'm really embarrassed by all my old content don't don't go read it but once you know i'll get a comment like uh oh wow this this post is really incredible and i'm like i mean i'm still impressed that people connect with it because you'd think 10 years later this would be much more visible and kind of like i always say my job was to put myself out of a job in trans advocacy but yeah it's still needed and i think it's it's very appreciated that uh i think my favorite comments are the ones where just people say thank you or this really spoke to me because i need to hear that too right everybody needs to to know and that one person also speaks to other people so one again i see we're getting a lot of great audience questions and i want to get to them next i just wanted to ask you one more question before we turn to those which was it's kind of more generally what really surprised or struck you from the stories that you collected in the book um i think how diverse they were and different and not just in in the way that people talked about their gender and their gender expression and and all that but just uh kind of how they talked about their life and how they tried to find metaphors their life experiences very different and even kind of the styles that they wrote it like we got poetry we got very lyrical kind of pieces narratives we got very straightforward pieces like this is when my journey we got some academic pieces these are statistics and so um one thing that i learned through this is that yes it's about gender but it's also kind of just about communication and being a person and everybody's different in kind of their own little weird unique way and that's okay and i think we have to learn to appreciate a lot of that yeah that's great that's great all right let me turn to some of the audience questions and let's start with one from william williams says hello personality has numerous perspectives and gender is certainly one of them how do you differentiate whether an expression of personality is rated to gender or not um so i i hope i understand the question but it's kind of uh how does how do you know if it's your personality or your gender i think is what you're asking um yeah i think i think it came up while we were talking about the different aspects of gender and the gender queer backpack yeah um so i've always said part of my gender is my personality like i'm a like very straightforward person i'm neat and so like the way i you know have my hair and just kind of wear like plain t-shirts and that's my personality but it's also how i express my gender um and so a lot of times like you know you have uh people who are kind of straightforward and bruised and to the point is very like masculine attributes right and people who are kind of like soft and kind and nurturing is very feminine and i think we have to get rid of those associations um because usually they they harm us more than more than they constrain us a lot of the time um and so you have to kind of say this is my personality and this is my gender and sometimes they match what society says sometimes they don't um and that's okay right so let's going back to the genderqueer backpack analogy just to take that take the little further melissa mentions certain like you said those gendered kind of personality traits and says here are some things i'm taking from male and some things i'm taking from female it almost seems like the the gendered personality traits persists uh in a way like that's being carried forward yeah uh it's gender is very entrenched um and so uh but i think the way that melissa plays with their backpack is like i took this high heel and it makes me feel tough um because it's you know there's a it's a pointy shoe and i can kind of like just uh it's you know bright red and i can show myself and so it's also playing with those attributes right like i can be um like soft and masculine and sensitive um and i think uh melissa does a great job of kind of putting stuff in their backpack and taking stuff out but also just mixing and matching and not sticking with um what they were taught okay let's get to another audience question uh this one coming up soon this one from austin austin asks as non-binary genders become increasingly visible where do you see healthcare going in terms of recognition acceptance and standards of care well uh we're going in in a good direction but there's still a lot of work to do so even just for trans people in general there's there's a lot of work in terms of acceptance and health care um standards of care are a very interesting thing as well so i'll i'll give um two examples so um when you go to the doctor they usually i mean maybe they don't ask you your gender but they definitely assume it and there's definitely a box that they check um and so for instance they go and they see you and they check mail but what if you have ovaries and you're having an emergency and you have uh something in your ovaries that needs to be taken care of how does the doctor know that so one of the changes that some colleagues of mine who our doctors have been involved in is changing the electronic medical record systems the big one is epic i think is the one people use and how um doctors and health care providers mark your gender because you know it doesn't matter what's in my pants unless something is wrong with it and you're my doctor and you need to kind of fix it so uh there's a thing called the gender organ in the organ inventory and so what they do is the doctor instead of assuming you're male and therefore you have these organs and your body looks like this is okay what's your gender identity perfect and what organs do you have because also some people who look male and were assigned male may not have all the organs and some of them don't even know it until later so this is a good way of kind of changing these you know technological physical systems social systems that uh that embody gender and constrain us and also make it hard for people to seek care the other thing obviously is insurance is big in the united states and i think right now there isn't really room for non-binary gender the standards of care are still very binary in the sense that you have to you know if you want to get hormones you have to identify as male and present as male for x number of years and blah blah blah and so it's it's very constraining and a lot of people kind of it's not only like upsetting because you have to lie but it kind of perpetuates the smith and um it doesn't uh even healthcare providers are miseducated and so a lot of what i do is educate healthcare providers about this i know there's there's a lot about uh recognition and healthcare that um i think is is the movement has started for sure um but we're gonna there's still a lot to go mm-hmm i wanted to ask a question that um related to that which is um there have been ongoing efforts at google to make available more general gender neutral restrooms and locker rooms and to enhance transgender health care coverage i want to ask you what else do you think we can do to create a more inclusive environment at work when when we return to work uh for our non-binary and transgender colleagues whether it's at google or any workplace yeah i mean google has uh i think been at the forefront in terms of the health care coverage uh for sure um covering trans-related health care um but sometimes we forget you know gender is in physical structures like you mentioned restrooms and locker rooms but you can have all these inclusive policies but at the end of the day you're interacting with people who are your co-workers and they may or may not be educated on this and be accepting hopefully they are but let's say they are accepting but they don't know better so a big part of it is just educate people who come in and then people who leave and go to other places and pass that on um and even online like have your pronouns a lot of people have talked about um when they're in a call and they can put their pronouns next to their name and so how do you communicate that in person i know the transit google group um has done a lot and and there's also more to do and i think i mean i don't i don't have the answer uh i think just being open and and getting involved and educating people every opportunity you have you know um one thing i always say is it's not only uh when you're in the room it's also when you're not so if mike you're talking about me to a colleague and you use the wrong pronouns for me then that's an opportunity that you can to educate someone else about it and say like oh i'm sorry these are the pronouns uh or someone says you mean this person and you're like no that that's not what they're called now um so being advocates for other people because we can't do this by ourselves yeah no that that's a great point absolutely i think we have another audience question so let's go to that one this one from plymouth thank you for being an inspiration as someone who is actually older than you i wonder how you feel about the generational aspects of non-binary gender uh yeah this comes up a lot um there's again this trope that non-binary gender is a fad that it's new and i can tell you it's not new uh just because i didn't know about it and see myself doesn't mean there weren't people who came before me who were visible and have done a lot of work on it um and so i think one is to dispel this myth that it's about young people and that it's a fad and that it's something new because it's not and in the book there's people of all ages who talk about their story i think what's different is that most young people have a lot of room to explore their gender today and they have the internet so they've been more visible about it and that's a positive and i think we should we should embrace that uh and that'll make it more inclusive for everyone but i think we just have to remember that um people grew up in different times with different kind of ideas about gender and so some people may be more open to accepting the idea that it's not just male and female that people have genders that are outside of that um and some people may embrace it right away because that's kind of how they grew up like yeah of course you know this is completely ordinary um and the others just recognize that yeah it's it's it's not just about young people it's happening to everyone everywhere um all ages and they're all trying to kind of find themselves and i think that again gets lost in the representation of who's represented is mostly younger people i know you had a bunch of uh comments from the community on what how quarantine has impacted gender identity and expression and i was hoping you could share that um yeah sure so i asked um on my social media uh and um well some people were like why would quarantine impact my gender which is a fair question um on the other hand a lot of people kind of have found comfort in having the space to i think slow down and explore themselves and this aspect of their life and again this applies to gender but also everything else um they've become more comfortable exploring kind of this expression like i can experiment and no one's necessarily seeing me all the time so i can try on different outfits different ways of doing my hair different voices and see what works um you know i like this one uh no one here is misgendering me and uh i'm not visibly in trans in this in between phase which can be very scary for everyone um the flip side is also again sometimes uh they put their pronouns on their uh screen names and this is good in that it forces people to see the pronouns and if you normalize it in terms of i was at this conference and they told all of the presenters to change their screen name to put their pronouns which felt very inclusive because again it's about not just the non-singling out this non-binary person but making it kind of everybody has different pronouns but this person said it's it's harder to ignore it when people misgender you and your pronoun is like right there um so yeah there's there's been a big response um i think the other one is um just using this as a cocoon phase to before i re-emerge as my best self which i really liked um because again it's it's it's a journey to to figure things out um and sometimes it takes your whole life and and it'll change back and forth i like the comment too about the availability of gender-neutral bathrooms [Laughter] uh yeah yeah and we don't think about that but in your house they're all gender-neutral so why are they in a different network yep exactly exactly this is great i think we had one other great question from the audience that i think will help us wrap up this discussion and so when we close up the slides and we can put that one up all right this one is from ezra so question for mika what do you think it will look like when non-binary identities are commonly known about and expected in society i hope that they come soon i think i think we're there for for a lot of people who get to experience kind of authenticity in their gender in themselves in their everyday life or i think at least some of us get to experience this up in some kind of portions of our life um i think what it'll look like is it'll be a known concept so again i didn't even know this existed um and so i if i hadn't found it i would have just kept wondering like you know i'm not i don't fit this definition of like you know transgender who goes from one to the other when that's not the case um but there's something else that's not right about me like i i have this feeling that i don't feel comfortable in myself and i want to do something so i think having it out there and more available as a concept will help people kind of find it faster and explore gender it also help other people um explore gender people who are not necessarily transgender um and kind of get rid of these uh constructs that limit us um it'll be a lot less work i think for non-binary people like i don't have to educate everyone about pronouns fight with my you know uncles about it or whatever whatever the case is um because i think i think people forget how gender is everywhere like again just going to the bathroom at the office can be an incredibly frightening experience and how many times do you do that a day every day and so it just takes a big weight off what i think it won't do is kind of be a magic pill and solve everything because again gender is so kind of complicated in a good way that you're always exploring and there's always more to learn about it about yourself about other people's gender and so i think it'll just give us this room to really explore that and play with it and figure it out in in a way that's safe for people because a lot of people again don't always feel safe doing it in a way that's accepted and maybe even celebrated let's hope let's hope that one day it'll be celebrated absolutely let's hope that day comes as soon as possible and hopefully us talking here today and sharing with people has helped raise visibility and awareness so that day comes maybe a day sooner yeah i guess i don't see everyone here but thank you for showing up and when it's available for sharing it with other people i think that's the first step you can do is just make it known that this exists and that it's okay
