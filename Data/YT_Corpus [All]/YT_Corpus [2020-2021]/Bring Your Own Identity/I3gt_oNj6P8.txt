 Lao Tzu wrote a book caught the daodejing this book was written in the 6th century over 2500 years ago it's 81 verses that are comprised of his different thoughts either on religion politics gender and the such there is one particular verse that is in the book called identity we have a huge problem in society today with this identity crisis identity leads to disaster because we have to remind ourselves identity is a word that habit has a definition the definition is not universal anyone can think anything they want about a word you chose to label yourself with also an identity has an expiration date it cannot last forever so when someone has a job title and they completely submerge their entire well being attached to that job title and the job title is dwindling away which it will because someone else can do it better the job is not really needed anymore well the person has to retire or change is going to come they got hurt anything can happen where that job title or that role has to change the person starts to feel a sense of panic and we don't realize that we do that that we attach our entire selves to the word and we're taught that early on we're taught that we're supposed to be boys or girls we're taught that we're supposed to behave in certain ways based on gender we're taught that we're supposed to grow up and make people proud and we do that by attaching ourselves to what looks successful and we try to dis attach ourselves from what doesn't look successful we are once we are born we are not the the identity is the thing so the thing has no feelings it has no compassion it couldn't care less if we exist or we don't exist but we are making it so identity in the form of value will completely bankrupt you it is okay to say to yourself I am doing the thing which is why calling people criminals pedophiles entrepreneurs when entrepreneurs can be anything in any body but when it doesn't suit us we don't want to say we're an entrepreneur marketers influencers so was Hitler so was Jeffrey Dahmer but so was Martin Luther King so with Steve Jobs all the word influencers but they mean different things so we have to say what am i doing is different from what am i separate yourself from the thing and it relieves you of having to live up to a definition that really doesn't mean anything to anyone else no one cares what your title is no one cares what you identify yourself as because what you deliver is going to be based on how you feel about yourself not the title remember everything is for sale we shouldn't be so we shouldn't attach ourselves to identities because anyone can grab anyone every which way and it doesn't make anyone's value any more or any less mental health mental awareness self awareness and self contentment will not come from someone teaching you to be a definition it is a horrible mistake that we are making that we took on ourselves and that we're teaching young kids to be when people start acting out and acting like oh my god I don't know what to do with myself it's because we keep trying to tell people to be something they have to be kind conscientious of their own behavior courageous able to speak their mind they have to be savage when they have to be savage but to be a thing is impossible we do the thing we are not the thing take [Music]
