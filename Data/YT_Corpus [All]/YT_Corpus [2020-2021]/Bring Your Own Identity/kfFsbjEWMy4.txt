 hello everyone my name is brandon but you can call me asriel and welcome back to identity v today's video it's going to be a little bit different than the usual content that i put out um i realize that i should probably diversify my content a bit more just because i guess i've generally just been sort of streaming and although a lot of people do watch my streams and i really appreciate the support on those um i feel like i definitely need to diversify myself a bit and start branching out with different content so although i've been busy doing a little bit of surfing with tara and still trying to push hunter rank on my main um i'm definitely going to be focusing on making some new videos coming out soon so i'm going to start mixing up my content a bit which i hope you guys will enjoy but today's video gonna be a bit different uh this is gonna be my first live commentary and just to start us off i'm gonna be doing a commentary on my own gameplay um so today i have a ranked match on arms factory that i played only a couple days ago so this is very very recent and the tier that this is in is currently cyclops or ogre whatever you want to call it um it's cyclops three and so i'm currently in cyclops 3 with around a 57 win rate which i'm pretty happy with considering it was a lot worse um in recent times but yeah so let's just hop right into the commentary i'm gonna be um commentating on the decisions that i make why i did this things i did wrong things i could do better and so on and so forth so let's just get right into the commentary so i spawn in at a pretty good spawn i'm going to put the exact spawn point in the top left of the video but to start off i actually didn't take a picture now this is a strategy that i've been practicing and trying out um in recent times just because i really like it because it keeps you unpredictable most survivors are going to be expecting you to take a picture right and by not taking a picture of that it's kind of like a one big massive mind game right because they don't really know why you're not taking a picture they don't know when you're going to take a picture and they don't know really which direction that you're going to be coming from but now i see the mind's eye crouching and now i'm thinking to myself this is awesome right i haven't taken a picture yet which is okay because they're probably still hiding and now they'll start to move to ciphers but i found the mind's eye and that's the main goal is to find the decoder so here the mind's eye is not lagging i i had some people say that she was lagging she wasn't lagging she just got very unlucky with her placement she accidentally ran into the camera and i positioned my body to body blocker basically and make a longer barrier so she got caught on my body the perfumer messed up really hard she tried to body block which i respect but i know my hitbox so i was able to swing past the perfumer and hit the mind's eye and then i kept chasing the perfumer in order to get another hit on her so now the perfumer is gonna have trouble rescuing or is gonna be unable to rescue especially if you have a mercenary and a postman on the team one of those is gonna probably go for the rescue so here i'm just trying to pressure the postman he dogs which is awesome so now i just wasted his dog it's gonna be on cooldown i don't actually know the cooldown for the dog but at least now he doesn't have it right so i make sure not to hit the chair and i try to make a little barrier with my wall a little a little wall along with the with the barrels um here i get hit on the postman which is great that's what i that's what i wanted to do and then i think he kind of tries the body block but doesn't really succeed because i know the hitbox with joseph now this is a very very important uh thing to note right here you might be thinking well brandon what the heck did you just got pallets done like your bag which yeah but uh that was intentional so i actually intentionally allowed myself to get palettes done and i baited the mind's eye in the palette stunning me and the reason why is because the mind's eye has last effort she's going to be down regardless so what exactly does this palette sun do for her now if she wasn't about to go down like i could totally understand like a palace and that's amazing right you just pass in the hunter but all you've done right now is just prolonged your death you're already guaranteed to die pallet stunning me grants you nothing but what does it give the hunter well now that pallet is breakable and once i break this pallet you're no longer able to use it for the remainder of the game so if one of her teammates late late game decides to kite in this area that palette is no longer available to them because she just wasted it with last effort so a little tip is that if you're playing survivor right don't waste pallets or throw down pallets when you're on last effort because there's no point you're going to be down anyways you're not prolonging anything because you're already going to be downed so just don't waste pallets when you're a survivor and you have lost effort and as as a hunter main uh if you do have a survivor that you're chasing with last effort walk through those pallets just completely walk through them let them pallets done you bait them into pallets funneling you or at least throwing the pallet down because if they do now those valuable pallets are wasted because pallets are very very valuable to survivors so here i had tinnitus which i think i was getting from the postman on the cipher but i'm somebody who's very cautious when it comes to tinnitus if i have somebody chaired and i have tinnitus i'm going to camp this chair very hard right proxy camping is a little bit dangerous because maybe they're nearby like you don't know where they could be they could pop out of nowhere right so they let the mind's eye die which i was you know i was like okay so they they died i could tell by the sound that the cypher had a lot of progress on it and i saw that the middle cipher was wiggling so i was like okay i'm going to try to go for the terror shock right maybe they don't react fast enough maybe they aren't aware of my of where i am so i come over here and i don't get the terror shock but i do get the down and she wastes a perfume so this is a really good scenario for me so i can tell just by the sound that that cipher is really close to being done and here i probably could have made it to basement but i remember thinking to myself brandon just play it safe right don't thirst for the basement just in case she might struggle like struggle out of the balloon um just chair in a safer chair so instead of going for basement i put her in this chair even though i probably could have made it to basement it might have even been closer now this is a very very crucial play so i want you guys to sort of pay attention to exactly what i do here i chair the perfumer that's the first step right i share the perfumer and i notice that the cipher that's nearby to me is wiggling so that means that somebody's really close by right now the postman is already damaged the mercenary is not right so who do we think is going to come for the rescue obviously the merc so i walk over to the cipher and where are my footprints now my footprints are back at my chair so i can safely patrol to the cipher now you'll notice a cipher just based off the audio cue right the sound that the cipher's making it's very very close to being done and i can see the tracks leading away meaning someone is right here so i'm looking around and i see the postman i activate my card trick and you'll notice where am i standing when i card check back to chair i'm standing right on top of the cipher right next to it right so i card trick back to the chair and i time it just right so that the mercenary has just saved the perfumer and now the perfumer is running away from chair and the merc's still there now does she have tide turner yes so you'll notice i hit the perfumer the merc's to my right and i start following the perfumer now look what i do here i still have my card trick and you'll notice where were my footprints 15 seconds ago my footprints were still at that cipher remember because when i cartricked back to chair my footprints were on top of that cipher meaning if i card trick back now and time it right i'll be right back on top of that cipher so watch what happens the postman has no idea that i'm there right i pop out of nowhere he's trying to finish his cipher which i knew in my head that cipher to them is going to be very valuable they're going to commit really hard to finishing that cipher because it already has like 90 plus progress on it just i can tell from the sound and then i cartridge back and if i just got the head on that merc would have been the cherry on top but i get the hit on the postman i downed him which is great i prevent them from finishing that cipher and then now he has to either waste a self-heal or get healed by merck limburg's saying on me so clearly the postman is going to use their cell heal and now i get a free chair on the perfumer so here was one of the mistakes i made this was this is probably the single mistake i made this game was i i wasn't thinking that oh he can just elbow pad the chair so i'm just playing around with the murk trying to buy time and i'm like oh shoot so i i use blink and i realize too late that my blink isn't gonna hit so i try to turn away from chair but i end up still hitting the chair which is really unfortunate but i at least get the perfumer now here again like i said this is a god palette meaning it's really easy to camp and you should expect people to camp this palette so i walked through it with confidence because i knew the merc wouldn't be expecting that so that's why i walked through with such confidence and if he ended up pallet stunning me now that pallet is gone so it's kind of a win-win either he gets the pallets done and he gets me which is good for him but it's also good for me or he doesn't palettes on me and i get a free hit so now he's gonna have trouble getting rescue so for some reason he was taunting me and then pinballs his elbow pads so i ended up getting him um i paid the price today by taunting in a ranked game by the way so just just don't taunt and rank games is what i'm saying because uh it'll end up getting you in situations like this so i actually see the postman hiding behind the tree and i notice where he is and you'll see that i have tonight here now watch what happens to my tinnitus it disappears and yet i can still see his tracks in the area so i knew that the postman was in the photo world because his tracks he was just right here and now he's disappeared the only possible explanation for that happening is if he went into the photo world so i switch worlds and i see the postman right here so i expect him to throw this palette down but he doesn't so i hesitate for a bit and then refine them again and then before you can switch worlds i get them down and then that's it they end up surrendering and that's a gg so two cyphers remaining and we got a four kill game which is awesome for us all right so that's gonna do it for this video i hope you guys enjoyed watching um it was a simple video for me to make but at the same time i feel like it'll be good content because i know that when i was first learning joseph and trying to find good joseph gameplays out there um i really liked people who did commentary videos like this because i could kind of see like well how does this joseph player think what type of decisions do they make what's going through their head while they're playing which in my opinion you could be the most mechanically skilled player in the game but if you don't have good game sense you don't have good decision making skills especially as joseph um you're not going to succeed so it's really more of a mental game than it is just physically being skilled or good at using your abilities or aiming things properly but obviously depending on the hunter that you play that's also really important too but um regardless uh thank you guys so much for watching if you could leave a like if you could subscribe join our discord server uh do any of those things that would be awesome helps me out a ton and will make my day i hope you have a great rest of your day stay safe and take care you
