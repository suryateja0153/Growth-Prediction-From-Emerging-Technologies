 so I'm officially entering into my third month of life here on YouTube and it's been a really interesting time getting to know what you won't hear from me so last month I decided to release a video about mixed race identity after realizing that I just couldn't finish writing this book that I'm working on without exploring this aspect of being biracial and how it actually impacts on the way that I express myself and the way that other biracial people express themselves so I talked about it more in this video here and this video here and I'm going to include the links to both of those videos in the description below so in this video I decided to share 10 journal promise for biracial women who my guidance in the process of self-discovery and finding their identity but first if you wondering who I am and where I come from I'm Candace the accent you hear is Australian my father is african-american he's from Mississippi and my mother is white she's Australian and as a coach and educator I work with people from all over the world to help them answer the question of Who am I and what's my purpose so that they can live a joyful life and do the work that they're actually called to do so what are some of the journal prompts that you can use Who am I not so we're in a society that tries to put us in boxes every single step of the way last week I did the u.s. 2020 census and it was outrageous the number of races that they had defined we're constantly being separated by class age race socioeconomic status credit score and so in a world where everybody's always trying to put you in a box who are you definitely not what do you believe about who you are and where you belong so in the process of self-discovery you get to write your own narrative you get to choose what you want to believe you know for the longest time I told myself that I didn't belong anywhere like I'm true different to be white I'm too white to be black nobody understands me I fit in everywhere but nowhere at the same time and then I started to think to myself like is that what I really want to believe like what would I rather believe how can I choose a narrative that makes me feel good and changes the way that I interact with others and how I operate in my life so what do you want to believe about who you are and where you actually belong what does culture mean to me so I always thought the culture was something for other people but it wasn't for me so the culture was tied to specific traditions foods arts different practices you know I never thought that culture was for me because I never experienced it so blatantly and so I just never tried to explore it right but what if culture is essential to understanding your identity how am I connected to my culture so as a kid my mother used to do my hair in different styles she saw my cousin's wearing in Mississippi you know I'd be in Australia walking around with braids and beads and as I got older head scarves you know I would listen to Erykah Badu in Angie stone and india.arie and I'd feel a deep connection to the music and to the art and yet when I came to the USA I started to question what people would think of me if I wore braids like if I was too into that type of music would it be cultural appropriation even if my dad is african-american and it may sound completely outrageous to a lot of people but this was a real feeling that I had had I felt such a disconnect that I started to lose my sense of self you know I often ask myself now how do I remain connected to my culture both black and white what can I learn from my ancestry so I lost both of my parents many times over the years so tell me about their lives so tell me about their parents lives and they've told me some cool stories over the years but often they find it hard to think of stories to tell me and truthfully I'm not sure that they knew too much and and remember too much about where they come from and so this month I decided to dive deeper into my ancestry by sending off my DNA to ancestry DNA calm if you're interested in doing the same thing I'm going to put the link below as well you know I'm convinced that the more that I know about where I came from and the stories of my ancestors the better we'll actually understand who I am what stories have shaped your life so over the last month I've shared stories with biracial black and white people that I've come into contact with and I've realized that a lot of us have similar stories so whether it was one of our white parents trying to do our hair or wondering where to sit at lunch break or I'm just never believing that your story of being biracial was actually worth exploring or sharing but it is right culture race ancestry they all contribute to the story of you they all shape who you are how you show up in the world and how you connect with other people how would my life be different if I chose to belong so if you chose to see yourself as part of something bigger if you decided that your tribe was out there waiting for you to embrace them to accept them what if you chose to actually claim them to claim your culture and to claim that you belong how would life actually be different for you what does me being on this earth represent so sometimes I like to remind myself that me being here is kind of a big deal right like 54 years ago in the u.s. interracial marriage wasn't even legal and so I like to believe that I'm a representation of where the world continues to move right it's forward and but it's slowly but it's still falling right does any of this feel important for you to know like as you sit there listening to this video and you're listening to me rattle on do you feel curious do you feel a tug on your spirit to go deeper to understand more do you actually feel excited about the idea of learning more or does just all of this feel kind of irrelevant most of the questions in this video was centered around culture because for so many biracial people this is the topic that contributes to the crisis of identity on the biggest scale and but I'm a journey of self-discovery there are so many more questions that you can ask yourself but what is the develop a deeper understanding of who you are and your unique contribution to and so I've written a four-page guide with 57 self-discovery questions to bring you closer to yourself and your purpose and no matter what your ethnicity I'll go ahead and put the link in the coffee in the description of the loan before you run away I'd love to connect with you an Instagram just head on
