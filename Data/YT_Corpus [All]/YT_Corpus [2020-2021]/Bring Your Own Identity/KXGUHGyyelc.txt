 Let's look at the process to create a Digital ID in Kofax Power PDF. So with the Security tab selected, we'll click on Manage Digital Identities. We'll add an ID. Choose to create a self-signed digital ID, and save that locally. We'll add our username, an email address, and a password, and then we can choose to save that to our desktop. There you go, we've now got a digital ID to use with our PDFs. It's just that easy!
