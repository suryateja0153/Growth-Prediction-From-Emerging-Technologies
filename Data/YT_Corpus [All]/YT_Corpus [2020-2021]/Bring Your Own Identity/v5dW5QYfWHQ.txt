 perfect that's all we need I think we can get it right down the street at CBS okay let's get in the car let's get going we can't actually yeah let's take this with us put in my sweatshirt pocket let's go Chris wait if I said no work guys right here today there's not why there was a car that way what do you mean no car in the driveway there was a white one I thought we held that one who said I don't know who that is hold on let's go this way real quick I don't know that's not mom no we don't have that cars cars that we are we being followed we just turn up there game master top secret evidence oh yeah that's right shares we got it it's time to reveal who this gamemaster person is you saw that grace and I were scraping fingerprints off gamemaster top secret evidence gadgets that we found in the woods we sent it to a lab and the lab results are back so let's get inside and let's open the stuff shares if you haven't already hit that subscribe button because this is gonna be so awesome we're about to find out who the game master is come on let's go inside let's do this okay hi Cooper oh hey where you going where you going where you going yeah sure as Cooper is our new baby puppy he's the newest addition to the sheriff am I think right now he's playing with the toy Cooper where are you where are you oh there's otter hi otter where did Cooper go what are you up to today huh what are you up to say hi to the shares good boy otter Cooper there you are are you snacking oh you're snacking oh yeah that's how you know he's just shares because he's snacking on something what are you snacking on say hi the rest of the sheriff family wants to say hi to you say hi good boy okay well why Cooper's snacking we're gonna go open this evidence envelope and see what's inside so you say there you snack how do you stay over there you sleep whatever you're doing we're gonna go downstairs we're gonna open this thing and find the results this is gonna be awesome and shares we're good because there are currently no workers here today so no one can steal this evidence from us we should be good no workers and here even though everything's wrapped up by the way the construction is really coming along check out this room it's looking good it's almost done it's a very big room now and we got like new stuff on the ceiling we got fireplace there a fireplace there and you get a nice clear view of the pond how cool is that you can see everything that's going on and in the summer where there's when there's fish and stuff we'll be able to see all the fish and all that good stuff so I'm super excited for that rooms have done it should be done soon and then the stairs will be done oh wait I just realized remember the other day how there was like a jail up there well check this out huh that's so weird they like patched it up almost like it's one piece of the wall now but why would they patch that up what are the workers trying to hide it was literally right behind here so they patched that jail thing up for a certain reason oh I wonder if they patch it up to hide evidence or if they're doing something different with that let me go check with my mom and see why they would have passion that thing up on the stairs real quick hey mom see that on the stairs there was like a prison bars and then the workers seemed to cover it up okay we'll come to this territory right now cuz I'm unpacking my balls you made that I did oh well sure smash like bun from a mom she made some like pottery balls but mom you were right though mailman did drop off this lab results for the top-secret no was that that yes yeah doc so we got it back so we're gonna open this today so it's probably a good thing the workers aren't here because then no one can spy on it and it's only our eyes only that good let's see it quiet here thank goodness yes okay let me just show you the stairs real quick because I'm not sure it's like why they would have patched that up it doesn't make any sense I'm not really sure but let's go look so it was right up here on the stairs here there was a spot right here the other day and I'm pretty sure there was like prison bars in here and then they patched it up you can see that they attached something on the wall Yeah right why they would patch it over definitely I guess I'll have to ask the contractors tomorrow find out what's going on yeah why they're not here today let's go open this Cooper what are you doing you stay up here okay mom we're gonna go open it I'll let you know what the results say okay okay hey grace I got the results let's open this thing up grace grace whoa whoa what is going on in here grace yeah I'm from my last video of the posit slam challenge yeah shares on Grace's last vlog we did the possum challenge I seen her eyes we made this much of a mess look at this that slime yeah that was my slime I did pretty good smash leg button for that that's Grace's climb oh very hard now yeah but look at it look at all those sparkles and it's like clear yeah it's pretty cool but not as cool as the top secret results that we got back oh okay let's open it you ready grace oh wait wait before we open it we just deem it for any thumb prints from the like factory Oh make sure it's not compromised yeah oh we got the black eye here come back here grace cheers check this thing out it ordered this just the other day it's a black light scanner it'll figure out if there's anything that was on this envelope that could compromise it here come this way guys so shows we've been ordering a lot of spy equipment and spy gadgets and we put them all in this back room back here like check this out this is the blacklight scanner so on the front you can put it on torch mode and it creates like an awesome bright light just like this you can use this to kind of look on the envelope and see if there's anything but all it is this is is just like a flashlight so this might not be good but grace if you can turn off the lights we can turn the backlight on okay lights are off whoa whoa can you even see me barely I can't see you honey well those me okay it's dark but we got a scanners envelope here we go black light on a three two one give it a second okay warm it out Casey well okay I think I see something on the envelope wait a second I do too huh wait a second do you see that what is that I don't know it's something that looks like a face almost like a face but what was given at that let's ski in the back of this no it's just on that front right there huh do you see that those shares do you see that yeah I see it I'm not sure if this means that it was compromised or not what do you think sweet way Stephen what Oh what is that flashing what what do you see that this red dot where no it's like yellow or white where over here back in that corner where right here yes this is just part of the hot-water heater I think we're good wait there's nothing washing what right behind you red that's part of the heater system oh okay it's all normal stuff it's nothing to be worried about okay this is nothing to do with it just just turn the lights back on grace yeah yeah turn them back on okay okay well that's the only evidence we were able to scrape off this thing was just that little tiny section right there I think it's okay to open what do you think Chris yeah I think it's fine that thing that we saw is probably it's like a little scuff from the mailman or like being shipped here let's open it okay shares comment right now who you think the gamemaster is could it be Rebecca's omalo Chad wild clay the quaint could it be like who could who could the gamemaster be great if you had to comment who do you think the gamemaster is I don't know see I'm trying to think maybe it's someone we haven't even met yet like Lucas and Marcus Oh like the Joker brother twins yeah it could be I have no idea that gamemaster could be anybody or it could be a bunch of people I have no idea but this should tell us grace okay here we go grace ready yeah first things first there's a note check it out huh wait there's stuff written yeah well yeah it's a note grace it's got to say something let's see it says thank you
