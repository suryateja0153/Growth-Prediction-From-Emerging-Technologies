 [Sunanda J] How you develop your own management style, your own mantras within the larger organisation given that, you know both of you are part of such well established businesses, how do you ensure you're creating your own space? How have you created it? [Anand Piramal] I would say that I really started my own organisation both times. So in some ways, I had less of a comparison with my father. And often, if you're the son of Sunil Gavaskar, then people expect you to be batsman only. So I feel how all the teams that I recruited came because of me or they they knew what they were getting into, before they worked with me. So that's why they, I guess it was a little bit easier. [Vaaman Sehgal] In my case, I think again, you know, we did a lot of acquisitions. So it was important that when we took over some of these companies, we didn't disregard their culture, their style. There's always something to learn from someone else. And my job was to make sure that we amalgamate all the different experiences and cultures and say, okay, what's best for our group? And taking some of those things as well, because definitely, there were a lot of places where they were doing things better than us. So to drop that, you know, arrogance and say - Okay, because we're taking you over, you know, you have to adopt all our lifestyle, you know, or our culture and now we're working. That's not really that what works, I think, you know, empowering the local people, giving them a chance to take their decisions, you know, allowing them saying, look, we trust you! Take your decisions, and if you have a problem, come back to me for it. So, again, these are things that, you know, we learned as we did those acquisitions. We started with some very small ones. Then we started doing larger ones; got more confident. Started understanding what really works in a global business environment and develop from there and it's still changing even now.
