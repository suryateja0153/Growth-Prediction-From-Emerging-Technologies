 So tell me, what is that? You're gay? You know it now, or do you know it now? Well, I think some days it's like I know I'm gay. But-- but the experience that came with it is what is hard to deal with. [SOMBER MUSIC] When I got in a group home, and I was violated, and kept being violated, it was like, I was struggling with this battle with myself. Like, oh I grew up in the church, and the church said one thing. And then its like, but I feel this way. And then-- You didn't grow up in the church. You grew up in a religious dogma, OK? Because here's the church, baby. So don't reduce your identity to sex. Yes, you were violated as a child. You need to find your true identity as a gay black man. Your ancestors were still whipped. They still picked cotton. They still came over here on a boat. We're not extricating you because you're gay. You are minimizing it. Yeah.
