 what is the purpose of marriage you know we've looked at the power of marriage the definition of marriage the priority of marriage even marriage roles and today we're going to wrap up this series by understanding the purpose of marriage what is the purpose of marriage well the purpose of marriage is friendship now i know that's not our culture but it's biblical culturally you might have a good friend who understands you but you're not attracted to them but another person really catches your eye they're good looking but they really don't understand you they don't get you at all and yet which friend is the better candidate for a christian marriage listen if you chase the eye candy to the expense of somebody who understands you you're headed for trouble that doesn't mean you got to marry some unattractive friend but what i'm saying is that friendship builds a much stronger marriage than just good looks at one time i am planning a wedding for a young couple and the bride asked if her maid of honor could be a man the bride argued well the maid of honor is supposed to be your best friend so why does that have to be a woman when my best friend's a man now biblically there's nothing in the scriptures that requires the maid of honor to be a woman you know god's silent on wedding party details he doesn't care you know if you've got some big you know uh taco truck at your wedding and such is that's not germane to how god leads but if this woman wants a guy to stand next to her and you know hold her bridal bouquet fix the train on her wedding dress and all that well there's really no problem with that from a christian point of view however if i were the groom i would have a serious problem with her understanding of marriage because the groom is anything but her best friend maybe he's a sex object maybe he's a meal ticket maybe maybe he's just a status symbol i mean he's something but he ain't the right thing because his fiancee just valued another guy as her best friend in the old testament language the hebrew it describes your spouse as your covenant partner your soul mate you know when adam saw his wife eve what did he say did he say what a babe no he didn't adam said this at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh this is a oneness friends that is not found first in a sex act but first in friendship what is friendship well well david gives us clues in psalm 41 9. david says even my close friend someone i trusted one who shared my bread has turned against me david said look i had a friend i was close with a friend i trusted a friend i shared meals with but now they're going the opposite of me right they're not going with me they're going against me so if you flip that we'd have trust we'd have sharing we'd have closeness we'd have going in the same direction and there are dozens of verses that provide a context for for what friendship is proverbs 17 17 proverbs 18 24 4 4 and there's so many more and if you study them all you'd come up with a base definition of friendship that would be sounding much like this take a look friendship is a trust filled love motivated oneness that arises as two people move together towards a mutual goal you know in c.s lewis's book the four loves he differentiates between erotic love and friendship love by talking about how the greeks use more than one word for love he says you know when they talked about lovers you know the greeks would say that's eros like erotic love when the greeks talked about friendship love that was filos like philadelphia the city of brotherly love and you know that's one way you know to look at it but what helped me is when i read cs lewis's book is how he positioned those loves he said in erotic love it's two people looking right at each other face to face eye to eye in phileo love it's two people standing side by side shoulder to shoulder looking at something else something that they have in common that's the difference between erotic love and friendship love for example if you like war movies you can see it nearly every war film you know the early scenes are all about how one soldier comes from the city another from the farm and when they meet in boot camp like they kind of hate each other because they're like so very different and in the early scenes of war films there'll be this fight between these two or there'll be some kind of tension that will develop but then as the film moves to battle and their commander says hey we got to take pork chop hill you know or we got to sink that battleship what happens well the relationship between the city boy and the country bumpkin between these two very different people it turns to what to friendship why because they developed a trust and a concern for each other as they pursued a common goal they rescued each other from tight spots right they lost teeth and fingers for each other someone's leg got shot and you know these movies poorly acted but like great entertainment the christian construct is similar god intended marriage to grow out of friendship he intended philos to be the first stage that's friendship and eros this deep eye to i love to grow out of that friendship so definitionally friendship it's a trust filled love motivated oneness that arises as two people move together towards a mutual goal and in a marriage that is outside of christ you know where two people who don't know jesus and sure they can be happy sure they can be in harmony sure they can pursue goals together and grow together but what differentiates a christian marriage from any other is the goal that they pursue and this goal is the huge advantage to every christian husband and wife who grasp it who understands it to not know the goal to not understand how it serves your marriage would be like getting into a tesla and not knowing about the ludicrous gear or like getting into the millennium falcon and not knowing about hyperdrive let me switch analogies it's like eating vanilla ice cream and not knowing about hot fudge or like watching a 3d film without knowing about the special glasses i mean the movie's kind of okay i mean you can kind of get the gist of it but boy you put those little paper plastic glasses on and wow it's incredible and this is how it is in a christian marriage because the mutual goal in a christian marriage is far different than the mutual goal in a marriage outside of christ what is that goal well god spells it out for the husband but it's actually the goal for both husband and wife god says husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy cleansing her by the washing of water through the word and to present her to himself as a radiant church without stain or wrinkle or blemish and as i shared last week jesus's job with the church is to make her holy so that she can be presented to the throne of god completely radiant and holy so this is the goal in a christian marriage each person looks at the other to see what stunning beautiful amazing thing that god is bringing about in that person's life it's like this most people who are getting married they're looking for a finished product you know like a statue when according to god they shouldn't be looking for a statue they should be looking for a block of marble right so that each person looks at the block and sees the statue that could be one day shifting metaphors they look at the caterpillar and they see the butterfly that will one day metamorph so the goal of each spouse is to look at their partner and say well i see beyond your flaws and weaknesses i see beyond your imperfections and dependencies i see who you are gonna be i see a you that's absolutely ravishing i see burst of glory flashes of immortality i see your potential i see the person that god is calling you to become and i want to be a part of that and i'm hopeful that you want to be a part of that sculpting process that brings out that in me too see together in this christian marriage you're going to work to present each other before the throne without blemish let me give you a few ways to think of it i'm visiting this university in riverside california nowhere the los angeles smog is like simply smothering we we really have no sense of it here in the beauty of indiana and neither did the student i met at the school he'd been on campus for an entire semester and the day i visited the strong santa ana winds came through that riverside valley and just completely blew out the smog when this college kid came out of his dorm he was absolutely floored because right in front of him were huge mountains he'd been there for months and never knew they were there but for a few hours that day the glory and the majesty of mountains soaring 10 000 feet in height were stunningly visible and in just a few hours the winds died down and the cruddy smog hid the mountains once again friends this is marriage it's any christian relationship really some days it's smoggy you can't see very far and as time goes by a wind whips up and you get a glimpse of the peak you see the snow at the top glimmering in the bright noonday sun and it takes your breath away and then the next thing you know the smog is back getting to know a christian a christ follower it's like that every once in a while you get a glimpse of the glorious right the gorgeous the radiant peak of perfection you see who this person is becoming you get a vision of who they would be if they weren't shackled by the smog of sin and flaws and it inspires you to want to be a part of the process of helping that person get there as fast as possible that's the way a christian relationship should be and one more way to think about this a few years ago i'm walking through care point academy and i noticed that the girls in one of the classes they'd shanghaied this little boy to play the groom in their little make-believe wedding he had a look on his face that i'd seen in many real-life weddings i looked from the groom that said oh my goodness how in the world did i get here there's a bit of truth in that really for all couples who stand at the altar i mean you don't dress in wedding clothes every day right you don't live in the grandeur of formality not even the most proper couples in our community walk around in a tux or a wedding gown today you know tuxes and really many dresses are rented which means you're just playing dress-up really and it is there in an outfit that you're really never going to wear again that you're proclaiming vows before god that basically say someday 70. 80 years from now when we exit this stage called earth we will stand before your throne and our souls and our character will be without spot or blemish and when you utter that vow you're about as ready for that day as those five-year-olds playing dress-up you're not there yet you're a major work in progress but one day god will look at you and look at your spouse and he'll say well done my good and faithful servants well done over the years you lifted each other up to me you sacrificed for each other's good you held each other up in prayer you confronted each other in love and you worked for the good of each other you cared and you hugged and you continually pushed each other towards me now look at you you are radiant you are spotless you are perfect and in the end two christians husband and wife will stand before the altar with joy and satisfaction because they know they've been the sculptor's tool to bring about the perfection in their spouse's life that's the goal that's what they're really after that's why i say that definitionally that friendship is the purpose of marriage and that it is a trustful love motivated oneness that arises as two people move towards that mutual goal romance fun travel houses and all those other things they're just some results they're the desert but they're not the main course they're not the thing that your marriage really runs on you are committed to each other's holiness to their beauty to their greatness to their perfection and that's your job if the goal is any lower than that well you're just playing dress-up you're not really doing marriage friendship is the purpose and the goal is holiness so how do we make this practical well let me give you a couple practical applications for those of you who are not yet married for those of you are single and let me give you a couple for those of you who have already been into this marriage relationship the first practical thought for those of you who are not yet married is to start with friendship you know in a practical sense that really means to scrap your current plan for finding a spouse you see the current game plan at least for most single men most single women is that when you walk into a room or a restaurant or a party it's like to scan that room for possibilities right you walk in that room you look around right and you see like 30 people the opposite sex and in seconds what do you do you rule out like 27 of them boom bam they're gone out right why well they don't have the right look they're too short too tall too fat too thin too little hair too much hair too cool not cool enough blonde not blonde and in seconds you've just done a laser scan of the potential spouses and knocked out ninety percent and frankly i'm showing my age here because this doesn't even happen in a room or a party anymore does it right it happens on your phone swipe left swipe left swipe laugh laugh laugh flap i mean some of you don't you don't even give those photos like a second of your time swipe sideswipe swipe right and ooh swipe right right right whether you're in a room or on an app you've literally knocked out all but three and so you muster some courage and you give one a shot and if they're willing maybe they meet you and they go out with you but the challenge here is that you started with romance with eros with physical attraction i'm talking about christians here not those of you who just jump into bed with each other right i'm talking about christians who don't think they should start with sex but you've still started with eros because you're facing one another like this and what you've done is to rule out all the people in the room or on the app who could be incredible spouses for you because they could have become your best friend but nope you've ruled them all out they're literally left out left left left left right and you've narrowed down the group your choice to only those who excite the eye and to whom you think you could have this kind of romantic swipe right rush for now certainly you might find a friend in that group but it is very possible probable even that you've ruled out left out your best spouse material so change that approach start with friendship and what i mean is to start finding out does this person have common values common vision common passions is this person looking for the same goal are they surface level or do they have any depth to them if you must swipe left then swipe left on everyone who couldn't provide you with friendship swipe left on those who don't share your values swipe left on those who don't share your goals swipe left on those who don't match your passion swipe right on those who you know could understand you swipe right on those who you could be vulnerable with those are the marriage possibilities because you start with friendship not with a hookup you start with friendship not romance you start with friendship second practical application for christian singles number two when you look for a spouse look only at christians if you're a christian and the person you want to marry is not a christian by definition you cannot fully pursue the goal nor can you live in the definition of marital friendship it's impossible if christ is the most important part of your life and your spouse says well you know i don't care if you're religious or not go to church as much as you want how to sleep and do some yard work listen if that's what you're considering stop they will never be able to understand you they might be a good lover they might be amazingly attractive but you can't ever expect them to fully understand you or bring out the best in you they can't and if you disagree with me just find one or two christians who've tried it and asked them how that worked out ask them how the plan of winning their spouse to christ worked out ask them how the plan of hoping their spouse would become the follower that they are worked grab a coffee and ask but bring some tissue because there's going to be some tears because it doesn't work out you know why because if your spouse doesn't understand christ your spouse does not understand you period all right this next one's for both singles and those of us who are already married here it is number three guard your heart against friendships with the opposite sex really you see friendship is the playground where you figure out who you might have a future with we've already laid the groundwork that you start with friendship we've just told all the singles to do that so so when you start to develop a friendship with someone of the opposite sex and you start to go deeper and understand them and they start to understand you what that means biblically is that you are dating yeah dating i know you're like well ray what do you mean i'm dating i mean we've not gone out to eat i've never sat down with this person at a restaurant we've not looked into each other's eyes through a candle flame we're not dating that's crazy no you are and it isn't crazy when you follow the bible's plan to establish a friendship first when you start to become vulnerable and open your heart to a friend like that you're doing what you're supposed to do if you're pursuing marriage that's the first step towards marriage now i'm not talking about friendships between two men two women that's fine but there are great friendships like that in the scriptures but they're not a step to marriage there's no biblical pattern for that it doesn't exist and really this is a message about christian marriage and the point here is that the two sexes that god created to fit together as two polarities to form one flesh when you've got male and female getting together in friendship that step to friendship is the first step to marriage to the goal in the beginning when adam wasn't sinning you know when he had this perfect relationship with god even though he was perfect he was lonely and god created eve to complete him that means that a friendship across the gender line has a profound and mysterious completion component to it where you realize you're in the presence of a friend but you're also in the presence of something unlike you right you're in the presence of someone who is different and you're vulnerable to them when they look at your problems and your sin and they say well i understand you'll find that fulfills and completes you in a way that someone of the same gender could never fulfill and complete you you're on your way towards marriage when you've got a really deep relationship with someone of the opposite sex and you're dating and what that means is you better be careful deeply careful because when you get someone that vulnerable and yet you're not starting to make a social commitment to that person you're starting to use them now you don't think that's true you say well ray i got one of those relationships and that person doesn't make me feel used make sure talk to that person watch out because you're dating and you just don't realize it you're dating the way that god says and you've just not thought you were all right this one's for those of you who are already married it's number four deepen your friendship with your spouse open up talk share share how you're feeling you know one of the things i prize most in my marriage is how lisa does this i never have to wonder what lisa's thinking because she reveals herself to me her hopes her fears her dreams her heart is all laid open and if you don't have that sit down with your spouse and start working toward it be honest with them your spouse will probably do the same thing back you know it's really rare for one person to say well look i've been totally open and vulnerable with you and the other person says well good but i ain't doing that with you right it rarely happens like that typically when one person opens up the other follows and what you want the thing that's really romantic the thing that makes the marriage heaven itself is to have someone look all the way into you and say i see the imperfections but what i'm focused on is not those flaws but who you're becoming i see your passions i see the you that's going before the throne one day and i'm gonna walk with you towards it every step when you have that kind of vulnerability and understanding and acceptance even in the best marriage it's only episodic but you can sense the life of heaven and you know this is what heaven's gonna be like all right one more for married couples because your spouse is only gonna reach perfection in heaven this means here's number five be patient with your spouse's imperfections you see your spouse isn't going to be perfect this side of heaven and neither will you and so realize that due to this you're going to constantly find yourself falling in and out of like notice i didn't say in and out of love don't say that you've fallen out of love love is a commitment to the perfection of your spouse one day love is a commitment like is a feeling and because like is a feeling you won't always like your spouse and they won't always like you that perfect you it hasn't yet arrived think of it like those old steel furnaces you know that they use to purify metal when they put that raw material in the furnace to get that pure silver or that pure gold there's a lot of impurities that must be burned off they call that dross the dross burns away the real valuable metal is what's purified and so just like in a real furnace you're gonna see some sparks in your marriage and they ain't talking about the like bedroom romance sparks i'm talking about when sparks fly wrestling wing kind of stuff right and when you get your eye off the goal and you get focused on the dross the impurities the flaws the weaknesses it's really easy then to be impatient discouraged but don't be god is using you as a spouse to bring about the glory of another person your spouse and your spouse is doing that for you too both of you want that dross to go and here's the beauty of those times and in a marriage of outside christ you know where people aren't concerned with the end goal when they don't see all this dross in each other the natural normal thing that people do when they see all these imperfections and flaws in their spouse is to wish they had somebody else someone better and what's fantastic about a christian marriage is that they too wish they had someone better but the person they envision that's better is the one that they're married to you want perfection from your spouse and your spouse wants perfection from you but not like a trade-in for a new model no you don't want someone else you want them and as you mature in christ you start to echo what the apostle paul told that church in philippi this is philippians 1 6. he said i'm confident of this that he who began a good work in you is going to carry it on to completion until that day of christ jesus how could paul say this to a church that he'd never met in person well he can say it because he knows that if they're followers of jesus christ they are going to be perfected one day that's the goal so you can expect to fall in and out of like and yet your commitment to that person is going to grow that love for them is going to grow even when you don't like them because what you see when you don't like them is the imperfection the draws the flaws and you want to get rid of that because you want that perfect person the good news is that's what jesus wants to he's that ultimate friend if you take what you learn from how jesus loves you even when you're not so lovable if you take what you learn from how jesus forgives you even when you do the same thing over and over again if you take what you learned from how jesus relates to you and you apply that to your marriage your marriage will soar and friend if you don't know christ you can come to know him right now tell him to forgive you for all the dross for the flaws for the sin in your life and then ask him to bring about your purity and to put his spirit in you he will you know and he can would you ask him right now let's pray together let's pray all together god thank you for an opportunity to to think about our marriages and god if there's somebody here that's never had a relationship with you never been connected to you right now in the privacy of their heart would you help them to say jesus forgive me would you pray that right now just say jesus forgive me i got some dross i've got some sin i haven't been following you come into my life save me would you just pray that jesus forgive me come into my life and save me father i thank you for every single person that prayed that prayer and i thank you for every person that's watching right now that's in a marriage right god i ask that you would bless their marriage as they put these principles into place bring about your blessing and god i pray for those that are single right now hoping for that day when you will lead them to the right partner god help them to pursue it through friendship and god i pray for those who you've blessed with the gift of singleness god provide to them all that a spouse might provide through your presence in their lives and god we bring all of these things to you in the name of your son jesus christ amen hey if you've just prayed that prayer would you please let me know but prayed it in the feed you know prayed it and just put it in the feeder just shoot me an email at hey ray at the point
