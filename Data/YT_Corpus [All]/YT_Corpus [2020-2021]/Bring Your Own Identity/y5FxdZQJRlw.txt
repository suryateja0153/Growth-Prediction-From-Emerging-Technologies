 [Music] hey there welcome to the stream i am josh rushing sitting in for femi okay today listen if you're watching this live on youtube i need your help here's what i want you to do see that box over there that is a live youtube chat and here's the deal we have a stream producer who's in there right now waiting to get your comments and questions to me during the show so i can get them to our amazing guests so be a part of this with me right join in the conversation all right you know what we're talking about today one of my absolutely favorite topics it's food and not just any food but it's like what food says about you your culture your history where you come from um we asked some people in our in our stream community share with us some some recipes tell us about those foods that remind you of your home your mom where you came from check out what they sent us this is pretty cool this dish is actually really special for me because it reminds me of how on most sundays my mom and dad would get up early in the morning while me and my siblings are still sleeping and they'd make chole batures and lassi for breakfast we get super excited and come downstairs and all enjoy it together so first i've made the base using ginger garlic onion tomato puree green chilies and multiple spices one thing that many people don't know is that it's common to add tea to punjabi chole to give it a darker color add the chickpeas and then let this simmer until the gravy becomes more thick and what you want to do is serve it with some onions as well as coriander and there you have it a quick and easy punjabi chole growing up as a kid i never had waffles and pancakes for breakfast instead my syrian family would make a spread of middle eastern breakfast staples this would usually consist of magdus which is a pickled eggplant kefir cheese hard-boiled eggs fava bean salad hummus helva and honestly the list goes on seems that every single middle eastern household has a staple assortment unique to themselves [Music] now look at that beautiful spread and as usual now final product and now bismillah today they are making lions and meatballs and order chestnuts choppy and cookies my only exercise this meatball dish is my all-time favorite comfort food i learned from my grandma the oversized meatballs so tender inside crispy outside so i boil them first and fry them in the wok as i was cooking the aroma took me back to living in china with my grandma we always eat meatballs with rice this is the best combo in the world i make this dish for my family all the time so this has become my kids favorite dish as well how good did those meatballs look right they made me hungry so look if you're at home grab your favorite comfort food and settle in for the next 25 minutes because we're going to talk about it i'm going to ask my guests to introduce themselves so we're going to go around the table here maria can you start please hi i'm marie mitchell and i'm a chef food writer and co-founder of island social club in london well thanks and joanne hi i'm joanne molinaro i am the creator of the korean vegan i am also a trial lawyer here in chicago illinois and a beer hi i'm a beer i'm a chef and food writer and the daughter of palestinian immigrants born and raised on the southwest side of chicago joanna saw you kind of tilt your head there when you saw her put the t in whatever that what she was making to make it darker did had you seen that before or is that something that that caused no i thought that was pretty fascinating it's one of my favorite things about going on tick-tock is i learn all these little tricks and the hints about flavoring food and and making it more authentic i just love it oh yeah marie what does food say about who you are i mean for me um you know i'm my both my parents are jamaican but um i cook caribbean food as a whole and it's really a chance for me to kind of explore my heritage because you know in school i didn't learn much about it and it's my chance to kind of delve in and to kind of experience this beautiful history that features in each dish because you know caribbean food was probably one of the first global cuisines because of how many different influences it features within the food and it's just a chance for me to kind of delve into that and understand my heritage and my culture more deeply can you give me one dish that actually does that for you that tells that story so a dish that i worked on last year is actually a guyana one called pepper pot and it's just a really beautiful way of thinking about preservation and actually thinking about the fact that food often was you know it's a necessity but often in some places you'd have to find ways to actually preserve that so it's like a dish that is actually like a preservation of culture as well as something that physically was a preservation of food itself and it's made up of so many like beautiful flavors uh the main component initially is cassareep which is actually the root of the cassava that's boiled down and then that actually kind of preserves the meat and then you add in loads of like thyme and all spice coriander loads of different flavors and it's just it's so complex and it's just probably one of my favorite dishes to cook i could listen to you talk to me about food for a really long time i could do it for a long time that sounded great when you're missing home or growing up or your family what what food do you turn to what do you make my ultimate comfort food is rice um but like i said i'm the child of palestinian immigrants but i was born and raised on the southwest side of chicago and amongst so many different communities so um that has influenced so much of the food i make and kind of tells a story on my plate of where i'm from so i love rice and i love stews and comfort food from my palestinian heritage but i also love food that represents a lot of the communities that i grew up around like a lot of mexican food a lot of puerto rican food and just the places i've traveled has influenced a lot of the food that just takes me back to that place especially when we're stuck at home like we are now you're talking about mexican food if we can go to my computer so this is for an international audience so you got to understand you know you us is a country made up of immigrants and so they bring all that food here these are the favorite foods uh in each state ethnic foods you can see like mexican food um a lot of chinese and a couple thai out there on the west coast i was reading and preparing for this story that there are more chinese food restaurants in the u.s than mcdonald's kfc taco bell and wendy's combined there were 40 000 chinese restaurants in the u.s which is is kind of incredible joanne what recipe do you turn to when you when you want that that smell of of home sure um probably which is a silken tofu stew um and part of the reason for that of course is because i relate to that um i relate that to my mother because that was the first korean recipe that my mother ever taught me to make and so it goes hand in glove with you know remembering home remembering my mom remembering her teaching me to make it as much as the fact that it's a very hot spicy you know delicious comforting stew so all of those things kind of combine to really provide that comfort food at the next level for me when i'm missing home or when i'm missing my mom you know one thing i love to cook is a roast chicken i do this one it's called a zuni roast chicken where you salted about 48 to 72 hours in advance and leave it in the fridge and the salt just gets absorbed all the way down to the bone um but when you roast that it's like the neighbors might be able to smell it from your house it just smells so warm and and comforting you know that i love it yeah we we talked to someone von diaz she's a professor and a writer from durham north carolina and we asked her about this check check this out i was born in puerto rico but raised in the american south and for me food has always been a tether to the island every time i smell sofrito hitting a pan of hot olive oil i'm transported back to my grandmother's kitchen i believe that the flavors we grow up with become deeply embedded in our taste memory and we return to those flavors in order to maintain that connection and celebrate ancestry which for me is indigenous african and spanish the things we eat can be a powerful connection to the places we come from because we can take them with us wherever we go you know marie listen to her it makes me think about how cultures have a certain ownership over their own culture to include their food and recipes and you know it's been a hot topic lately what happens when celebrity particularly white celebrity chefs take that is it cultural appropriation and you know make money off of those recipes can you can you touch on that is that because part of me is like being in america a country of immigrants i'm like bring it all bring it all on i love it and so i i want all that cultural influence and i want to learn to cook it and make those things but i also see the problem that there's probably a lot of doors open to those particular chefs you know um that maybe aren't open to chefs of color in certain communities can you can you touch on on that for me yeah i mean it is fundamentally it will not fundamentally it is cultural appropriation and it's frustrating because there are plenty of people out there that are doing amazing things that aren't presented with the same opportunities and i think for me the discussion comes from a place where it's not as if others can't celebrate or engage in foods of other cultures but it's about being respectful of them and understanding the really important histories that feature within that because quite often as you're saying that you know the playing field is very white and very male dominated and you know they'll often kind of create things but not always have spent the time and the energy really understanding why that shouldn't be messed within the in the way in which they might be approaching it and i just think that's you know it needs to be dealt with sensitively because it's essentially stripping people of their identities and their culture and there are plenty of people out there that aren't doing that they're actually strengthening it and you know from that clip before it was so beautiful talking about that tethering you know that is something that is so precious and it doesn't deserve to be played with so i want to bring in a headline here this from the washington post and it's chef jamie oliver accused of cultural appreciation for his jamaican punchy jerk rice what was the problem with how jamie oliver did this and maybe he didn't have done it differently or better um i think the fact that he didn't use scotch bonnet peppers and it was i think jalapenos instead it was rice you know that dish is essentially a kind of amalgamation of smoking and the importance of allspice wood that used to be used to do that and why that flavor in particular needs to feature in that dish and then you've got the sweet but spiciness of the scotch bonnet peppers it's just it's the fact that i think what was likely and you know i can't be quoted on this because i don't know for a fact but it probably didn't have someone in the room that was from that culture because if there was you wouldn't have had that rice because it wasn't it wasn't jerk rice you can't jerk rice you might be able to have a smoky flavor in there but that didn't exist one thank you for the shout out to scotch mon and peppers been eating them all week because we had some trinidadian food earlier this week and we bought a bottle of the sausages they are delicious um too it's like the recipe fine you should just named it something else like yeah just call it whatever he wants don't okay don't don't take jerry yeah yeah joanne what do you do you think because i read a definition of cultural appropriation when it comes to cooking it has to do with um one culture taking it from another culture but particularly the culture they took it from is a culture that came from oppression and the culture that is taking it didn't experience any of that oppression and if that is a fair definition can there be cultural appropriation in other ways like can you culturally appropriate french food or because there is an oppression involved in that that that's up for grabs that's a really interesting question i you know the fluidity of language is often challenging when you're talking about these very important concepts and you know for me and perhaps this is the lawyer in me um i like the term cultural appropriation as a very general broad word that encompasses anyone trying a recipe that isn't from their own culture which means that it isn't always necessarily a bad thing what i think is a bad thing however is what i call cultural misappropriation when you're doing it for profit and you're not actually doing it in a way that's respectful as we just discussed um and you know you're actually deriving revenue or some other kind of benefit that's just for you so in the case of jamie oliver for example um you know the scotch bonnet is such a great example because i was actually thinking of doing a caribbean rice curry dish because one of my friends who's also a jamaican she featured it in our cookbook and i was really excited to try it because her mother made it for me and it was quite frankly one of the most delicious things i'd ever eaten but of course i have no experience with caribbean food i've never made it before and you know i stupidly thought oh this should be really easy i you know the flavors are so good i'm sure i can do it and when i looked at her cookbook i realized there were at least seven ingredients that i've never heard of was completely unfamiliar with and i decided well this is time for me to actually do some research and do it appropriately and and give her some respect for that so i think you know in terms of what happened here with jamie oliver and misappropriation is very much rooted in this idea that um you know caribbean food is a food of color if you will it comes from people of color and therefore this notion of misappropriation can that occur um you know against for example a culture that hasn't been oppressed historically is a really interesting one and you know i don't know if it's being too political or being controversial but i'd say that it's probably very hard to do i'm not sure that it really can be done i think embedded in the definition of misappropriation is this idea that you are sustaining oppression by you know disrespecting the culture and disrespecting um the hardship that is kind of in that food injected in that food by that history yeah there's also the economics of it i'm going to bring in another member from our community juan diego romeros had this to say about the money of it but what really concerns me is the people that monetize from these dishes giving back to the community especially if they don't belong in those communities um and without giving credit uh to these communities often that's the case of of uh chefs that you know tend to create this you know dishes appropriate these dishes in a way that uh uh did not credit uh where they learned the these uh these uh dishes from and i think that's the problem i saw you nodding through that what were you thinking um i'm just thinking i'm thinking about what everyone has said and i think at the surface level we just see like a white person or a person in a place of power cooking this food but we don't see the other factors that they're contributing to when they're making this type of food for instance as a palestinian a big reason i started sharing my food publicly was because i was seeing my food misappropriated um often being called israeli and when we continue to perpetuate that and perpetuate that misappropriation it's not just contributing to erasing palestinian food it's erasing palestinian culture it's erasing the existence of palestinians and what people don't know is they are probably in some way contributing to just further colonizing of palestine and of the people there and uh continuing to erase the existence of them and all together and you're contributing to these bigger factors that are happening to peop real people in the world um just by saying well i like jamie cooking that instead of a palestinian person hey i want to bring in some comments from the youtube community they're they're talking about this food equals gateway to another cut uh culture that is shrimp paste one it's pretty funny that her name is shrimp paper one um do you think she'd have an opinion about food uh here is i cannot pronounce this nyam s zika s boots become a part of you it provides you with memories i like the young lady used the word tether that's a great word samuel lee when you go commercial i guess it stops being about the food you have to follow principal and then we have a uh another shot from our community or another comment from someone in our community this is ashore she's a food photographer and a recipe developer check this out and my mom and my grandparents really really used to introduce us to so many item foods um i lived in jordan for a little bit and my grandmother and my grandfather lived there and i had a lebanese grandmother in denver and i learned so much about food and about our culture through the food that they used to make um there's so many memories that i have of my mom teaching me to make traditional food that she learned from her mom and now i get to teach my daughters about that too i love to make saheb for example in the winter time with my younger daughter it's something i used to do with my mom growing up teaching her how to make sushi because my grandmother taught me how to make that so many different memories that we get to make and we get to learn about our culture through the food that we eat which is amazing i want to go back to you and that that answer you had about the uh it's often seen as israeli food when it's actually palestinian food what does palestinian food tell us about the the culture in the country oh a lot for instance now i didn't travel back to palestine a lot as a child i only started traveling back as an adult and my family went through displacement in 1948 and they still live to this day in a refugee camp and when i learn recipes from my mom i'm connected to not just my grandparents my great grandparents and ancestry that i never really got to know and i get to know them through these recipes it's not just a recipe i learn stories about them i learn where they came from because now sometimes i'll learn a recipe from my mom and people who live around where my family currently lives in palestine don't cook that recipe so it makes me dig a little deeper about well did they learn this in jaffa did they learn this on their way while they were leaving gaffa and stopped in egypt and then came to a refugee camp and it causes me to kind of um like i said dig deeper and suddenly there's just so much more than a recipe there's displacement there's history there's stories there's struggle and like she said that memory that you suddenly become attached to and that heritage that you can connect to is um really something that can't just be explained in a short you know description about a dish and i think a lot of the foods from my grandmother how they were shaped by the great depression here in the u.s you know she was eating uh fat back or pork rinds or things now or pork belly and or gourmet but back then is what they could afford and what they could eat and also think about bringing your culture to to another culture through food and we have another member of our community named alan guillaume who is a chef of a michelin star restaurant in paris here's what he had to say about that today i am cooking from the french kitchen because this was the main reason i came to france for this kitchen but in each of my dishes i added lebanese flavor that reminds me of my family and my mom who used to cook for us when i was young i always shed tears when i add the lebanese flavor i can hardly believe that for example a day has come and we are able to change falafel with filling it with smoked fish mix hummus with caviar or mix greek yogurt with black mushroom this is where everything started mixing french food with lebanese flavor and this was so special to me and the clients felt the same you know an incredible thing about alan is when he got to paris he was homeless and he started working in a uh restaurant one day the chef called in sick and he was able to step up and fill the role and now he actually has his own michelin-starred restaurant and i love to think that the secret ingredient he brings is the tears that he described you know as he's adding a certain degree maybe that's the salt that i just can't get the same as alan because they come from his own tears all right we just have a couple minutes left in the show and i'd like to kind of go around the table and give me one recipe from your culture that i need to learn to cook i'm going to start with you join um i would have to say the one recipe is my kampung tofu recipe it you know growing up we used to eat gumpung chicken um i'm obviously vegan and so what i did is i translated that into tofu it is my most popular recipe and i love it because people are like oh my god i never knew tofu could be so good and so definitely check it out all right i'm on it my oldest son is vegan so maybe i'll make this for him and he'll love it all right marie what's the one thing i need to learn to cook oh you've got to learn to cook roti it's our staple in our restaurant it's kind of we basically make roti and everything else is kind of around the roti so it's all about using roti as a vehicle to eat and it's just i find it incredibly therapeutic and just tearing it apart and all the layers and the whole process it's just it's a labor of love and you'll you'll fall in love with it it is embarrassing how much i enjoy listening to you talk about food the most popular recipe i've put out which is rose cardamom tres leches um it honors the tres leches i learned to love in the communities i grew up in but adds the flavors of my heritage with rose water and cardamom and yeah it's going to be super comforting especially now as it gets colder oh that sounds mind-blowing all right look thank you so much guys for sharing your recipe thank you everyone in the audience for joining us today i'm gonna go get something to eat i hope you do too i'll see you tomorrow bye you
