 My name is Edman I am a senior at Augsburg University and I'm majoring in communications and I'm studying here in Mexico well I identify as a black Somali Muslim woman. Well I don't feel like my religion has faltered in any way it's mainly been you know, very genuine, you know inquiries about my hijab whenever I wear it about you know things that they've heard in the news just mainly like like genuine curiosity think there is the same stigmas as the United States it's it's just not like they're not very informed about the Muslim community I would say don't think you can't wear your hijab, wear it whenever you want how to be what because regardless people are going to be staring at you and most likely are gonna get a compliment here in there so wear whatever you want and also I didn't get the chance to but to visit the small Sufi community here in Cuernavaca I think it would be an amazing opportunity to see the differences between the religions here and there
