[Music] hi welcome back to my channel this is Barbra Kay if you're new here you're very welcome remember to hit the subscribe button and the bell next to it so that she don't miss out on any of the videos once I post them up and see recently I only sleep thought I knew who I was I mean I knew my job I knew my parents anyway I came from I knew my siblings my friends and definitely my hinge but I didn't know who I was beyond those things and the funny part is I didn't even think there was anything to know about myself beyond those things now what is identity anyway for the purposes of this video as well as simplicity identity in short is who you are at the core or how you think about yourself or who you think you are now identity should come from within from your inside than your outside and most people tend to acquire that identity through their peers through their family or parents through their role models through their career and through what other people think of them for example if a parent told their child that they're good for nothing then in most cases in most cases that that's how the child is going to perceive him or herself to be that other child is going to identify him or herself to be likewise most people identify themselves with their jobs or career their businesses the positions or titles they hold in society now when all that is out of the picture what is left of you who are you really like a taco and so during this challenging time one of the things likely to bring you stress and anxiety or that has brought you stress and anxiety of course apart from the obvious core v19 is that you feel your identity has been affected you feel lost and that's because things that formed a bit part of who you are all things that you identified yourself with have been put on pause or can I say put on hold for lack of a better word things like your job things like daily routines thing things like your business things like you being able to wake up and take your kids to school and pick them up from school things like meeting your friends over a cup of tea those things are not there anymore and so as much as that sucks this is the best thing for you to find out who you really are beyond those things beyond your daily routines beyond your schedule beyond your 9:00 to 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. job this is the best time to find out who you are beyond those things be what forms your story how would you identify yourself or who are you who are you have beyond those things one may wonder why is it even important to know my true self or my identity and here is why once you know your true self or your true identity you're going to live such a happier and fulfilling life and that's because you get to live up to your full potential and once you don't know who you are then you're likely to always feel empty and lost and in such always in search for someone or something to make you whole which is really sad and I have found that before not once not twice not thrice the good news is once you know who you are then you're likely to jump out of that phase very quickly now there's a quote that says unless we base our identity on the truth of who we are then it's impossible to attain true happiness so with all the time you have on your hands right now why don't you use some of it to do some soul-searching and find out who you really are or reconnect with yourself maybe you knew yourself maybe you knew your true identity but along the way or over time you've gone off the course now I'm going to share with you some tips on how you can find your true identity or reconnect with your identity but before I do that be sure to watch this video till the end because I'll be sharing with you the most rewarding thing or the most rewarding feeling about finding your identity one is find out to try to find out your personality traits now there very many research theories and models on how you can assess your personality like the big five personality traits find out if you're an introvert or an extrovert are you sensitive or I use secure are you curious or are you cautious finding your personality is one step closer to knowing who you should put knowing who your children are you notice your feelings or observe how you emotionally react to different situations both bad and good you know what you like and what you don't like what makes you happy and what doesn't that way you will know what your strengths are what your weaknesses are and when you know that then you really know who you are you really know what funds part of who you are three is think about your future now if once you have a clear picture of how you want your future to be then you're likely to know who you are now or who you need to be in order for you to meet your goals in the future because your dreams or your aspirations have a lot to say about you and maybe it's a time to get your pen and paper in during this free time you have to write down your dreams and plans and when you write down the your dreams and plans be sure try to find out where you want that dream or where you have that plan away want that goal is it because your parents need you to have that or be that or is it your friends my prayer is that it's because of you my prayer is that whatever dream or plan or goal you write on that piece of paper or you have on that piece of paper is entirely for you not for anyone number four is try out new things maybe you don't even know what your likes and dislikes are maybe you don't even know what makes you happy expose yourself to different experiences and notice how you react each one of them I used to think that life had one formula that everyone had to fold I don't if this is something I picked from my upbringing or my culture also so the society I have no idea but that's what I used to think and oh boy I was and honestly was in a while I do like my comfort zone but I quickly pinch myself to snap out of it because once you get stuck in your comfort so and then you stop leaving so I urge you to go ahead try out new things don't get scared of trying new things get out of the comfort zone it is so refreshing and so rewarding the other point is find out what your core values are because values from your thoughts and your actions which also form a big part of who you are what you value do you value honesty your value integrity you value trust once you know what you value then you even know how how to react or how to respond to different situations or when faced with different situations point number six is that don't forget to write down the things you find about yourself or that help you know who you are during this exercise and this is because at some point in future when you feel lost or empty then you can always go back to them now the beauty or the most rewarding thing that comes with finding who you are or finding your true identity is the authenticity that it comes with you get to be authentic with yourself you become authentic with your friends with your family and even watching what you do so be fearlessly authentic in every aspect of your life so enjoy finding yourself enjoy reconnecting with yourself especially during this time I hope you found this video helpful and if you did please like comment subscribe and see you in my next video Shalom
