 curiosity is key because if we're not curious we don't even know it's trauma [Music] hey everybody welcome back to tales from the journey i am stephanie zamora and today we are here with johnson chong who is the best-selling and award-winning author of sage sapien a shamanic guide a speaker and a transformational coach who has just an amazing body of work and such a great story to share with us today so johnson thank you so much for being here thanks so much stephanie for having me on your show yeah i would love to start with you sharing just a little bit more about yourself and what it is that you do that's always an interesting question right what do you do um so yeah i guess i can start by you shared a lot of the broad strokes and the themes and i suppose you can say that i work with various types of alternative modalities and tools to help people remember themselves and i have been working with a large community of people that have spanned across more corporate types of people to more freelancers men women mainly women and so actually for 2021 my focus is actually more on the lgbtq plus community and really honing in on this concept of karma and working through the unconscious karma that we carry a lot of that's unresolved emotional trauma let's say or it could be conditioned patterns of beliefs limiting beliefs fears guilt shame all of these things that center around identity especially for queer people we tend to harbor me being a gay person myself we tend to hold on to things differently um since we are a minority in the world and so really helping people break through that so they can come into a place of self-love acceptance more inner freedom and joy no matter what goes on around us in the external world so that's the bulk of what i do yeah so powerful and i love what you talk about on your website about different types of people that inherently go against the grain and i know that that was something that was true of you what it sounds like what i've read about your story when you're a child as well and so i'd love to kind of go back to the beginning of your story what your childhood was like who you were and and kind of start there sure so yeah i was a very unruly child i think i think there was always something innately within me that questioned everything my parents said and did and everyone around me i think part of that was also my environment i grew up in new york city i was actually born and raised in new york and and then in brooklyn there's just so many cultures you have so many different sounds and accents and subcultures i lived in a very mixed neighborhood lots of jamaicans i would actually come home sometimes speaking in a jamaican accent i would like hey mom like i don't know what i did but it was very because my parents my mom my dad had a little fish market so he would leave me with the raw safarians in their fish restaurant and i would just spend the whole day with them and then that was my daycare so and then you also had lots of you know there was a big latino community and so i i think i was quite quiet as a kid and and language and communication was always fascinating to me because i would observe and notice that people were speaking different things and expressing things differently and it wasn't until i realized that i was actually speaking cantonese at home when i went to preschool i noticed that wait these other kids are speaking english what's that and that tends to happen a lot in new york and because a lot of these bicultural multicultural communities are are existing in their own little bubbles within new york city and in other large metropolitan areas i think young children that come from immigrant families grow up with this sense of oh i'm i'm different i'm other right away and so i was very aware of that at a young age and then throw in the sexual orientation later on and then realizing oh i'm even more other than this other cultural thing so not only did i realize oh i'm this asian-american kid when i step into a room i'm very aware of that and then wait now i'm i'm gay as well i am attracted to boys and so so there has always been this uh shield that i put up whenever i would walk into a space because i didn't want to be found out and that led to some very unhealthy patterns growing up um into young adulthood because there was this fear of intimacy because i was afraid of sharing of also knowing that my parents are super traditional knowing that they would not accept and that was this belief that i had in my head and they actually still don't accept i've come out to them about a decade ago but they still don't accept me to this day because of their values where they come from being refugees experiencing lots of violence and trauma themselves in a very uh violent you know they had a very violent past so uh and then having to work through all that and understanding where where they've come from and how they've parented me because because of their violent upbringing i actually also experience a rather tumultuous you know physical mental emotional verbally abusive uh upbringing so i mean it's just lots of things to unpack um that i've had to do over the years and i mean i think every queer person's journey is a little bit different some are more fortunate and they have a very accepting family and others are less so and then there's those who are experiencing even more otherness because they fall into some other sub categories and and i think no matter you know i i don't think it's about comparing like whose journey has been more difficult but it's really just recognizing that in our other nest and and what makes us very different or what makes us feel separate from the mainstream that's where our gifts lie and if we can really own that which is very scary it's like oh i'm really other and so most of the time i do feel alone but now i feel peaceful alone i don't feel alone alone um because i do know that not a lot of people can identify with my experience and it's hard for them to imagine it because i'm in a very small minority of people and i also have lived on three continents so i'm now this enigma i live in australia right so people are like oh who are you you open your mouth you sound american but you look asian what and people have no idea where i'm from they just are you canadian like what's going on oh you're gay oh tell me more about that right so everywhere everywhere i go people are trying to label me and put me into a box and and that's okay i don't i'm not offended by it anymore i used to be um and so this is this is kind of yeah i can ramble on and on about identity [Laughter] yeah what was it like for you because you mentioned that especially when you were younger and in school like you had put up walls and barriers to keep yourself safe what was it like for you to begin forming relationships that felt deeply connected and safe and genuine and at what point in your life were you able to do that i think it started when i was 14 and my friend joanna i mean it wasn't in the most conscious of ways but it was my first attempt at trust and because me and my siblings i have an older brother and younger sister the way that our parents raised us was very much in this doggy dog mentality and it was all about rewarding the one who did the best you know it was very competitive and so it wasn't the healthiest way of parenting it's just what my parents knew and what that led me to do was to always you know try and outshine everyone else in school so i actually got straight a's i didn't actually have to work very hard i i never wanted to be the last one ever in anything i did whether it was academics or in sports i i i wanted to excel at everything i was just overachiever because of the expectations from my parents and and in that i didn't want to show people any of my my weaknesses and so my friend at the time joanna who you know at 14 we we started taking the school bus together and the train and we realized we lived down the block and and the one thing that we connected on was bitching at everything so that was how i started developing trust was like this little [ __ ] teenager who was moaning at the world and that's where i found common ground and of course later on as i evolved 18 19 20 and then actually by 1920 that's when i started experiencing yoga and spiritual teachings of yoga and then by 2021 22 it just kind of was this avalanche of meeting different saints and teachers and masters and various workshop leaders in different facilitators in new york because new york such it's a massive hub for all of this kind of work and that's when i started to realize that oh wow me trusting is not the same as commiserating and i realized that a lot of people were they found a bond and you know as children or as young adults that we tend to commiserate and moan about what's wrong versus oh wow let me connect authentically and share with you exactly how i feel um and and that that's probably more risky because you may lose that relationship if the person like totally doesn't get it or it might strengthen your relationship um and and i i think it took a while for me to understand what intimacy with myself is was um and how to develop that further and i think a lot of it required separating from people and separating from unhealthy relationships and i i could see that over the years i actually i don't talk to that high school friend anymore not because there's anything wrong we've just grown apart you know um and our difference you know we have differences in hobbies and i started to notice that my the friends and the people that keep around share a more common [Music] understanding that we are having this human experience as energetic beings spiritual beings and that there are certain things that just don't have a grip or whole importance even and so it doesn't make sense for me to keep people around that still put certain weight on right you know dramas and because it then it brings me back into old patterns and it's not a better than a worse than it's just this it's just this evolution of who we are as people um so i would say that you know i've had a very tricky relationship with trust with people and intimacy and changing relationships and i only really have you know a few friends that i can call and and they would have an understanding of where i am energetically um right now where i am so yeah i think that's different for everyone yeah definitely what was your process of like you mentioned the sense of being other and having a family system a family home that was very like you should look and behave these ways like there was a lot of expectation around who you should be when you were younger what was it like for you did you conform in any ways did you shut down any aspects of yourself and for how long if you did oh yes i think that well in chinese culture there's the concept of filial piety which is very much paying respect to your elders and osho who is one of my teachers teachers he talks a lot about respect as not something that is automatically just there it's something to be earned what it does it's it and it's not hierarchical it's not about oh that's your elder you must respect them and he actually flips the whole thing on its head and says what about respecting the children and and letting them have a voice in what it is that they want what are their desires right and the thing is in chinese culture it's very i don't think this was always the case but i think something happened 150 years ago that shifted you know the energy of of of how modern chinese culture is and a lot of it comes from imperialism and having to then warp the old confucian values and make them a little bit it's like mutant confusion values because if you look at the taoist and confucian ways a lot of these precepts of paying respect to father as the sky and mother is the earth these are very shamanic principles that you see in indigenous cultures except there's not such a attachment to what that means whereas when you say these phrases well well my parents would say it like you must honor me as the earth i mean that's very poetic in chinese you know and they'll scream at me yelling saying these poetic things um and you must respect father as the sky you know it's like oh my god you know and so i would hear all these poetic sayings in chinese growing up and they wouldn't i would never understand because it was such a dogmatic understanding of of these principles of respect and i i think i picked up at a young age that their expression of these phrases was colored by some sort of pain and hurt in them that i didn't quite understand and it was only when they would melt down because they were totally overwhelmed and they would never express their feelings that they would then start talking about their past with communism and you know all the things they experience with you know my dad's mom getting murdered and and you know family turning on each other just to stay safe and then having to flee and run from people because they would get killed and then having to swim to hong kong and like all these crazy crazy things um and and i i remember going oh wow okay i've never i've never experienced that okay i can sort of start to see where they're coming from why you know hurt people hurt people i i got that at a young age they're hurt and they're still hurt and they're hurting me not knowingly and i and and so part of me knew this so i could empathize with them but also that was like the adult soul version of me that kind of saw things from this very zoomed out perspective because i i just had these insights as a kid however the child human version of me was like oh no but i want mommy to hold me in the way that i see other mothers holding children my mom never really you know my parents weren't physically affectionate i want my father to you know be more present you know he was very much checked out most of the time and just providing being the breadwinner and not really emotionally involved with us growing up so i wanted my parents to be a certain way but they weren't so i had to hide those parts of me that wanted and i think because i knew that if i showed actually when i did show desire that i wanted something i would get either smacked or shut down or you know so it was a big no and even though the other part of my the higher more evolved consciousness aspect of me that was picking up on all these things as a kid knew that this wasn't the truth i still let that the the victimized part of me take over and that pretty much governed you know my life as a young adult so i i think it wasn't until my early 20s that i started to unravel that you know big ball of repressed emotions so it took a while you know and i think i'm quite fortunate because some people don't do that work until they're like in their 40s or 50s and and i was really fortunate to have role models and guides and mentors at a younger age to point me in the right direction yeah that's huge we talk a lot about the role of mentors and the work that i do and on the show both our external mentors whether that's coaches or therapists or just wise people that we come across or books or podcasts but also our own internal mentors and that can be our spiritual relationship or religious relationship or even just our intuition and what kind of mentors did you have in role models and how did you find them well i it's okay this is part of the whole inner rebel thing that i experienced as a kid even though i wanted mom and dad's approval there was this part of me is like no i'm gonna do what i want so i left for acting school which was a big no-no in my family so i went to go study theater because it was the only place that i felt like misfits belonged i mean you you look at shows like glee and all these types of shows where where the theater kids are a little bit you know mismatched right in so i i thought i found comfort in that and so i went off to theater conservatory for four years and it was actually there that i was exposed to yoga and to various mind-body somatic practices and there was more mental physical psychological and that was an accidental discovery into spirituality because the purpose of doing yoga in that context in acting training and then doing mind-body somatic work was more about you as a person learning more about your physical tension your physical habits how to let go of it so you can be a more efficient more truthful actor on stage for performance for telling the story but something happened in that process i realized oh my goodness i'm not separate of this character you hear this a lot with not as nuanced actors you hear that you know you i hear this sometimes and they and they say things like um oh i i'm i'm playing i'm playing a part that's not myself so i'm i'm spending you know my career being someone i'm not and that wasn't the case for me as as an actor and actually our teachers taught us that you're just accentuating a part of you and highlighting that more so every character you play even if it's a villain you know i've played you know very awful characters i played you know a japanese rapist who during world war ii during their occupation of korea i've i've played you know gangsters and you know people that did really awful things but the what you realize in playing dark dark characters is that the only reason you can play those characters that there's a seed of that within yourself yeah and you're just choosing consciously in your normal you know me johnson my normal day-day to not not let that come out but you will learn to empathize with it because when you're playing a villain you don't think you're bad your intentions may sound the same as you know joe schmoe down the block who has a similar intention i just want to be i want approval you know but joe down the block may be looking for approval by doing nice things and buying flowers for you know his mom on mother's day and then this other person is looking for you know the villains looking for approval because they want the world to know them because they haven't dealt with their inner wounds or whatever it is everyone expresses their need for approval differently so you notice that the intentions for every human being is very much the same everyone just wants to be loved and to love they just have different ways of doing it and when you start to see that there's something in you that shifts there's a spiritual connection that you just cannot help but develop and and i i think really good actors realize that i mean the theater was always it was always grounded in its portrayal of the divine you see this in ancient greek theater it was a reflection of of the greek gods and they're portraying the stories that that's what theater was and and and in that i started so my first teachers were were my theater teachers and then i i was curious i was like what is this yoga business i want to go deeper into the spiritual aspect so i started going to a studio where they they taught a little bit more of the philosophy of yoga and then that took me into meditation and then that brought me into energy work where i studied to be a master reiki practitioner and then doing shamanic work as well and and then bodywork i was really into uncovering what the body was holding onto because i had the craziest experiences with my body shaking yeah not even controlling and going into these releases um crying hysterically into maniacally laughing from one moment to the next like what is my body doing and i'm not even doing this it is just having its release so i was always very curious as to you know how the body was storing memory and experiences so i studied body work and and and meeting different mentors and spiritual teachers along the way to help facilitate that and so i've been very blessed in that i've met just the right person to take me there yeah and they've always pushed me into my blind spots and forced me to look at things that i never considered before and it's just changed everything in how i look at the world yeah oh my goodness it's so when i started working to heal my trauma it was fascinating to me how the body and the mind work and i kept at first i really believed like mind over matter right like if i just like decide and think this way like i can just do these things and heal myself and and then my body would start shaking or things would start happening or i would have panic attacks and it was just like oh i'm not this is not a mind over matter thing like it's it's in my body and it has to process out and i think it's also the permission piece too to allow ourselves to see what's happening that's already there and waking up to the fact that that energy that is moving through can either be felt or numbed out and i remember i was laying there on the floor in a fetal position and there was a class called feldenkrais and you can look up feldenkrais if you're not familiar with his work but his work was very much on mind mind-body somatics and he he was a scientist engineer who injured himself and he didn't want to go the surgical route so he did a lot of inquiry-based work into his body and figuring out these little fidgety movements back and forth back and forth and just watching let's say you know like the rotation of your head you know and doing that for three to five ten minutes yeah but then with very specific awareness points of how it's moving is it moving from the different senses is it moving from your eyes are you turning your head from your your your sense of hearing is it from your taste right and and all these different types of exercises and i remember i was laying on my side and my teacher was asking me to undulate my pelvis and she was asking specifically to see if we can separate the movement of the sacrum and the tail and the pelvic bowl from the thigh bones from how the femur is attached into the socket so those of you who are anatomically inclined you probably understand for those of you who are not you may not have thought of that before and it might make you question google and look at what that looks like but but i had never at that point in time you know at 19 years old considered that my pelvis and my legs were actually a ball and socket connected together and by moving my tail and letting it fluctuate like that and to feel the difference and then but also feel them working together as a team that separation and connection it sent me somewhere else i i started i i went into the i felt this warm current of electricity move up my spine and then i started of course sobbing hysterically i was like oh my god my tailbone and i didn't understand at the time but that was the beginning of what people call a kundalini awakening because there was this it was a current of energy that i can feel and all it is is an awakening to something that's already happening and and so permission and allowing ourselves to see that um in a movement context or in a yoga class even can be really powerful yeah absolutely during all of this exploration did was it just curiosity-based or were you looking to heal some of your trauma and some of your deeper stuff i think at first it was about curiosity because in acting school the first thing they teach you is the what-if principle so what if you were adolf hitler and you had to play him as a as a character what if you were a parent who lost all your children during the plague in the middle ages i don't know whatever it is right so you have to be curious as an actor what if i were this person who seemed so different from me and in wanting to understand that you realize actually there are certain parts of you that you can find within that character and so the curiosity piece led me to explore my humanity in a different way to empathize with the more shadowy you know those of ourselves that we judge like oh i would never do that [Laughter] you know i i would never you know okay you you you say you would never but you weren't you know like i'm trying to think now like once in school i had to play this um you know the the myth of jason and medea in ancient greek mythology so there was this contemporary irish version written by marina carr it was called the bog of cats and i i don't know why i got cast as like this irishman i'm just like i thought we could be cast in the ethnic show you know but i got cast in like the irish shows like i had to put into this irish accent i was like all right whatever color blind casting here we go so here i am this irishman um and he there's this there's this whole like um rivalry between um the character who's the jason equivalent and uh the medea equivalent i can't remember their the characters names anymore and they're fighting over like custody of the child and and the the wife you know does all these awful things she even burns down the caravan and like kills her kid you know and and and you we we say that we would never do those things but we don't necessarily know the kind of history the kind of karma that has led that character to do such a heinous act but in the moment those were her decisions they were not the best decisions but it comes from a whole history of unresolved issues and i think that is what you learn as as a as a performer you learn to empathize with these really dark parts of yourselves and you don't judge it because that's not your job your job is not to judge it your job is to bring it out so other people can see it and reflect on it and go oh right what was the question again i can't remember well you kind of answered it so it was it began curiosity based so i guess then the question would now be at what point did you start to realize like you're doing your own healing and growth work i think it was when my second year acting teacher sent me to the therapist i was like what how dare you right what do you mean i have to go to therapy so what happened was i was in i was failing basically we were all put on probation we were in this again competitive environment where we there was a cut system we entered with 22 people into a very competitive uh conservatory environment and we graduated with 15. you're all put on probation for the first year by the second year i was still on probation if you're on probation for two more semesters you're out and i'll go oh my god i can't i can't get you know that would be a no-no um so here i was i was overachieving again i'm like i'm gonna prove to everyone that i'm not gonna fail so instead of presenting uh one final scene for the end of the semester we're doing chekhov and anton chekhov wrote very bleak plays that reflected you know russian like just the russian like life you know out in like this just heart harsh bleak uh melancholic characters who were alcoholic who had gambling issues like he wrote like really dark things um in seemingly very ordinary um life and that was what was really disturbing about a lot of his work because it was quite ordinary and so i decided to do three scenes with three different scene partners back to back to um to show that i was good enough right and and what happened was because i did three back-to-back scenes i started to and i was playing this character yvonne and who ends you know the climax of the play is that he feels super despicable as an awful human being because he hurts his wife so badly he cheats on his wife with this like young maid he has gambled all his money away he's married his wife who's jewish for her dowry and he himself has no money and he's borrowed all this money that he can't return and so here he is having this affair he hates his wife and resents her because because she had to convert to be christian her family disowned her and so he now has no doubt he has no money he's broke and he represents the wife they're not in love and she's sick you know she has like this you know she has this like uh disease that is basically terminal and so he he goes into this this space where he basically insults her and says you're gonna die and starts calling her all these like awful racial slurs and then he realized oh my god what am i doing i'm a terrible human being and at the end he has this meltdown he goes oh my god i'm a terrible human being being will you forgive me i'm despicable i'm awful i'm awful awful and i literally felt that because of what i was going through at the time i felt johnson's an awful person for hiding from you know i was still also hiding i was trying to be like straight and like be like this straight actor yeah you know hiding from people um i'm i'm hiding from you know i'm not telling people about you know my family i'm still like repressing a lot of my my emotions i feel terrible because i feel that you know my acting professors think i'm a terrible actor um and and so i actually feel like a despicable human being and so then the two merged and i literally didn't have a meltdown as the character i had a meltdown as johnson and i went into this like state where i was curled up into a ball in in the acting studio shaking and convulsing because i i got the character confused with me and it it became a bit psychologically damaging to the point where i couldn't leave that emotional state and and everyone realized in class that something was wrong here i was known like there was not the separation the safe separation of actor and character and and my teacher literally gave like the whole class a talk about acting is not you know a psychological therapeutic release if you have issues you need to go see a counselor therapist and i felt even worse i was like oh my god so then he sent me off to the therapist and i did and i actually didn't find it helpful because in therapy they kept me diving into the past and analyzing and i'm already a very analytical person so they had kept me analyzing why i think the way i think what i do what my actions i i choose um and relating it to a particular scenario from the past so in that context it was always going to be everything i do now is a result of something that happened to me in the past and that for me perpetuated this victim mentality like i couldn't change it so in therapy i would just literally cry myself like i would leave feeling worse than i did because i was like oh my god i have more issues and it was like i keep doing this because of that so i kept equating something to the past and it was more in like meditative work the shamanic work where there was more of this empowering quality of wait a minute yes that's where it comes from and now what let's take the the the symbol of of let's say like like for example for me one of the things was like a neck thing my neck was really forward i would hold my posture out like this and and i would like i didn't realize at the time but i'd be walking out like a duck like my head was and then my body was like way behind me and my back was like it was all types of weird my posture and so so that's my physical symbolically metaphorically what that was representing was my fear of coming into my heart space so if i pulled my head back and stacked my head up over my heart you know you would see that the head and hearts bridged by the neck and throat and in order to do that i needed a sense of safety and trust that everything was okay and i i could not allow everything to be okay if if i kept seeing the world as this doggy dog scenario so i needed to learn how to trust to be okay with people and i had to do a lot of bodywork actually for that i had my teacher like one of my female teachers she would hold and cradle my head and neck it was on our private one-on-one table sessions and she would literally just hold it very lightly do the lightest little traction and she had the sweetest little angelic voice and she would say imagine your neck being long and free and and she would say some other things softening the jaw it was so simple but in that moment i felt a mother's love that was me projecting of course that i never got from my mom my mom's like the opposite she's like a thunderbolt hurling through the sky she's crazy fierce you know and this woman is like i'm like oh my goodness this is what i've always wanted as a child and in that release i felt safe and i had to practice that over and over and over again um and in in allowing the safety to be there for a longer period of time and then being curious as to oh how can i keep this more oh wait a minute i need to change the way i'm looking at the world oh okay so yeah curiosity is key because if we're not curious we don't even know it's trauma you know we're just like oh that's just how the world is yeah i just lash out and react at people violently all the time that's how the world is so yeah curiosity i think is is super important yeah that's so powerful so how did you go from like how did you step into who you are now both in terms of coming out but also realizing that theater wasn't the path for you and then beginning to do the work that you do today well so i realized that on stage and i had this on off relationship with theater i had this dream of like going to la and auditioning for sci-fi shows and just being this alien i loved i loved star trek and i loved aliens and sci-fi and there was this fantastical escape element that always intrigued me because i always felt alien and another as a child so i always resonated with the aliens on tv shows i was like oh that's me i'm the alien alien me so so then when i realized that wait a minute that's just me being you know escape here that's that's probably not so healthy um in diving into more of the meditative work because i realized that wherever i went i was there and i had you know it's making lots of mistakes i i would run away from new york and i i would take all the money i saved up waiting tables uh because you know that's that's the thing you do in new york you wait tables you act and wait tables you act uh and so i took all my tip money and i would just fly away just to escape and have a different experience but i couldn't run for my thoughts and from my head and and i think it was doing that a few times and making the same mistake that i realized okay i need to do something about this and then i realized it that acting was not actually grounding for me because as an actor you're you're constantly put into situations where you have to deal with rejection you audition for 100 gigs you probably get two right and then you also there's an integrity question you know how many times do you wanna do i wanna audition for the the geeky um you know engineer on some tv show or or whatever it is you know some where you get uh typecasted and so you have to navigate what your heart desires and also to eat like okay i have to do these things because otherwise i won't get seen and i shouldn't say no and so this integrity piece comes into play and i realized wait a minute why am i doing this am i doing this to therapist myself or am i doing this because i generally love the art of storytelling and actually what i really loved was stage work where i felt this meditative flow of living life larger than it actually was on the day-to-day that's what it felt like on stage for you know an hour and a half two hours of doing a show you're so focused on the other actor on the story on delivering something that's on a truthful it becomes this meditative energetic flow that's how it felt for me anyway then i realized wait a minute i can do this in meditation i can sit and when i started to realize oh it's the same feeling um that's when i started to slowly make the shift into really going more on the healing path and and then i had a big ayahuasca plant medicine experience when i was 26 and that changed everything for me because i realized i went in with the intention asking ayahuasca the the the medicine and i communicated with her and i said where am i meant to go can you please show me am i meant to continue forcing down this path of actor which felt like an uphill battle everywhere i went it was like so hard or do i go down um something else do i go down more this yoga healing path which i already was on but i wasn't fully embracing and i was split between two worlds and she opened the door and just showed me this other healing path and it was frightening and exciting all the same time i saw spirits everywhere i saw shadowy things i saw really bright angelic deities i saw all the stuff that was hovering around everyone in that room i saw it very clearly and then i was like no i don't want to see this and i try to close my eyes but it was still there it was like okay so this is my answer i didn't realize it at the time but in retrospect i was like oh i'm being shown that i can tap into the unseen realities and so go there and so it took me another year to like accept that and i was like oh no god i just i'm going to shut that door again and then i went back the acting route right so i had a bit of a push to pull with it and then eventually i embraced it and then i came back to acting again like about five years ago and and i was you know in singapore i lived in singapore for six years and i did shakespeare in the park for 30 000 people in the park for a month and we had like 2 000 people every night in this massive park and it was merchant of venice beautiful performance but i still felt a little hollow at the end of the performance i i thought why am i not why am i not in love with this and i realized that i okay i i've actually grown out of this that that my journey into acting was really just for me to learn more about myself to send me off into this healing journey so now i just tell stories through helping people with their own stories and that feels more aligned with where i am now yeah that's amazing and so how did you begin to do the speaking and the writing and the coaching that's that's an interesting thing too i think everything happens by i don't want to say accident but it's when one door closes you decide to close like okay that's the end of that chapter of my life of and you commit your your energy to a new direction i wasn't sure where i was going it's like okay i'm teaching so here i am teaching and then teaching led to you know i opened up a studio in in singapore you know and and so i had this boutique studio we did yoga and pilates meditation we did workshops we did retreats all over southeast asia but then that didn't feel quite right and then there was you know in meditation sometimes you get you get intuition you get visions and you get shown things and so it's like oh okay now i'm in australia right so i was like okay why am i here and and and i've learned that whenever i get shown something or or experience something sometimes it comes through feeling in the body and it's just this this download of feelings it's like a like a picture book like a cartoon book this is where you must go you don't know exactly where you're gonna go but if you don't listen it's gonna it's gonna feel difficult and i've learned that and i i've gone i've i've heard and i've listened and then i've shut the door i'm like no no i don't i don't want that my ego goes no no i don't think so you must be wrong up there right but but i i i think a lot of the the writing and the it's just it was again it was intuitive it was it was inspired from a place that is other than my own and and like i never well a psychic once did say oh you're going to write a book this was like in my 20s i'm like what are you talking about this is crazy so but then in the moment i was like oh wait something's coming something's coming in and telling me to to go into it because i was actually i started writing um i was writing something more for a training manual for meditation teacher training and then it turned into more storytelling because i felt the only way i could authentically share about altered and expanded states of consciousness was through personal uh experiences and then it just started to morph into this and of course with my theater background it was just the way that i was writing and i i never you know ever considered writing a book because but i did journal you know i and so that kind of just took on its own life and and i think the speaking naturally was me bridging this aspect of me that has always wanted to perform but instead of performing as a character i'm just talking about myself and my experiences and and hopefully that might reflect something that is like a hidden seat of potential in someone else and so it was kind of bridging the theater world and the spiritual world together and that's where that happened and so now it's kind of come full circle which i didn't understand at the time but it's like oh right that's why i went to theater school right i got i got it now it makes sense we don't know we don't really know why we're doing things sometimes when we're in it and it's only like you know 10 15 years we look back we're like oh [Laughter] exactly to kind of wrap up the whole conversation what is one thing that you wish you would have known back when you were a child or a teenager i think i don't know i think that's a hard question because on one hand i think i learned a lot through pain and then on an on on another hand if i were to go back and tell young johnson something it would be to to trust with more ease that the universe has got your back that pain is temporary right the sensation of getting your heart broken by your parents or from a future lover or whoever it might be from not getting the thing you want trust that it's going to be okay that you that the world is actually a safe place and i think that peace of safety if we all if we all just realize that it's not the way that we make it out to be because it's it's what we're projecting out into the world then then we allow ourselves to do more we could because if we're not safe we can't create because we're we're in this fight flight mode right it's that first stage of maslow's hierarchy of needs we got to get food water shelter we need love and affection and all these things to make sure that we're we're okay if we're not okay i mean we're just gonna keep fighting for those things so that would be the one thing i think i would tell my young self yeah it's beautiful we're gonna link to everything of yours in the show notes but before we sign off tell everyone where they
