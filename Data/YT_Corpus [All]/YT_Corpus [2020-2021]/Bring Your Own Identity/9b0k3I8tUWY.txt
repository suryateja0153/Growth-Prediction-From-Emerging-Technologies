 this video I'm going to show you how to change your current vibration for your current identity for the year 2020 your identity is what's keeping you in your Kurt vibration and when you change it you change everything in this video I'm going to show you how to do that welcome back to another video my name's Aaron and I help people expand their consciousness now in this video I'm going to be sharing with you how to change the vibration of your current identity so that you then create a completely new reality in 2020 and the 2020 I'll say first off as well I believe that the vibration on the planet is continuing to raise as it raises things keep happening easier than ever and it's not even that the planet itself is raising although I believe it is it's that we are raising our vibration and as we raise our vibration the things we think of come to fruition easier and quicker than ever so right now your current reality is a reflection of how you think how you feel and how you act this is your vibration and your current identity the way you view yourself is what is keeping your vibration on autopilot think of it like your vibration is the way that you see yourself and you're doing everything you can to remain consistent to that if you see yourself as unworthy then you'll constantly find reasons to feel unworthy and you'll also be projecting that energy out and other people will respond to you in that way if you see yourself as somebody that has to work at 9:00 to 5:00 job something you're not passionate about then you will experience your thoughts emotions and actions will be equal to the story you tell yourself that you have to work a 9 to 5 job that you're not passionate about your reality is a complete reflection of the current identity you are embodying so the first part about this is understanding that the story you tell yourself is what's keeping that vibration in place and I used to have a story that I had to work a nine-to-five job selling women's shoes I was not passionate about it I told myself a story that it was very hard for me to focus and that I wasn't able to meditate because I've seen boring that was the reality I experienced and there are many people you'll see and you can hear their stories in their own language their language they'll be talking to you and they'll be like oh yeah but this is the way it is you got to have a job you got to have you got to you got to pay the bills and that story is what keeps that reality going now you could say well it's true you do have to pay the bills but the means to pay your bills does it have to be a job you're not passionate about could you at certain point change your story to give it like a movie everyone has in a way that you are the star of your own movie or you're the Cameo of your own movie if you're not embodying that star role now imagine that at a certain point in your story you just decide you are going to go for once you are passionate about and when you make that change then that puts you on a different timeline you see you change the script that's exactly what I did I change the script at a search story that was on autopilot I worked in sales for years and then I was like you know this just isn't working for me I'm making daily I'm making weekly videos on YouTube I have to change something if I want to change my reality so and then what I did is I changed my identity I changed the way that I saw myself instead of me seeing myself as someone that has to work a 9 to 5 job I said this is Who I am I am somebody that creates daily videos on YouTube because part of my identity is I am a full-time youtuber so therefore I started to wire that in no matter what the outer reality told me no matter if people said oh this video zooms cringy or whatever it is I decided this is Who I am I'm going this direction and then eventually reality began to change on the outside because I would be on the way I was currently thinking at that time I went beyond the feelings I was feeling a majority of the time and I went beyond the actions I was taking for majority of the time so in 2020 it's really about you going beyond your current identity of what is comfortable if you stay with what is comfortable then you'll continue to get the same reality you've got from the last period of time for the last years and most likely that's just completely on autopilot if you want to change your reality you have to go beyond what is comfortable beyond the current thoughts feelings and actions and that won't always feel comfortable but guess what you did not come here to only feel comfortable I believe you came here because you had a mission and that mission is for you to do what you're passionate about and to create life on your own terms not on the terms that somebody tells you you have to do it this way your family members tell you that this is what you're meant to be doing this is how the that would make them feel comfortable if you would act to this way your friends and family asking you to be the way that they're always expect you to be but guess what part of the reason you're here is to go beyond to go beyond that shell and then to emphasize to other people through the way you are being that they too can go beyond how they are currently thinking feeling and acting and that would they go beyond how they are currently feeling thinking and acting they too can get amazing results and you will be a leader in that way does not mean you have to share this information as your passion it could be but it doesn't mean it has to be it could be just by you embodying the true vibration of who you are and you being passionate about it and then going hey this person is very passionate about what they're doing and they do it without needing other people to validate them that's impressive maybe I could do that thing that I was thinking of for so long but I never actually did and then you inspire people through your beingness to do that and I believe that the people that are watching my videos now I believe that you are at the leading edge of this transformation I believe there's a transformation happening on the planet more and more people are waking up every day to who they are that they can live their purpose and that they can be who they really are without the confinements of society that tells them how to live and tells them the way to be and I believe that you are at the leading edge of that and you can help other people to wake up as well but you first off just need to embody that energy yourself maybe you already are but regardless this is about you coming into your own power you've been the star of your own movie because whatever your identity is the way you see yourself that's why the first step to this process is knowing how do you see yourself if you see yourself as somebody that's trapped in a belief system somebody that's trapped doing something you don't love then that will continue to be a reality and your thoughts your feelings and your actions will be consistent to that identity because that's the way you see yourself here's the thing most people just aren't aware of how they see themselves they see themselves as somebody that has to live in that story that's just the way reality is that's not the way reality is that's the way that reality has become comfortable and I'll show you something right now this right over here is something that I did that like this Tony Robbins thing that I went to with Victor my buddy Victor odo moving to Tony Robbins for six days and on it you become aware of a lot of your rules you have and the values you have which are kind of like boobies you have towards values and rules that you want to be driven by and you have a way values and rules this is my mission statement I look at it every day the purpose of my life is to be loved to enjoy life and to raise my vibration for myself and how others do it too that's my mission I believe that's many of your missions too by the way is to raise your vibration and to help other people do it too now there's towards values anytime the ideas contribution any time I remember my intention to help others and anytime we've added value to others any time I'm doing these things I feel these emotions it's very easy for me to feel these emotions because I make it easy anytime I feel loved time I put attention to my heart very easy to do now away values comfort is the top of the list I realize you want your away values to be ones that will hold you back from achieving your dreams the one thing that will hold me back from achieving my dreams is comfort if I get comfortable with thinking feeling and acting and consistency to just making videos on YouTube I'll never actually live out my full potential and even before that I was comfortable at that nine-to-five job that I had and I was just getting by with paying the bills guess what I wouldn't be able to live life on my own terms making YouTube videos traveling the world and living where I want and would live in the lifestyle that I want comfort in 2020 will be the thing that holds you back from becoming the true expression of you of who you are and remember how you think feel and act is your vibration and that is simply up into this point but on autopilot and been extraordinarily comfortable and to really achieve your dreams in 2020 what you must do is go beyond how you think go beyond how you feel and go beyond how you act you must make a choice and as you make that choice you begin to go beyond and guess what when you do that consistently the reflection you get in outer reality will then begin to change and you'll look back and go wow I'm in a completely different reality now this is completely different now one way you could do this in 2020 is to simply do something your current identity would never do your current identity would be afraid to do I did this in 2019 in in some ways might one of my intentions just see when it's one of my power virtues was courage playfulness grateful and determined these are these are power virtues that I need to achieve my vision my dream courage playfulness gratefulness determination the one of them is playfulness so what I decided to chose in 19 I was going to do that my old identity would have never done is I'm gonna dance more often dancing was something I always told myself a story I'm not good at dancing I don't do very often so what I did in 2019 is I anytime I had the opportunity I push myself to dance I went to that place a Costa Rica there was an aesthetic dance thing there were other there was like a wedding that I went to that I decided no I didn't have to dance where a lot of people stand around I said okay no I'm gonna go dance by doing that I broke out of the old identity which says Dancing's not very comfortable I'm not very good at dancing you know what I found out push myself to do it come on oh I got it I'm not the most amazing dancer which maybe is the story I tell myself maybe it's true but I can enjoy it and get into it and keep a beat so how do I get there I uncomfortable I started to dance anytime the opportunity came up instead of saying That's not me I don't want to do that I'm gonna go do that thing I'm gonna go for it then the thing when you go to a Tony Robbins event by the way as well you're gonna dance every like hour and a half I'm gonna get up and dance to keep you awake because you're there for 13 hours a day in a 40-degree room so that's the idea is in 2019 what I encourage you to do is to do something you have never done before and that by doing something you've never done before it will begin to change your life in a very powerful way now this is the key is challenging so first off becoming aware of the old self-image and becoming aware of it and seeing it as seen almost as the old version of you because then you begin to take it out of the identification I'm aware of the old self-image the old version of me that was afraid of dancing was a Iran not even Aaron a Aron was afraid of dancing by giving you the name I didn't able to separate myself from that identity there it is a Aron afraid of I afraid of dancing that's not even me anymore though in 2019 I danced and I enjoyed it too and it allowed me to become more playful allowed me to open up my sacral chakra and my different lower energy chakras and to enjoy myself you see so their identity becoming aware of it then challenge it second step challenge it challenge your belief system and when you challenge your belief system when you challenge that I identity by doing some that identity will never do would never do you then ask yourself this question well if that's not who I am and I can do that then Who am I really and when you look at who you really are you'll then notice that your life begins to change because you are inviting a new vibration then the key is consistency with wiring in that new identity something you do every day that wires in that new vibration for me I was the old vibration the nine-to-fiver a a Ron who needed to work a nine-to-five job to feel comfortable who was afraid of making daily videos on YouTube I saw that and then I said no I'm gonna challenge that by making daily videos a part of my daily practice was every single day I'm gonna make a video because this is what I'm passionate about I'm gonna do that no matter what for a year straight within 2 or 3 months my YouTube channel went vite with much more viral I went from 3,000 subscribers to 100,000 and then I was able to quit my nine-to-five job so challenge it and in your daily ritual have something you do that wires that if maybe if you are trying to become more able to dance and and be free in your body every morning you put on a song and you would dance and guess what the first 5 to 10 days may be not a big difference but you do it let's say three months straight you start to see yourself in a new way you're not just a a run your errand so yeah that's the metaphor and when you start to see yourself that way guess what that's when things begin to change this is about shifting your identity you have an identity look a little belief system that says this is who I am most people 99 percent of people are not aware of their self-image therefore they're living in comfort they're living on autopilot and they're getting the same reality that is equal to how they think feel and act that's the first step becoming aware second step simply challenge that belief system do something that identity would never do go dance go decide you're going to do your passion every day go for that job you were afraid or simply decide that you're going to challenge it and then thirdly wire it in with and actually do every single day that then begins to change your life in a very powerful way and one thing you could do as well because you can wire that in and change your subconscious mind about who you are now something that I have for this is something I'm going to be offering is that of the all axis transformation pass which is 11 all of my top transformational courses you can get right now
