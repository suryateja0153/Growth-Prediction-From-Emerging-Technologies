 hey everyone it's like almost 1 30 in the morning i'm sitting in bed and last week was a very intense week for me where i just did not feel like myself i am currently with a cold and i think i have fall allergies i've had fall allergies i think for the past like three or four years now so i probably don't think i know i wanted to do a quarantine diaries entry for this one because i'm getting like really real with you guys this is gonna be i think the 13th one but i wanted to talk to you guys about my identity crisis i don't know who the heck i am and for my entire life i still have not figured out the answer to that question i mean do you know who you are beyond your name who are you can you describe yourself in one word two words three words a sentence i definitely shared this on my instagram sometime last year when i changed my username on youtube and instagram i did a post on it explaining how i came up with this username the problem is i don't feel like it's me but at the same time i do feel like it's me i'll link that instagram post down below in case you want to know why or how i came up with this name but i also shared that in my teen years i had over 70 usernames at the time i was using aim aol instant messenger and i just kept coming up with username after username and obviously that meant i had a million emails to make those screen names i copied a lot of my usernames from other people people i didn't even know a lot of my usernames were anime based because i love anime i also took inspiration from the internet some felt like me but there were more that just didn't feel like me at all and that's why to this day anytime i start a new game i just cannot come up with a username i never had one in the past where i just use the same one across all platforms and that's why i'm the absolute worst with usernames when i started on social media i started with my blog then i started on instagram and then i started my youtube channel i changed my username on my blog three times so in total i had four usernames which meant that on my youtube channel and my instagram i had to change my usernames too hell i even changed my description box and my bio on my youtube channel a million times already that's just how clueless i am about who i am but in my description box if you scroll all the way down you'll see that i do link my instagram handle and my pinterest handle i changed my instagram handle last year or this year because i just gave up on it i gave up instagram because it was just too stressful for me to be on that platform i felt like i just didn't want to advertise my youtube anymore it was too stressful for me so i changed it to a form of my name and in the end i just thought about it last week the person that i am am i just my name as for career options i have no idea what i want to do and i'm trying to do this all alone which i know is not the best thing because there are resources out there the problem is that i can do anything i'm a really fast learner and i absolutely love learning and there are so many things that i think about that i want to do but i just don't know how to settle for one thing and it's not to say that i'm restricting myself to do one thing because in this day and age it's like people aren't just their job titles they're also this and that and this and that this and that but for right now i just don't have any title i still don't count myself as a youtuber even though this is just what i have been doing full-time and i kind of don't want to be a youtuber for a while i did but really reflecting on myself and a little bit into my future i don't see a future for myself on youtube so i came up with this question about why i have an identity crisis why i don't know who i am why i can't just figure it out and that's when am i myself and i actually wrote down in my notes for this video that i don't know when i feel like myself but just a second before picking up the camera i realize i'm myself with my husband i am at my rawest or is it most raw realist self with my husband i actually firmly believe that i found my soul mate we say the same things we think the same things sometimes we finish each other's sentences we can talk about virtually anything and everything and i think i'm gonna do a video about how you know when you are your true self or what is your whole true self just keep an eye out for the video if you haven't subscribed to my channel definitely recommend subscribing so you don't miss that and a bunch of other live chats so i actually don't even feel like myself on youtube and when i first started my youtube channel back in 2017 i really did feel a little bit more myself than i ever felt when i was a teacher because teaching is just not me i wasn't myself only because i was super nervous because i was just starting and i didn't really know how comfortable i would be talking to a camera but then as i eased into it i think i really became comfortable with not just talking to a camera and not just knowing that there are people out there who don't even know me that are watching my videos but that i became comfortable with myself that i talked so much and my whole life i never talked and i have so much to say and i have so much knowledge and expertise to share with you guys and that just comes from personal experience as we all have i remember a long time ago there was like this survey or one of those tests in a magazine and the question was describe yourself or ask somebody to describe you in one word my brother was sitting next to me on the couch in a living room and we were watching snl i asked him describe me in one word and he goes goofy and that fit me so well and i tell you guys i don't feel like myself on youtube anymore because i'm not goofy i mean sure you'll see my personality come out every so often but to be honest i'm both serious and goofy and when i do these live chats with you guys i don't always feel like cracking jokes sometimes i do although sometimes i really want to because everything is just so depressing and when i do these live chats i just don't want to depress you guys i mean they're not supposed to they're supposed to just tell you guys that you guys are just never alone in what you're going through just like in this video like if you have an identity crisis too just join a club it is so welcoming here i did talk about my social media journey and a video about a couple years ago or last year even and i did feel like myself when i started my blog because i was always a really good writer and when i finally started a blog as an adult because i used to have a blog as a teenager i felt like i could really do something with it but i just don't understand why my personality just doesn't translate to anywhere no matter where i go for some reason my personality who i really am just gets completely sucked into a black hole never to be seen again so i'm going to conclude this video with saying perhaps the question is not who am i but when do i feel like myself and i think once you address that question and you really think about those moments those times the people around you even by yourself that you are your whole complete true self then it might give you a little bit of a revelation as to who you are and how that translates to what you do in your life unfortunately for me since i feel my true whole self with my husband does that mean i'll be a housewife for a while i was thinking that maybe i should just settle for being a housewife but i'm very goal tripping and i love seeing progress i love working so i don't really know what the future holds but for now at least i can really appreciate having somebody like that who makes me feel my whole complete self like comment share this video if you haven't subscribed already i would love to have you here i have related videos to this crazy struggle that i will leave on the screen for you to watch any of them next
