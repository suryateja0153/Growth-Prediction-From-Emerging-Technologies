 have you ever looked in the mirror and thought oh  my god what happens i think most of us probably   have particularly those of us that are moms but  where does our identities go when we have kids   does it just hop on the bus  and leave us what happens hi   i'm shelly i'm a mother a mental health  professional and i have a speciality in   perinatal and infant mental health and  i've helped hundreds of women just like you   to nurture their relationships with themselves  and nurture their relationships with their babies   if you're interested in more tips tricks and  techniques on transforming families from the   inside out then i invite you to subscribe to my  channel hit the notification bell so we'll post   every week and also hit the like button  and share with friends let's get started so what actually does happen to our identities  when we become parents well i think first of all   we need to work out what identity is now identity  is really what makes us unique what makes us   an individual a person and it's made up of  our experiences to date it's made up of our   core beliefs the conditioning the upbringing the  environment it's also made up of our temperament   our personality and the nutrition we were fed  the environment i think i've already said that   but all that um and also the way that we look  so the genes that is given to us um when we are   conceived so there's a lots and lots of different  things that kind of go into forming our identities   and we all like to think that our identities  are fixed and i think for the most part they are   um you know like temperament is  fixed and the way we look is fixed   unless you obviously try and change that  cosmetically but that's fixed so there is   there is certain aspects of our  identities that are fixed but there's also   certain aspects of our identities that  can be changed so things such as our um   core beliefs and our thinking so the way that we  see things that have happened to us the way we   tell our story of our life our narrative around  that all those things are perceptions and can be   changed depending on how you see them and what you  think about them um obviously experiences to date   and what's happened to you can't be changed  that's happened but the way you perceive them   the way you think about them can be changed but  anyway identity is a whole host of lots of things   kind of coming into one package that makes you  unique as you are today at this moment in time   so when we become parents society allows us to  believe that our identities just get lost that   we no longer are that same person that motherhood  has come along and taken that away from us and now   we are a parent and that's that so what if instead  of losing our identity when we become parents that   we actually just rediscover our identity you know  we are learning something new we're learning a new   technique and you um parenting is a new technique  and use new skills that we learn every single day   like you would with a job and that's helping us um  grow and discover and ask questions and be curious   because we need to know more about parenting our  children and doing this learning the knowledge um   seeking out other things that helps us to  then create new experiences for ourselves   and new thinking and new thoughts which then gets  put into our identities so we're not losing the   identity we've still got our identity because  we have to have we've got those that are fixed   those things that make up identities that are  fixed but we can also add on top of that and   start to actually discover a little bit more about  ourselves that perhaps we wouldn't have discovered   before having children because we wouldn't have  been learning these other new experiences and i   guess that comes with everything in life as well  not just parenting that our identities do mold and   evolve as time goes on and the experiences that we  kind of pull together in and start learning from   so the next time that you look in the mirror and  think oh my god what has happened to me actually   just reframe that reframe the thinking and think  to yourself wow look at what has happened to me i   have rediscovered myself i've got all these  amazing new experiences that i've collected   over the years whilst bringing up my children this  new knowledge this new curiosity this new learning   my children have taught me all these things  about myself that i would never have discovered   beforehand and you know not discovered if i  wouldn't have been a parent and just appreciate   that fact that you are a parent and it's a  blessing well i hope you enjoyed this video i'll   be back again soon so take care and don't forget  to subscribe if you haven't done bye for now
