   (MUSIC PLAYS)   FRASER WILSON:   What do they say about us? CAITLIN HARPER:   They think we're dating. FRASER:  I think they think we're weird. Does that bother you? LUCA GUADAGNINO: We Are Who We Are mostly is,  a tale of change. I believe that people, we all go though processes in which we really don't know who we are. And we really need to experiment  who we could be.  And this for me, fits every  generation. JACK DYLAN GRAZER:   Fraser and Caitlin, their relationship was by destiny's chance. They are so similar in that they both need each other in this world. JORDAN KRISTINE SEAMON:   Caitlin struggles definitely  with identity. Fraser helps her evolve and he teaches her about the world outside  that military base. CAITLIN: Why are you following me? The stuff you wear is inappropriate for what you're planning on doing. I'm not planning on doing anything. I was messing around. Who do you think you are? You don't know anything about me. (COMMAND CALLED) The rigid nature of the army and, there's just not as much room  for expression. So I think that it's more of a stifling environment. Which is interesting to explore. I know my men, ma'am. Just going on that roller coaster ride... What!? ...and that journey, of  the drama, the love, the loss. All of that, kinda works together, you know? And it paints  a beautiful story. LORENZO MIELI:   What Luca has been attracted  by the beginning,  was to describe but pretend  to be observer, of sentimental issues, about teenagers and the rest of the world around them. LUCA: A very immersive  experience into  the identity of people  that I love to describe.  In a way this immersion,  into the mindset of all these  characters...  for me, because this is really  kind of driven by behavior and less by action, I think this is going to be almost a trip for audiences, because you immerse yourself into this kind of fractured,  real landscape of identities.
