   [THEME MUSIC]    AS OF 2017, ONE IN 25 AMERICANS HAVE TAKEN DNA TESTS. MORE AMERICANS ARE USING DNA TO FIGURE OUT THEIR ETHNIC IDENTITY AND TRACK ANCESTRY. A 2019 STANFORD UNIVERSITY SURVEY OF 110,000 AMERICANS FOUND DNA TESTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE USED BY LATE GENERATION AMERICANS OF BLACK, WHITE OR MULTIRACIAL DISSENT. WE'LL MEET A SCIENTIST WHO USES DNA TO TRACK HISTORICAL HUMAN MIGRATION PATTERNS. AFTERWARDS, WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE CROSS-SECTION OF DNA AND SOCIAL MEDIA. THEN WE WILL SEE HOW PHOTOGRAPHER IS PUTTING PEOPLE IN TOUCH WITH A DEEPER SENSE OF THEIR ETHNIC HERITAGE.  DNA IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR SELF-DISCOVERY BECAUSE IT'S A LENS INTO HISTORY. HISTORY IS IMPORTANT TO ONE'S UNDERSTANDING OF ONESELF OR HOW ONE FITS IN AND HOW SOCIETY IS STRUCTURED OR ANYTHING, IT IS A GOOD TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING HUMANS OR ANY SPECIES CAME ABOUT TO WHERE THEY ARE FOUND NOW. MY NAME IS MICHAEL HICKERSON, I'M A PROFESSOR AT CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK. I FOCUS ON USING THE GENETIC INFORMATION THAT WE CAN USE TO INFORM ABOUT THE HISTORIES OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES. THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE AMOUNT OF GENETIC DATA AVAILABLE FOR COMPARISON HAS EXPONENTIALLY EXPLODED. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE RESULTS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMERS ARE BASED ON SPECIFIC METHODOLOGIES THAT HAVE THEIR OWN LIMITATIONS. AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE THE UNCERTAINTY AND COMPLEXITIES UNDERLYING THESE METHODOLOGIES. IN 2014, WE CONDUCTED THE NEW YORK CITY STUDENT ANCESTRY PROJECT. WE BROUGHT TOGETHER 200 STUDENTS FROM THE NEW YORK CITY AREA AND THEY TOOK PART IN THIS DIRECT CONSUMER DNA TESTING. THEY USED A COMPANY CALLED NATIONAL GENOGRAPHIC. REALLY THE PRIMARY GOAL WAS TO GET UNDER THE HOOD SORT OF ABOUT HOW THESE METHODS ARE USED AND DEVELOPED AND REALLY TO HIGHLIGHT THE UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING THE KINDS OF RESULTS THAT ONE WOULD GET. WE FOUND THE SAMPLING OF 200 STUDENTS WAS A PRETTY GOOD WIDE SAMPLE OF HUMAN GENETIC DIVERSITY. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY WHO HAVE IMMEDIATE FAMILY FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE WERE CURIOUS HOW MUCH HUMAN DIVERSITY WE SAMPLED. WE DID PRETTY MUCH GET A HUGE AMOUNT OF THE DEPTH OF THE SO-CALLED GENETIC TREE. ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE DNA ANCESTRY PROJECT IS THAT IT CATALYZES UNDERGRADUATE COURSE THAT I TEACH EVERY TWO YEARS. THE WHOLE IDEA IS THAT INSTEAD OF BEING SPOON FED BY THE COMPANY RESULTS, ACTUALLY TAKING THEIR OWN DATA IF THEY VOLUNTEER TO DO SO, AND USE THIRD-PARTY ANALYTICAL TOOLS TO DO THEIR OWN ANALYSES. PEOPLE DO HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF REACTIONS. OFTEN IT IS ON THE ORDER OF I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL TO, THERE SOME STORIES IN OUR FAMILY MAY BE CORROBORATED BY SOME OF THIS OR LEADS TO OTHER QUESTIONS. ONE AMAZING RESULT THAT CAME OUT OF THIS STUDY OF THE ANCIENT DNA IS CONTRARY TO WHAT WESTERN HISTORIANS HAVE BEEN PUSHING OVER THE LAST COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS, THE TAINO PEOPLE, THE TAINO CIVILIZATION WAS NOT COMPLETELY WIPED OUT AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF COLUMBUS AND EUROPEANS. A LOT OF THEIR DNA IS FOUND IN TODAY'S PEOPLE WHO ARE DESCENDED FROM CARIBBEAN PEOPLES. I'VE HAD CARIBBEAN STUDENTS TALK ABOUT STORIES FROM THEIR FAMILY, GOING BACK HUNDREDS OF YEARS. SOMETHING LIKE THIS SORT OF CORROBORATES WHAT THEY ACTUALLY HEARD FROM THEIR GRANDMOTHERS, GREAT-GRANDMOTHERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THERE'S A BOOK TITLED, THE SOCIAL LIFE OF DNA BY ALONDRA NELSON. THIS BOOK CAME OUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO. SHE CAME TO TALK TO OUR CLASS. GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW GENEALOGICAL TESTING COULD BE USED AS A POLITICAL TOOL. AS A WAY OF TYING PEOPLE TO THE PAST THAT HAS BEEN ERASED FROM THEM. I KNOW GENEALOGICAL TESTING HAS BEEN USED AS A TOOL TO MAYBE GAIN REPARATIONS IN THE REPARATIONS MOVEMENT. PROBABLY EVERYBODY ON THE PLANET HAS COMMON ANCESTRY GOING BACK A COUPLE THOUSAND YEARS. THESE TESTS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN WITH REGARDS TO HOW MUCH ANCESTRY THEY CAN ACTUALLY CONTAIN. MY FATHER TOOK PART IN THIS ALSO USING ONE OF THE COMPANIES. FOUND HE HAD A LARGE CHUNK OF GENETIC ANCESTRY CONSISTENT WITH SO-CALLED NATIVE AMERICAN ANCESTRY. IT COULD MEAN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS OR NOTHING AT ALL. IN MY OWN RESULTS, ACTUALLY DID NOT INHERIT THAT CHUNK OF DNA. IT ILLUSTRATES THE FACT THAT WE ONLY GET HALF THE GENETIC INFORMATION FROM EACH OF OUR PARENTS AND THAT IS HAPPENING SEQUENTIALLY EVERY GENERATION. THIS ILLUSTRATES REALLY NICELY THAT IN JUST A BUNCH OF GENERATIONS, MORE THAN A DOZEN GENERATIONS, THERE'S DIRECT CO-ANCESTRY BETWEEN THESE TWO VERY GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTANT INDIVIDUALS LIVING TODAY. OF COURSE, BACK IN TIME THERE WERE FEWER PEOPLE. GREATER AMOUNTS OF INBREEDING. THE POINT HERE IS YOUR ACTUAL GENETIC COMPONENT IS A TINY FRACTION OF THAT. AND IT'S HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO RANDOM SAMPLING PROCESS. AS FAR AS HOW THESE RESULTS ACTUALLY DEFINE WHAT IS A PERSON I DON'T REALLY DELVE INTO THAT AREA. I LEAVE THAT UP AS A PERSONAL DECISION. IT MEANS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.  ACCORDING TO M.I.T. TECHNOLOGY REVIEW, IN EARLY 2019, MORE THAN 26 MILLION CONSUMERS ADDED THEIR DNA TO FOUR COMMERCIAL ANCESTRY AND HEALTH DATABASES.  I ORDERED THE KIT. I JUST SPIT INTO THIS TUBE.  DNA TESTS CAN BE PERSONAL BUT MANY PEOPLE LIKE TO SHARE THEIR RESULTS WITH A BROAD ONLINE CROWD. THE WORLD OF DNA ONLINE SHOWS A RANGE OF REACTIONS PEOPLE CAN HAVE TO THEIR OFTEN UNEXPECTED RESULTS.  22.5% EUROPEAN.  I DID A SKYPE INTERVIEW WITH A SOCIAL INFLUENCER WHO TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE IDENTIFIES THROUGH HER DNA TESTING AND CONNECTS TO AN AUDIENCE. SO, GROWING UP AND BEFORE YOU DID THE DNA TEST WHAT DID YOU MOSTLY IDENTIFY AS?  GROWING UP I HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT MY HERITAGE BECAUSE I IDENTIFIED MOSTLY AS EUROPEAN, CAUCASIAN. I KNEW I HAD SOME THAI BACKGROUND BECAUSE MY DAD WAS BORN IN THAILAND. I WANTED TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT. ALSO THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT MY MOM'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY BECAUSE I KNEW MY GRANDMOTHER WAS RAISED BY SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT HER FATHER AS WELL. A LOT OF MYSTERY ON BOTH SIDES OF MY FAMILY. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT ANSWER A LITTLE BIT OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD.  SO YOU GOT THIS TEST AND YOU DECIDED TO MAKE IT INTO AN ONLINE VIDEO. THIS IS A PERSONAL THING. YOUR GENEALOGY IF YOU WILL. WHY DID YOU MAKE IT INTO AN ONLINE VIDEO?  HONESTLY AT THE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GOING TO BE FUN AND ENTERTAINING. I'VE WATCHED A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S RESULTS. IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE GET THEIR RESULTS. I DON'T THINK I REALIZED IT WAS GOING TO BE REALLY EMOTIONAL FOR ME. I'M EXCITED. I'M NERVOUS. I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO FEEL. I'M SUPER EXCITED TO DO THIS VIDEO FOR YOU GUYS. FOR CHRISTMAS, I GOT A ANCESTRY DNA KIT. I BEEN WANTING A DNA KIT, LITERALLY FOREVER. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW. I THINK HAVING A MIX OF ALL TYPES OF CULTURES IS BEAUTIFUL. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO GET THESE RESULTS. LET'S JUST GO AHEAD AND GET TO THEM. THERE'S 23% EUROPEAN JEWISH. THAT'S MY HIGHEST PERCENT. NEXT HIGHEST PERCENTAGE IS GREAT BRITAIN. YOUR DNA SHOWS YOU HAVE ANCESTRY FROM GREAT BRITAIN AND LINKS YOU TO THESE SPECIFIC REGIONS. GEORGIA AND FLORIDA SETTLERS. MAKES SENSE. EAST ASIA IS 13%. 11% SCANDINAVIA. 6% EUROPE WITH 9% ASIA CENTRAL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?  CENTRAL ASIAN AND EAST ASIAN.  I'M EVERYTHING.  I REMEMBER BEING STRUCK BY HOW YOU WERE PSYCHING YOURSELF UP TO OPEN IT. WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND AT THAT TIME?  I WAS JUST REALLY EXCITED. IT'S SOMETHING I'VE HEARD ABOUT FOR A WHILE. HAVING SO MANY MIXED RESULTS ALLOWED ME TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WITH EVERYONE A LITTLE BIT. WHEN YOU HAVE A SPRINKLE OF ALL OF THESE RANDOM ETHNICITIES I THINK IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL. I THINK ALLOWS YOU TO IDENTIFY WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE.  WHAT WAS YOUR PREVALENT UPBRINGING. THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU?  WE HAD A FEW HISPANIC PEOPLE IN MY SCHOOL. MAYBE TWO OR THREE ASIAN PEOPLE. EVEN THE KIDS I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH, THEY DID NOT LOOK AT ME AS ASIAN. I HAVE MOSTLY EUROPEAN FEATURES, TO MOST PEOPLE. I HAD HISPANIC PEOPLE WALK UP TO ME AND START SPEAKING SPANISH AND ASSUME I UNDERSTAND. MOSTLY CAUCASIAN, AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH.  SO NOW THAT YOU FIND OUT THAT YOU ARE 25% JEWISH, HAS THAT CHANGED HOW YOU LOOK AT LIFE OR LOOK AT THE WORLD?  IT REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY I LOOK AT THINGS AND LOOK AT LIFE AND EVERYTHING. IT'S A LOT TO PROCESS. TO LEARN A WHOLE NEW CULTURE AND RELIGION, NOT THAT I'M CHANGING RELIGIONS, BUT I JUST REALLY WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT.  YOU ALSO LOOKED INTO BIRTHRIGHT?  I LEARNED ABOUT BIRTHRIGHT ISRAEL. I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO POSSIBLY GET TO GO AND LEARN MORE ABOUT IT. I FOUND OUT THE CUTOFF AGE IS 32 AND I WAS FULLY EXPECTING TO GO AND THEY CALLED ME FOR ONE LAST INTERVIEW AND THEY BASICALLY SAID WE'RE SORRY YOU HAVE NOT ALWAYS KNOWN YOU ARE JEWISH. BEING THAT YOU FOUND OUT IN AN UNCONVENTIONAL WAY AND THAT YOU DID NOT GROW UP CELEBRATING JEWISH HOLIDAYS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER YOU THE TRIP. IT'S STILL REALLY BITTERSWEET WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT.  YOU SAID AT THE END OF THE DAY THESE ARE ALL JUST PERCENTAGES. IT DOESN'T EFFECT YOUR IDENTITY. THIS IS JUST YOUR GENETICS. HOW DO YOU THINK IDENTITY AND GENETICS, HOW TO THEY PLAY TOGETHER FOR YOU?  I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING. AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE, THAT ALLOWS YOU TO RELATE TO OTHER PEOPLE. YOU HAVE A KINSHIP IN THAT. I WANT TO HAVE THAT CLOSENESS WITH THE THAI PEOPLE. I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO THAILAND NEXT MONTH FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. GETTING TO MEET MY THAI RELATIVES THAT I'VE NEVER MET OR SPOKEN TO, SO I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.  NOW THAT YOU'VE JOINED THE RANKS OF PEOPLE DOING THE DNA TESTING AND KIND OF BECOME ONE OF THEM, IS THERE A COMMUNITY OF DNA TESTERS OR IS IT JUST, I DID IT TOO AND THAT'S IT.  IF THERE'S A COMMUNITY I DID NOT GET THE INVITE AND I AM UNAWARE OF IT. I KNOW IT'S KIND OF A TREND.  DID YOUR ENGAGEMENT RATE HAVE ANY BARING, YOU DOING THE TESTING? MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE FOUND YOU THROUGH THAT?  MY CHANNEL DEFINITELY GOT A BOOST AFTER I POSTED THE VIDEO. A CHUNK OF SUBSCRIBERS COME FROM THOSE VIDEOS AND CONTINUE TO COME FROM THEM. ACTUALLY MY NORMAL CONTENT IS NOT ANCESTRY RELATED. IT'S MORE LIKE INTENTIONAL LIVING TYPE STUFF. IT WAS KIND OF OFF BRAND FOR ME TO POST THAT VIDEO. I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH THE VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT WATCH MY VIDEOS. I WAS REALLY SURPRISED THAT IT GOT THE TRACTION THAT IT DID. I DEFINITELY THINK THAT IT HAD A HIGE FACTOR IN IT. BEING ABLE TO HEAR SOMEONE'S STORY AND FEEL THEIR EMOTIONS AND GO THROUGH THOSE STEPS WITH THEM I THINK THAT WAS THE MAIN REASON PEOPLE WANTED TO SUBSCRIBE.  DO YOU THINK DNA TESTING IS IMPORTANT TO DO? DO YOU FEEL YOU ARE SOMEWHAT RAISING AWARENESS?  I THINK IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE YOU COME FROM OR WHO YOU ARE, IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF MYSTERY IN YOUR FAMILY BACKGROUND, I THINK IT CAN BE SUPER HELPFUL. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS AS ACCURATE AS I ONCE BELIEVED OR HOPED IT WAS. ALSO, IT DID LEAD ME TO FIND MY FAMILY AND ANSWERED ALL THE QUESTIONS I NEEDED ANSWERING. FOR THAT REASON I COULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.  AS A PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHER YOU'RE REALLY WORKING WITH EMOTIONS, WITH THE PERSON. SO AS THEY GET INTO THEIR HAIR AND MAKEUP, THE CLOTHING, THEY START TO THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES AS WHO AM I, WHERE AM I FROM. MY NAME IS BROOKLYN MCTAVISH, I'M A PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST, FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON ETHNIC DIVERSITY THROUGH DNA ANALYSIS. I'M TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE THROUGH PHOTOGRAPHY ABOUT HOW SOCIETY VIEWS US ETHNICALLY AND HOW OUR ETHNICITY CHANGES SOCIETY. WELL IT STARTED OFF WHEN I WAS ABOUT 14 OR 15. I WAS REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOCIETY SAW ME AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN. I WAS BORN IN FORT GREENE, BROOKLYN. MY MOM IS FROM NORTH CAROLINA. SHE IS THE SECOND GENERATION BORN OUT OF SLAVERY. MY FATHER IS FROM NIGERIA. WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOU GROW UP IN A DIVERSE CITY LIKE NEW YORK, OTHER KIDS DON'T CARE WHAT YOU ARE. BUT AS YOU GET OLDER ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY, PEOPLE START TO TREAT YOU DIFFERENTLY. WHAT ABOUT OUR SKIN COLOR MAKES PEOPLE SO FEARFUL OF US AND HOW COME OTHER PEOPLE COME TO THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE NOT OF DARKER MELANIN GET A PASS? THAT STARTED ME THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANS TO BE DIVERSE, WHAT DOES ETHNICITY DO? AND HOW DOES THAT EFFECT YOU AS A PERSON BECAUSE YOU ARE BEING JUDGED BY THINGS THAT ARE NOT REAL. SO WHEN DNA FIRST CAME OUT PEOPLE WERE KIND UNDERSTAND WHAT DOES IT MEAN? HOW CAN YOU USE DNA TO EXPLAIN CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT YOURSELF? I KNOW I HAD ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH IN ME. MY MOTHER'S SURNAME IS WATSON. HER MOTHER'S SURNAME IS MCCRAY. WE KNEW IN NORTH CAROLINA WE HAD CAUCASIAN RELATIVES. BUT BEING THAT I KNEW SO MUCH ABOUT MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN SIDE OF THE FAMILY, IT WAS REALLY TRYING TO PUT MORE POINTS ON THE AFRICAN SIDE OF ME. WE KNEW WE HAD CAUCASIAN RELATIVES. WE KNEW WE WERE HEAVILY MIXED ON MY MOTHER'S AND GRANDMOTHER'S SIDE. IT'S JUST HOW LIFE WAS FOR PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH. ON MY FATHER'S SIDE, BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH SAMPLES THERE, I REALLY COULD NOT BE SURE. THE THING THAT STRUCK ME THE MOST WAS PART OF ME WAS GERMANIC, ABOUT 1% SWEDISH AND 1% GERMAN. VERSUS THE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF AFRICAN AND SCOTTISH DNA WITHIN MY PROFILE. ON THE AFRICAN SIDE, BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS MORE IN ORAL TRADITION, A LOT OF PICTURES AND PHOTOGRAPHY IN WEST AFRICA AT THE TIME, SO EVERYTHING WAS PASSED DOWN THROUGH THE TRIBE. YOUR GRANDMOTHER, GRANDFATHER, THEY KEPT FAMILY TRADITIONS ALIVE SO WHEN I WOULD GO BACK TO NIGERIA, I WOULD HEAR STORIES OF UNCLES AND GREAT UNCLES WHO DID THESE AMAZING FEATS AND WHERE THEY LIVED. THINGS THAT THEY DID. I KNEW THE STORY BUT I DID NOT HAVE DATA TO BACK IT UP SO DNA BECAME A WAY OF HAVING DATA TO PROVE OR DISPROVE THE STORY. THE THESIS PROJECT I HAD IN MY MASTERS PROGRAM WAS CALLED THE SUM OF THE SOME OF US. THE THESIS WAS BASED ON LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL AS THEY ARE TODAY AND ASKING A QUESTION, WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE AS AN AMERICAN. ARE YOU WHITE, BLACK, MIXED RACE? WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE? AND THEN, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE NOT THIS THING? WHAT IF HE FOUND OUT YOU HAVE MORE EUROPEAN IN YOU THAN AFRICAN OR YOU HAVE MORE AFRICAN IN YOU THAN EUROPEAN BUT YOU LOOKED WHITE OR LOOKED BLACK? WOULD THAT CHANGE YOUR EXPERIENCE? PHOTOGRAPHY BECAME A WAY TO VISUALLY REPRESENT THAT. BASED ON OTHER STUDIES INTO DNA. THE PROJECT WAS TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION, MAKE IT MORE TANGIBLE THROUGH EXPERIENCE OF GOING THROUGH AND CHANGING HOW YOU LOOK TO BE MORE ALIGNED WITH YOUR ETHNIC BACKGROUND AND WHAT THAT EXPERIENCE WOULD BE AND HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. THE SUBJECT SELECTION WAS A RANDOM PROCESS. IT STARTED OFF WITH PEOPLE WHO I KNEW THAT WERE INTERESTED IN KNOWING MORE ABOUT THEIR PAST. I TRIED TO SELECT PEOPLE FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE THAT I HAD IN MY TEST POPULATION. DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS. THE POINT IS TO PROVE WE ARE ALL RELATED. SCIENCE TELLS US WE ALL ORIGINATED FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR. AND AS WE MIGRATING OUT OF AFRICA DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE SUN AND INTERBREEDING WITH OTHER SPECIES OF HUMAN AT THE TIME THAT GAVE US OUR DIFFERENT LOOKS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. TRYING TO FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER AND REALIZING THROUGH THEIR DNA AND ORAL TRADITIONS THEY WERE VERY SIMILAR. FIRST WE DO AN INTERVIEW AND WE CAPTURE ORAL TRADITION, YOUR STORY, BEFORE YOU TAKE THE DNA. IN THE SECOND PHASE WE PUT YOU THROUGH THE DNA PROCESSING AND GET YOUR DNA BACK. FROM THERE WE LOOK AT IT TOGETHER WHAT YOUR DNA BREAKDOWN, WHAT WE CALL YOUR ETHNIC ESTIMATES AND WE DO RESEARCH INTO YOUR CULTURE AND INTO COSTUMING. FROM THERE WE CONSTRUCT COSTUMING BASED ON ORAL TRADITION AND DNA EVIDENCE AND THAT'S HOW WE GET PORTRAITS. THE COSTUMING TAKES THEM OUT OF THEIR EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE. THERE'S AN OLD SHAMANISTIC WAY OF VIEWING THE WORLD, THAT IN ORDER TO BRING NEW THINGS INTO THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO BREAK THE OLD THINGS. BY DRESSING PEOPLE IN THE GARB, THE HAIR AND MAKEUP OF THEIR CULTURE, TAKES THEM OUT OF THEIR EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE AND TRANSPORTS THEM TO THE WORLD IN BETWEEN. YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE, BUT YOU ALSO ARE WHO YOUR FAMILY LINE AND TRADITIONS WERE. BY BRINGING THOSE THINGS TOGETHER THROUGH THIS VISUAL MEDIUM GIVES AN EXPERIENCE TO STEP OUT OF THEIR DAY-TO-DAY. ONCE WE DO PORTRAITS YOU GO THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE WE HAVE A FINAL INTERVIEW AND THAT INTERVIEW COVERS YOUR ENTIRE EXPERIENCE. AND WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE VERSES WHAT YOU ARE TODAY AND DID THAT CHANGE YOUR VIEW OF THE WORLD AT ALL. SO I'M GOING TO SAY THAT 80% OF THE SUBJECTS WERE IN AWE OF WHAT THEY FOUND OUT. A LOT OF THEM DID NOT HAVE A CLUE WHERE THEY CAME FROM. THEY HAD A STRONG ORAL TRADITION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD FAMILIES THAT WERE STILL ALIVE, SOME PEOPLE WERE ADOPTED. DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEMSELVES. WHEN WE GOT TO THE COSTUMING PROCESS, THEY ARE SITTING IN THE MAKEUP CHAIR, THE FACT THAT WE SHAVE YOUR BEARD OFF AND PUT A FAKE BEARD ON YOU THERE WAS SILENCE. WHEN PEOPLE STEP OUT OF THE MAKE-UP CHAIR TO SEE THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR AS HOW THEY WOULD BE REPRESENTED AS THEIR ANCESTRAL PAST AND PUTTING ON CLOTHING, SOME PEOPLE FELT LIKE THIS WAS LIKE BEING AT HOME. THE MOST COMFORTABLE THING EVER PUT ON AND IT FEELS LIKE ME. ONCE WE DID THE PORTRAITS AND WE EDITED THEM DOWN SOME PEOPLE CRIED. SOME PEOPLE SHOWED IT TO THEIR PARENTS, THEIR PARENTS CRIED. WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT THIS IS WHERE WE WERE FROM. IT'S PLEASING TO SEE PEOPLE ARE AWARE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BUT ALSO THERE ARE COMMONALITIES. THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE THEY QUESTION THEMSELVES, THEY START TO QUESTION HOW THEY VIEW OF THEIR PEOPLE. WHEN YOU FIND OUT YOU ARE A PERCENTAGE OF SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE CAN BE CHANGED BASED ON THAT, IT'S A PALPABLE THING. SOMETIMES IN A POSITIVE WAY, SOMETIMES IN A NEGATIVE WAY. FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND AMERICANS AS A WHOLE COMING OUT OF THE ERA OF SLAVERY INTO FREEDOM, THERE WERE RULES. THE ONE DROP RULE. IF YOU HAD ONE DROP OF BLACK BLOOD IN YOU, IF YOU WERE WHITE, YOU WERE BLACK. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK IN REVERSE. IF YOU HAVE ONE DROP OF WHITE BLOOD IN YOU, DOESN'T MAKE YOU WHITE, IT MAKES YOU BLACK. AND SO PEOPLE HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THESE CONCEPTS AND AS MORE PEOPLE SEE HOW CONNECTED WE ARE GENETICALLY, THOSE CONCEPTS, THOSE OUTDATED CONCEPTS, SHOULD BE QUESTIONED. AMERICA, DIVERSITY IS A BLACK AND WHITE THING. IT'S NOT A BLACK AND SPANISH THING. IT'S NOT A WHITE AND ASIAN THING. IT'S THAT A RIGHT WAY TO DEFINE YOURSELF AS YOUR MOST DOMINANT SIDE OR WHAT SOCIETY DEFINES YOU AS? I BELIEVE IT SHOULD OPEN A GREATER CONVERSATION ABOUT DIVERSITY. DNA IS ONLY PART OF THE STORY. THE PROJECT AND MY ART HELPS FURTHER THE CONVERSATION ALONG. WE WILL TAKE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT YOU FROM ORAL TRADITION, FROM YOUR FAMILY EXPERIENCE, WE WILL TAKE FROM YOU WITH THE DNA TELLS US SUBMERGING THESE THINGS TOGETHER IN YOUR OWN HUMAN EXPERIENCE I BELIEVE INFORMS WHO YOU ARE AND HOW YOU INTERACT WITH SOCIETY AND CONVERSELY, HOW SOCIETY INTERACTS WITH YOU. ONCE WE COMPLETE THE WORK, THE INTERVIEWS, LOOKING AT THE DNA, DOING RESEARCH INTO THE CUSTOMS FOR THE COSTUMING, IT'S SUCH AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE EVERY PERSON IS UNIQUE. YOU GET TO CHOOSE FROM A KALEIDOSCOPE OF PEOPLE AND EXPERIENCED FROM PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE BEEN FROM HOUSE OF LORDS OR COMMON PEOPLE. BEING ABLE TO BRING THOSE THINGS TOGETHER VISUALLY TO TELL A STORY FOR ME IS A MOST UNIQUE EXPERIENCE.  THAT'S OUR SHOW FOR NOW. IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU SAW, LOG ONTO OUR WEBSITE AT TV.CUNY.EDU. I'M MINNIE ROH, SEE YOU NEXT TIME ON SHADES OF US.   [THEME MUSIC]
