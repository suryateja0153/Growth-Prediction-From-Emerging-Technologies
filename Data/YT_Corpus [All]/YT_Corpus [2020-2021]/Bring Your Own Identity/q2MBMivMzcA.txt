 [Music] let's think to ourselves for a moment how many of us feel completely ourselves at work if you did it if you did not immediately jump to a yes answer to that question then you are like a lot of people in the working world and you did think yes chances are you will be leading or managing others who will not answer that question in the same way so we all have something to learn about healing or communication to our identities whenever those identities may be and identities in the workplace are increasingly important studies are showing that job seekers look for more diversity of identities and inclusion at work and studies also highlight problems for example according to one study one in three women do not feel comfortable expressing contrary opinions at work without fear of repercussion so we have work to do to help us better tailor identity our communication to our identities we draw on lessons from communicating with mastery by JB's from a chapter 6 of the book he lays out a framework that leaders can follow to better authentically communicate to fit our identities we call this the four C's clarity confidence competence and connection as leaders we need to hit on all four of these to authentically leverage our identities in our communication I will start by talking about clarity and my clarity is essential for communicators of all backgrounds but also why I have found clarity to be particularly important to me as a gay man clarity is simple it's really about choosing words and saying them and a way that removes doubting ambiguity for your audience to improve our clarity there are a few rules we can follow the first is to be mindful of the diversity of your audience if you are leading a team diversity of backgrounds some of the expressions you might be comfortable using in corporate America will not resonate with everyone for example if you are in professional services you may have heard people say things like oh let's just run it up the flagpole and see if anyone's gonna lose it a much better way to make the same point it would be to say let's check with upper management and see what they think of our idea so you want to be careful about using idioms that will not make your message clear to everyone on your team second use concrete and specific language instead of pronouns and generalities when I first started working at consulting I had a partner who used to say that pronouns are poison when I would present to him and use a pronoun he would stop me and he would say wait who is it or who are they and after many rounds of this I got this point in seeing when you throw around so many pronouns antecedents your audience will quickly lose track of what you're saying and your clarity will plummet as a result so your audience will thank you if instead you avoid some of those pronouns and use concrete and specific language instead finally sequence certainty if I you say to a member of your team hey it would be is it due on Friday is that not due on Friday when we use hedging language like perhaps or maybe or sort of are kind of we make our mutt our message much less clear to our audience so again let's do our audience a favor and speak with certainty this way our message will be more clear the report [Music] I have found clarity to be particularly important to me and my identity as a gay man before the GSB I was working overseas in a country with less than stellar LGBT protections and when I was talking to a government official our conversation got into personal chitchat territories he asked me whether I had a girlfriend back home I thought about what to say I decided to say no I have a partner back home and I emphasized that word to my appreciation he understood what I meant and he proceeded to ask me about my partner back home in Seattle in this instance one conscious choice of clear language helped me to make a more productive and authentic relationship with this official so I hope that this gives you some techniques to follow to improve the clarity of your communication I'll now pass it to edge a to speak to you about confidence if a Boise news says you cannot paint then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced that's Benson mango now we cannot all be master painters realistically but we all want ourselves to reach our full potential and to step into our power especially as the woman in the audience too often we get perpetually underestimated so here are a few strategies to help us build and project our confidence strategy number one be courageous and step up woman research has found out that our women are very very unlikely to apply for a job until they feel they're 100% qualified whereas men feel a lot more comfortable applying even when they have just a few of the qualifications and let me tell you this holds true even here at the Stanford GSB recently a female classmate of ours reached out to me and asked me for help with her application for venture capital job a few days later she told me that the deadline had passed but she hadn't applied because she felt like she was under qualified so this is the best Business School in the world and this woman had come from a top consulting and even she had such such strong doubts about herself so woman in the audience and the men who are our allies let's make a commitment to each other to have a seat at the table and apply for that job strategy number two so as you can see woman get interrupted disproportionately often and so Francis break from Harvard has a great strategy for us when we anticipate being interrupted make your point at the very beginning of the story so when you do get interrupted you're still gonna get credit for having made that point and then you do get interrupted our very own Ellison has a great strategy to deal with it which is with humor and we examine at the table very confidently remember Thank You Leila that's a great point it was also a great point when I made it ten minutes strategy number three reduce the apologies again as Allison has taught us woman's who often start and end a conversation when I'm sorry but there's no point for us to apologize unless we're actually sorry and as long as we feel like we have a valid point we should feel comfortable taking space in the room for example if there is an act of fire hypothetically speaking excuse me may I have a moment is not the right opener an alternative and potentially life-changing exchange would be hey there's an active fire let's go I'm going to pass a possible to Leila to talk about competence confidence without competence is a little bit like icing without cake delicious but it's probably not something that you would want to serve at your dinner table a few years ago at work I got feedback from my boss he said that I wasn't doing a good job of demonstrating my competence why because I speak pretty confidently relative to other women so it was difficult for people to distinguish when I was strongly stating hypothesis versus stating facts that I had done a lot of research on so how do you make sure that you actually demonstrate your competence while also remaining true to your identity there are two main levers doing good work and actually doing good preparation good work is relatively straightforward do your homework put in the time to prepare on topics that you're speaking about good preparation is much more nuanced because it first requires you to understand the biases that your audience will have about you because of your identity then it requires you to actually deliver the message that you want to send while remaining true to this identity and staying authentic you can do this with three kinds of speaking tools vocal tools verbal tools and visual tools for example as a woman in addition to the bias that I described at the beginning I tend to appear smaller younger and more inexperienced than men and I have less gravitas what do I do vocally I try to make sure that my voice doesn't go up and down in the middle of my sentences and that I don't end my sentences on an upward note which is a common pitfall with females verbally I try to make sure that I actually have strong synthesis and that I line up supporting details behind things that I'm sure about and then visually I try to stand straight and take up space to increase my gravitas remember to stay authentic in the midst of all of this one of the best communicators I have ever worked with was a 5 foot 1 woman who led a team of army generals I have such strong memories of her sitting at long conference tables surrounded by large men with loud voices she typically be in a light pink or light under suit and yes no one ever questioned her competence because she acted like herself her voice was soft yet it would still carry she made her points and then back them up so stay off Montek now I'm gonna hand it over to Mike to tell you a little bit about connection thanks Leila that's a great story in fact stories are one of the most impactful tools we can use to connect with our audiences think about story time when you're a kid or the last meeting you were in you often remember the story more than the actual content JD's Shaun's book talks about the value of embracing your personal identity to bring a connection to your audience and allow them to gain a perspective on your viewpoint these authentic stories can make your communication all the more impactful now one of the identities that he talks about in the book is that at the rope now we all know your first few weeks on the job can be quite challenging this is actually one of your best opportunities to build connection with those around you now let me show you what my first JM job looked like before I understood this important secret hey Mike welcome to your first day at Stanford Capital Partners let me tell you a bit about how we run our Monday morning meeting look look boss I have a pretty good idea of how to run this back when I was at Harvard Capital Partners we started by talking about our layoffs then about our weekly profit how do you think that this was a missed opportunity first we start on a job this is the ideal time to build connections to build allies before you ever need them in other words I need to put cookies into the jar before I start taking any out second it's a great opportunity to ask questions so that you're curious and hungry as time goes on it will become much harder to ask those dumb questions and third I should avoid references to my prior job and not think about those differences as raw well it can be helpful to provide an outside perspective you need to embrace the culture and the processes of your new firm now let's try this one more time hey Mike welcome to your first day at Stanford Capital Partners let me tell you about how we run our a meeting we usually start by running through an update on the pipeline of our exciting projects how does that sound to you boss that sounds great in fact I was going to talk about the new communication optimizer project I have some great customer stories but I also think your perspective would be helpful think you could help me run through the presentation sure by the way how some Johnny's baseball team yeah so remember take advantage of being a rookie build connections tell stories set yourself up for success in any new environment so we hope that you now understand the importance the four C's well you may not conquer and master the entire grid you can use these techniques to improve your effectiveness as a communicator by doing so you can embrace your own personal identity to excel as a communicator and believe it empower your team's and inspire your audiences thank you now like they open it up for questions [Music]
