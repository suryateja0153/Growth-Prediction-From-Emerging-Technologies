 let's talk about the identity stuff so i'm i'm not totally sure where to start but like how how does somebody sort of like identify what their current identity is so that they know to even shift it yeah well even even then they have to understand why they would want to the way i explain it is uh it will go a little science so the left brain will come back to right brain so to understand why we even want to shift it because that's part of like okay what is that why isn't the point of it because some people be like what's the why would i do that ah how's it gonna help me here's how so if you think about it like i i have this picture in my head of identity equals success and the success let's put a thing whatever you want to be if you want more money you want a better body whatever whatever your version of what you want to achieve maybe what happens is that the equal sign is like the dash on like somebody's you know you know called casket it's the important piece and it really is so if you think about the science of the brain if somebody said hey who are you there's a part in our brain called the default mode network dmn actually and it lights up when your identity is is engaged here's a crazy thing when i ask you who you are it shuts down the rest your brain lights up and starts describing things you've done or you've accomplished or it's weird right because it's attributes of that thing because you're thinking about who you are i'm a dad and i'm a father and i'm a but it's interesting because that's not really communicating who you are because you can also say your dad and you can also say you're a mom and you can all say your business owner is that who you are right but here's a crazy thing if i'd stopped talking to you and you went to daydream and you started thinking about how you felt about the job or the person or your judgments you see it's interesting now that thing lights up because now you're you're not thinking about it like who you are is coming to fruition in fact it's like the natural organic flow that's just who you are so it's crazy who you are is who you are when you're not thinking about who you are make sense it's always the inverse right it's super but weird now now how does that tie the success okay so that means the way that i am that's pretty much how i i just am i'm being we'll call it and that is essentially how you just operate like i operate i mean when you think about someone operating like they're just in flow i'm like the the baseball player that feel like that the ball is in the air he's not thinking about right foot left foot by hand here he's just in flow yeah that ball snatches out of here stripping the ball from adrian peter peterson all that dang dog you know it's secondary nature you're not even processing your body just reacting that's your identity that's who you are how you respond to situations how you have conversations how your face looks when somebody says something to you if you flinch when somebody you know steps into you these are the things we don't think about all day when somebody cuts me off in traffic my boss says something so i just reacted i'm not even thinking about it that's who you are how you operate now how you operate determines how you perform now whether i perform consistently or poorly or well it's due to the way i see a problem approach an opportunity if it's an opportunity or a problem to me all these dynamics but it will determine how i perform high performer low performer how i perform determines my success i perform well as a baseball guy again right i've practiced i've done all this stuff to work on i'm a baseball player and i react and i flow like this balls of the air turn cut run do i perform this way to catch the ball my performance gives me a good success more money better team better you know i get to start whatever it is and so for a lot of people not understanding that realistically that identity that you can actually craft you can architect and it's not this woo-woo thing it actually comes from actions that you do you have to in fact like architect it create what you want and then you program it by taking action literally what it is it's just it's kind of that simple but not but i do things and after a while it becomes this new normal for you now i'm operating differently and i perform differently now i have success that's the first part of it so that is why it's concrete in my head for people to uh to do that now a lot of people unfortunately like i just gotta work my mindset man i know what to do i gotta work on my mindset i all the time i know what to do i got to do it oh yeah cool all right you would have done it by now how long have you been trying to do that oh like six months a year okay i would have done in six hours i'm not better than you it's just who i am to do that kind of stuff and how do we get you there it's a big piece like how do i get somebody at this level well the first part is understand like it's okay to not be great right now it's okay to suck you gotta have a point at which you accept the fact that i'm boo boo trash poo trash we'll call it that's right at that thing right yeah and then you lean into the space of like all right well how do i take these next steps in and essentially what it is is i look at it's called the shift method is what i use c shift sustain too many people go right to the work of stuff we're good at trying to do stuff but the problem is we'll do it haphazardly or halfway or we won't even do the right work we'll end up like the metaphors like you know have a ladder against the building climb this ladder huff and puff get to the top of the building and realize oh the ladder's leaning against the wrong building that's right we end up like it's and it happens for a lot of people they get burnt out they're like i've spent so much time why would i farther ahead by now like what's going on and what it was is you didn't do the right work right that's essentially what it boils down to and the hard thing to do for a lot of people in the very beginning is to go back and say what do i really need to work on that's what i had to do in the business and early on i had to do it in the marriage i had to do it as a parent like a lot of different areas i had to dig in and really take a look and see what in the world is this thing my luck my wife's dropped me a whole bunch of these these yogurts she just dropped like yeah that's the best oh like four of them how many yogurts does she think i need man i'll get my belly big baby [Music] but not like that's the thing is so i gotta figure out these things i gotta work on and it usually comes with a lot of pain of acceptance it's the things that you that you have to admit like i suck at this or i'm not good because if not you don't do the right work and now you end up spitting your wheels and burning out money and burning out energy and willpower you never get anywhere so that's a lot of it for me that's framing as like i suck at this like i don't think most people ever admit that because they're like no i'm good enough or i push through this it's like but now you grounded yourself so damn low you're like i suck at whatever this thing is yeah and it's okay it's the darkness that's what you're talking about how do i get that out well put a put a light on it like i suck at this i'm a sucky bed i'm a sucky husband i'm a sucky business owner because it's okay because now what happens i've given myself permission to pursue better things until you do that you're not going to and so that's why a lot of people will spend time dating the same person with a different name because they never understand how to fix a relationship because it's same person y'all you do this you do this actually the person accepts me for me no no you need to accept you for you first off and then you can be a better human in a relationship because you are not the relationship the relationships relationship you're one of the two people in it and sometimes what you want from a relationship you have to give it's a different understanding and so now that i'm there like all right now i know what to do now i can do the shift work and the shift works the hard actual work most people they don't realize this is a true reality but i hear the statement i've done everything i can i've worked so hard i i don't know what else to do that right there humongous red flag that you got some shift work to do you got to stretch because here's the thing the dream you have is typically up here right i want to have this that whatever this thing is and your level of maximum overwhelm is way down here keeps telling us all i could do i was like no no to you relatively it's all you can do it feels like a lot because you don't know what to do and you're not willing to push more this is that we'll call the comfort zone level people run into right and i had a client on before this and he's giving me this kind of rundown of why he hasn't done some things and what's going on is a lot going on and i say okay hey simple question if i was to you know talk to the person who has all the things you've told me you want would they use excuse you just said about everything being too hard and he sits and he goes no right and it's the truth because when you think about the person who has what you want they don't even blink at the things that are shutting you down right now that's right so how do you expect to have what you want like it's not going to happen and so in the shift work a lot of people my true purpose is to present you with moments where you want to stop i need to get you those levels where you want to stop because just like in a workout when i've taxed myself i'm about to throw up it's only at that moment where i know if i take one more rep i'm getting better for sure because i want to do this right now in life that extra five minutes 10 minutes that extra email that extra video you don't want to do that you'll easily talk yourself out of and like but i got to go and make dinner you got five minutes to record a video woman like you could it's okay you know there is a i think there's a line in uh what can't hurt me um uh with uh jesus the book um yeah can't hurt me david goggins there we go oh yeah you're asking yeah i know i was just trying to make the reference there but what you just said there he always pushes himself like a little further if he has to run a mile he's gonna go like a mile point one or whatever but it's like proving that you can always go a little bit more yeah yeah you always have more in the back and when you when you start to understand that and actually try to do that because one thing to understand it haul a thing to do it what happens over time you just keep stretching and stretching where now it's hard for you is easy that's why people are successful who have the things you want it looks easy it's weird like it just looks like it's so hard because here's the thing it's a statement that i love and i tell people the root of my work is in this what you create creates you [Music] you
