 what's up Greg I hope y'all having a great day welcome back to my channel this of course is another episode of an attempt I will be making an attempt to do something very strange it might work it might not but one thing's for sure it will be in attempt so if you're a frequent viewer of my channel and you saw the title of this video there's a good chance you probably already know what this is about but if you're new here or you're just not familiar with the Paul Zimmer Troy Becker situation basically I've been covering this dude named Paul Zimmer who is basically super popular on tik-tok and then he left because of a controversy he stopped posting and then tried to come back pretending to be a different person but the thing is he didn't even try to make himself look different he didn't even try to make himself seem like a different person I've been thinking a lot about how little effort Paul Zimmer put into trying to make himself seem like a different person so I thought hey why not try to do this I'm gonna do with Paul's of what was trying to do with the troy becker thing but actually try because to be fair i made fun of him a lot for not trying at all but what do you really think about it if you really did try to become a whole different person when you already have a pretty big following would that even work is it possible to change your identity on social media and get away with it so my goal is to make up a new identity basically just invent a new person I'm gonna give them an Instagram and then try to get as many of my followers to follow that Instagram as I possibly can without it being revealed that it's really just me right now as I'm filming this it is 3 o'clock on January 8 and I am planning on posting this video hopefully before the end of January so I've got like a little less than a month to work on this I'm gonna say over the course of a month like a really successful implementation of this would get my other Instagram account up to like 10,000 it's not like whoa you're super famous now but it is like it's a it's a healthy dose of clout it's an it's a spoonful of clout and if I could do that in a month I think that would be success the other aspect of this know is to make this as easy as possible for me because originally I was thinking this will be pretty easy to do if I hire like a professional makeup artist to just make me look different or like prosthetics or something on my face this is gonna be a piece of cake but if I'm really trying to do what Paul Zimmer was trying to do where this could be a feasible thing that I act they continued with I can't just hire a makeup artist every time I want to post on this new account so I have to make this as easy as possible while also being as convincing as possible so my two goals are easy disguise and ten thousand followers will I be able to do it I have no idea I'm really worried the second I posted the first picture of this dude all of the comments are just gonna be like that's you what are you trying to do that's obviously you from there I concocted the perfect plan to fold the Internet I knew from the start I would have to have a convincing reason to be shouting some random person out on my Instagram but luckily a few weeks prior I had posted on Twitter and Instagram that I was looking to hire someone to help me shoot and edit videos so my followers wouldn't be too surprised if a new intern of mine started to show up in my Instagram post I gave this mysterious editor the names Aiden Long's an or just Zaid and long for short when unscrambled the letters of this name spell out my own name I thought this would be kind of clever and a cute touch to my evil plan all right good news everybody Papa got away I also needed to develop a convincing disguise to disguise my hair I decided to go with a wig this way bolt Satan's hair color and length would be drastically different than my own well this was just my disguise hey guys it's me is a long okay look like 2006 Smosh is it is this believable I don't even know if this is on the right way maybe this is the front to avoid wearing any of my own clothes while acting as Aiden I took a trip to Kohl's and headed straight for the clearance section where I picked up a few items that I would never be caught dead wearing and apparently no one else would either because they were on clearance this part was pretty fun cuz I got to decide what kind of persons Aidan would be does he like Rick and Morty Scooby Doo or shirts with lame-ass jokes the answer was none of them with my new wardrobe in place the only thing left to figure out was how I was going to disguise my face since my big fat nose is so prominent I knew I would surely need to do something drastic to alter my face that's when I remembered that face app the app that everyone was using to make themself look old last year has features that allow you to change your face in different ways so I took a picture of myself trying to smile like someone else and got to work trying to make myself look as different as possible the beards look pretty convincing but I ultimately decided to utilize a feature that lets you merge your face with a celebrity's face here you can see me trying it with Justin Bieber and Adam driver look at that that looks like a different person he's got different eye color he's got it he's got facial hair he's got black eyebrows I mean if you saw that would you think that's a different person this is my face merged with Tom Holland it just made me look like a baby after a few more attempts I tried merging my face with Chris Evans and that's when things got crazy whoa wait okay look at this that looks like a totally different person is is it me and Captain America himself had a baby the beard helped so much it changed his hairline I think that might be the winner this is me mixed with post Malone so with my full disguise ready to go it was time to get a move on and craft my first image all right gang it's time to craft the first image so for each and every picture that I post with Zeta and I kind of have to have like a backstory or like a reason for taking the picture what's going on during this picture why are we taking a picture that way it's believable you know I'm not just posting things for no reason to the backstory that I've with for this picture it's sort of like a celebratory picture I just hired my first employee my shooter and editor Zeta is now working for me all right well let's do it note to self this little iPhone grippy it pinches fingers first I took a few pictures of me as myself smiling and then it was Satan's turn now it's time to change into Zaidan for the first time getting into character for the first time was tough both physically and emotionally but once I was there acting as Aiden felt almost natural like it was somehow meant to be I was thinking I should probably make a different smile than I usually make so I tried to make a different smile and looking super [ __ ] creepy I'm really growing through a lot of trouble here I really hope that this works and doesn't immediately backfire and fail alright well only one way to find out while editing the first image I decided to not only use face app to combine my face with Chris Evans but also use Photoshop fix to make even more alterations to my face like narrowing my nose and adjusting my jawline and hopes that altering the shape of my face would further add to the illusion that I was Aiden after all this effort I thought it would be as confident as ever to post the picture but unfortunately for me I was wrong alright so the picture is done I'm done editing it I'm not as confident in it as I thought I would be when I look at it I still see me and I don't know if that's because I know that it's me or cuz it actually looks like me well now I don't know now I'm looking at it again and it looks fine to me it doesn't look like me anymore maybe I'll maybe I'll just I'll just post it if anyone at all says like hey that's that's just you you just edited yourself I'm gonna take it down put it away and figure out a different plan moving forward that confidence in this is so fragile that if even one person sees through it I'm done I have to figure out something else and try it again in a different way there's no way this is gonna post this okay I gotta figure out a caption expect some more production value in my videos very soon I'm gonna make it a little bit smaller so you can see both of our laptops okay I'm gonna post expect some more production value some higher productionvalue maybe yeah I'm second-guessing this so much okay I'm gonna post it here we go your story okay posting now and there's Curtis for this first post I decided not to tags Aiden and that didn't even create his account yet because I mostly just wanted to test the waters and draw as little suspicion as possible it's been seen by ten people I'm gonna monitor my DNS like crazy to see if anybody's DMing me telling me I'm a con man it looks fake again I've been looking at it for too long I've gone insane just then my worst fears were realized I got a DM asking if my Instagram story was the result of cloning oh [ __ ] okay nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope I'm really growing through a lot of trouble here I really hope that this works it doesn't immediately backfire and fail okay I've already got okay nope I got to delete it deleting it oh [ __ ] oh no Danny is that you I'm stressed I thought the guy on the left was you with a photoshopped beer the second I post the first picture of this dude all of the comments are just gonna be like that's you alright deleted that real quick he looks like you're in long-lost twin wow all of the d-ends all of my dams were wow that's just you Jesus man oh god I just got owned so hard okay so I guess new plan we're starting over and we're doing something else I don't know what we're gonna do good that I was monitoring my DNS so that I could see immediately cuz within the first minute I got like I got seven DMS right away that we're like that's you yeah that's a good thing I didn't just leave that up so we're gonna we're gonna try again a different way hmmm alright when I posted that initial picture it was Friday it is now Monday I took the entire weekend to think about my actions and how disappointed I am in myself and now I've regrouped and I'm ready to try this again so there's some good news and bad news from this situation the good news is that when I posted this picture on my story only about a hundred people saw so I was thinking okay this this will be fine I'll just delete that forget that ever happen I'll just you know mix my face with a different celebrity Photoshop it a little bit different and I'll try again tomorrow and see if that works but the bad news is I did not anticipate the first 100 people who saw that story screenshotting it and spreading it all over Twitter I guess I thought that people would just see it and be like ooh that's weird and forget about it but a bunch of people have screenshotted the picture and are now tweeting it at me constantly so now I feel like any time I post someone new on my Instagram story those people are going to immediately know that something is up so I kind of spent the entire weekend feeling like I basically failed this experiment before I really even started it and for a while I was thinking I'm just gonna scrap this idea it's not worth it it's not worth the trouble because enough people have seen the picture now that I've basically failed the challenge that the challenge was for no one to notice that it's me and everyone noticed every single person that saw the picture notice and I didn't even get him any followers I didn't get the new account any followers cuz they didn't even make it it was a giant fail on my part I felt like a royal doofus but then I began to see it as a blessing I needed to learn the hard way that if I wanted this to work I had to do a lot more than just sit in my dining room and take a few pictures so that's when I devised a new plan I decided to scrap the entire editor idea it was never going to work and past Danny was an idiot and a coward for thinking anything else instead of hiring an editor I was going to make it look like I was going on a trip to see my cousin at his house in rural Illinois by making Zeta and my cousin hopefully people would be much more forgiving if he heavily resembled me so to make this as convincing as possible I got an air B&B for two days so I could take pictures at Satan's house without it looking like my house after that I packed up and it was off to my cousin's house all right so I booked an air B&B I've arrived at the air B&B now I'm at the air B&B feels a little bit weird to be at an air B&B by myself especially since I'm not even staying here I'm just here to take pictures this house also kind of creeps me out it kind of looks like it was built over a hundred years ago and I'm a little afraid to go upstairs so I'll probably be doing most of the pictures down here because I'm kind of worried that this house is haunted I also thought I heard voices when I first walked in so that's also concerned okay and that's kind of creepy I just found a long dark hair on my tripod how the [ __ ] did that get here all right get in alright so I'm back at the Airbnb it's day 2 I'm ready to take some more pictures son when I got here today there was a light on upstairs that I did not leave on I am certain that this house is haunted I don't want to go up there but I have to for the pictures I want to take today so we're gonna brave it together yeah this house is for sure haunted we were these stairs there's no way someone didn't down these stairs I spent those two days doing nothing but planning and taking pictures of myself and Zayden I knew my old antics just wouldn't cut it so I decided to go all in fully immersing myself in the role I knew I was born to play I ate as Aiden drank as Aiden and thought as Aiden but the real work of convincing the public that Zaidan was in fact real was yet to come alright guys well after a pussyfooting around it for a few weeks I'm ready to have another go at it I'm gonna try posting some images I'm spinning in my chair I'm not meaning to do this the chair is just spinning I'm ready to buckle down and make these pictures and post them on Instagram so here's my plane first thing I'm gonna do is post an Instagram story of just me using one of the pictures that I took at the Airbnb saying something along the lines of I'm in rural Illinois visiting family something implying that maybe like a Oh rural Illinois it's just a precondition people to think okay Danny's not at home where is he he's probably off doing something whose E win is that suspicious I feel like I never post about my location like this on Instagram so people will immediately know that I'm lying and up to something if I make it not Illinois should appear somewhere more exciting a Oh rural Minnesota check sure maybe I'll be in Minnesota okay so that's where Zaidan lives rural Minnesota let me just check my DMS real quick and make sure no one's no one's causing a fuss like I I know I checked Minnesota you're not there okay no I'm kidding I'm getting the good DMS like whoa why are you in Minnesota but before I post him at all the first thing I want to make is his Instagram account I haven't set up his Instagram Yas Aiden underscore is underscore long I'm gonna make him my older cousin so I'm gonna make his birthday in 1992 April first his birthday's gonna be on April Fool's Day cuz all of you are gonna be April Fool's for believing this to make us so Graham account look more believable I also needed to follow a bunch of random people so I just went to a couple small colleges Instagram pages went to the list of people following them and just followed a bunch of people might as well give some of the homies an extra follow - drew Curtis shoot I'll give us an extra follow what the heck Satan can like good content right I Oh born to be Zaidan born to be sauce why did Satan autocorrect - sauce born to be sauce alright I'm just gonna leave it that's one's kind of cool [ __ ] I was born to be sauce Chris Evans really burned me before and I never make the same mistake twice so when crafting Satan's Instagram profile picture I decided to use Tom Brady's face this time Tom Brady's eyebrows and overall complexion seemed different enough from mine and I was pretty happy with the end result from there I threw together the first image of Zaidan that I would be posting on my story okay guys the image is done the first image that is prepared to go on my story is done I think and I'm pretty pleased with the final image in fact I even sent it to Laura and she approves and if anyone knows what my face looks like it is my own way so I'm still very hesitant but I think I'm ready to post the picture will I make a complete fool of myself once again we're about to find out right now for the caption maybe I can play off the previous story so I can say like a Oh royal cousin check that way people will immediately understand okay he's in Minnesota because he's visiting his rural cousins Aiden should I tag him in the first one where I'm just gonna tag him in the first one before I was I was testing the waters by not tagging him but it's well I'm not doing this again okay this is it we're going all or nothing this time so I'm not I'm not testing the waters I'm just gonna go for it I'm gonna tag Satan I'll do it just as I would tag anyone else Satan is long I'm just gonna throw that right there as if it's not even a big deal just making it pretty small on the screen and oh god damn that looks like me Oh it'll never not look like me and posted Oh God have people seen it yet okay two people have seen it six people have seen it well people have seen it Oh baby boy you are gonna know aren't they Satan has two followers now three even me and two other people all right let me check my DNS Oh the first DM I get about it is look the same look the same Hey look the same I thought this was you in a wig god dammit oh no okay but but they're not saying this is you in a wig they're saying I thought that was you in a way which is good my heart is beating so fast right now why is this why does this mean so much to me okay I'm getting surprisingly few DMS though that's that's good is this story has now been seen by a thousand people and I've only gotten to DM I would say that that's good cuz last time I got a bunch I think tonight I'm feeling better about this okay before I post the second picture I wanted you know infuse a little bit more realism to it and a lot of times on my Instagram story when I go to a new place I like to post sitting on a big comfy couch on this new couch so since I'm in this new location I feel like it only makes sense for me to post that I'm sitting on a big comfy couch all right we got photo number to complete this one is a beautiful image of Zaidan flipping me off cuz i'm razzing him so i think the tone of this one is gonna be a little bit kind of like messing with him while also trying to get more people to go over and follow him as of right now I think Zaidan has like 50 followers I want to try to increase that baby we're trying to get Satan a big heaping spoonful of that clout for dinner okay the caption I came up with is my cousin thinks she has what it takes to be an IG model please tell him he wouldn't last one day with cloud and then I tagged his Instagram if I know my followers I know a good chunk of them will turn against me and take his side so I'm hoping that'll gain a decent amount of followers from this and pose I'm now realizing that the two pictures of my cousin don't really look like the same person per se I don't know how that happened but that's not good like they kind of have different hairstyles and honestly different skin tones so hopefully people will look past that just go straight for his Instagram okay this person said he kind of looks like if you and Drew had a child together how about me and Tom Brady honey oh [ __ ] okay this person says is that actually your cousin or is it just an edited picture of you I literally can't tell all right I'm gonna count this as I'm still winning cuz she said she literally can't tell another person said I swear at first I thought this was you with a wig you hear that at first so needless to say I'm feeling pretty damn good about this right now oh [ __ ] baby Zaidan long has a hundred and seventeen followers we're doing it now sign okay people are deeming Zeta into tellin it he doesn't have what it takes to be an Instagram model you wouldn't last one day with cloud you won't last a day even with cloud or not okay I think this person just threatens Aten so that's not good oh my god this is this is so stressful but it is fulfilling I do feel fulfilled right now that night I posted two more pictures on my story all to a pretty solid response from my followers so with hope in my heart I tucked myself in for a good night's rest and woke up the next morning ready to continue this sick and twisted charade oh hi dang-son Zaidan now has 2,000 followers on instagram and he ain't even got any posts yet of course people are messaging him that they think you wouldn't last one day with clown one person is encouraging Satan to kill me and take my place what the hell actually a lot of people have been hitting on Zaidan you do got that IG model type doe with a fire emoji someone said you're hot someone said here before a hundred K that's right baby we're getting Satan to a hundred K next up was a rendition of my classic I wear a yellow shirt today Instagram story this is something I do whenever I wear this striped yellow shirt that I own I take pictures of myself from a distance and caption them I wear a yellow shirt today but this time I let my old cousins Aiden get in on the action and with those stories up and most people buying it it was time to start on my riskiest task yet I was going to post a picture on my actual Instagram feed since this picture would reach many more people than my stories I knew Zaidan would get a good boost and followers if this looked good but if it didn't the jig would be up and I'd be out of luck so maybe we should let past Danny work on this for a bit while we talk about today's sponsor hello fresh guys one of my least favorite parts about being an adult is going to the grocery store to buy all the food that I'm gonna eat that week only to remember that I only know how to cook like three things but that's why I think that hellofresh is such a great

spend 20 to 30 minutes cooking with Laura each evening it's really fun to cook with someone else we just like throw on some music and have a little party and every time you cook something new you get

right back to the action though right now Satan has 2343 followers so hopefully by posting this is an actual Instagram picture we can get him a couple more okay so I tagged Satan in it now I gotta think of a caption maybe include something like it's my cousin's birthday that would give me a reason to be shouting him out and also for me to be visiting him my cousin's only birthday wish is to be an Instagram model please donate as much clout as you see fit my only worry is that since this isn't a story and it's a picture there's comments so people read the comments and there are other people saying this looks weird in Photoshop even people who didn't initially think that will start to think that because they'll see other people's comment but I have a plan for that too on your Instagram you can block words from showing up in your comments like if you're sensitive about certain things you just don't want to see comments about certain things you can just add them to your block words list so I think I'm gonna add a bunch of words like photoshop and photoshop and wig to the blocked words list that way no one can comment about those things so people who aren't suspicious won't have it ruined for them you might think that that's Shady and it is alright and share and ok it's up I spent the next few hours monitoring the comments like a crazy person and adding words to my list of blocked words as you can see I ended up having to block a fair amount of words but the result was a squeaky clean comment section okay now time to check out the comments and see if people are suspicious we got clapping I can't tell are you wearing a yellow shirt just a reference to my Instagram story true icons if he wants to be an Instagram model he should post photos on his account seems a little counterproductive okay here we go find me to donate cloud oh baby this is good this is go oh my gosh this is going so much better all right guys it's been three hours since I posted the picture on my Instagram and I'm starting to think we might get away with this low-key this is going pretty well it actually is going a lot better than I expected I mean it's probably cuz I blocked all the words that would allow people to comment their suspicions about this picture but scrolling through the comments they all seem to be focused on other things besides the fact that it's just me with a way everyone's being pretty supportive of seinen I'm actually I'm pleasantly surprised so I guess now we'll just wait and see what tomorrow brings I am excited all right guys the experiment is over I'm cutting it here it's the next day I gave it all night for Satan to gain followers so now it's time to see how many he's got and to see how I did with my stupid little experiment so before I check Satan's follower count remember that my two goals were for Satan to hit 10,000 followers without anyone figuring out that just me and then the second one was for this to be as easy as possible I'm searching up Zaiden and oh [ __ ] baby Satan long has 12.5 thousand followers god damn well point 5 K so for goal number 1 of hitting 10,000 followers I actually got like a hundred and twenty percent that's like a that's like a a plus plus plus that's like a a plus plus plus that being said that there was the other condition of the goal where I didn't want anyone to figure out that it was actually me and I'm pretty sure a decent amount of people caught on if not to the fact that it was me these are the fact that like the pictures were photoshopped in some way or there was something weird going on so maybe I'll just mark this down to like an A plus plus and maybe change this to a hundred and ten percent that seems more fair alright goal number two was this an easy process did I make this as easy for myself as possible so that I could redo this over and over indefinitely forever for this one I'm gonna give myself I'm gonna give myself a solid D minus a good ol 60% if you will now editing the pictures himself wasn't actually that hard it took around like ten minutes per picture some of them took a little longer but in general they took about ten minutes which isn't too bad but if I ever wanted to do like a video with Sadin I don't know how in God's name I would do that I guess I could try like taking a video and then exporting each individual frame as a picture then putting those all on my phone and then manually using face up on each individual picture but even a one second video would be like thirty picture so what is that 300 minutes which would be five hours and also it would probably end up looking like [ __ ] so yeah ease of use gets a d-minus all right so what's my final score if I average these out 110 plus 60 is 170 divided by two is a solid 85% that's like a B huh Abby really that seems like really generous you know what just to be fair I'm gonna knock it down to a b-minus cuz I didn't feel that good about this especially considering the fact that I failed the first time and I had to delete a bunch of comments and block all of the words that were used in those comments let's definitely feel it a b-minus like I passed and I did already but it's not an A+ job you know what I'm gonna get myself a see this still I the more I think about it I don't I don't deserve a B I did a I got AI got a C I passed but I'm not feeling great about alright well
