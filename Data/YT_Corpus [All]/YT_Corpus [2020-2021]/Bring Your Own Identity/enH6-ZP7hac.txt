 hmmm I don't see any tracks in the snow I think we're good what's going on tears welcome to the vlog home to another awesome day yeah we got a crazy snowstorm last night and as you know in the last snow storm we had tracks going all the way from our merch room all the way into the back yard but so far I don't see any footprints in the snow it looks fresh and clean and you also saw that person walking across the back of our property carrying some sort of thing well grace and I took off on our mini motorcycles we went into the woods to where we think that person was hiding out and we collected some evidence so today we're going to take that evidence and we're going to dust it for fingerprints and try to figure out who this person is so while I've been waiting for grace I've just been looking out the window for any signs any clues of anyone coming but I think we're pretty good and oh baby otters say hi to the shares yeah you tired today yeah you are grace hold on yeah great maybe she's getting ready to give her room to her or something if grace isn't in her room I don't know where she could be I've looked everywhere maybe she's outside great oh hey grace you ready to go desperate some fingerprints yeah just a little baby down for a nap oh yes check it out if you didn't see Grace's vlog we unveiled the big surprise we had a few this is our new puppy oh yeah he's just a few weeks old and he's sleeping right now oh maybe you got a little energy you want to play a little bit yeah hi say hi to the shares yes just a few weeks old we're still trying to figure our name so comment down below any good name ideas okay you go back to bed you sleep you need to take your nap cuz you're the baby yeah you take your nap okay we're gonna go dust for fingerprints see we can solve this okay all right grace you ready yeah okay let's go grace Oh shares I ordered a bunch of finger print mystery spy device things on Amazon I think we'll be able to scrape a lot of data off this stuff yeah we're about to figure out who this is and we set up the merger and we turned it into the laboratory so check this out oh yeah here we got our mystery detective bored of all the places we've spotted the gamemaster around the sheriff AM house and now we have test tubes we can use as well as a microscope check this thing out I can go up to 40 times whoo that scared me I was just snow that fell and these are the three items we found in the woods we put them in Ziploc bags so they would get contaminated all right guys I guess we better start with evidence number one the glove the glove see we can scrape any evidence off this thing so it's latest thing on the laboratory table oh you know what we've got to make sure we don't contaminate the contamination piece right we better go get our lab coats off Oh chairs hang on one moment oh yeah now we're ready to go Gracie got the briefcase I got the briefing so shares inside his briefcases all those tools that we need in order to scrape data off the stuff we can scrape any type of DNA fingerprints we can get like hair samples all that good types of stuff so let's get this thing open let's see what's inside oh yeah we go top secret this is for the top secret evidence that we're going to find oh well these things yeah so we got dusting powder that you can use to dust for fingerprints we got our brush for that as well we have a USB Drive where we can put all the data we find on it we've got a cotton swab to swab for evidence and if we do find fingerprints or anything we can stick them onto these clear glass test strips and we can put them underneath the microscope and we can really zoom in and find the fine detail important thing Steve wait what is it it's the morning caution thing we should put up so baby otter the new sheriff a member and mom don't come in oh yeah we just took that on the door so like here to here perfect so now we're an active crime scene let's get to work got to grab our first pieces of evidence and figure out what kind of data is on there wait before you start we gotta open the top-secret envelope these are the evidence cards that we need to be able to fill out by the end of this we will find the name the age the gender whether the left or right-handed the pattern type as well as a photo of who this person is for now grace we're going to put game master on here because we don't know who the actual game master is but the game master are the pieces of evidence that we're going to test okay so we got to get some fingerprints if we can put all data together we can run it through the database yeah let's get started so grace we got to be careful not to contaminate the evidence so to do that I've got my plier thingies let's go ahead and reach in here pull out the glove very carefully I already see like marks on it yeah there's definitely some like brown spots and stuff so in order to do this grace first thing we can do is you have that black clay where's that black light pen oh I got it right here sieve perfect so shares this might look like an average pen but on the end we have a black light if we use this black light to scan the glove we can see if there's any potential fingerprints so grace go ahead and kill the lights God Steve hidden light okay let's scan it up here we go ready scan in anything I'm seeing do you see these little bright white little dots oh we go back great like there do you see those yeah and there's one right over here one over there too so we've got some stuff one there yeah oh that might be a piece of hair hang on oh yeah that might be let me use my other pair of pliers and see we can scrape this piece of data off right here here we go three two one oh it's a piece of fiber I think I got it we got it okay I'm gonna take this little tiny piece of evidence and I'm going to stick it into this test tube right here okay okay there it is at the very bottom yep I see at the very bottom that little little dot okay we can put this aside for evidences perfect grace first piece of evidence off the glove now let's go ahead and flip the glove over and see what else we can find more yeah you're right grace er there's one right there you're right there's more pieces okay you know what what see this glove has enough evidence we can do it formaldehyde on it the format formaldehyde what's that we take this red test-tube uh-huh build it for malahide and it'll really expose to a greater scale exactly what type of evidence is on this glove oh okay actually before we do this turn the lights back on got the lights Steve okay you ready I'm ready we're gonna pour this on the glove we're gonna aim it towards the fingerprints and then we should be able to press them onto this card and we should have some sort of fingerprint show up okay here we go ready three two one here we go whoa there we go we're getting somewhere just a little drop that each is all we need okay if there's any fingerprints on here they should start showing up within a couple seconds okay here we go let's see let's go ahead and press it in a little bit more Steve I'm not seeing anything are you oh yeah we got something coming hang tight it's developing okay the chemical is still developing and let's flip this over okay okay now that it's soaked this formaldehyde all we have to do is take this special blue dropper and then a fingerprint should reverse and pop out of here okay we're ready dropping in three two one mmm boom we should be able to get at least a partial fingerprint off this thing so let me grab one of these vials we'll stick it on here and we'll transfer it over you think this is going to work grace I know this is gonna work check it out boom we got a match hmm wait that's a fingerprint that's a fingerprint that's what a fingerprint looks like that's so cool that's perfect grace okay we got our first fingerprint shares now grace we're gonna take the DNA card we're gonna push the glass thing on top of it lift carefully and boom whoa we got a pointer finger well that's so cool piece of evidence down I think we're ready to move on to the next piece grace sure that was so cool got a fingerprint I wonder what lies on the scissors masks put this back in the evidence bag just in case you can maybe find more evidence in the future if we need to but we'll fill this up and put it away for safekeeping okay on to evidence number 2's scissors this is really weird because because scissors in the tree yeah why would they need scissors I don't know but uh let's open this thing up let's use these plier things let's grab these scissors out of here okay I got the scissors now we just got to figure out how we can get fingerprints off this thing so I'm thinking what we can do grace is we can use this dust powder and we can dust for fingerprints oh okay two-pump right grace all we have to do is use this brush Plus this dust okay and brush it over top of these scissors and we should be able to figure out if there's any sort of fingerprint on this thing oh it's actually working grace look at this oh yeah look at that you're pretty little ridges told you we're on to something I wasn't um grace is definitely a thumb wait how do you know that you can just tell it's big because think about when used scissors use your index finger and the thumb and the thumb goes on that one right there it's definitely a thumb let me just do a couple more brushes and we should have enough to pull this thumb off this thing sure this is so cool we're getting a thumbprint off pink scissors we found in the woods that's crazy yes there's no Game Master can hide their evidence from us this is perfect now we can take this piece of tape wait tape yeah tape and what lay that tape over the scissors like this this is how you pull the fingerprint off whoa no way yes it's just like this you lay it on okay you dab it on top of the scissors just like that you like press it down press it down and then grace when we peel it off voila can you see that wait where's the thumbprint you can see it right there oh that dot right there so to make it even easier what we can do is we can take one of these vials take it out just like we did last time well transplant the fingerprint onto this vial right here and we'll stick it on right on the chart just like that perfect here we go ready press down over top we gotta get a good transplant of this lift and anything you see it now even murder huh yeah I can really see the fingerprint right oh yeah look at that there's a thumbprint and now grace will transfer this over to the piece of paper right on the thumbprint okay just wait perfect look at that there we go sure so far we got a thumbprint and a pointer finger that's awesome we're making some good use of this okay um grace I think it's time to scrape evidence of number three the man what are we gonna find out this thing I kind of think uh how will we get fingerprints off that because it goes around your mouth does that might be hard no there's no one way to find out though let's put it down on it so we can scrape you ready no the next step let's put these scissors back in the evidence bag seal it up and let's move on to this so grace you're thinking we can't get any fingerprints off it right I don't think so just a little bit hard that's why grace we're going to do the swab test what's the swab test the swab test helps determine if there's any DNA from your mouth or anything like that on here so we can do Grace's we can take the swab brush and we can swab all around this scanning for any sort of DNA that's really cool because you can get DNA from your saliva well we'll do Grace's we'll take the mask we'll flip it over okay the inside where you put up like this to where oh come on you put on my mouth what we'll do is we'll take this swab device and we'll swab all over the inside of this what we're doing right now shares is we're trying to grab any sort of DNA that could be on here so we're just gonna swarm his mouth yeah from his mouth okay grace something's on here can you hear me one of the green vial tubes a green - okay here's green why green because this should help extract anything that's on here Oh take this out let me stick this in here just like this we should be okay oh hi Steve I see stuff falling off of it yeah okay hang on and after we twirl it around a little bit it's he's already scraping off some clues we drop the rest of this in we cap this test tube up give it a little shake and now grace it we put this in the evidence bag we should be able to send it off to the secret safe house laboratory and they can extract clues and evidence from it mm-hmm see that's perfect here's to getting the evidence bag and we'll mail it in perfect just like that ingrates that's not the only data we can pull from this mask what what else can we do Sherri's check this out grace when you put a mask on yeah with your fingers yes but more reasonably you take a mask and you put these straps over the top of your head yeah so I'm thinking we can scrape this for some pieces of hair oh yeah because things always get stuck in my hair and look at this this might actually be a piece of hair do you see this right here you think that's hair do you see that yeah I see it that's definitely a piece of hair it's so small and skinny but it's definitely a piece of yeah I see it you see that yep we can put this right on the card okay just like that one piece of hair and then if we are very careful we might be able to find more pieces like at the back of the strap will get tied in your hair uh-huh is that one that might be a piece of hair too can't tell can you see that I see it in that hair that's hair I think okay ah this is very small Oh got it okay very very very small but oh that's definitely a strand of hair Oh what matches yep yeah I was folded in there okay so we got two strands of hair now grace I just need a piece of tape here I got eight now grace let's take this piece of tape okay mm very carefully we got a light over top of the hair okay just like that perfect look at the hair it's stuck we got the hair stuck yeah we can probably peel this off very carefully and slowly bingo grace why are you peeling it off you got the hair just like this locked on do you see it yep I see it okay perfect we got the hair and now we'll just move it down here because we didn't find any other fingerprints but what we'll do is we'll label this or cross up that finger we'll cross off the ring finger we'll cross up a pinky finger and we'll put hair for evidence perfect okay we should be good register smashley fun with all this evidence we're going to figure out who this person is yes what we'll do Grace's we can take this card stick it in this evidence envelope just hang yes as well as this USB Drive because that USB Drive is what the information will come back on exactly so what we'll do is we'll tape this up and we'll send it off to the safe house laboratory and get it processed yep this is evidence case number one well it's cool grace yeah yeah that's for the suspect suspect sure comment down below who you think the suspect is what do we think it is oh I'll put that down I think we're ready to send this off let's do it yeah hopefully the mail hasn't coming in today and we can get it delivered today come on oh well it's not active crime scene anymore let's go oh wait see if we did check on the radio transmitter let's see if it's charged yeah we gotta put this in the mail first because the mail that's about to come grace and then we can go check on the device thing okay yeah you're right let's put that over before we forget it might be snowing but that's not gonna stop us come on grace oh it's so deep we got so much snow I made it just in time can't have evidence in there hey close it up to the mailman come soon oh is that him this is the big snowfall truck Wallace snowplow watch out all right shares we'll see you in the next vlog hopefully we'll have our results back you haven't already hit that subscribe button turn on post notifications and until next time you know what to do stay
