 i've been doing a ton of customer research and asking you guys what are you really struggling with when it comes to getting started with creating video content and a lot of people say that they're struggling with their message determining what their brand is in the first place and how to take that take that three-dimensional version of yourself and boil it down into a two-dimensional brand so

do awesome thanks for having me today amanda and nice to meet all of you my name is taylor liu as amanda said and i am a lifestyle design coach and business mentor and i specialize in helping finpreneurs to reinvent themselves from the inside out and master the art and science of sustainable business expansion yes and she's actually right now embarking on a new venture yourself i've been talking a ton about course creation and the freedom that comes along with course creation so let's just quickly give it give it a quick plug right at the beginning and then we'll dive into uh the value of personal branding or how to take steps forward with that as well so totally what is it that that part of your business how is that working yeah i'm i'm so i'm so excited because i have been spending the last few months just pouring my heart and soul into a brand new course called reinvent you and it's really exactly as the name implies it's helping service-based business owners to really reinvent themselves online through their personal brand and what i love about this course is it's actually a perfect fit whether you are just getting started with your personal brand or for people who are more advanced in the process um because i give two different paths i give kind of a beginner path diy you're working with a smaller budget and then also for people who are looking to rebrand themselves maybe they feel like they've outgrown certain elements of their brand maybe they feel like it's just they're ready to invest in a more professional look and feel online but i really lay out both of those paths in this course which makes me super excited because i don't see a lot of similar courses doing something like this i love it so if you do if that sounds up your alley and you want to learn more there's a link in the description below this video but right now what i want to do is dive into the three mistakes that a lot of people make when it comes to personal branding so let's talk about it yes so i actually calculated the other day how long i've been studying personal branding marketing social media and it's 11 years 11 years i've been working and studying on these studying about these things and there through that work and through my work with my clients i found three big mistakes that people typically make or are apt to make when they begin their personal branding journey or really no matter where they're at in the process these mistakes can come up because i'm certainly guilty of these and that's why i want to share these with you because hopefully you won't have to make these same expensive mistakes as i did and i'm sure i've made them too yeah they're pretty common but the first one just to kick things off is to brand yourself based on what you think is working for other people online so this is a big one i see because there's a fine line between being inspired by other people's brands and becoming a bit of a copycat and what happens is if you just look to other people to build your brand at the end of the day it's not you and that becomes very obvious to your audience it feels like there's something incongruent there's something inauthentic and it doesn't work and just because it's working for susie q and getting thousands of likes and followers and and whatnot does not mean it's going to work for you if that's not your most authentic expression absolutely yeah i think that's really key just trying to find now here's a thought about that because when you're first getting started sometimes it can be challenging to start from scratch right so sometimes it can be really nice to take a framework and then apply your put your own unique expression into that so how would you say if you're just starting out and you're looking at all the different people and you're like oh this person i really resonate with their start like their instagram and how they're doing it here and this person how would you navigate that process like when do you know that you're genuinely copying someone else and when do you know that you're just taking that inspiration like you said that's a great question and i think for me the very first step no matter where you're at with either branding or rebranding yourself is deep diving into personal identity so if you really start out and this is kind of a personal development lens or framework but if you really start out by asking the big and challenging questions like who am i and what is my mission what is my purpose simple question very simple very simple what am i convicted about what am i how can i help people if you start out by answering those questions for yourself then you can look around at other brands in terms of market research and say okay i like these colors or i like the way they're formatting their instagram posts or i like their website but if you don't first dive into the identity piece it's very quickly going to tip into the arena of copycat versus oh i like how they did this i'm gonna use this as a framework a hundred percent yes i think that's such a good thing yeah a good approach to it and i think that a lot of people when they're first diving into that what they might do is they might build their personal brand based on the future or who they are in this moment which brings us to the next step almost like you know these tips i do i do yes and this one's real good y'all so i'm excited to chat about this yeah so the second biggest mistake i see business owners make when it comes to personal branding is they try to brand themselves or especially rebrand themselves based on a recent personal discovery or breakthrough and i actually want to give a personal example of this because i made a very multi-thousand dollar mistake doing this exact thing because i went through a period of time where i was doing i was actually in my nlp certification which is neuro-linguistic programming and i was just having a lot of insights about who i am as a as a person and um i realized that i wanted to be perceived online with more of like a fierceness or an edge and i and more than anything i wanted my audience to know that i had the depth capable of really holding them in their own limiting beliefs and working through their fears and self-doubt and so i decided to turn that personal breakthrough into a whole new brand and i invested so much money in a new website and new brand identity kit like the whole nine yards graphics photo shoot and after everything was said and done everything looked really cool like it was really well done brandon you remember that i remember it was great it was like this like fierce super edgy like checker kind of yeah yeah and it looked amazing like aesthetically it was very cool and at the end of the day it's not me it's not my my true core essence and i think most people when they meet me they would describe me as warm and welcoming and inviting and fun-loving and nurturing um and i wasn't getting any of that in this new brand and so it was it only took me like probably two months after i completely redid everything i had a new brand launch like everything and a couple months later and i was like this isn't me this is not me this this was something that was i was uncovering more about myself in the moment and it was a part of myself that fierceness that depth is certainly a part of me but it's not a good thing to create a whole brand based on like one one small part of who you are i can so relate to this because i've recently had a big breakthrough that i've been working through behind the scenes as well so one of the branding elements of video is creating your explainer statement which is that one sentence that you say over and over again to communicate to your audience who you are right so i wanted to bring more femininity into mine and it's like you know right now leverage the power of video without breaking the bank you're taking up tons of your time like i was like oh i helped soul entrepreneurs or conscious entrepreneurs do x y and z and i kept trying to put more and more woo into it in a way and i've recently had a breakthrough in that sometimes even if that is a part of who you are it's not the thing that will initially hook someone into your audience like there's a balance between marketing and branding where like it will it will hook the person where they need to be hooked right and that like essence of who you are it's interesting like weaving those two together it's that balancing act between the two so how do we find that balance what is like one tip that you could give to today you can go and you can do this pull out a piece of paper or something like that that might be helpful yeah so i have a full exercise in my course that i'm really proud of that helps you create your brand words based on your most natural and consistent essence so i'm not gonna give away that whole exercise right here on this video but i will give you a little piece of it is to really think about a time where you felt most like yourself in your life or you felt the most expressed or the most you for me it was probably the ages between the ages of 5 and maybe 11. and i think back to that little girl who was just so bold and vibrant and self-expressed and she just said whatever she wanted to say whatever is on her mind she dressed in these like really ridiculous clothes almost always in costume and when i think about that little girl like that feels like the core of me like that is very much who i am today and obviously there's a lot more layers on top of that as i've gotten older but for those of you who are watching this video i think that's that's a key takeaway here is think about a quality maybe it's even one quality that you feel like you've carried with you your entire life like for me vibrancy is a quality that i've had my whole life part of which is because i have bright red hair so i've always been very colorful and vibrant just naturally and i've always had a big personality so when i think about the way that i've curated my brand now that vibrancy is a core part of the brand and so when i when i rebranded myself based on something that was happening in the now i lost all of that vibrancy which if i had done an exercise like i just described i don't think i would have made that mistake yeah that's so good i always talk about like looking at your past and look at the patterns that continuously are popping up and i think that's so in alignment with it okay i absolutely love it so now let's move on to the third mistake what is that awesome so the third mistake is when people brand themselves based on who they want to be versus who they are and let me add a caveat to this saying looking to your aspirational self your best self your highest self is actually a great tool to use when creating your personal brand but i think the mistake can be when you base the brand purely on that and then what happens is when people meet you or experience you in real life it's completely different than the way that you've represented yourself online so of course you want to put your best foot forward online and at the same time you want to make sure that your day-to-day like who you are in this moment is congruent with the way that you're showing up online yeah i think that's where a lot of the imposter syndrome comes in yes to play if you're projecting that you're a different person because you feel like you need to for some reason i think there's this feeling that you need to show up perfectly in front of your audience and the the thing is like you don't want to do that you know because no one resonates with that no one resonates with that but also you're creating more anxiety in your life and that's definitely not something that you want to do it's exhausting trying to be someone you're not and it's an exhausting even just creating like instagram stories and youtube videos and whatever content you're creating online if you feel like you have to fully step into a different persona to be able to deliver on that that's exhausting yeah which i think is just across the board on all three of these it's branding is taking the essence of who you truly are not turning it into something that you're not right yet or that you think that you might be but really boiling down okay who am i and asking yourself those deep questions right the quality of life that you live is the equivalent to the quality of questions that you ask and i think that that's so perfect with personal branding too so i appreciate you being here and i just want to give a quick shout out for once again if you guys are interested in really deep diving into personal branding then be sure to check out reinvent you with
