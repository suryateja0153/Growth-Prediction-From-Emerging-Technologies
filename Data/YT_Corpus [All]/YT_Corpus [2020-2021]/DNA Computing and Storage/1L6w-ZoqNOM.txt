 so catalog is a company is addressing a huge market that's all of sort of parallel computation we see that as a hundred billion dollar market but as a first step in getting there we're tackling the cold tear archival storage market that's about at seven to eight billion right now so as we develop technologies to do more competition and improve the reader right characteristics I think will be in a really great position to get a large portion of that much bigger broader market that's out there and so in terms of the fundraising we have great venture capital firms that's already on the cap table and on the milestones that we'll be meeting in the next few months the completion of at every machine and having some pilot customers on board will be going out and raising another round our Series A round during the first half of this year so I think when you think about the process of storing information in DNA you really have to start from the very beginning what does it actually mean to store data you know maybe it's it's a pic file of a picture a JPEG or a text that you want to store in DNA so for us that no matter what kind of data is it's just reduced down to a series of ones and zeros a bit stream binaries data so how do we turn those ones and zeros into the physical presence or absence of these DNA molecules right so in between that sits a computer that uses our codec to read the binary information and generates instructions for our liquid handler to move around our pre-made DNA Allah goes and combine them in combinations that represents the ones and zeros that we want to store so we would take the bits turn them into instructions for the Machine the machine would go in move around DNA molecules combines them into the pools that represents the ones and zeros we want to store and then in the other end the machine would collect all of those DNA molecules and pool them and concentrate it down to a pellet and when we want to restore and retrieve information from it we would put those DNA molecules into a sequencer and these sequencers are not any different from the ones you would use for genomic sequencing and so we can work with any genomic sequences are out there or any DNA sequences are out there right now and at any given point we would work with the platform that gives us the highest throughput for the lowest price and it's so in reading back the information there's also an issue of error correction and detection because reading back DNA molecules isn't a perfect process it's a random sampling process and in the samples that you've you're reading back you also get base pair errors so that's less of a problem for us than it is for diagnostics and therapeutics because we're using large chunks of DNA molecules and the problem of calling whether these larger chunks are there or not is a much easier problem to solve on the sequencing side then going down to the base pair resolution and trying to read every single base pair you
