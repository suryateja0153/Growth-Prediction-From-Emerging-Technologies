 [Music] [Music] thanks for joining me here today to learn some more about the updates we have coming to our overall hardware platform before we get into the exact announcements what i'd like to do is cover the tenants and the overall strategy we use for how we roll out new hardware updates within oci and this really focuses on three main factors one is the overall maximum flexibility the second is highest performance and the third is the absolute best price performance what you can see here is a bunch of the first that we've achieved in oci working towards those goals so for example we're the first cloud provider to offer pervasive bare metal flexible virtual machines and containers across our hardware portfolio we also offer extremely flexible block storage unlike any other cloud provider same thing we went and created our industry first cluster networking in the cloud that offers extremely low latency less than two microseconds latency across a large cluster of compute nodes and we offer that for our hpc offering as well as as of today for other offerings as well we also offer the absolute best highest per core performance while at the same time offering the best price performance across all of our compute shapes and the same thing is true for our overall gpu offerings we offer bare metal we offer virtual machines and we have the absolute best highest performing gpu offering available anywhere in the cloud that's a little bit about how we've gotten here up to this point but now let's talk a little bit about where we're going both within oci as well as in the industry so the first thing i want to talk about is our next generation of high performance computing shapes we've been working very closely with intel so in the past we have invested heavily in our current generation of high performance computing we offer extremely high frequency cpus we offer very low latency rdma cluster network as i discussed previously we're now coming out with the next generation of that this will be available in the first half of 2021 and we're expanding that that offering so now we will have extremely fast local ssd storage for checkpointing of mpi workloads we're going to be offering approximately 30 better performance compared to our current generation of hpc offering and again we'll have that extremely high performance overall cluster networking to hear more about what we've been doing with intel in general we talked to bob swann a ceo of intel earlier and got his perspective on where we're at with oracle and what's going on in the industry with intel at intel we're focused on helping customers truly unleash the potential of data the integration of intel's technologies across oracle cloud and engineered systems is at an extension of our long-term partnership at every layer of hardware and software development our 25 plus years of continuous innovation and deep co-engineering with oracle has sought to create innovative scalable and secure enterprise class solutions last year we announced that oracle's exadata x8m would incorporate intel optane persistent memory or as larry referred to it the magic behind the performance and oracle's customers had experienced the magic in the form of ten times faster analytics and two and a half times more throughput we worked with oracle to win a deal with nissan for migrating its on-prem high-performance computing workloads to oracle cloud infrastructure today's high-performance computing workloads require an increasing amount of computing power and the demand for high performance and cost savings continues to grow now nissan can run performance intensive hpc jobs on demand instead of having to buy fixed on-premises capacity oracle's industry first bare metal offering combined intel's highly optimized xeon silicon allows oracle applications to handle far more users operate on a larger active data sets and respond in real time to complex queries we're eager to see the innovation and performance that oracle hpc cloud will bring to customers with our 3rd gen xeon scalable 10 nanometer ice lake cpus and other improvements in oracle's new instances performance gains could be up to 30 percent on certain workloads such as crash simulations oracle's breadth of enterprise class offerings based on intel technologies allow customers to analyze data with endless possibilities paramount to success in this data-centric world intel and oracle both strive to give customers the very best in flexibility performance and cost savings our shared obsession with customer value is in our dna and i look forward to extending our long history of innovation and collaboration we're also doing a lot with other architectures beyond x86 so we've been working very closely with a company called ampere a startup in the arm server space i view them as not just a provider for us they're also a partner we've been working very closely on the design and the implementation of their next generation of hardware chip as well as the optimization of different software stacks to make sure they run incredibly well on the arm platform we're coming out with our first ever arm server processor offering in oci powered by ampere ultra processors this is an 80 core cpu which we're sticking a couple of those in a server so we can have 160 cores of arm performance at 3.3 gigahertz max with a terabyte of memory and a massive amount of network bandwidth with that we believe that for a huge number of workloads arm with ampere ultra is going to be the overall price performance leader anywhere in the industry and to talk more about that i sat down with renee james ceo of ampere earlier this week and we discussed what we've been doing with arm what we've been doing with ampere and how that's going to change the industry in the future well i'm here with renee james from from ampere i'm very excited to have her with us we've been working together very closely on the design of our latest offering our first offering as an armed server chip um so renee i know you guys have been working on this for a long time why what made you guys decide to get into the arm server chip business we really had an ambition about building what we think comes next very focused on cloud software not enterprise not legacy not backward looking and it just happened that arm was pro it was the furthest along architecture for us to use that makes complete sense um so you guys have done an amazing job of creating this new 80 core part we're sticking a couple of those into our new server so we have 160 cores in a single server and we're and we're launching that early in 2021 because of the work that you guys have done the density you've created we can also offer that at a very attractive low price but what other motivators besides just price and performance that you see when you talk to customers that are interested in these cpus yeah i think there's a couple of things that people are excited about i i think that the 80 core approach with the single core per um instantiation if you will of you know allows for a level of isolation and security that people are excited about it also allows for a level of density and and scalability that's really oriented around people how people sell cloud instances today you know that we have ultra max coming which is 128 core version that also is uh drop-in compatible with the first version of ultra this 80 course so we believe we can offer um better security higher performance and really great value for not only yourself but your customers more than just being a general purpose cpu i think with the with the progress that arm is having on the server side and also on the desktop side right if you go back a few years ago everyone talked about these things in the server but no one really did them and now with um the work that say aws is done with graviton and graviton too but i think even more importantly the the direction that apple's taking by choosing to put arm as a an offering in their new laptop lineup i think the demand for server-side arm computing is going to be astronomical um how do you think that typical developers should be thinking about this right how should how should kind of most companies be thinking about how to capitalize on this opportunity for arm in the server that's a great question we know that the armed community of developers is significantly larger based on the device ecosystem the phone ecosystem edge and other emerging uh devices that are built on arm or becoming smart devices because of embedded arm and what this allows is for developers to come to the oci cloud and be able to either move their apps develop new apps or and very quickly get to market with something that can serve to all of those devices and emerging opportunities i am so excited by the opportunity this presents to uh you know pretty much all developers around the world um well thank you renee i really appreciate the work that you've been able to do with you on ampere ultra i'm excited for our launch early in 2021 and i'm even more excited for the upcoming uh you know developments that you guys are going to continue to put out i'm i've seen some of the behind the scenes roadmap stuff and it's a very exciting time ahead we're really excited excited about your cloud and excited about the products so thank you thank you renee bye bye we've been working very closely with amd as well so if you if you go back a couple of years we launched our e2 line of amd offering which at the time was about our by far our absolute best price performance winner and then earlier this year we launched our e3 line which was based on amd roam processors and not only did we launch that with amd we also made that our first platform that supported our overall flexible compute offering which gives us complete flexibility in how customers can choose their cpu and their ram requirements we've been working closely again with amd and later in the first half of 2021 we're going to be launching our next generation of amd offering that's going to have significantly improved performance over what we're doing today with e3 here's lisa sue ceo of amd to share more with what's going on with amd and the industry in general i'm really happy to join all of you today at amd our mission is to develop high performance computing products to solve some of the world's toughest challenges this is really the basis of our multi-year collaboration between amd and oracle spanning hardware software and solutions with strong joint focus on the performance optimization of every element of the stack together we've delivered a number of innovations with oracle based on amd epic processors the largest bare metal instance offering in the public cloud the first instances to support oracle's flexible instance type and instances that more than double peak java performance our industry-leading performance of 2nd gen amd epic based e3 instances translates to a compelling tco advantage for enterprise and hpc customers and looking ahead we're very excited about our close collaboration on the next generation e4 oci instance based on the third gen amd epic processor codename milan designed for the cloud milan will bring unmatched computing performance and business value to power the world's most important cloud workloads and services i want to congratulate you clay and the entire oracle team on your success in driving innovation in cloud price performance thanks for the great partnership so we've talked a bit about some of the things that are coming in early 2021 but i want to end today with something that we're very excited to be launching uh this month right in just just a few days we've been working very closely with nvidia to bring their latest gpu the a100 to our platform we didn't just kind of take this as an opportunity to evolve our gpu platform we really wanted to go and and push for a revolution and so we have our new offering that you can support up to eight a 100 gpus in a single box but we've done a couple of things that are different than what many of our competitors are doing so one thing we're doing differently is we've added local ssd storage for check pointing of complex workloads we've added a significant increase in the overall ram available up to two terabytes and the reason for that is to support the ever-growing memory needs of these large machine learning models and the third thing that we did is we've added our cluster networking capability to our gpu offering when you combine that with the gpu direct technology enabled by melanox and nvidia it actually enables customers to create an extremely large cluster up to 512 gpus all working together on a single model this is a huge benefit to the customers that have these extremely large training models that they need to work on very quickly and to be able to iterate fast so that they can actually provide value to their customers i had the opportunity to sit down earlier this week with jensen huang the ceo and founder of nvidia and we got to talk about the latest offering we have with nvidia but we also got the opportunity to talk about the advancements that are being made in machine learning as well as the progress that gpus are providing for the overall industry i'm here with jensen huang ceo of nvidia uh thanks for thanks for coming to talk with us today jensen it's a great pleasure to be here clay congratulations on oci and and uh the exciting launch you guys are about to do thanks we're we're very excited for the launch of a100 i would love to learn a little bit more about you know what's going on with you guys in the data center business clay our data center business is doubling every year and it's doubling off of really large numbers and it's happening at a time when the type of software that's trained with ai really wants to be accelerated by gpus and and we recognized that about 10 years ago and we'd leaned into it really really hard and this is this is really what's been propelling our growth this new type of software that's called deep learning the big bang of ai today and and what i'm so excited about with our with our most recent release of the a100 is that what we're hearing from customers is that there's a massive demand for larger and larger models we're building on the impressive work that you guys have done the thing that you guys did that's going to be really helpful to enterprises around the world by implementing a bare metal large cluster system you could you could of course have parallel paralyzed gpus on a per node basis using the mv link that we created but now you have nvidia mellanox nyx that uses this technology called gpu direct over rdma that moves data around the different nodes by itself the benefit of going fast for ai researchers is is the ability to iterate on very large models to make the perfect model i think the oci implementation the bare metal a100 with nvidia melanox nix that's really a fantastic infrastructure to offer another area that i think you guys have done an amazing job with is how quickly can someone get spun up with the right tools how quickly can they get access to the right software yeah accelerated computing is a very different type of computing model the way that accelerated computing works it it really starts with an amazing processor but includes the system software the acceleration libraries the algorithms that sits on top and this is what the industry calls domain specific computing whether it's computer graphics or simulations like fluid dynamics or crash simulations or particle simulations genomics processing to deep learning and data analytics each requires its own domain specific stack we created this registry in the cloud that has all of these really complex software stacks perfectly tuned updated and all containerized so that all you have to do is pull it down put it into the oci instance and spool up your machine we made it possible for people to to gain access to accelerated computing really cost effectively and really easily now that you guys have made the the largest kind of silicon ship ever where do we go from here well we've put this technology together for the very first time as you know this is now a cluster scale high performance computing platform using state-of-the-art technology with with uh with uh a100 and the melanox melanox nix um now now we want to put this in the hands of all the enterprise customers all over the world now we know very well now that that every company is going to be an ai and so i'm very excited about that yeah we're just as excited you know the one of the things we're most excited about here at oracle is we offer the full complement of services so obviously we have the newest a100 gpus from nvidia we have you know a data science platform and a big data platform to enable those enterprise customers to move their data into our cloud and then to train uh you know their machine learning models on our platform we also have things like our digital assistant and chat bots that actually run internally on top of that same infrastructure that we then enable that functionality into our sas applications things like erp systems and hcm systems it really is uh impacting every single layer of our business and all of our customer business business we're going to put this technology in the hands of enterprise customers all over the world i think this is the great next adventure for us and it's really great to do it with oracle well jensen i really appreciate you taking the time to speak with us today i'm very excited for the work that we've done together and i continue to be excited for the work we'll do in the future thank you very much congratulations clay great work with oci we've been working very closely with many customers and partners to make our overall high performance computing platform the best it can be and so i'm going to take a few minutes to talk to you about a few of those first i want to talk about nissan who's been an incredible customer for us they've worked with us very closely and they've seen the value of our hpc platform they've been able to take advantage of our rdma cluster network and our extremely fast intel cpus to enable them to move their computational fluid dynamics workloads from on-premise and other cloud providers onto oci since 1933 nissan seeks to provide unique and innovative automotive products and services that deliver superior and measurable value to all our stakeholders nissan is a leader in adopting cloud-based high-performance computing for large-scale workloads such as crash test and computational fluid dynamics simulations running large cfd and structural simulations requires tremendous amounts of compute power nissan has adopted a cloud-first strategy for its hpc platform to ensure its engineers always have the compute capacity needed to run their complex simulations we selected oracle cloud infrastructure high performance compute solutions as part of our multi-cloud strategy to meet the challenges of increased simulation demand and under the constant cost savings to pressure by moving our high performance and latency sensitive engineering simulation workloads to oracle cloud we will be able to speed the design and the testing of new cars altair is both a customer and a partner of ours they are a massive provider of software solutions that enable customers to perform these complex simulations on top of our cpus and gpus in the cloud we've worked very closely with altair over the years been been a long time customer and partner and we're very excited for the opportunity for them to move their sas portfolio on top of oci let's say you're trying to design a card [Music] instead through creating a physical prototype and crashing it into a wall what you can do is basically model this on a computer you can look at many different iterations and you can optimize your design when we looked at all the cloud vendors out there we found that oracle was very focused on hbc [Music] bare metal offering which was i believe the first in the industry and had high speed low latency networking which is very important for us first they maintain the infrastructure and then they also help us migrate workloads and cloud we did benchmark oci versus some other infrastructures and we found that oracle's was better by 20 versus some of the other benchmarks [Music] rescale is another partner that we've been working with very closely recently they are able to take advantage of all these advancements in our hardware platform to make their own hpc platform better and then translate the value of that into cost savings and higher performance to their customers rescale has been on a tremendous journey over the last eight years the things that our customers are working on things like supersonic transportation autonomous vehicles are really literally changing the world traditionally this has always happened on prep the challenge with that is you have a large capital expenditure that goes with that longer refresh cycles and you have to maintain the whole thing pivoting to a cloud environment allows customers to get that advantage of latest hardware fastest interconnect speeds and really a high performance simulation environment [Music] deciding to partner with oracle is really a simple decision it's not just in terms of speed and scalability and manageability it's also a price performance benefit with the bare metal and the virtualized capabilities that oci brings to the table you have not only a highly performant environment but you have one that performs well economically as our customers are working with the oracle infrastructure [Music] we're also very excited to have iden tv and deep zin take advantage of the latest in our gpu offerings from nvidia to accelerate their platform and deliver a ton more value to their customers at ntv we focus on providing end-to-end ai solutions to transform the tsunami of big data into real-time actionable analytics identities video juicer is used by sports leagues for brands and sponsorship analytics replacing manual processes that normally take four weeks this innovation allows for granular measurement of roi while providing sales teams differentiators to retain and attract new clients health oracle's cloud and nvidia gpus have provided us the horsepower needed to train large convolutional neural networks twice as fast compared to other cloud providers this has provided us the ability to iterate and pass along cost savings to the tune of 60 percent to our customers at mtv we focus on providing ai to both technical and non-technical users with ease of use in mind users can customize or augment existing models without writing a single line of code in pairing with oracle's cloud we're able to create the most powerful and insightful unparalleled analytics for our clientele thank you all for coming here today with me and learning about our great new announcement
