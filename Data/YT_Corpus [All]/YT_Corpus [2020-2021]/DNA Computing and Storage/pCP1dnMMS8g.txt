 Hi my name is Jesse Martinez I'm an undergraduate researcher currently conducting research at Texas A&M University as a part of an REU program funded by the National Science Foundation I'm currently working for Dr. Michael Nippe and at my home institution Baylor University I work for Dr. Caleb Martin so the issue that we're trying to approach with our research is that in today's computers were currently reaching physical constants as to how dense the data is how dense we can get the data in our computers in our harddrive specifically so to explain a little bit about where the current technology is at with our hard drives I brought an example of a hard drive and so in a traditional hard drive you have a platter which is where the data is actually stored and this platter is typically made of mostly something like glass or aluminum something that's not magnetic and then throughout the platter is distributed a magnetic material so that's something like iron and cobalt and in each hard drive is also a needle which is located right here on this one and this needle moves across the hard drive and either reads or writes data onto the hard drive. With today's traditional hard drives each bit of information on that is about the size of 100 micrometers and so you can see each little box here is essentially a bit and that's a compilation of molecules and so with our technology or with the technology of single-molecule magnets we can reach sizes of point 0 0 0 1 micrometers and so that's on the molecular level as essentially each molecule would serve as a bit of information and so the reason why it's able to do that is because the single molecule magnet can have a magnetic field imposed on it and then it can retain that magnetic field and the direction of that magnetic field and so what that essentially means is just that it can retain the information that you put on it at a molecular level rather than at multiple molecules per bit and so the difference in size between these two leads to a difference in data density and so with today's technology involving these domains a common flash drive can hold up to about 256 gigabytes while a flash drive of this similar size using single-molecule magnets would be able to hold up to 25,000 gigabytes and that leads to an immense decrease in energy costs and so utilizing the technology of single molecule magnets has a potential to decrease the amount of energy being used by data centers and for example those hosted by Amazon Facebook and Google which some estimates report are responsible for roughly about two percent of the greenhouse emissions and so by decreasing the size of these data centers we decrease the cost of energy and we decrease the greenhouse emissions annually. With the modern day technology we use as mentioned prior magnetic materials such as iron and cobalt in order to get those materials we have to mind for them and this mining goes through a process called beneficiation and what that essentially means is that you're dissolving the material that surrounds the metal with an acid usually sulfuric or hydrochloric and that creates tailings which are essentially just streams of waste and this waste is typically dumped into local water sources and so with our single-molecule magnets we would be using lanthanides rather than transition metals and so lanthanides are located on this part of the periodic table while transition metals are typically up here and so the reason why this would be a greener option is because instead of going through beneficiation we could use something called ion leaching and so ion leaching is essentially just taking these clay deposits that hold lanthanides and using an ionic solution and so an ionic solution would be something a solvent and that has a table salt which is sodium chloride or lithium chloride which is a common medicine and you would essentially wash the clay in order to extract the lanthanides and so this makes it to where you don't have to dump a bunch of acid waste anywhere and instead you just have a bunch of salt lanthanides are considered rare metals while transition metals are not but this is actually a misnomer it's not due to the rarity of the lanthanide it's actually due based off of the fact that lanthanides can't be found in their metallic state in nature rather they're found as oxides and so a lanthanide for example is less rare than something like gold and silver which are commonly used in computer parts and can actually be found in over 200 rock formations in nature the recyclability of lanthanides has also been increasing Dr. Schelter a former Aggie student and a current research professor at the University of Pennsylvania recently won a green chemistry award based off of his publication in which he separated out early and late lanthanides using kinetic controls and so this allowed him to reintroduce what would originally have been waste back into the production cycle for technologies that require a lanthanides and so this advancement has the potential to decrease CO2 emissions decrease the amount of energy needed and also decrease the amount of mining needed in order to get lanthanides and so this allows us to source our research from more sustainable options. In conclusion the field of single molecule magnets is still very young and discoveries are being made each day but with the help of the National Science Foundation and the institution's at which this research can take place at such as Texas A&M University we can all inch forward towards the technology of the future. Thank you very much for listening.
