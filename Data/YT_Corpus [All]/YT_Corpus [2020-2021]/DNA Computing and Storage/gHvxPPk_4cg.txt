 from Miami Beach Florida it's the cube covering a Cronus global cyber summit 2019 brought to you by Acronis cover and welcome back to the cube coverage here in Miami Beach at the Fontainebleau Hotel for Cronus's global cyber summit 2019 John for a two days of coverage we're on day 2 learning a lot about the global security cybersecurity and protections marketplace and solutions our next guest is Alex Amir ischenko also known as Alex Mero great to have you on great chatting with you prior to coming on camera Thank You Seth come on so vice-president of cyber infrastructure Acronis essentially looking at your platform that's essentially the hyper-converged stack underneath the platform software you're enabling and essentially optimized for Oh a cyber platform you know your interesting background we were talking before we came on camera about your your background certainly you've seen waves of innovation you've been a high-performance storage enterprise infrastructure you know engineer and developer and executive lots changed in the past couple years and certainly the past decade if you run the V sand wave you saw that storage wave now we're in a cloud wave now we're on premise with hybrid all right so hybrid certainly now a big part of the operating model so the operating system is not just storage anymore it's a it's a system view what you're an personal opinion on where storage is now I've heard software-defined data center from VMware for years we've been joked about suffer to find storage software-defined compute I mean everything's software-defined but but software is the game scales a game high performance is a requirement what's changing storage right now well like everything and nothing at the same time as I said like remember going back to like 30 years ago like oh gosh you know if the storage is exploding soon we're gonna have like 2 gigabytes a company server my god and there's like or you know we're gonna come in like imagining when people started recording music or you know like like they sing this everybody thinks he's getting upset it's the same game different year but more data more storage it's it's like this exponential curve it's like the shape of the curve stays the same and to be honest like I like part of me like never believes that I was like oh come on how much bigger can again and now everybody's like oh we got I you t line we've got like those cameras streaming things 24/7 in every possible thing you can think of and of course we're gonna store everything know what to do with it but so from that point of view the demand keeps growing and we need to have technologies to handle that appropriately and again just not a matter of kind of throwing the bid somewhere it's forgetting about them it's just keeping them in the predefined order and actually being able to process them and Acronis isn't a business of cyber protection some people say oh you guys just like a backup company yeah that's a fundamental part of that but as you pointed out again in our pregame chat is the traditional data protection guys be that backup you know you can think about is their various like a raid as a way to protect your data they are all about defending against like a physical disruption of the court right okay my dis by you know it's like my datacenter died like my power went out so what do I do I was but it does not protect him what I call a logical disruption I mean back in the like the classic logical disruption or the disruption okay yeah logit estate destruction disruption disrupt no same thing i mean some ransomware is pretty much destructive I mean it's hostage at that point but I mean geological meaning non-physical not like an event like that's hurricane or outage or something like that you remove the wrong about the right file and you need to notice that and then you answer several backup cycles and then you realize oh I want my file back but then you like the backup that had that file is gone what are gonna do right nothing but disrupted the files gone that's art illogical disruptions or destructions that happens happening certainly security points that outcome where is the big thing those what the people didn't think about it back definitely not like me but like 20 years ago is like the so what happens if you see some got hacked or like people you know you know the Quran somewhere right it's specifically the product designed to like you know aquas your storage whatever you want to do there and again next thing you know you like picking up junk that will keep I read somewhere and then you go to your backups and like oh my god where's everything because it's all it's all that and I'm saying people have a really strong backup in recovery but they're recovering malware that they store it that seems like an obvious problem but like nobody but Acronis is actually provides an integrated solutions to builders there I mean there are different I mean people know what the problem is and they they're companies out there like will scan your backup archives will find you know I'm already if I got to find great but then anybody could fly to like really deal with the restore in a critical situation knows that even without the malware it concerns it's it's stressful job site yeah and it's not always predictable Anastasia right but if the malware is involved it's you know it becomes an extremely expensive and sometimes you know impossible operation a chronic stick takes care of that because you know we can actually monetary backups you know we can find out where was the last time you're you know you were clean it's a post-hoc you know where the sleeper active also to kind of real-time scanning for viruses so it's a multi-level cyber protection you know I think it's unique an illustrator well I think it's interesting how you guys have brought data protection concepts and paradigm and practice by the way into cyber it's much more holistic view right and I think that's like an operating system kind of thinking and thinking and holistically is about systems in systems has consequences something goes wrong over here it's affecting it all a place off of it and you know we have a very strong system background for DNA is that sometimes like to say that in fact they first virtualized our virtualization solution and containers for that matter were built by the Cronus engineering team more than 15 years ago way before like anybody in the Linux world knew how to spell container so that's like our storage layer software-defined storage it's fully blown HDI product Midler own understand I hope built that that's gives us a unique advantage among the security companies you know I got to ask you a question I'm a I'm fascinated a student of history and also student of competitive advantage when it comes to technology platforms and the one thing I always say and see with entrepreneurs whether the young or old is that there's two types of entrepreneurs is a systems thinker and a coder right and I think with platforms you can't shortcut a platform because there's trajectory benefits economies of scale for putting the work in you can't put a platform out there overnight you've got to have a gonna get a build it and it takes time so this is people trying to accelerate platforms some have done the work you guys have done it for a long time what's your view on that hole well I'm gonna throw a platform out there what are some of the things that that like that get exposed when I try to you know push a platform too fast well the platform presumes that you have an ecosystem people actually using it and building stuff on top of them like every if you talked about the coders right so every programmer a software developer or most of them at least they dream of two things right in your like a create a new programming language finally the one for the other kind guys like can I write any operate the system I went for that face muslin operate this is a long time code and it's you know it's a process I mean whatever your bill has to actually serve the purpose yeah if you I think there are lots of platforms in all areas of technology and then people's like oh we're gonna create a set of API is and anybody can plug it in to us it's like unless you solve a real problem and really simplify life people they're not gonna do that I'm gonna do like use the platform for the sake of using the platform our cyber platform is different because we're essentially expose our api's to our technology that's out there and people have been the user I mean I know if you saw the keynote yesterday there was the demos that wait how would you write let's go to plug in for a second better term you know the other person this interview when people can add you know their own policies to cyber protect work for which could be specific to what they do you know that plan the platform makes sense because it's already out there and that's a respond to customer demands like you know look will love what you guys do but we have the specialist specific set of requirements and keepeth general enough we incorporate it into the product but there is also a lot of things which could have been specific to a vertical or even to a specific company and we just want to enable them to do this stuff plus the platforms are there an abling right that's an able some capabilities that provides value to that right use case and that could be custom if you don't need specific but I'm sorry that could be domain-specific so yeah platforms enable capabilities for try someone I do something yes but again the key point to the platform is it has to kind of solve a real problem or not be there for the sake of elegance or submission or API final question for you Alex so I'm a CIO or seaso or I'm out there with decision making I'm like man you know I got to get I got to rethink my enterprise architecture I got to think about I got a ot command I got industrial IOT and just an end regular IOT I want to have a comprehensive platform why Cronus what's the pitch and how do you and what's different than the traditional sands and storage and other solutions out there what's that what's that what's that pitch to that enterprise decision maker Cronus you kind of like you have a tremendous growth in your in your data flows the number of data sources exploding it's actually going back to your previous question I think that's what one of the difference is that it's not just a volume of data it's the like the breadth of the data sources are getting better so you gotta have to manage that gets through somehow or it son of an Academy I don't know what they're right now is like world analogy for that thinking like how do you guys gonna manage that you have to protect it please you have to know from what you exposure rays of what the things there and just throwing out a bunch of you know like blendra technologies when products is you're not gonna solve it I mean yes you can hire lots people you can build their own thing you wouldn't be effectively - reinventing the lots of wheels in the process while we already a half of that solution for you I like the platform idea because it makes data more Dressel horizontally scalable it's not just a siloed right the salaat product out there you can actually work and enable with data data is moving around you got to be acted on ya need software to do that yes exactly exactly so that's that's another thing is it's not it keeps like in a structured data reserves on structured data there's dispatch discussions been going on for many years you know the reality is you will always have both types and you will always have a need to process them in both ways I have one more final question since I just popped in my head something a final final question what's in the infrastructure platform that you're involved in that people should know about that they might not know about that's important to investigate what does their a killer feature is there a killer thing in there that that is like notable that they should know about what's the what's under the hood on the infrastructure side for Cronus that's your favorite feature what's the one thing sides I mean like let's say like okay I've been writing storage old most of my career so I like storage but but doesn't mean it's more important or less important than other things unless you have a you know comprehensive compute layer on top of that this storage is just then become a storage underneath underneath so that's not who we are I'm really fascinated by actually the integration was they can cipher feature in the security because that's on one hand it's not something that I've been doing in my previous carrier for most of the time but I do have a lot of kind of understanding how they work flow away she is an integration points and that excites me integrated platforms is I think the key thing thanks for coming on Alex thanks for sharing your insight appreciate it first question in the morning here and my afternoon now Thank You mm and that's like everybody's so busy the Cronus inaugural global cyber summit 119 about cyber protection not data protection cyber affectionately both working and this is the cube coverage here in Miami Beach I'm John Ferrier we'll be back with more after the short break
