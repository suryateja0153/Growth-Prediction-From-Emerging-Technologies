 Garvin's aspirational goal is to achieve longer healthier lives for all Australians and the citizens of this world, the stark reality that we face is that as a Medical Research Institute we are undergoing a transformation into a data informed medical research institute,  where computing has become crucial to our very business and everything that we do around it. The big area obviously is in terms of genome sequencing, actually sequencing the genomes, analyzing the genomes and putting the genomic data in the hands of researchers or data scientists who can then unlock the secrets of disease is very much our mission. The faster we can do it more efficiently we can do it the better it is for everybody and hence our enthusiasm for our new Dell E&C power image acquisition, each one of the new Dell EMC PowerEdge servers, is dramatically different to anything that we've had before is going to be quite transformative to our business. We can sequence 50 whole human genomes per day at a price of around a thousand US dollars. We have all the statistical and bioinformatics analyses that researchers are doing right across the Institute, so it's very much around large well-established workloads and then also very bespoke workloads, it's that flexibility that the Dell E&C platform provides us today and this really is the evolution of the Institute into a data informed Institute. Is about unlocking the science that hopefully in turn will lead to the change of the practice of medicine. Dell EMC, powered by Intel Xeon scalable processors.
