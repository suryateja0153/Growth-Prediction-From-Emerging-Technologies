 [Music] Elrond welcome to this special Cuba conversation we're here in Mountain View California at the pier storage headquarters here on Castro Street one of the many buildings they have here as they continue to grow as a public company our next guest is Kix vice president of strategy employee number six at pure great to see you thanks for spending the time thanks forever so cloud is the big wave that's coming around the future something here now people are really impacted by it operationally coming to the reality that they got to actually use the cloud its benefits for it multiple benefits but you guys have major bones in storage flash arrays continuing to take territory mm-hmm so as you guys do that what's the cloud play how do customers who work using pure and we've heard some good testimonials yet a lot of happy customers we've seen great performance easy to get in reliability performance is there on the storage side on premise right okay now operations says hey yeah build faster cloud it's certainly a path there certainly a good one your thoughts on the strategy for the cloud absolutely so look we're about 10 years into the journey here at pure and a lot of what we did in the first 10 years was help bring flash onto the scene and you know we had a vision when we started the company of the all-flash datacenter and I like to first of all remind people to look we ain't there yet if you look at the analysts numbers about a third of the storage sold this year will be flash 2/3 disk so we still have a long way to go in the all-flash datacenter and a lot of work to do there but of course increasingly customers are wanting to move workloads to the cloud and I think the last couple of years have almost seen a pendulum swing a little bit more back to reality you know when I met with CIO is two three years ago you often heard we're going all cloud we're gonna be cloud first and you know now there are a few years into it and they've realized that that cloud is a very powerful weapon in their and their arsenal for agility for flexibility but it's not necessarily cheaper and so I think the the swing back to really believing in hybrid is the model of the day and I think the other thing people have realized in that journey is that the cloud really works best when you build an app prefer the cloud natively but what if you have a bunch of on-prem apps that are in traditional architecture how do I get in the cloud and so one of the things we've really focused on is how we can help customers take their mission-critical applications and move them seamlessly to the cloud without rear connect sure because for most customers that's where they're gonna start I mean they can build some new stuff in the cloud but the bulk of their business if they want to move substantial proportions to the cloud they've got to forgot how to move what they've got and we think we can really add value in that and the economics on the cloud is undeniable people who are born in the cloud will testify that certainly as you guys have been successful on-premise with the cloud how do you make those economics be seamless as well as the operations this seems to be the number one goal can you talk about how important that is and and how hard it is because it sounds easy to just say it yeah but it's actually really difficult to have seamless operations on prem because you know Amazon Google Microsoft they all got computing storage in the cloud and you got storage on-premise yeah this equation is a really important one to figure out what's the importance and how hard is it and what are some of things that you guys are doing to solve that yeah so I heard two things in that question one around cost and one around operations and you know the first thing I think that it's been nice to see over the last couple of years is people realizing that both the cloud and on from are cost effective in different ways and I think a little bit of the way that I think about owning a car owning a car is relatively cost effective for me and there's time to take an uber as well as have the cost effective I think they're both cheap when you look at on one metric though about what I pay per mile it's way more expensive to own or to take an uber if I look at about the acquisition cost it's way more expensive to own a car right and so I think both of them provide value of my lives in the way that that Hybrid does today but once you start to use both then the operational part of your question comes in how do I think about these two different worlds and I think we we believe that that storage is actually one of the areas where these two worlds are totally different and so a couple things we've done to try to bridge them together first off on the cost side one of the things we realized was that people that are gonna run large amounts of on-prem at the structure increasingly want to do it in the cloud model and so we introduced a new pricing model that we call the s2 evergreen storage service which will essentially allows you to subscribe to our storage even in your own data center and so you can have an optics experience in the cloud you got have an optics experience on prem and when you buy in the s2 those licenses are transferable so you start on-prem move your storage to the cloud with pierre go back and forth tons of flexibility from the operational point of view I think we're trying to get to the same experience as well such that you have a single storage experience from a manageability and automation point of view across both and I think that last word of automation is key because if you look at people who are really invested in cloud it's all about automation one of the nice things I think that's made Pierre so successful in on-prem cloud environments is this combination of simplicity and automation you can't wait out a mate what is it simple to begin with and and so we started with simplicity but as we've added rich API is we're really seeing that become the dominant way that people administrated our storage and so as we've gone to the cloud because it's the same soft form both sides literally the same integrations the same API calls everything works transparently across both places that's a great point we've been reporting on silken hang on the cube for years automation spray if you have to a couple of manual tests should automate it but the values been shifting and you guys in the storage business you know this data is data data is very valuable you mentioned the car now let's just take Ober ubers an app it's got Web Services in the backend so when you start thinking about cloud you think here api's you hear micro services as more and more applications going to need the data they're gonna need to have that in real time some cases not near real time either real time and they're gonna need to have it at the right time so the role of data becomes important which makes storage more important so if you automate the storage okay take away the mundane tasks now the value shifts to making sure data is being presented properly this is the Renaissance of application development right now we're seeing this you're how do you guys attack that market how do you guys enable that market how do you satisfy that market because this is where the api's can be connectors this is where the data can be valuable whether it's analytics or an app like uber that's just you know slinging api's together for a service that is now gonna go public yeah I think the mindset around data is one of the biggest differences between the old world in the new world and if you think about the old world of applications you had monolithic databases that kind of privately owned their own data stores and the whole name of the game was delivering that as reliably as possible kind of locking it down and making it super reliable if you look at the idea of the web scale application the idea of an application is broken up into lots of little micro services and those micro services somehow have to work together on data and so what does it mean at the data level it's not this kind of monolithic database anymore it's got to be this open shared environment and you know as a result if you look in the in the web in Amazon's case for example the vast majority of applications are written on s3 object storage that's inherently shared and so I think one of the bigger interesting challenges right now is how you get data constructs to actually go both ways you know if you want to take a non-prime app that kind of is built around the database you've got to figure out a way to move it to the cloud and run it reliably but on the flip side of the coin if you want to build in web skill tools and then be hybrid and run some of those things on Prem well you need an object to run from and most people don't have that and so you know this whole kind of compatibility to make hybrid reality it's forcing people on both sides of the wire to understand the other architecture and make sure they're compatible both ways and you just throw more complexity into that equation is that skills gaps I know I know in cloud NIDA but now when on pram it's a different skill gap you guys had an announcement that's come out so I want to ask you about your product announcements and your accusations go back to past six months what's the most notable product announcements and acquisitions and you guys have done and what does that mean for pure and your customers yeah absolutely so I'll just kind of walk through it so the first thing we announced was our our new set of cloud data services and this was in essence bringing our core software that runs on our purity operating environment right into the cloud and so we call that cloud block store and again this is a lot of what I've been talking about how you can take a tier one block storage application on Prem and seamlessly move it to the cloud along that same timeline we also introduced something called PSO which is the pure service Orchestrator and this was a toolset that we built specifically for the containers world for kubernetes so that basically in a container environment our storage can be completely automated it's been really fun watching customers use and just see how different that storage is in a container environment you know we look at our call home data within our pr1 application and in our traditional on-prem environment the average array it has about one administrative tasks per day make a volume delete something whatever if you look in a container environment that's tens of thousands and so it's just a much more fluid environment which there's no way a storage admins gonna do something 10,000 times in a day they've got out and that's where automation comes in but what does that mean the containerization that means the clients are using containers move to be more flexible are they deploying more what's the what's insight out of this container trend you know I think ultimately it's just a far more fluid environment it's totally automated and it's built on in a world of shared data and so you need a shared reliable data service that can power these containers and then you know back to original question about about kind of product expansion then the next thing that we announced last year was acquisition of a company called store reduce and though we've subsequently brought out as a product that we call object engine and this is all about a new type of data moving into the cloud which is back up data and facilitating this backup process you know in the past people moved from tape backup to disk based backup and you know we saw kind of two new inflection points here number one the opportunity to use flash on-prem so that people have really fast recoveries on-prem because in most environments now disk based recovery is just aren't fast enough and then using low-cost object storage in the cloud for retention so the combination of flash on-prem and object storage in the cloud can completely replace both disk and tape and the backup process okay so talk about the competition because you guys came in really with the vision of an all flash data center you now have cloud software that runs on Amazon and others but there's no hardware just the block source which is a great solution how have the competition fallen behind because you guys really kind of catapulted into the lead took share certainly from other vendors in my public somewhat predicted that pure would never make it to escape velocity yeah some other pundits and other CEOs of tech companies said that you guys achieve that but their success now you guys go the next level what is the importance of that ability you have and what's the inability of the competition so you know I like to joke with folks that when we started the company I think flash was just an excuse you know we just tried to build a better storage company and we went out and I talked to many many many customers and I found in general they didn't just not like their stories products they didn't like the companies that sold it to them and so we tried to look at that overall experience and you know we of course innovated around flash the use consumer fresh brought the price down so you could actually afford to use it with deduplication but we also just looked at that ownership experience and when I talked to two folks in the industry I think now we might even be better known for our evergreen approach than even for flash and it's been neat to watch customers now that even the earliest peer customers are two or three cycles of refresh in they've seen a dramatic difference in just the storage experience that you can essentially subscribe to an own over time through many generations of technology churn as opposed to that cycle of replacing arrays share a story of a customer that's been through those refresh cycles from their first experience to what they're experienced now what is so what's some of the experiences like and you share some some insight yeah so you know one of one of the first customers that really turned us on to this at scale was a large telco provider and they were interesting and they run you know hundreds of tier one arrays from from competitors and you know they do a three-year cycle but as they really like looked at the the cost of that three-year cycle they realized that it was 18 months of usable life in those three years because it took them nine months to get the data on the array and then when they knew the end was coming it took him nine months to get the data off the array and so Perea was costing him a million dollars just in data migration cost alone then you've wasted half of your life of the array and so add that up over hundreds of Ray's in your environment you can quickly get the math it's the total cost of ownership it's out of control right yeah and so as we brought in evergreen you know there was just an immediate ROI I mean it was a cost equation it was you know on parity with flashy discs anyway but if you look at all those operational savings it just it was completely different and so I think what we started with evergreen we realized it was much more of a subscription model where people subscribe to a service with us we update and refresh the hardware over time and it just keeps getting better over time sounds a lot like the cloud right and so we really pay your strategies to bring common set of tools in there and greet them again that kind of services have been key yeah yeah I think you know another thing that we did from day one was just said look we're never gonna build a piece of on-prem management software so our on print or our management experience from day one was pure one which is our staff based management platform you know it started out as a call home application but now as a very full-featured SAS based management experience and that's also served as well as you go to the cloud because when you want to manage on-prem in the cloud together we're better to do it from then the cloud itself to about the application environment you mentioned it earlier hybrid multi clouds here a lot of pressure of an IT to get top-line revenue not just cost reduction those are good benefits you mentioned certainly gets their attention but changing the organization's value proposition to their customers is about the experience neither app driven or some other tech yeah this is now an imperative it's happening very fast modernization Renaissance um people call it all these things you guys helping that piece of the puzzle yeah I mean I think ultimately that for most customers as they start to really get in their mindset that technology is there differentiation the speed and agility of their developers becomes key and so you know modern CIO is much less about being a cost-cutting CIO today and much more about an empowering CIO and how you can actually build the tools and bring them to bear for the organization to run faster and a lot of that is about unlocking consumption and so it's been it's been fun to see some of the lessons of the cloud in terms of instant consumption agility growth actually come to the mindset of how people think about on-prem as well and so a lot of what we've done is tried to get to arm people on prem with those same capabilities so that they can easily deliver storage of service to their customers so folks can consume via API without having to call somebody to ask for storage so things can take seconds not weeks of procurement right and then now as we bridge those models between on permanent cloud it becomes a single spot where you can basically have that same experience to request storage wherever it may be in your organization the infrastructure as code is really just you know pushing code not from localhost or the Machine but to cloud or on-premise I don't end of trickle all the way through this is one of the focuses we're hearing in cloud native conversations as you know words like containers we talked briefly about you mentioned in the activities hi kubernetes is really hot right now service meshes micro services stateful data stateless data these are like really hyped up areas but a lot of traction for some people take a look at it how do you guys speak to the your customers when they say hey Kix and we love all the pure stuff we're on our third iteration or anthing about being a customer I got this looming you know trend I got to understand and either operationalize or not around kubernetes service mesh these kinds of cloud native tools how do you guys talk to that customer what's the pitch that's the value proposition yeah I mean I think you know your new Kerberos environment is the last place you should consider a legacy storage you know all joking aside we've been really I think positively impressed around how fast the adoption has started around containers in general and kubernetes you know it started out as a developer thing and you know we first saw it in our environment when we started to build our second product up your Flash blade four or five years ago engineering team started with Canadians from day one it was like that's interesting and so we started to see that useful and we got containers in kubernetes worker straight pretty nice and so you know we just started to see that grow we also started to see it more within analytics and AI you know as we got into AI with Airy and and our broader push around going after big data and analytics those tool chains in particular were very well set up to take advantage of containers because they're much more modern that's much more about you know fluidly creating this data pipeline and so it started in these key use cases but I think you know it's at a point right now where every Enterprise is considering it there's certainly an opportunity in the development environment and you know despite all of that the folks who tend to use these containers they don't think about storage you know that if they go to the cloud and they start to build applications they're not thinking many layers down in the organization what the storage that supports me looks like and so if you look at a storage teams job or an ephah structure seems job is to provide that same experience to your container centric consumers right they should just be able to orchestrate and and build and then storage should just happen underneath I totally agree and I think that's success milestones you can have that conversation not even be had you know you're winning what they do care about we're hearing more of what you just mentioned earlier about data pipelining data they care about because applications will be needing data but it's a retail app or whatever I might need to have access to multiple data not some siloed or you know data warehouse that might have lowly you know high latency yeah they need data in the app at the right moment this has been a key discussion real-time I mean this is the data that's been a hard problem yeah how do you guys look at that solution opportunity for your customers I think one of the insights we had was that fundamentally folks need an infrastructure that can not just run one tool or another tool but a whole bunch of them and you know you look at people building a data pipeline they're stitching together six eight ten tools that exist today and another twenty that our new system are oh and that flexibility is is key right a lot of the original thought in that space was I'm gonna pick the right storage for this piece or the right storage for that piece but as we introduced our flash plate product we really positioned it as a data hub for these modern applications and each of them require something a little different but the flexibility and scale of Flash blade was able to provide everything those applications needed we're now seeing another opportunity in that space with Daz and architecture you know as we came out with Envy me over fabrics within our flash great product line we see this as a way to really take web-scale architecture on Prem you know you liquids within Google and Amazon and whatnot right they're not using hyper converge they're not using dad's disk inside of the same chassis that happens to run applications they have dedicated infrastructure for storage that's specifically designed for it they have dedicated servers and they're connected with fast internet you know cannot networking on demand and so we're basically trying to bring that same architecture to the on-prem environment with nvme of our fabric because i mean me of our fabric can make local disk feel like you know as fast this is the shift that's really going on here this is a complete reaaahhr texture of computing and storage resources absolutely yeah and I think the the thing that's changing it is that need for consolidation and the early days I might have said okay I'm gonna deploy I don't know 200 nodes of Hadoop and I'll just design a server for Hadoop with the right amount of disk in it and put them over in those racks and that'll be like this and then I'll design something else for something else right now people are looking for defining a rack that they can print out over and over and over and over again and that rack needs to be flexible enough to deliver the right amount of storage to every application on demand over NDB over fat you know one trend that I won't get your reaction to is server list because this kind of points to that value proposition functions have been very popular but still early days on what functions are yeah and but it's a tell sign a little bit on where this is going to your point around thinking rethinking on-prem not in the radical wholesale business model change but just more of operating change how its deployed and how it works at the cloud because those two things if working together make server lists very interesting yeah absolutely I mean it's just a further form of abstraction ultimately from the underlying hardware and so you know if you think about functions on demand or that kind of thing that's absolutely something that just needs a big shared pool of storage and not to have any persistent bindings to anything you know to be able to get to the storage of needs do its tasks right what it needs to and get out of the way right well VP a strategy a big role you guys done a good job so congratulations being the number six employee of pure how's the journey been you guys have gone public still growing it's been around for it almost ten years you're not a really small little company anymore so you're getting into bigger accounts growing how's that journey been for you it's so it's been an amazing ride that's why I'm still here coming in they excited to come to work I think the thing that were the proudest of is it still feels like a small company it still feels with like we have as much aggression at much paint you know excitement to go after the market every day as we always have the orange is very very strong but on the flip side it's now fun that we get to solve customer problems at a scale that we probably couldn't even imagine in the early days and I'd also say right now it really feels like there's this next chapter opening up you know we the first chapter was delivering the all flashes and we're not even done with that yet but as we bring our software to the cloud and really port it to natively be optimized for each of the clouds it kind of opens up our engineers to be creative in different ways generational shift happening is seeing it you know again application modernization hybrid multi-cloud at just some key pillars but there's so much more opportunity to go I want to get your thoughts you've had the luxury of being working under two CEOs that have been very senior veterans Scott Dietzen and Charlie what's it like working for both of them and what's it like with Charlie now what's what's the big Mandy with what's the hill you guys are trying to climb share some of the vision around the Charlie's well I'd say the the thing that binds both Scott and Charlie together in in DNA is that they're fundamentally both innovators and you know if you look at pure we're never gonna be the low-cost leader we're never gonna be the company that sells you everything so we have to be the company that's most innovative in this basis we play in and so you know that's job number one at pure after reliability so let's say that's job number two but but but that's key and I think both of both of our CEOs have shared that common DNA which is they're fundamentally product innovators and I think the thing the fun thing about working for charlie is he's really thoughtful about how you running a company at very large scale how you how you manage the customer relationship to never sacrifice that experience because that's been great for pure but ultimately how you also unlike people to run faster in a bigger organization chanting John Chambers who Charlie worked with at Cisco would they back in the day he said one of the key things about a CEO is picking the right wave the right time what is that way for pure what are you guys riding that takes advantage of the work you still got to do in the data center on the storage side what's the big wave um so you know look the the first wave was flash that was a great wave to be on and as or it's not over but we really see an enormous opportunity where cloud infrastructure mentality comes on Prem and you know we think that's gonna finally be the thing that gets people out of the mindset of doing things the old way you know you fundamentally can take the lessons we learned over here and apply them to the other side of my hybrid cloud every talks about hybrid cloud and all the thought process is what happens over the cloud half of the hybrid yeah well the on Prem half of the hybrid is just as important and getting that to be truly cloud era is a key focus of our yeah and then again micro-service has only helped accelerate and you want modern storage to your point to make that work absolutely Kix thanks for spending the time in sphere in the insights I really appreciate it it's the cube conversation here at pure storage headquarters we are in the arcade room getting the insights and sharing the data with you I'm Java for you thanks for watching this cube conversation
