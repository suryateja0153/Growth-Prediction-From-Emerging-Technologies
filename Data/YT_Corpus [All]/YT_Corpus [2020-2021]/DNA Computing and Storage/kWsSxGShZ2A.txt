 [Music] welcome everyone and Nicolas Chavez and the product manager for Gmail security and my colleague is Nicolas as well I'm a hi I'm Nicolas Bosque I'm a technically this working on a gmail and G suite security engineering so welcome to the session CP 211 Gmail security on advanced security features and thanks to all of you for being here I'm going to switch slide so I looked at who's came today and I saw a lot of you are responsible for security within your organization so you're basically the heroes of the organization because protecting user is one of the most important things these days it's a top rightly for business because of all the issues that you're all aware about like business email compromised phishing attack and over attacks and over so G suite protection starts with Gmail and why why why Gmail why email because email is actually one of the most busiest vector to reach the largest number of people so in this presentation we'll go through three different sections the first one being advancing phishing and malware protection the second one would be about encryptions and what Gmail is doing to better protect email on transit and the third one would be around right management information right management that will provide to users so we leave time at the end for Q&A if you if you have any question so starting with Gmail and fishing fishing has been around for a long time it used to be pretty straightforward to detect phishing attacks because we males we are not very difficult to identify there were typos and things like that but fishing has evolved quite a lot malware also something that is distributed primarily via email to third of malware come from email and enterprise customer event of enterprise corporate account of users receive an average four point three times more malware via email than regular consumers so corporate accounts are much more targeted another category of attacks around data breach it can be either via users and internationally making mistake and leaking data or it can be also attack on the on the to to the cooperate infrastructure in one category of malware we've seen a large growth and these numbers are not from Google visa to big numbers from I think the note had at the bottom right from the horizon and other studies but run somewhere as a type of malware I've seen huge growth over the last few years there's been a lot of news about it and it costs businesses billions every year to to address these issues so that's really a category of malware where we've seen a lot of growth so what is Google and Gmail what are we doing to protect you is Gmail uses machine learning technologies that are developed across Google and apply that to to fighting phishing phishing attack we also have what when you use machine learning one of the information that we need you need to train models is ground truth and because gmail has over 1.5 billion users we have a lot of ground truth coming from users and feedback loop which helps us improve our models and train our models it's also Gmail it was last week gmail 15th birthday so Gmail has experienced now on fighting spam phishing and from the beginning Gmail was one of the first service to really focus all on spam detection here are some numbers I'm not gonna go for each of them but as you can see the norm those are pretty large every minute just as an example 10 million spam messages are blocked and not from being delivered to the users mailbox so it's video scale business at scale and this slide is about early detection there are two ways to do better we are at detecting and this is what Nikko is gonna is going to talk about and avoiding delivery in the mailbox of of bad emails the last remediation we are for businesses so focusing on improving detection is the top priority for us I already mentioned that earlier the self learning models so that's something that Google is investing a lot on and we we are the mix of heuristic and self learning models all the time we are doing more and more on the machine learning side and we've seen really really big improvement in the quality of detection by using machine learning and as I mentioned much these models have been developed or the technologies have been developed across Google in different businesses for example we use machine learning for image analysis to recognize logos or fake logos into images this was developed by over other teams within Google and were using that in Gmail to improve to improve detection and the last bullet the last part rare is personalized for you as an example for spam not everyone is going to find for a given email it can be considered spam for certain user and not planned for others so we need to have models that are personalized for each user because not everything spam doesn't mean the same thing for everyone and not all emails are spam for users it's different for fishing and really malicious messages which don't have to be to be personalized but spam is video category of message is where personalization is very important so what is fishing now we are going to talk a little bit about fishing fishing is basically a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity in the electronic communication so today fishing is one of a major attack use on the internet and why fishing versus other type of attacks one of the thing is fishing is relatively simple for attackers to use compared to malware creating a malware or an application can be much more complex or script inside inside inside an office documents or something like that but fishing is pretty straightforward and easy to do the second way is scalability with phishing send by email your attacks can be very scalable and the last one is return on investment sort of a result of a previous to simplicity and scalability these days attackers are often people who try to make money and they look at via Hawaii if it cost them too much to do an attack when we are not going to spend their time on that and we are going to use another vector their exception like the states installer tag but don't do that for money but for the last large majority things like Branson Wales and over us the people the attackers what they want is to make money so the harder or their life is and to do we attack the the it reduces basically the the risk of events using that vector for for attacking so fishing as these are just screenshot of newspaper but it has evolved over time when it started fishing was pretty easy to detect it was not targeted at all today non targeted fishing as still the majority of fishing but we see more and more and it's growing targeted fishings and the way attackers do that is they are going to for example look at the company and do some research about the company or what are the suppliers of this company which what are the other companies this company makes business with and we are going to do fishing by using the name of the supplier or something like that they will do spoofing that's these are much more advanced attack that are smaller scale so more difficult to to detect and that are much more effective because people are not as cautious when they see an email coming from someone with a supplier for example or but fakes to be a supplier so these targeted attacks are much more difficult to to identify but we have technologies for that and now I'm going to have Nicola provide some insight about how we about phishing and what we do for fishing all right so today we are going to go mostly about credential fishing now as its most prevalent form we have seen the reason for the popularity of these attacks is basically that phishing attack are it makes it really easy for an attacker to ask the victim all the relevant information for successful hijacking you can ask for a username password additional information and some victim are going to answer so the vid sector despite being one of the easiest to pull off it looks so one of the most successful one so we studied a couple years ago we studied like the different type of attacks that are efficient on internet and we published paper how we reveal that or discovery with the victims of phishing actually much more successfully hijacked afterwards then the victim of other major hijacking vector like key loggers or credential leaks its back to the point that phishing are allowed the attacker to get all information they need to access the target system so Fisher's try to make it there difficult to pin down they try different methods and move forward so we know that window of vulnerability actually very small like they are reported very quickly and then the attack will stop to work so what they are doing they are trying to go very small in a short period of time and then they are going to switch to a different attack before the difference mechanism how about you need to catch up so we know that the median number of phishing email in campaign is only 250 emails so the half-life of a campaign is only 12 minutes so it's up the defense here needs to be extremely fast and reactive to be able to handle this so we're going to go over different phases of phishing attack as well the protection will provide like generally can categorize the component that need to fail for successful phishing attack first the email service he needs to basically let the email go through and not provide enough information to the user to prevent it then the phishing website is going to gather the credentials and finally the stolen credentials going to be used on the target website so the first attack Gmail is going me here to defend you like we have a machine system as well as extensive UX to help user defend themselves then the Chrome browser is going to provide the additional protection against phishing website and finally we'll go over security kiss or defensive so to understand the many opportunities the defense hot here when go over the life cycle of phishing email so the first element is one everybody is very comfortable with its delivery everybody is aware of email delivery is coming to SMTP at this stage that's when you have a lot of mail filter we are going to catch immediately or not the attack so what Google we use an a wide array of techniques to actually distinguish good emails from bad ones the techniques here range from repeat analysis where we are going to just understand the sender message header understand what email comes from then we have content understanding where we are actually going good through the content and of system are going to determine whether something is risky in the content of the message and finally we have clustering christening our array of techniques that group similar behavior and find patterns of abuse so the first one of the techniques which video reputation it's fairly straightforward reputation technique is similar to blacklist in of bad actors and then we have observation of previous bad behaviors as well as a rank ranking on them and we are going to use that to identify what is wrong like we identify like IP address other cluster that are known as bad subnet AF number domains URL prefix and this provides very direct feature to know what something is bad we also have feedback Krukow user helping us there both to marketing as well as well as mock that things are not bad and sometimes when in case of IP address we want actually to end up YT visiting them so we are not blocked forever the next element is content understanding statically understanding the content of message for system to be able to identify something is similar to non good or bad pattern so we are using text and image similarity detection to enhance or different system and I don't write roofing in this case you can see we identified text looking like Google or images look like Google logo and we can use that to notify like something is suspicious down the system that will reject or not email finally clustering questioning is really critical nowadays and AI is really enabling a Google to efficiently protect billions of user today like we use was a different technique and we have been like early adopter of AI - and we have multiple layers of linear regression model as well as neural networks and those multiple techniques allowing us to have extremely efficient model to separate good from bad traffic so now that we are done with delivery is not over one very important concept here is the temporality of emails like you get delivery but you're not opening the email right away and it's additional time you can take take advantage of to provide additional differences for users so I think in times basically when the email is synchronized from storage into your client this opportunity to first we have a limited and we needed most of the fishing during delivery it's only a subset now and we are going to add additional information in the message to allow the client to display the right information to user in particular for element that are suspicious we are going to let them information flow through so we we know we also providing like sank addition of the content to ensure that the content will render similarly on multiple client so people cannot like have selective contact in one grant that with the other to hide attacks the next stage is message open at this stage the email is opened by the user if you are suspicious element in the message we are we want to provide them as crew to the user like the machine learning system the automated detection was not able to provide the verdict that was bad but who may know it something is suspicious and this is a really critical opportunity to help user defend themselves so Google had security warnings in Gmail for extremely long time however as part of the gmail redesign we worked on last year we work extremely closely with user experience team on the security aspect of warning banners the new warning banner are extremely bold and with a clear call to action so for risky messages we even disabled capabilities such as links and attachment and this had a huge impact on reducing interaction with malicious emails time is of the essence here and we can actually benefit from constant evaluation of bad sides by the attachment and reclassify contact during that even after the message came to you to an inbox it is possible to change or open of it we may have some new data they tell us this is actually dangerous and we can modify the banner so we are never just delivering email and forgetting about it instead we are constantly monitoring afterwards so user benefit from new rules new model and date focus on user safety so a real example of that is something we we launched very recently which is outbreak warning banners basically if an employee of the organization is reporting an email as phishing we're going to propagate quickly that information across the organization and similar emails will be very quickly labeled as such preventing like widespread attack so after we have message open the next element and the fishing flow is actually a link clicking that case that's when the attacker is going to redirect the user to phishing website to have a screenshot for instance so here will provide real-time check which means that we we do an additional check of phishing links when you click on the link it goes technically to resurrector Gmail that will analyze again the later Safe Browsing definition for fishing as well as my website the point he has to be the most up-to-date possible another vector for filk attack is reply people are going to ask for information and buy an email and sometimes people will fall for it so a protection we added here is differences on lucre like name inside the domain if someone is pretending to be someone in your dog we'll be able to let you know that the name is confusing and you need to be very careful about it like we had a vast array of phishing attack that pretended to be the CEO could a community the company and this is what this difference is targeted so in addition we provide a vast array of additional control for domain administrator to improve the defenses and select multiple techniques that will define the user so nicholai not going over malware protection but we offer to our users so for malware we also as well like for phishing have a multi layer approach so we do use many heavy engines and we run a five for all these avenging so when you use Gmail and and and this which you're protected by many antivirus engine so that's one thing the second thing is we block attachment that are not trusted so we block executable in Gmail so you can't say negligible by email or we block attachments that are encrypted and with scripts that's an option you can disable as an admin by default it's off but that's something that you can enable in your domain it really depends on your companies and the third one is your de protection so if malware already known they will be caught by the different ad engine but for new malware for the one that are created today they're basically not listed yet on the ad engine so what we do is we do a mix of static and dynamic analysis so we look inside the address script inside the file and we evaluate the level of risk for these scripts so this is a technique that proves to be quite effective for detecting zero the the or them aware another thing that we do and that we are launching in bed tomorrow so that's that's a news is security sandbox so for file that are at potentially at risk we open them in virtual machines and we look at the what they do in the operating system and based on that we decide to block the file or not we do that for all users based on the risk associated with the file and if you use the Enterprise Edition we do that exhaustively for all your files that are not already called by another a virus antivirus so you get basically one out percent of your file scan that way if you're using the Enterprise Edition of this week and if the file doesn't be already caught by an antivirus another think related to malware to protecting and malware on the the end user side is when you use Gmail when you open a file it opens us preview in in Gmail as a preview the result of that is in most cases the users don't have to download the file on their computer and open the file from the computer so by previewing a file in Gmail it eliminates the risk associated with that file of scrape running and things like that so it's completely safe to open the file in preview mode in in Gmail so that's for phishing and malware we've covered by section phishing malware in Gmail the detection in Gmail now I would like to talk about the detection of phishing website with Chrome as we mentioned earlier it's really a layered approach so in chrome what consumers see today is that when you get to a page that is known by Chrome and Safe Browsing to be to be malicious where is a page like that but once the usual it's available for consumers as well but as a consumer you still have the ability to go further what we provide is with a policy admins can decide for the for the users of their domain to block users and prevent them to go further if they try to visit a page that is known to be a malicious page so that's something that is managed by fufu group policy and you can also use Active Directory if that's what you prefer to use another thing that we provide is a password detection so here is an example the video is playing is a user tries goes to a travel site and try and uses his corporate password to log in and what happens is that we've chrome from the tag that the users trying to use a copyright password to log into a site but as is a public internet site and blog the user from it and then the user is forced to change his corporate password so that really provide a protection because the same password being used on multiple site is a known source of risk because if your corporate password is on the side that then get hijacked the the attacker of that site are going to have a credential of the users and they are going to be able to to log in to your to your copper to the corporate account of the user so password alert is a policy of Chrome browser that itn mean can can use to protect copyright account and copyright account can be both Google and on Google account so the last part is about account protection so two-factor authentication is better than just one factor just regular credential email and password but something to keep in mind that two-factor authentication with a passcode whether it's a passcode given by an app running on your phone or an SMS that you receive is vulnerable so and if we look at this example imagine the user he logs in with credential his credential email and password and there is a man in the middle here the man in the middle is usually not a real person it's a proxy so everything is done automatically so the person here is trying to log into a site the right box here thinking that a legitimate site on the right side and he entered his email and password the man in German or does with fedsim and logs in and then the user enters the passcode that he has to log into a site and turns it the man in the middle catches it and is able to log into the legitimate site so although what we are seeing is there are more and more open-source tool kits available for an attacker to easily set up so do this this type of attack so although it's better than nothing second factor with passcode is vulnerable so what we use at Google and what more and more district customers are now using is the Securities and the way securities work is imagine the lady here logs in with her email and password and then instead of entering a passcode it's basically the security key that sends a passcode to the site in the middle the managers site that is supposed to set the passcode but the security he sees that google.com is not very google.com and is not going to send this this authentication and as a result of that the authentication is going to fail and the man in the middle will not be able to access the legitimate site so security keys we will use them at Google's and we use them we haven't had any hijacking successful at Google so it's really very effective it's also affordable the price range is between 20 to $50 depending on the model US dollar compared to a price of a computer it's not it's not a big cost and really adds a lot of security so we really recommend that you consider using it so I can just talk about it and now I want would like to talk a little bit about what is available for administrators basically our approach on security for G suite and Google is to provide simple tools for you to configure to tune the security that we provide by default we want we want users to be safe by default even if you do nothing but if you want to tune the security it should not be it should be simple so here is a example of screenshot of something called security centers where you can get analytics and security best practice as well as some security investigation you can look at charms drill down into the logs and do all of that from from a simple user interface for fine men we also provide control to to fine-tune the security of phishing and malware protection some examples I will not go for the list if you go to the admin console it's available to all edition of G sweetened and and you can look at the breadth of the controls but some examples protections again an encrypted attachment that are sent by untrusted senders or protection against anomalous attachment type of emails an example of that is you have your company and your receive file type the type of file one of a non-player receive a file that no one in your company ever received so it may be legitimate but most likely there is a high likelihood that there is a risk associated with it so Veon means now have the ability to say hey when file like that comes movie to quarantine so we apply intelligence and we do analysis to identify for each domain what are the file type that are very uncommon and it's possible to add white these foreign means but we most of the work is done for you so all you have to do is is checker box will also provide spoofy Neko talked about it and additional protection like looking behind shorten links or looking inside images to see their logos of data being used for fish fishing purpose so it's a lot so as a summary and I won't go through each and every box here because niccola cover most of it but in summary for gmail what do we do we provide different layer of protection the Gmail Chrome and security keys for account protection against hijacking we use a breadth of technologies clustering machine learning models using thousands of features we use computer vision for images do static or dynamic analysis of attachments and and security sandbox that I mentioned one of the differentiators G suite is the breadth we have 1.5 billion users and the report feedback and we have a very large number of users on Chrome as well so all of these data that we receive can help us help us train our machine learning models to be to be more more effective another thing here is what Michael mentioned earlier is making the best use of time by checking at clique time for example time is really critical to for detection and because more time we have more signal we have coming from antiviruses from users reporting phishing messages so by doing things like checking our click time it increases the chance of catching malicious malicious link and also the Enterprise Protection that we mentioned earlier so now Niko is going to talk about what Gmail is launching soon to increase safety in email in transit you know in encryption all right so very important topic for us has been how to protect Amyris kal going over Internet so gmail has led the very big scrutiny on email protection in trended vertically encryption of SMTP it front entrance turned it has been an afterthought of email protocol and we invested extensively to actually make people understand like where the improvement to be done so in 2014 we launched a dashboard showing people the reality of the situation where you had 3/4 of the email go rich in Gmail that was not encrypted when it came from other provider this actually led a big increase in encryption in transit then in 2016 we added an indicator in Gmail showing users when they receive email from Thunderbird San clear text email and did not care as much about their security another but however it doesn't show the fact that the SMTP protocol itself is doing opportunistic security radically when you send an email when a lease right with an email to Bob email used to being totally key attacks then start CLS was added in 1999 which offer an opportunistic encryption which means if both and agree on supporting encryption very long crypto trend it sounds great however an attacker I can any point in time do an active man in the middle attack again the traffic and the deliberate encryption so attacker can just place themselves in the middle they can just break the capability detection of the service and the traffic will go in protected and attacker can actually listen to traffic so over the last three years we have worked with in IETF turned our body to build a new standard for email in transit and we had amazing work from Google as well as over large email providers and Internet community at large and we are very excited to announce that Gmail is going to become the first major email to follow the new MTA STS as well as TLS reporting standard so I'm very proud that my team actually design and build the first large-scale implementation that is coming to you starting tomorrow so the MT STS is basically offering the recipient demand ability to specify a policy so that the sender that sea-bottom GSEs will verify that the smtp connection is properly encrypted as well as authenticated with valid public certificate this is combined with Telus reporting which will make the Thunder domain of Thunder daily report to the recipient domain for Emerald fronted encryption and issues will actually be reported so this standard is a first big step that of enforcement of security in transit on internet for mail so in practice how does it look like in this case and the SMTP sender is going to actually read the policy set up by the recipient domain and the Thunder will refuse to deliver email without valid TLS and first the server certificate in case we can see if only the Thunder is not able to communicate on cruising on Krypton manner with the recipient we had that policy specifying always encrypt it the email would stop additionally the reporting's and I will actually send a report and the report will contain information about the failure so this done this reporting who looks like that which should dedicate JSON file that explain exactly what era what observe and this is like deterrence against anybody who will try to do interception not only intercept our time for interception of electrons traffic is going to be prevented it will see reported so what why do you need this today um the immediate benefit you can have today is for yourself to set the policy for your domain which means anybody using a sander stack with supporting MTS yes will actually be able to send you encrypt to over the email encrypted there's no guaranteed way you can also contact all your partners and ask them to set up a policy and then as you sign in using Gmail stack you will actually have your email protected like that in transit so again this is launching in beta tomorrow so please check this fit update on and Annika is going to go back on how you can protect sensitive content in email so we provide a product feature in Gmail called confidential mode and what it does it provides basically right management for email and with content exploration and two-factor authentication we launched this feature for consumer with a new gmail last year and we've waited to launch it to enterprise and we launched in beta earlier the last month actually because we wanted to complete the integration with vault for discovery for enterprise wanted the product to be ready and so what is Gmail confidential mode it basically the way it works is at the time you're sending an email it strips out the content the body of the email and replaces by link and email goes over the internet with a link and the content itself stained your mailbox so the recipient on that email to view the content will get the content via HTTP at you time so the content will never physically be in the recipient mailbox one benefit of that is if you can request for authentication of a recipient that the recipient gets a passcode by SMS the value of that is if the mailbox of a recipient for example is hijacked the recipient who has hijacked the mailbox and SMS verification will not be able to get the content because at the time the SMS will be requested it will go to the to the real owner of the mailbox another advantage of that is the content transit of HTTPS with which is a secure channel and you also have the ability to make content expire so if you want to send content to someone but the content web person doesn't get access to content forever it's also it's also possible so we provide for these feature as I mentioned the feature didn't a lot of the same time as consumer because we wanted to build this integration with volt it's possible to set up volt policies of retention and export on the recipient mailbox and if the contact is sent by someone within our organization so you have access to the content of of a center of mailbox as well you are able to set this policies basically and if you do not want to for whatever reason to receive Gmail confidential email you can always use the lp rules to to block this content you have full control on that so to summarize what we covered today because we could have quite a lot one of the thing is I hope we manage to convince you that this which really has as a top priority to make communication secure and using email and as secure as possible that lots of top right of us and what we want is what users are saved by default that's our top priority the second thing is we what ticket just cover the enhancing protection as well on transit and the last thing is helping user protections if the--if content by playing policies right management into email these are two free takeaways of a presentation today and we have a little bit of time for for Q&A that's a quote from one of our customer the city of Boston that has seen great resolve a using G suite and compared to their prior a system for security they've seen a big upgrade [Music]
