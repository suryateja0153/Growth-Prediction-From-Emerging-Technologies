 over to you Daphne welcome just how many people are biologists raised ahem okay so few how many computer science okay okay so probably rich is right so climate change is already affecting crops for every one degree change there's expected to be a two to fifteen percent reduction in yield and this is already pretty bad but also it's important to know that it's not equally affecting our crops so most of the talks are wheat and corn and these are actually the ones that are most resilient to climate change in temperature change but on the other hand a lot of our favorite crops like potatoes they're the ones that are least resistant to temperature change and and the fact that they're and so this local economies that rely on these kinds of crops could be devastated when we have some hope because plans aren't actually limited by their environments completely plans are sensing their environment and planning for the future so a normal like fail crafts plant when it's grown at 12 degrees is like kind of tiny but if you mutate the plan so it can't sense the temperature it grows to be huge so what that means is that we can kind of figure out what the plants are doing to plan for the future and trick them into growing and producing more yields so that's what we're kind of interested in doing figuring out power plants predicting what the future weather will be and can we fool them so well I'm gonna try so what are the data science questions involved so we want to predict things like planned high yield we want to predict flowering time and when to harvest the plans we want to predict whether they'll survive after stress or fungal infection and we also are interested in understanding the molecular behavior plants who want to be able to put a certain intermediate molecular factors and what's nice about doing research on plants instead of humans is you can do interventions so you can grow plants and growth chambers and control temperature and life you can mutate the plans and you can also kind of use natural environments and track things over time so you can also exploit like random fluctuations and things as well so there's lots of data types which are very nice for for a set of scientists from images to sequences time series and even networks so I'm going to go through a couple of projects that are taking place at the alan turing institute and that are involve all the different aspects of how do you map genetics and environments to growth and development and a lot of these projects go through the intermediate staff of the internal state of the planned sometimes because it's easier to formulate a machine learning problem and sometimes because we're just interested in it so the first project i'm going to tell you about is skipping this intermediate step and looking to see if you can prove X growth rates from environmental conditions specifically we were interested in seeing if you could predict spring onion growth in natural environments so we wanted to see if you could track temperature and lie it over time would you be able to predict growth rates over time and the problem is that even like the best research facilities don't have more than like a dozen growth chambers which means that you can only make 12 interventions at a time you can only have 12 different light and temperature curves and so that's not enough to do any machine my name so how can we resolve this well I got primary school students to collect the data for me so we got fifty schools throughout the UK and all of the school children to build these little controlled growth chambers and further spring onions outside measuring the height of the spring onions daily for two weeks and they were as accurate and measuring things as PhD students so we managed to had a really wide distribution of schools participating including like in Outer Hebrides and in Wales and and Scotland and and Cornwall and stuff so we're very excited about that and we could use this to develop a model of how the plants are integrating light and temperature information to determine how much to grow so you can find out things like the temperature in the beginning of the time course affects the growth rate throughout the time hours the next one I want to highlight focuses on genetics and how that affects the internal state of the plan so a little bit of biology so in each cell of your body you have DNA which is composed of different subunit different segments called genes and each of those genes can be copied into a molecule called mRNA which then gets gets translated into the protein which is all of the machines in your body that does everything so when we say gene expression what we mean is the concentration of that intermediate mRNA within the cell so let's say that this is your DNA it'll have different sections which are represents different genes and each of these sub sequences in your longer sequence provide information for a specific encoding a specific protein and in plants with not an animal well lucky because the regulatory sequences that are adjacent to the genes so the DNA sequence that's next to the gene encodes all of the information or most of the information required for predicting where and when that gene will be expressed in your body um so the machine learning aim is given the DNA sequence close to a gene henry predicts where and when that gene will be expressed but the problem is there's something so nice what plants we're going problem with plants is that they have tons of gene duplications so your DNA sequence isn't a single long sequence it's actually split into separate volumes and those are your chromosomes and you get you have 23 pairs of chromosomes one from your father and one from your mother except in circumstances like in this case with a person with Down syndrome who has two copies of chromosome 21 from one of their parents but this isn't the case in most profit species like this this is like this is the chromosomes from a worm and they get this specific type of form has four copies of each of their genomes from each parent so forever so while you would have generally two copies of each gene one from your mother and one from your father though this worm would have eight copies of each gene for from their mother and four from their father and actually most crop species have this and so that makes everything a lot more difficult and but plant biologists usually ignore this problem by studying the fail cross or air pedasus which is very simple and it like humans has one topic from the mother one copy from their father however even the closest like crop relatives of the sale class which are the brassicas which include things like broccoli cauliflower cabbage turnip some Brussels sprouts they have many sets of they have many sets of chromosomes so it's really hard to transfer the information from the model organism that everyone studies in plant biology to the field so this project is trying to do this and one of the reasons why the gene duplications makes everything more difficult is because over time mutations begin to accumulate both within the genes and in the regulatory sequences nearby so the research questions in this project are how have regulatory regions evolved in the duplicated genes in things like cabbage and broccoli and also can we predict where and when each copy of the of the genes will be expressed so these regulatory regions the reason why they encode information that determines where and when the genes will be expressed is because the specific proteins that binds to the DNA in specific locations and read that DNA and transfer that into determining the gene expression so we have lots of data about where these proteins bind to DNA so this is a great training set to build models that to predict so you can give a DNA sequence into the algorithm and out pops and annotation of where these proteins could bind to the DNA so we know where they bind to the DNA in the model organism in plants but we don't know where they binds in each of the gene coffees in something like broccoli but we can go through and annotate it and then study the evolution of those regions and the next step is to see if we can predict the spatial and temporal pattern of gene expression in these brassicas so in it's one of the more difficult experiments to do and most expensive experiments is to determine where and when the gene is expressed because you have to sample from all the different tissues and all the different time points um but we do have this for for the failed custom model organism so we've already in the previous slide I've shown you that we can annotate the regulatory regions from things like broccoli and then we can try to predict for each of the gene copies where will it be expressed in the plans and for training purposes we can gather this information in a few different species but what we really want is to be able to make transferable models so we can train a model like this in broccoli and then be able to use it to predict the gene expression of cabbage or in Brussels sprouts but why do we even care where and when a gene is expressed right like it's just a molecular fun fact but the reason is because we know a lot about about the snail crash so we know things like you know a gene that controls when flowers will bloom in the spring and that'll determine like when to harvest the plant we know genes involved in stripping fluid loss and leaves and those can be helpful for draft resistance but you know in cabbage and broccoli you can have eight versions of this so how can you determine which of those gene copies is the best one to target for directed selective breeding measures so this is like a really really practical application the next project I want to highlight is looking at how the environment affects the internal state of the plant and in this case the core question he asked is why are plants more resilient to stress in the early morning so you might not have known this but if you take a like a plan and you like give it a heat shock in the first hour after the light after in the morning then it's more likely to survive also it's more likely to survive fungal infections in the first hour of the morning but nowadays if you've if you've ever taken the train from Kings Cross to Cambridge at night you can see all these pink houses where people are growing plants and greenhouses with 24-hour pink lights so does this mean that these plants will no longer be as was this sense to fungal infections we need to know what's going on so we can do experiments where we modify the ability of the plants to sense light and to sense time and to respond to a biotic stress different types of stress and we can change the temperature and we can change the light conditions and from all this we can try to to learn what's going on we can do this in an unsupervised way and find groups of genes that are expressed at different times in the first two hours of the morning and we can see groups of genes that are activated by life or pressed by light activated by high temperatures repressed by high temperatures and so on and this gives you a qualitative sense of what's happening but we can also take a supervised learning approach and ask can we predict the gene expression of any given gene based on the gene expression of other genes in the in the past and from this we can construct a network of which genes are predictive of the gene expression of other genes and these this is a subset of our network that was validated by additional experiments and the reason why these networks are cool is you can kind of summarize them to look to see if there are certain pathways that are upstream or downstream of other so for example we saw that life is a central hub so light-sensing obviously is very critical for for a response to the morning and it seems to be upstream of stress but rather temperature responds seems to be downstream of the circadian clock which is the daily cycle so this helps us tease apart different relationships finally we also have a project that looks at how genetic gene x' and environment interacts to affect the internal state of a plant so so we have we can mutate the plants in different ways and we can treat the plants in different ways but what we really are interested in is how do these interact so that there's a huge combination of different mutations and variations of plans and different environmental conditions to help save experimental costs it'd be nice to predict how what are those interactions and moreover we want to be able to predict interactions in a time-dependent way because plants have a cycle of gene expression over the day and so if we sample plants the wrong time point we might miss some important behavior like what we were talking about before where this stress resilience in the early morning as I've shown you the work that we're doing at the Turing is really having a practical impact on plant science and an agriculture we have studies looking at spring onion growth and volatile environments predicting gene targets for broccoli and cabbage and turnips selective breeding understanding what plants are resilient to stress in the morning and predicting gene environment interactions interestingly there's this dichotomy between data science for agriculture and that assigns for plant science where in agriculture you are interested in mapping plant variety and environments to growth but as for the plant science community is interested in that intermediate staff like what's happening in the plan balancing between the two is something that's quite difficult and but in a way if you take the plant science approach you can create very transparent algorithms so you can understand how that mapping takes place and be able to see if that makes sense in the this is just my thinking about like what I think that some future questions will be in AI research in plant science and agriculture the one really cool thing is in Wales and in Vienna they have these robotic growing facilities called genomic centers where they can have extremely controlled conditions for plans including shuffling the plants so they don't have bias because it can be bias if you have a plant growing near wall and it's really cool and you can do longitudinal imaging which means that there's lots of lots of images that need annotating and some of this can be manually annotated and then we can do deep learning on it however one of the constraints is the number of interventions that can be done which is still very limited so optimization algorithms will be required to figure out which environmental conditions to test and which combinations of genetic variants and environments to test and also the big we'll have tons of time series data which is something that wasn't as available for plant science research previously which means that lots of time series and longitudinal statistics will be required so thank you this is my research group for the turning and I'd like to thank all of my funders and open the floor to questions Thank You Daphne we'll take questions afterwards thank you very much so I'd like now to introduce Joanne Thiago lingam who's the deputy scientific machine learning group leader for STFC at Oxford I thank you so the purpose of this talk is not to kind of dive you down into very cool science of it but rather to kind of give you a bit of a feel what we do at STFC from the data science perspective so this talk is very sort of a very high level giving a bit of a perspective of what we do within different divisions of HDFC so does if you don't know so you know search council Science & Technology specialties council be a part of the UK our UK research and innovation so unlike other Research Council we do 3 activities other it's the most of the other research councils basically kind of give you the money and then they kind of you know you can really go away and do your research whereas being definitely doing 3 other things to other things so entropic really doing the core funding for your research we also kind of look into what we can do in terms of but you can do in terms of our own research we have on research groups we have all departments it's like a little it's like a university and on top of it we want to have your hosting a very large number of large facilities you're going to see what these facilities are in few minutes so when I say research we focus on the fundamentals of Sciences so these basically spans from material sciences Biological Sciences we don't do a medical research that's up to the Medical Research Council's we look into other material sciences or other particle physics particularly nuclear physics these are the regions we kind of really work on so the deferred update in lab is basically one of those sites the other one is in Duxbury up in node so we are fundamentally committed to kind of advancing the science that's our motto so what you see here is a various different facilities within Brad so there are a number of different facilities but I have highlighted only four here so the donut ray donut shape ring is basically what we call a light source or synchrotron one thing either one other thing that you could see there is basically centralized the facility the other one is Isis neutron source the other one is adjustment zones so fundamentally what you do here is basically we want to sell you materials of you instruct the properties of these materials these materials can be proteins can be anything can be linked into crystal structures then what we do is basically bombard it different using different techniques say for example if you are looking into the diamond light source what we do is we basically bombard the music other techniques say Fagin if you're looking into the icy sauce we are really gonna bombard them using neutrons if it's lace that we're gonna bombard them using lasers so what we do is he bombard them using different techniques and then we collect so these are very simply simple view of it but the more complicated yourself even I don't understand because I'm a signal processing person by definition so the key thing is and we generate large amount of data on a daily basis so instead of really going to the industry kind of looking for problems to solve with one our data is unique and I type to the science side of the soil by looking into the data more closely can receiver that we could advance the science so yes DF CV is actually because we generate this amount later can be really apply machine learning to these data sets and can be see whether we could really develop much more insight into what's actually happening the scientific machine learning group I'm really part of co-leading it's basically it's a newly formed group within the STFC it's basically only eight months old formed in last October and the skill sets really vary from signal processing to material sciences to machine learning so there's no sort of a very unified skill sets in terms of machine learning we cover all sort of grounds and what we do is work collaboratively with facilities to see what can we do in terms of analyzing the data so some of these are technical base will be on decay properties because we don't understand some of the science so this is why we have scientists on site so we also collaborate with the number of the universities we basically fund them to kind of work on some of these projects so the idea is to see whether over next 10 15 years because we have all these large-scale facilities from diamond light source to column Center to Isis sources can we really develop not only machine learning techniques but also the software techniques so that we can really formulate ambition to see whether we see haben as a Center for AI way I said a a Center for science so this is only for understanding the fundamental side science so can I gave you a bit of view of what the STFC does and what we do in terms of asset group so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to take you through a number of couple of different projects we work on on two different extremes of these signs to kind of illustrate what we do so as one of these projects is basically it's more Langille x-ray scattering i'm sure that most of you might know this much better than I do so this is basically collaboration the diamond light source the idea is basically to study the fundamental structure of the materials so depending on the material the underlying atomic structures are different so what we do is you take a sample there are scientists to do this be blind scientists what they do is they prepare a sample put in front of the x-ray and depending on the underlying atomic structure these atoms are going to diffract these x-rays in different patterns so depending on the material you study the resulting diffractions are going to be different so what you see in the end you can see a bunch of 2d majors coming from these materials so depending on the material you study you're going to see different types of patterns now going back to the basic parts of it you don't know about the material you're studying so you basically put it in front of the x-ray sources and that basically generates images for you two-dimensional images for you depending on the orientations and what you want to decide now this basically can be from this material can we decide what the met from these images can you decide what the materials are or what the not only the material but you also want to know more than that say for example what you see here is basically you have a two-dimensional ring pattern and from that you want to decide where the what type of material is it in the first place is it a crystalline structure is it a Collider or is it a protein you want to decide that that's the first phase away on the second phase of it then what go deeper into that but the shapes of these molecules are are they simply spheres are they really rods are the electrodes are they parallelepiped you want to decide what type of fundamental shapes that basically give rise to these ones then what you do is you go a bit more deeper into this to see whether can you characterize these shapes can you estimate the parameters of this these are at the atomic level so this is basically the overarching question one of the questions we are answering on this particular one so this one so from the machine learning point of view are looking into two types of challenges one is basically the classification side of the problem the other one is from the signal processing side of it you are looking into the estimation or statistical signal processing side of it you are looking into the parameter estimation the number of parameter is going to vary depending on the shapes your kind of looking into so to start off with it might be when you start to look into these 2d images so these are very large in size so single image is not that very large it's about half a gigabyte half a gigabyte to one gigabyte but when you really take about thousand to 2,000 images they become kind of prohibitive in your way so what happens is then then you're going to start cutting corners because most of the optimization techniques do not really work at that scale so what do you do is you basically start to you have to do certain cutoff so what we have done is basically in most of the cases the materials we analyzed isotropic so we can basically integrate them on the plane we can do a two dimensional integration we can turn them into a one dimensional profile so instead of looking into a two-dimensional profile all of a sudden we have one dimensional profile so the question now comes down to you have series of one-dimensional profile from these one-dimensional profiles can you decide the shapes say for example if it's a sphere that's a different shape if it's a rod it has a different shape now it's quite quite nice to see that but the reality is slightly different in reality the materials are never homogeneous they are basically what we call poly dispersity any material is going to have even if you have spheres is going to have different radius and they're going to be mixed up with all sorts of shapes so what happens in the end is basically you have final 1d plot basically becomes much more convoluted because much more harder so it's much more tricky problem to solve so the overarching problem now can be really kind of put forward saying that okay you have a material you basically bombarded by using x-rays and what you've got is basically a one-dimensional profile and from one dimensional profile can you do these things so we have taken two different multiple different approaches one of them is basically very obvious supervised learning side of it but the important thing to highlight here is basically when you get these datasets from these facilities the key limitation we have is you don't have a boundary so that's basically the showstopper for you in terms of simply blindly applying any supervised learning techniques so what we have to do is basically we have to simulate the data from model side of it to see whether can we really match the ground truth for what the curve we are getting so this is one of the problems the other problem ism on the other extreme of it what we call Sentinel cloud this is the space division in STFC or ad space so the idea is basically so there are about 100 to 200 different satellites orbiting the Earth taking aerial images and when you really consider this image if they really contain anything and everything you think of from cloud to vegetation to roads to mountains to volcanoes so the idea here is basically to see whether take an image and for for a given image it's very high resolution image in the region of thousand five hundred thousand five hundred for each of these images for each of the pixel we want to figure out whether it is a cloud or non cloud because it effectively this feeds into your weather forecast with a prediction overall ground temperature and so on and so forth so that P has to be fairly easy because all you have to do is look for white pixels but in reality is much more harder because if you look into the images over no snow snowy mountains or Sun glint or vegetation smoke plume all those things basically kind of come in the way so your classification basically runs out of thing again we have a simulation here we don't have any ground truth because when you have an image you have really don't know whether you have a cloud or not so what we have to do is we have to do a slightly different approach here we have multipass approach so we have to really pass through the basin filter to actually estimate the ground truth it's a computer ground truth not really the what you call a standard down to the near normal machine learning you basically compute this ground truth then what we see is can we really match this one can can we do better than this again there are multiple different approaches supervised learning and unsupervised learning so in the sepoys learning we managed to get almost up to 85% accuracy appears to be good but in reality 85% is not really good enough to kind of get it anywhere uniformly across the whole of the earth so in for example the candle easy to classify clouds in the region of ocean because it's pretty easy because you don't see anything else but if you see cloud on a Sun glint situation or if you see cloud over Saharan desert then it becomes much harder because it becomes much occluding in that way so then again we have to kind of come up with different techniques to see whether what can we do there so on top of it you also do a number of different activities so we cover a whole set of grounds from astronomy to biology to particle physics to nuclear physics so I can't really go into detail on a number of different projects but so that kind of gives you a bit of a feel what we do within scientific machine learning group so on top of the individual projects we deal with so with other facilities and other universities covering from biology to particle physics one of the key things we are really actively involved in is basically developing a benchmark suit so what we call a saml benchmark suite the idea is to see whether given that we have access to large amount of data so it's a different kind of data because if you look into the industrial data sets they are totally different so we have a totally different type of data sets which are focused on science pretty much so what we want to see is can be used these data sets to see understand your machine learning ecosystems so when I say ecosystems we're going to see that in few next slide what the ecosystem I mean but and we worked with companies like Intel Nvidia and other companies to see whether do that and we also kind of collaborate very extensive the us lab labs in National Labs in the u.s. to kind of give you a better feel what the ecosystem is if you take any machine learning so what you're looking into is basically you could implement a machine learning model based on different type of models like you know support vector machine no internet so convolutional neural nets and you also can really have a choice of different frameworks from tensorflow to Theon or to PI torch and things like that and then on top of it you also have access to different type of architectures you can run it on GPUs you can run it on GPUs and CPUs now you have lots of different knobs to turn around so the question is then okay which one actually performs better then the question of better is basically very subjective because you could look into accuracy performance or look into f1 score or you could look into how much of energy have consumed for energy or how much it took how much of data you needed to kind of get your accuracy so these metrics might really change by your definition so what we have really enabled here is basically we can really have a framework which covers all these things and the examples of is Caloocan examples are basically going to come from these different domains so they're very problem-specific very domain-specific we're going to pick examples from material sciences you're going to pick one from particle physics we're going to pick one from nuclear physics so on and so forth and by combining that you're in a much better way to see whether not only to understand how different machine learning techniques techniques really work but you also can go away and then develop much better techniques to see whether and you outperform them so this is much of a bigger broader interest for most of the architecture companies because it is also an interest for them to see whether can they tune the architecture based on certain performance something like glint back so um you have seen what STFC does so we started with typically what the STFC is and then we focused on what the focus of the Siam L is the key ideas we have large number of facilities within that and you also generate crazy amount of data but very challenging lis most of them don't have ground truth so in that case we had to kind of compute the ground truth and then go on to kind of explore different techniques to kind of highlight the different projects we deal with it and we are very much committed to kind of advancing designs and the very importantly all the data sets we have free and very public and it's open to public to do anything with it and the benchmark initiatives are very open to public as well thank you Daphne would you like to join giant stage and we'll take a few questions congratulations for competing with a small child who's trying to get in have a seat can I ask you where do you have any questions that you'd like to raise been some very stimulating presentations there around the role of data science in biological environmental science and if we don't have any from the audience and I may ask you to raise questions of one another thank you um I was at their health stage yesterday and a big theme there was about and some of them genomics England was talking and a big theme there was about personalizing medicine so sequencing human genome and using that as a way to personalize medicine and you've talked about sequencing plants and plant genomes and that understanding plant science better but how do you think that personalization when it comes to plants do you think there's anything any crossover and if anything that sort of matches okay so crops are homogeneous however now people are beginning to realize that there's lots of heterogeneity with even within a population that has like homogeneous genetics and so a big area of study is to not only find varieties of crops that are kind of that our suited well-suited for environment but to have low variance in terms of the outputs so that's one area that kind of answers your question another area is in commercial farming it's very homogeneous but there are lots of local varieties throughout the world that local farming communities have developed and so actually I'm hoping to start a collaboration with with a specific charity organization that's looking for ads um take taking those and seeing if you can identify like they are seeing how you can identify like kind of personalized growth regimes for each of those local varieties and seeing if actually those match with other communities and whether there can be exchanges of seeds so in a way that's a little bit like a personalized medicine approach for plants so there is a bit of crossover any other questions at all so let me ask the two of you did you learn anything from one another that you didn't already know quite a lot of material sciences so I'm not really material scientist I'm significant I mean I was an academic I'm still an academic my focus is on signal processing and machine learning so I didn't know anything about materials and what they do but now I know more about how cells move and migrate and how atoms diffracting it's quite a lot I guess it's nice to know that there's these big that I think the benchmarking scheme I think is quite useful for I think that like having kind of a system to benchmark new algorithms on your data so way then you can say oh yeah because I do lots of methodological development so it's nice to have the have access to these different data sets the benchmark new approaches on data sets are very different from the kind of you work on so we make lots of custom like kind of tweaks to algorithms and things like that for our domain specific approach we also develop new techniques that could be more generally applied so it's good to know that these exist so none of the models are models model none of the models domain specifically tuned sure they are basically engineered by us but you're free to kind of apply anything you think so you know to start with some of the models are basically you know we throw the pre train models like which is six you know something else to see whether they really work in the first place so you know it can't be anything it doesn't have to be very specifically tuned for domains thank you any more questions data science for science as being one of those horizontal programs so we have domain-specific programs health security economics engineering data science for science takes the algorithms take some methodologies which are being developed through all of the programs and is applying them to the scientific facilities at scale that we have within the UK so impact on the UK economy impact on society in the UK this is one of the fundamental programs that we've applying it maturing so at this point let me just say thank you very much to JN and to Daphne we have a break now until five o'clock I would encourage you to come back we have a very interesting suite of presentations then looking at data science around criminology in particular but thank you very much indeed please join me in showing your appreciation for the latest set presentation you
