 I will go really it will kind of be like an overview type of presentation and I will try to connect it to what I'm doing in words and if you have any questions the chat box is open so I'll try to look at it from time to time okay just stop me and and I will try to answer it okay so is that okay I'm assuming that is okay so we actually did connect with Porgy but I think the mistake that we made was we were at the practice room I think I may be wrong but I think that was the problem but I will continue with the presentation now so as I said I can't see the chat if you have any problems I can just you know stop just let me know okay okay so you know my research is really about and you know everything I do and I think a lot of people they it's about bioinformatics right and I think it's it's good to start with a general definition of bio Mattox and by the way right now it's 11 to 15 or something and I will try to go a little bit faster than usual and I mean I have time but if you guys have to leave I guess I mean that's fine right okay so the the okay so what is bioinformatics oh by the the basic hypothesis of bioinformatics is we can explain the mechanisms of biological phenomena in living organisms using mathematical math and so you know it in a very simple level we can just think about you know living organisms are made up of molecules and they these molecules just you know hit each other and they just interact with each other and we can explain this by you know chemical equations so why don't we just use computers to you know solve these problems so what my informatics does is you know we just use computers to solve biological problems and these logical problems are generally I mean they contain we just generate a lot of data and the reason why we use computers is you know computers are very good at processing very large amounts of date I mean if you just you know paper and pencil type of computations it would take you years to do that and believe me a lot of people like so they did at the time you know went down you know like maybe like 20 30 years ago people actually were using pen and paper to solve protein structures and on you know try to solve the scatter plots from x-ray crystallography experiments but now we don't do that because now we have computers right and but at the same time you have a lot of data so we will talk about that so at the very basic level if you you know use a computer to analyze some data you know make some you know bar plot scatter plots and try to fit some you know curves to that or like you know do some correlations try to relate that to biology like you know to evolution or like you know how does a mutation affect the protein structure then you are doing by informatics right and a lot of this stuff that we do and you know in my research is is really related to that type of those type of problems okay so the the basic driving forces behind by informatics and why it's actually making a big big hype right now is well one of that is rapid accumulation of biological data right so it's the the title of my talk is really about you know biological data acquisition so so recently a lot of dumb you know a lot of you guys are probably related to I mean they're you're working on feels related to genetics right so I mean mymy whole my whole thing is about next-generation sequencing data analysis and and I mean yeah I mean the NGS data and the data acquisition systems right I mean they have been advancing really fast last we can say last that maybe like 10 years right still they're advancing really fast and you know this actually is now you know more than millions of people are like they're get they're getting their genomes either genotype by arrays right or they are getting their genome sequenced either like you know whole genome sequencing or by you know whole exome sequencing type of thing and and you know since this is like a market right I mean right now we have like I you know in gs economy so to speak so there's there's actually a you know there's a supply-demand type of thing to this because there are a lot of companies who are doing sequencing so the cost is always decreasing right because a lot of the companies want to enter the market so they you know they have new services and another driving force is the fact that we can now ask very complex questions because you know when you do sequencing you get you know billions of reads from a lot of jeans or like non-coding regions right and then we want to map those mutations on the present like pathways or change or you know cancer drivers or rare variants right and we want to make sense out of that and we can actually combine that with a lot of other information like you know gene expression or genetic regulation or you know systems biology like you know network type of approaches so I mean you see this is actually becoming a very complex field and I will talk a little bit about that now I mean we can actually now start editing genes right genes and genomes and this is actually opening up a whole new opportunity whole new frontier to to perform this genetic analysis and may be translated into into clinic right and on the other side you know one of the other driving forces advancement of information technology right now we have actually much cheaper and faster hardware we have cloud computing we are GPUs new CPU architecture so there's a type of there and these are actually making making the computations much faster we can now do their world much most complicated statistical tools or machine learning algorithms you know I mean everybody heard about probably deep learning hype these days right I mean everybody's about deep learning yeah so you know we can can we just put together you know millions of genomes and we can we perform some deep learning deep learning tasks on that and then try to understand whether we can you know the convolve the cancer genomes and understand which type of mutations they they can be targeted by which type of drugs right so these type of you know these type of hypes I kind of like to call it you know these are now driving the PI informatics much faster so again we have now faster software because the implementations are getting faster we you know a lot of the core the tools they are now implemented in distributed computing settings and finally as I said new computational methods and paradigms like an advanced machine learning so these are the basic pushing forces behind by informatics I mean these are actually kind of I don't want to say contradicting but they are kind of balancing each other because you know the more data we have we want to you know advance our information technology better right we are gonna have some faster CPUs we want to have better more efficient machine learning algorithms and we want to make these make these and make sense of this data much faster because the data is accumulating really fast okay so I want to you know talk really briefly about how this came to be so so the first application so I mean you know when I talk about my informatics I'm really talking about you know genomics sequencing and things like that because that's all I do so I mean other types of mathematics obviously at my firm X is not just genome sequencing there's there's a lot more to it right I mean there's imaging by informatics there is on chemo informatics right but I will be talking mainly about sequencing based by informatics okay so this thing all things started in 1951 so you know Frederick Sanger right so he actually did sequence about the protein sequence of insulin so this is a fairly short protein and he actually did something pretty smart so you actually you know divided the protein sequence into chains of amino acids and then he created his own scatter I'm not scatter but like yeah scatter plot similar to the x-ray crystallography and then he just you know he actually did use some bioinformatics old he didn't use a computer he did a lot of you know by informatics based analysis to identify what type of patterns would create these scatter patterns in the hope of the amino acids and then he put those amino acid change together polypeptide chains together to create a final on protein sequence off of the insulin protein now this is actually a major accomplishment in 1950 because right even right now we don't have a good protein sequencing technology and after like you know 10 20 years we have first RNA and DNA sequenced again Frederick Sandra right I mean so this guy was actually he actually got to know about prices where these he was actually very successful in you know sequencing things yes right and in 1980 I guess you know Europeans they saw that the fact that we need some you know by informatics Institute because we were getting so much data from you know all the you know Sanger based sequencing and all the for molded different organisms right and do they want to make sense out of this date so they formed this EBI is in 1980s and I mean 1982 GenBank was was set up and I'm not exactly sure if this still applies but at one point John Bank was increasing in size every eighteen months so that was doubling in size every eighteen month so right now I think there's more than ten billion DNA letters and more than 1 billion sequences and this is I mean the great thing about this is it's publicly really right and in 1990 so there you know this is like you know like the moon landing project the human genome project was started I mean this would take billions of years about billions of dollars sorry and DOM and you know tens of years to finish but yeah I mean did they just they just started and in 1996 the first genome was published so this is the flu genome I mean flu is always hot right I mean studying flus this is a big deal at least in the United States so all the flu strains what type of flu scan you know come and kill us all like it did in 1918 obviously I'm joking but I mean I mean so the first published genome was Haemophilus influenzae was done in 1996 ok so if you look at a little bit of the economics right I mean conics is always important so I was talking to porgy about this a little bit but I mean yeah I mean everything just boils down to economics I mean if you look at it you know these guys they spent three billion dollars of taxpayers money to finish the sequencing of the whole jump human genome and it turns out you know this actually it returned around 1 to 141 or want to 1 to 180 return rate to the economy so what does this mean for every $1 spend as much as 180 dollars was was turned back to economy I think what this means is you know that you know hundred for every one dollar that a night spent 180 dollars was basically invested back into United States economy so I mean this is actually a very big deal right because they started in 1990 after it like you know 25 years and three billion dollars of taxpayer money they are not getting the return back right and this is actually a very big deal I mean this is a I mean everybody is now using human genome and you can go and download it publicly I mean no so it's it's a very good thing for open science right so I mean thanks to these guys we can actually now go and look at sequence of any gene and they actually also didn't patent it right I mean they could have done that and they could have you know create a whole bunch of mess to everybody but they didn't do that so it's public the open and everybody can download it and analyze it okay now starting from that obviously the costs are going down in 2004 James Watson's genome was sequenced below 1 million dollars that's not the best person to sequence the genome off if you're following the news um but yeah I mean so parent 2004 you could sequence the genome of the person around 1 million dollars that's still a lot of money obviously but now I mean these days you can actually if you set up your experiment carefully you can get the sequencing of a whole genome sequencing of a human genome on average less than thousand dollars like the last 10,000 dollars but if you actually put the wire from Attucks analysis cost on top of that actually I think goes around up to like four thousand dollars now I mean if you think about it the technology is improving really fast right so it's I mean thousand Tummie from you know three billion dollars two thousand dollars it is that unbelievable decrease right and but I mean the point that I will try to make now is really divided from Attucks has become the bottleneck here because we have now so much data I mean think about like you know we have millions of people and these millions of people they need their genomes analysed and you know if think about every whole genome sequencing data file being around hundred gigs of data at I mean if you just sequence around like you know 4050 X that's a lot of data I mean if you multiply that with you know 1 million that's going to create I can't even do that right now hundred thousand times so I'm sorry million times 100,000 is like 100 billion or something yeah I mean that's uh that's a huge number so it's uh I mean even storing that that file for a couple of years that would that would cost a lot of money in terms of storage even if you do it in the cloud so you see I mean that the the the bottleneck was I mean maybe like 20 years ago the bottom like was really doing the sequencing right now the bottleneck is really about storing the data analyzing the data keeping it secure transferring it even transferring the you know just one whole genome sequencing file is a major headache I mean if you guys I mean if you ever work with those files I mean I I mean I personally I'm really I really hate it but yeah I mean think about you know transferring millions of genome genome files from one place to another means it's a it's a major nightmare ok moving to slide 6 now I know I'm going a little bit slow and maybe I should fasten up a little bit so this this I like this plot is basically showing the cost per genome starting from 2001 until 2017 so this from a nice website and so the green plot is showing how the cost is decreasing over time so it's I mean it started with hundred million dollars around dawn 2001 and it is going down to I mean Sarah now 2017 around thousand dollars and around 2007 now we 2008 you can see that there's actually but there there's a faster decrease started right I mean that the reason why that's decreasing faster than usual is because you know the next generation sequencing technologies have been introduced right by Illumina and other companies like Roche right and the white curve here it says you know Moore's law at Moore's law means I mean it actually doesn't really fit into this this this plot but what is trying to represent here is so the Moore's law basically says you know the number of transistors you can fit into a CPU decreased increases increase it doubles every 18 months so this is just you know showing in the log scale how the how the number of transistors we can fit into CPU increases but I mean well you divide that and you get the price of that so if every 18 months that curve is actually you know it's just housing okay it's just you know it gets divided by two so the point that we are trying to make here is if you compare the you know decreasing CPU prices right and if you compare the decreasing sequence II prices the sequencing prices are now getting much much cheaper compared to computation so this is the point that I'm trying to make about the about you know diaphragmatic becoming the problem like because the Pyfrom Attucks is really the the actual I mean we can generate data much faster than we can analyze it that's the bottom line okay so now again this is just you know representing the same idea in a different way so while the data generation cost decreases does so does the cost of storing and analyzing data but we get actually we can actually generate much more data than we can analyze right now that's why we need a lot of female by a permit issues and you know in Turkey right I mean I hear that you know a lot of new new projects about you know sequencing the Turkish genome and representing the you know general population level variation is is is now of interest right then we will need actually a lot of people to really understand you know what the rare variation is like in Turkey and what you know Jim at least you know if you can create a good population panel for Turkish people that would be actually a very useful thing because then you know a lot of the drug companies would use that right or a lot of the you know VIPRE materials obviously like US would use that there so that's why you know we need a lot of people who need to look at this problem and make sense out of it okay so so now moving to more a little bit to towards like how do we the computation and how do we you know start from the tissue and how do we go to data store it so this is this is a workflow that shows you know the types of tools and file formats that we use in invite from attics at least in NGS by informatics so we start with our laboratory work right I mean you guys know about this too obviously I love you so the in the lab you know we generate the DNA samples you know we create the sequencing library then you know I mean you can do enrichment that capture like you know exome sequencing then you do next-generation sequencing using mainly Illumina probably I mean this this actually she says solid but solid is mainly it's just obsolete I don't think anybody use a solid technology anymore but packed by right now at Pacific Biosciences or I mean these days none of poor right I mean nanopore Oxford nanopore they are actually becoming very popular although they are very expensive but they are becoming very popular to generate much longer reads I'm compared to aluminum but these reads they have actually very high error rates right so you know different technologies I've been are being used I mean one thing is alumina actually did buy a pack buyer I don't know if you guys are following that but that's that's a major development right because I mean alumina is going to be a a well it's going to be a monopoly right there right now so we will see how that goes maybe they will increase the prices maybe they won't but we will see its economy right so it will see how we're where it goes okay so after the sequencing we get the fast queue files right and then the fast after fast keifa's it's all all divine permutation so you know you take the reads you trim them you filter them using a software like fast QC and then we do alignment so we do bwa or bowtie too so those are actually my two favorite aligners and then we do variant identification so these are the you know very intersection I know a lot of you guys are familiar with um you know some tools and gtk so gatk is actually now I think it can also find a lot of copy number variants and things like - so it doesn't have it doesn't only do a send reason in doubt and after we identified the variance so the variants are basically where the our sample is different compared to the reference genome right so after we find those locations we want to annotate those bearings so you basically take your variance and give it to a tool like a noir right or or snip F or something right and then what what did that tool does is you know it adds the gene annotations to the variants and I mean this is still an open problem because a lot of the variants are we don't know what their effects are and and although we are me you can identify that it overlaps with the gene I mean and and I mean if you have a mutation like a stop codon right I mean stop codon mutations are obviously bad but if you ever meet a lot of the mutations with you know nonsense mutations right to change amino acid their effects are not really well characterized and if you can actually solve that problem that would be a big deal right okay next thing is visualization and prioritization so you know I was talking about that so you can actually give those mutations to something like you know that poor poly fan and they would actually give you a score for each mutation about you know what their effects are what their impacts are right and finally you take these data and then you just you know store it somewhere so it's the place like SRA or DB gap or ena so you know in Turkey I mean I think one of the main things that that people should solve the bill when you have a problem like a hey you know that like if you wanted the project like thousand genomes or hundred thousand genomes you should just you know think about a place that that's secure and you know that place that will enable you to share the data securely with with researchers right okay so this this I mean I like this workflow because I actually summarizes a lot of the things that that we do starting from there you know the lab work until the you know the storage and there are so many aspects that we have to we have to think about here because a lot of these things are open prompts I mean if you just take storage right I mean like that I just talked about I mean how do you deal with storing so much data you know you don't want to just you know stopped or like you know you don't want to slow down the scientific discoveries right but at the same time you want to make sure that that data you know stays private so I want to I mean one of my actually research interest is about genomic privacy so can we come up with a you know analysis architecture right that would enable people to to not share the actual variant files but you know you can actually share you know aggregate statistics like you know allele frequencies or you know histograms or you know contingency tables and things like that and in this way you don't she actually give out the actual variance but you you know you share just you know the summarizations of this data and you know things like that and can you be like pictures like that they're both useful but at the same time that those architectures enable you to protect privacy so things like that would be I mean these those are major problems right now you know NIH and the all the journals are very interested in these type of things I mean you know again you know you can also think about you know how do you I mean I'm just jumping onto another place like I mean variant prioritization right number and prioritization is very hot right I mean if you can come up with a good way to score nonsynonymous variants and then then you I mean that would be a very useful addition to all the tools that we used right for example I mean you can think about you know for rare really rare mutations right I mean if you can just take a rare disease and in Turkey for example I'm just making it up and then think about how would you come up with a prioritization scheme just for that disease I think that would actually make a pretty good paper you know I mean I think there are so many different frontiers that you can you know take up if you just you know if you're just working on these projects and in Turkey or I mean in u.s. too right I mean if you think it just focus on a specific biological problem and set a good goal and then you know try to you know find custom ways to change this this workflow to come up with a good good algorithm or a good analysis okay so um oh this thing did not come up well but okay so the so you know one of the things that I wanted to talk about a year is I me wanted the one thing that I that kind of tried to explain to students here too so we do read mapping right I mean read mapping is kind of an interesting thing so the reason why we actually use the reference genome and read mapping is because you know any person in the world that you just mean randomly pick right two people you randomly pick friend in the world their genetic material is like more than 99% similar so what we do is you know we just take the individuals and then you know we align their genomes to the reference genome so one of the things actually is making our job really hard is the reference you know bias right so because the reference genome is not perfect it's actually coming from as far as I know I think four or six people who are mainly European okay so for example in Turkey right I mean the Turkish variants they may not be well represented in the reference genome so if that's if that is the case then we would not be able to identify you know the variants well using the reference genome that is generated from you know white Europeans so that would be a problem right so if you can actually come up with the Turkish reference genome and I think that's probably one of the main goals of the Turkish genome project if you come up with the you know good reference genome for the the Turkish people only right I mean that would be a very big deal because then as I said you know the drug companies right I mean they if you had developing a drug for a rare disease or a you know just you know if you think about just cardiovascular disease and in Turkish people they would actually need a reference genome for just the Turkish people you know I'm just right now I'm just you know um you know just contemplating on ideas but I think those would be very good frontiers to think about I mean because I mean what's the point of using your your European reference you know if you're if you're in Turkey with a different genetic background right so in that case yeah again so I mean if we can come up with a good Turkish reference genome that would be actually a very big deal and I mean I would be very happy to see that okay so I mean on the left side I'm you know I'm just listing some of the tools Mac so Sigma I mean these are actually very old tools from Mac is actually one of the first period mappers and both are bwa is I just mentioned I mean I use both dialog PBW is actually is again is a very another reader liner that is used a lot for aligning whole genome sequencing reads people don't use both type a lot for old you know ops using because it's actually I think as far as I understand its alignment Quality Score is not as good as bwa and it's actually not as sensitive as bwa but you know they're established pipe lines and each pipe line use a different type of reader liner and you know if you're not familiar with these if you remember you know bow-tied bwa i think that would be that would be good okay so you know one of the what do you think about the graft genome graph genomes are very hot they are I know John likes them a lot Channel can I know and and I you know I actually have not seen a good good application of them but I'm sure they're I mean I can't think about a lot of good applications but I just never saw mean maybe I'm not following the literature well enough but yeah I didn't see a good good application of those but I mean if you mean if you come up with the graph genome I mean graph reference do you know for Turkish people that would be actually very useful to but I think that should also be a linear reference genome because a lot of people are just not I mean a lot of the pipelines right a lot of the pipelines are not very I'm not just I'm not modified to handle graph genomes here but I think that's that would be a major that would be a major accomplishment if we can come up with a good graph genome for Turkish people and I think that's probably John will do that I know I mean I at one point I think I talked to him and he was like he was very into that and yeah I think I think that's it's it's a very interesting topic I mean the graph genomes and thanks for asking that actually that's a good point cuz is that good yes okay so so that you know the you know central dogma of biology I mean that's that's a very general thing I mean I'm sure I mean everybody heard of this right I mean so you basically died is you start with a DNA sequence right I'm DNA sequence gets transcribed into RNA and RNA gets translated into a protein sequence right so here the protein sequence we're and I'm showing it with these you know black little black dots right and they look like beets almost right and then that protein sequence the amino acid sequence just it gets folded into that circular type of a protein right so that's the protein working protein structure it could be you know a protein that that just you know helps other proteins fold right and but if you get a mutation right if you get a mutation the DNA sequence and that changes a letter in the DNA and that gets when when it gets transcribed that that change in the DNA sequence would be propagated into the RNA right and from our innate can get yet translated into your protein where one of the amino acids in the protein that gets affected right so it changes into that red amino acid right and then you know when you fold it we get a different protein structure that is not working anymore because it doesn't have the you know circular shape that we were expecting it to have so so you know you know this is actually a lot of the you know the disease genomics right disease you know it people I mean one day study or like really I mean really rotations on when they study the disease this this is the time I mean this is the basic idea so you just try to find mutations DNA that that affect the protein structures but you know I mean having said that I actually am much more interested in non-coding regions in the genome so I mean the way that I think about mutations is actually much much more different from this and I will talk about that in a minute just but but I mean this is the type of thing I think that that a lot of people out of geneticists right they they like to think about I mean if there's a there is a disease you should actually first look at whether there's any protein like the protein candidate that is causing this disease by changing the structure of a very important protein right so for example in BRCA right I mean like the breast cancer gene I mean the famous BRCA I mean a lot of the mutations are I generally in doubt as far as I know the pathogenic mutations and they are I mean yet me they're just frameshift mutations or they are early stop introducing mutations okay but having said that actually so moving to the next slide we actually have a much more complicated scenario right so again so this is a this is what I like to call a little bit like an extended central dogma so what's happening here so we have DNA and RNA and we have the protein right but let me actually try to use this or never memories so I was going to try to draw on this but maybe I will not because I'm a mess it up okay so the idea here is only DNA you know it turns into RNA and protein so this is the you know basic central dogma we have right but what can happen is actually we have a lot more different things that may be regulating this right for example you know we have you know metabolites and small molecules they may affect the transcription they may regulate the transcription or RNAs may go integrate other RNA right I mean micronus right in my cronies can go and degrade mRNAs by the help of some other proteins or small metabolites can actually go and degrade other rnas and finally or at least can go and degrade proteins right you know like so again this is the you know micro RNA or smaller an interference type of type of mechanisms would be at play here or like you know at the translation we can have you know metabolites or RNA is changing the translation rate right so that the rate of transitional translation changes or the proteins can degrade other protein so the point that I've tried to make here is you can see we have a lot of edges now right so these edges that actually they you know it starts looking like this this regulatory network so you know generally what I like to think about are these regulatory interactions so you know what can you change in the DNA and this you know these regulatory interactions may change for example you know I think a lot about you know that transcription factors I mean things that happen at the genome level I mean at the DNA level I mean it's not really shown here but what I mean is you know transcription factors or you know Nick Newell Mach you patient or you know histone modifications and and DNA methylation and things like that so the bottom line here is that at the point that I'm trying to make it so just you know life is actually much more complicated than the actual a central dogma of biology I mean this is it's actually almost an old view of the world having said that a lot of people actually don't believe in the you know non-coding portion of the genome I mean a lot of the biologists they just you know they just stick to exome sequencing they don't like to think about you know promoters or enhancers or you know transcription factor binding and things like that but I mean these days we're actually getting a lot of papers and you know high-impact journals and we can see that a lot of things are happening in the non-coding genome and they may cause things like cancer okay so moving on again so this is now I'm showing the transcription maybe I'll start going a little bit if we go over to I mean I have time but if we go over 12 is it going to cut us off immediately or how does it work okay okay okay we can go on okay I'll try to a little bit faster so okay so the the you know when you think about regulations or the regulation you know in the in the in the cell right I mean everything is really about gene expression so if you think about you know gene expression gene expression is just you know making RNA from DNA well I mean obesity we have the proteins too so I mean the translation is also very important but okay somebody's asking something yes oh okay is that a question no okay okay so so no that's okay okay so I mean the reason why I'm just focusing on the three transcription regulations because you know that's that's what I that's what I think about all the time so so the idea here is you know the promoters right I mean the promoters of the genes are basically you know the starting locations of the genes and that's where a lot of things are happening so here is actually a pretty old representation of what's happening at the promoter so what this is showing is you know around the promoter we have the you know start of transcription this is the you know transcription start site right and the RNA polymerase you know comes and binds and then it gets bound by a lot of you know different transcription factors you know tons of transcription factors and we have the Terra box right that the famous data box where everything actually kind of you know starts on laying around and then you know the very interesting thing is we have the you know this long-range interactions between the promoter and these enhancer regions so if you look at the DNA or DNA is this you know the gray strip that that we're seeing here and a lot of the DNA it gets bound by these proteins okay so these are it's a gene regulatory sequences so those are sometimes people call them enhancers okay and then answer is basically a region that is far far from the transcription start site but it actually makes a loop in three dimensions and it gets actually very close to the the promoter by just you know in three dimensions so it's like you know the promoters here and then you know then answer comes very close and then answer gets bound by a lot of protein so yeah I mean we don't know why you know the nature chose it to to do like this but it's just the way it is okay so it turns out these enhancers they can interact with a lot of different promoters and they can you know enhance the transcription or activate the transcription or it can slow down the transcription and so this is one way that the transcription is regulated so everything is really about RNA polymerase you know pull them you know it's just I'm transcribing the gene and if you stop RNA polymerase then you would actually get you would not get too much transcription but if you you know activate it you would get a lot of transcription so I mean you it's like you know it's an on and off type of switch right these proteins get bound there and some of them actually activate some of them repress and some of them actually just keep the promoter paused there okay so that's called promoter I'm sorry the polymerase they poles the polymerase so that's called the polymerase pausing okay so you know what we are trying to do is we are really trying to understand from these you know datasets what is really happening at the promoters how are then answers interacting promoters where are the enhancers you know can their mutations in the enhancers change whether the proteins are binding there or not and things like that okay so you know one of the other other factors is actually the nucleosomes I think that's the next slide okay so the nucleosomes actually are the are the are like you know little spheres I mean they're actually not the spheres they're actually a protein complex okay they are made up of histone proteins there and they're like eight of them and what they do is they just they're just you know they're holding DNA okay and this is actually very interesting because the I mean if you look at on the left figure right so it says you know you chromatin active you see the black line there is the DNA okay so the DNA gets wound around this these victors also the nucleosomes are these black on black beads okay I'm sorry blue beets the blue beads are the zones and in the you chromatin the DNA is actually pretty relaxed okay so the nucleosomes are like you know they give way they open up they're like relaxed and DNA can be pretty well accessible okay and in the heterochromatin region where you see that the nucleosomes are like very tightly wound around the DNA so they don't let much access to the DNA and so this is actually one of the very important ways that the cells they they regulate gene expression okay because when you have a heterochromatin region in the genome okay the transcription factors for example they cannot access that region easily so it's not really that simple because you have a lot of histone modifications too but one of the ideas is if you decrease the DNA accessibility the DNA you actually get less gene expression from those regions okay and that is important because because the cells they actually use these use these type of use these type of mechanisms okay to silence for example the regions in the genome where there's a lot of retrotransposons okay the retrotransposons if they are secret there they are active too much they may actually cause a problem with the genome integrity okay so the what the cells do is they just you know create a lot of heterochromatin region around these these retro transposon elements are like repeat elements and then they are not active too much okay and you know trying to understand these you know where these euchromatin regions are I mean obviously if you think about it you know the essential genes right I mean the genes that for example code for ribosomal proteins right so they have to be active all the time so they would be actually very permissive they would be in very permissive regions like you know euchromatin regions and they would be they would be mainly active all the time right but actually I mean other genes like you know differentiation I mean genes associated with differentiation or development right I mean they should be on some of the time for example you know when you're developing a you know from a you know from an egg or like you know and I fertilized the sperm and then your development starts right and when did that starts they're actually so many different developmental programs being implemented so the genome is actually very active you know it opens up different regions different genes you know it closes up different portions a lot of you know transcription factors get affected a lot of enhancers get you know they move around interact with different DNA and you know one of the main things right now people they're trying to do is they're trying to understand these non-coding programs of you know development or differentiation and you know make use of that to understand for example you know the disease is the disease that are coming from development right so you know an understanding these non-coding effects of these non-coding mutations and you know non-coding epigenetic changes right I mean they're going they're going to be they're going to I think in my opinion is going to get even more hot in the in the future ok so one last thing I will talk about is the DNA methylation right so the DNA methylation is another type of epigenetic effect so when we say epigenetic if you're not familiar with it the epigenetic means it's it's basically a non genetic factor that changes you know organisms for example on phenotypes ok and so DNA methylation is really about you know changing the the adding a chemical modification to the cytosine residues ok the C residues right this I'm sorry see Nick the Atty residues right this they are actually special because they can get methylated so it's here's you know cytosine this is shown on the on the top right and then we get a ch3 group that is added by these different you know the NMC or dnmt 3 type of genes okay these proteins they can actually go does in everybody can't get everybody see me or not okay I think what must say is that she cannot hear me maybe she should just okay okay okay okay so okay I was saying DNA methylation so DNA methylation it just you know it just you know you add on the cytosine residues you add is a methyl group okay and then when you add that it turns out that this region is it becomes inactive okay so a lot of the regions in the genome so these are called CPG Islands okay so CPG Islands they are fairly rich with the CPG residue so the reason why we call them CPG is because do you know there's a sea Nick they type then there's a phosphate part and there's a gene igloo okay cytosine phosphate kornish in on the same strand we have a CPG C so these regions that are highly enriched in the C gene dinucleotides they get a lot of DNA methylation on them and when that happens they do you know this the the genes around those regions they get inactivated ok now you can see we actually added a lot of different types of information on top of just the genetics right I mean so the genetic portion of the genome is really is really static right I mean the genes I mean the gene sequence does not change too much over time but you know all these epigenetic effects for example make deals on positioning or DNA methylation or you know transcription factor binding or we didn't talk about too much but histone modifications or I mean they change all the time and they're you know hundreds and maybe thousands of these different factors that are that are used to regulate the gene expression so you can see now we are really now talking about you know non-static view of the genome I mean genome although is just you know three billion letters that don't change too much over time it actually changes a lot in terms of what they're you know what the cell does in terms of its you know epigenetic mechanisms are okay so you know this is just showing an example maybe I'll just pass this quickly so what's happening here is I'm you know in a normal cell we have you know the it so I'm just looking at the figure so we have the CPG Island there you know the white CPG so the white you know little beats with you know lines connected to it they're just going unmethylated regions and the red ones are showing methylated region so if you have a gene that is important for for example tumor separation right tumors are pressing genes then in the normal cells they would actually not be methylated right but in the tumor cells if you have aberrant DNA methylation at the promoters then you would not see gene expression from that gene and if you you know if you just you know shut down two copies of this gene you may not be able to get expression and this may actually start a a tumor cell or you know in your plastic cell that may turn into tomber cloners or something back so obviously I mean one of the important things is these things don't happen by themselves or I mean this you know the nucleosome positioning and DNA methylation and transcription factor binding and you know three-dimensional genome structure they are actually very I mean the hypothesis should be they are there's and there's some interplay between those right I mean we cannot just look at each of them separately I mean a lot of people do that but the idea should be really look at them independently and one of the other things is you know for example in Turkish people I mean does do we have a different type of three-dimensional genome for example I'm just making it up totally but we're like our I mean I mean this does this thumb you know difference in the genome genome structure does it create different enhancers or like you know Turkish population specific enhancers can we identify those you can actually even do that from the genome sequence you can try to identify there I mean there are algorithms that identify and answer sequences from the genome so I mean I would be very interested if you know we can find things like that in the Indian or Turkish genome right okay so oh yeah one of the things that I wanted to talk about is because I use this data to a lot is is the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing so the idea here is if you want to identify the regions in the genome where you know proteins interact with DNA okay for example transcription factor is the perfect example then you can actually use something like this chip sequencing analysis and you know I don't want to go too much into the detail of this because we not have too much time but the idea is really um you know binded the protein to the DNA then enriched the regions of the the genome where protein is bound and to sequencing and finally you basically get you know sequencing plots like the one on the bottom right so it says you know h3k4me3 or something like that so this is basically a stone modification that is associated with promoter active promoters and you know one of the things I am actually doing a lot is you know trying to understand what these signals mean and how can we understand them so do you know the point that I'm trying to make here is you know this this you know sequencing actually gives you a lot a lot of very interesting information about this epigenetic analysis - okay so I will try to go a little bit faster so you know if you look at these tracks so I'm just you know I'm showing an igv screenshot of this of this of these transcription factors here so so each of these rows is actually showing a transcription factor chip see data and on the bottom you can see SLC for a one gene and then did the the promoter of this gene is on the rise because it's the gene is on the negative strand right and you can see a lot of the things are a lot of things are happening around the promoter right so the point that I was trying to make here is you know the signal is actually you know wiggling around right I mean it goes up and down up and down so when it goes up it actually means that that there is some transcription factor binding at that location so you can see a lot of different transcription factors are binding at different locations around the promoter of this gene so you know I mean if this is a an interesting gene to you in your research for example I'm just making it up then then you can actually you should try to understand what is happening around the promoter of this gene because you know if it's if it's associated with a disease right and you know one of these these transcription factors are important for transcription of this gene then you should really understand whether mutations are affecting the binding of that transcription factor okay so you know one other thing that I want to talk about is the encode project so the encode project is a project very similar to TCGA but this is really about you know healthy people and this is really about epigenetics I mean the reason why I'm talking about that is because I worked a lot with this project and the idea here is you know they are actually doing a lot of different experiments like you know chip sequencing for like you know identifying histone modifications you know in this example it says I'm you know seven six hundred experiments and data sets and for transcription we have like you know more than 1,200 data set so this is a lot of RNA seek experiments aren't I don't think there's an expression arrays here and there's a lot of you know right now in code for is is in progress you know in code for is going to generate a lot more data sets and these those are going to be there's going to be a lot of three-dimensional chromosomal interaction data sets there too right so you can see now your encode is really what they're trying to what they say they're trying to do is you know annotate the non-coding genome and it's the the non-coding genome I mean one of the papers that we wrote was in 2012 and we were saying you know 80% of the genome is active I mean people didn't like that number a lot one bit but you know I mean it's actually true if you go and look at the encode project datasets and you can actually go over the genome you know you know at least more than you know 50 percent of the genome has some interesting transcription factor or histone modification associated with it and those we should really try to understand if they mean anything for diseases like cancer right okay so let's try to go faster so I will talk about this for one second so one thing that I did was actually um I was actually looking at you know searching for functional genomics associated publications in PubMed okay and this is showing the number of pomade entries for each year so the point here is 2012 has a lot of entries and after 2012 it actually goes really fast goes much higher you know compared to previous years and the reason why why that I'm hypothesizing is because encode was published in 2012 and people actually have gained a lot of interest after 2012 in functional genomics so functional genomics is really related to understanding you know epigenetics and you know gene expression how these relate to each other okay so you know we actually should have done that earlier but we didn't talk about too much about to you next round gene expression is sorry these things didn't come up but they're actually you know indeed those black boxes there is supposed to be things like you know like a measurement tools that represent we are measuring you know the RNA at each of these different locations and cell but you know the the gene expression quantification is actually very advanced right now right maybe we can do a lot of or any expression RNA sequencing experiments right there we can actually all so quantify the protein expression level so I mean this is this should also be done right I mean because RNA doesn't do the actual job proteins are actually doing that important job here I mean RNAs are just messengers right and one of the things that I wanted to highlight here is so we can actually take the RNA and we can actually divide it even within the cells compartment so we can actually look at you know nuclear rnas and cytoplasmic RNA or you know we can look at polyadenylated RNAs and we can look at you know mature rene's and you know pre mRNAs and you know we can actually look at the expression levels of all of those and you can see now we can actually when you say gene expression it's you know it just represents one number but it's actually you know you have you know you can get you know ten different gene expression levels for one gene even if I mean if you incorporate the transcript expressions right I mean you would get probably 20-30 numbers so I mean the point that I'm trying to make here is it suddenly becomes very high dimensional and this is you know this is one of the things the current you know functional genomics based by firm attics people are trying to really understand so you know how can we make sense of this very high dimensional data okay so you know two projects that I wanted to highlight here is I'm not actually involved in those but they're I think they're very important so the one of them is G text so G tags is actually very I mean everybody's all about G tags here at least like you know six months ago everybody was all of architects but so the gtex is really what they're trying to do is they're they are actually trying to correlate the genetic composition of individuals with the gene expression level so you know they're trying to find these events called eqtls expression quantitative trait loci so the idea here is you know the mutation changes the gene expression level of ffs nearby gene okay so they're trying to you know relate the genotype to gene expression levels and here my protein at this is really about mapping that expression levels of proteins in a lot of different tissues in the body okay and gtex actually does this for gene expression so they're trying to you know map the gene expression levels for a lot of different tissues in the human body so if you're interested in you know tissue-specific expression of you know genes and proteins then you should definitely look at HPA and gtex so I'm not exactly sure if gtex data is I mean there there's some public component but I'm not sure if the the protected data you can access it from outside US I think you can but it makes it take some time okay moving on so you know one thing I want to highlight here is you know RNA sequencing read coverage is kind of an interesting thing so if you look at the genes you can actually you know when you mapped or and East RNA treats you actually get these I'm read coverage is only on the exons okay you can see here is that you know the aligned reads I've shown a lot of them are spliced so we don't get too much coverage in the introns right and on the exons we have a lot of coverage so what you do is gene expert when you just compute the gene expression levels from by just counting these reads and after you you do that you get this number for example in this in this case you know we computed 75 RPM what you do with that is you just take the gene expression levels and put that into a matrix right so after you put that in a matrix you can actually make that a heat map right so here it's showing a ll versus a ml to different Dom leukemia right two blood cancers and what what you can do is you know you can try to identify biomarkers just based on gene expression levels right and what we're trying to understand is basically you know by just I mean if you from either way that the breast cancer right I mean they it has actually very good biomarkers just based on gene expression labs right and people are now trying to identify biomarkers you know based on gene expression levels or I mean obviously the mutation landscape right I mean the mutations are very useful for as biomarkers to for example identify which drugs would be suitable for individual but one of the the main things I mean one of the things people are now trying to use this you know gene expression levels or you know other epigenetic marks and can we correlate these with for example the survival rates or things like that okay so you know one thing that I kind of like is you know this this thing I called you know diaphragmatic triangulation so the idea is you know you put you know the genomic information transcriptome and the regular regular ohm is basically what we talked about you know transcription factors nuclear is on positioning things like that and you know transcriptome is the gene expression levels all these gene expression I was and the genome is you know whole genome or exome sequencing VCF files and can we just put all these together and add some of the other information like you know structures and you know metabolomics information and can we try to really understand what is happening in in the cell or in a disease or in some you know phenotype that you want to study so this is the type of thing I think you know where the the field is really going to I mean you know five years ago it was integrative analysis now it's really about you know deep learning and you know trying to you know put all these datasets together very large datasets together and probably in ten or fifteen years it's going to be about gene editing or something right and the world one of the things that is actually making this possible is very large datasets so you know we have thousands and you know thousands and thousands of samples in the intro example TCGA right a lot of them have some regular loam information I think there's some micro RNA information and there's a lot of transcriptome you know RNA sequencing date the genome obviously we have the whole genome whole exome sequencing for those patients and the nice thing is they mean they're not not nice but the good thing for this analysis is there's also a lot of you know imaging data and things like that that you can try to incorporate into this into this triangulation so to speak okay so but this kind of takes us to you know when you talk about you know holistic approach is right I mean rather than looking at each data set separately we want to just you know put them all together in a holistic approach and we get you know we kind of start doing the system's pilot right I mean we try to put all these things together and we you know we try to come up with networks right so it's uh you know we start from genes and then you know we create these molecular networks a lot of people actually are working on networks right so you know you try to you know come up with regulatory networks co-expression networks war you know singling networks or things like that and then next what people are you know looking at is they look at as you how do the cells interact with each other so there's actually a lot of research going into you know XO some'll rnase right I mean the RNA is they're sent between or the cells so the cells you know send some message to other cells mean to do you know in intercellular space and then you know in terms of RNAs and then those RNAs actually get captured by other cells and they you know they look at the RNA and they you know they change their they take they change their metabolism to do different things so you know the cells now they may be interacting with each other finally you know you have organ networks right so so the idea here is trying to look at everything you know you know holistic manner and try to make sense out of those and finally you know we have the individual right I mean after the organ right and then we can now go to social networks Facebook or Twitter right oh yeah I you see like there's just no end to you know making these these networks I mean you can actually you know take the social networks at you know the animals or like you know the plants went to this and you could actually think about what what would happen if we did that but obviously we need the datasets were right okay so one of the things is metagenomics right I mean metagenomics is really about you know taking a a sample from a for example an office or like you know Street or like you know a you know from your mouth or something right and then trying to understand what type of different organisms there that are interacting with each other so these organisms are creating a a habitat so to speak right and they are interacting with each other and can we really understand what is happening in for example in our stomachs right the gut microbial in doubt that is actually pretty popular right now meat people are trying to understand you know differences between there in cancer patients versus healthy people is there difference between the gut gut microbiome I mean this is very hard to study right because the cancer in which they cancer patients they take a lot of drugs that are changing their got microbiome so it's time how would you correct for that but I mean I mean that's not my area of research but but it is very hot right now so I'm just showing one example paper here I don't want to talk too much because we are way over time but if you're interested in this this this field of study you should really look at that okay so again you know when you look at metagenomics people are now trying to oh something is happening I didn't like that okay one of the things is you know trying to understand what type of bacteria live in in on our bodies you know everywhere you know on your body so try we can understand you know the types of bacteria that live in our bodies then we can actually probably make better more informed decisions about our health right so that's the one of the ideas and as I just said got microbiome is is one of the hot research areas right now people are trying to understand so another thing that is actually pretty is going to is already a very important deal is CRISPR right so the CRISPR base gene editing so it's almost like a genomic typewriter for fixing health right but this has actually a lot of issues with it so so they're you know the idea behind CRISPR is you know that you just you know design a construct that is going to go and edit this very specific location in the genome right and it turns out that CRISPR may have a lot of off target effects meaning that a lot of regions that is being edited may not be the regions that you want to edit and as far as I heard a lot of this studies that use CRISPR are now CRISPR are now they they're just asked to do whole genome sequencing to make sure they are not editing the regions that are not supposed to be edit so this is going to be an interesting place I mean Christopher is obviously a very big deal but there's a trial I know it is not very mature yet although the Chinese scientists are actually already making CRISPR babies as far as I know so you know that the city of that I mean ethical considerations behind that should be discussed a lot right okay so you know that brings us to bioethics right so I mean one of the things that you should definitely think about is is you know the what are the ethical implications of what you're doing I mean it may not really you mean your decisions may not be really affecting too much but it could I mean at one point you you will probably make a decision that will have some ethical implications of something right so I mean you know a lot you can think about like you know the genomic data and genomic data is very identifying so that's why you know NIH for example they're they're protecting it very very securely right and in Turkey too right I mean right now the Turkish genome project if you're doing that right now it's they should I mean like how would you protect that data and you know if I mean you can protect the data right now but if it gets out you know in 10 years 20 years what will happen to the relatives of those people because you know you share a percentage of your DNA with your relatives right so I put you know two questions here that you may want to think about but I will just you know keep going because you're way over time so um you know one of the things is again privacy right so the privacy of people is a major thing so right now I mean if you guys are familiar with me you may have heard at the Golden State kill right I mean so what the detectives are now doing is they're doing genetic surveillance on on the unsolved cases okay so what what happened is you know this guy was um you know this is a serial killer who was killing people around 1960s okay and he was not caught so in 1960s I think he just you know just stopped and you know he just and then he just vanished right and did you know the detectives they just couldn't find him but they had DNA evidence from the place where he was you know he was you know murdering people right and then but that you know there was no technology or no database to search for that DNA but now we actually have a lot of you know public DNA databases so what these detectives they're smarter I mean what they did is they sequence that DNA and they search for the this this DNA within those database and they actually found a very good match to the killer's cousin and then after that they actually found the killer by just looking at whether this this guy's um you know any any of his relatives were in the area and on 1960s and they just caught the killer and actually they did indict couple of people just based on DNA evidence and the Supreme Court actually says that if you get arrested in the United States you may get your DNA being stored in a FBI database so that is that is constitutional that so to speak so like your fingerprint right now they can actually take your DNA and put it in a database too so you know this actually just you know the point that I'm talking about this is just I mean it just opens up very a very different place right I mean now if they're actually using molecular data to really to to to you know for law enforcement which is which is kind of interesting I mean it would obviously be very useful but obviously this I mean genetic material is not definitely right I mean you can actually get wrongly accused of something that you didn't do and they know that go implications of that should be thorough okay one of the other things about ethics is you know I kind of like to talk about this as scientific misconduct right I mean when you write papers you know you generate genomes and you write papers you know you find results and you write papers and um you know it's it's very easy to try to you know to you know to plagiarize people or like change results to make your case much better right so I mean an age and other places obviously take this very seriously so I mean there's no point in saying you know bad plagiarism is bad but I mean yeah so it's bad so I mean but again there's it's it's not always a black-and-white scenario so the bottom line that I'm trying to I mean I will just say here is intent is the most important factor I mean you do a lot of things when you're doing research I mean you make a lot of decisions you know just leave out this data put this data and you know change the state to things like that but your intent should always be is this the main key factor right to understand what you know how to do things so if you always have the best intentions I don't think it's going to be a problem and you know one of the other things is the scientific reproducibility you know cancer and psychologies actually is getting a major hit from this so you know I will just go over this right up here the reproducibility project so okay so the cancer biology launched 2013 to scrutinize key findings in 50 cancer papers it aims to determine what fraction of influential cancer biologists studies are producible and they found that actually they failed 47 out of 50 3 cancer papers we reproduce so I mean this is a big deal right I mean out of you know 53 papers for 7 were not reproduced and so the bottom line is you know we ever produced with the crisis okay so even you know any paper that you write it should be reproducible I mean there's just no other way to say I mean if you write a software pipeline right I mean that's what we do all that's all we do right you should just put it on get up I mean I'm all for get up I mean pop make it public put it on get up anything you Det just you know make a make a script and put it on get up when people don't do it I actually reject papers as a reviewer yeah but I mean just I don't reject them but I ask them to you know just to put the coat on you know I mean otherwise there's no point right I mean that's my personal view but there's no point as a wife or a musician if you come up with the software analysis and you don't you know put it on somewhere publicly available there's it just doesn't do anybody any good I mean I can just make up results in a paper and I know if I don't show the code for it you know I can write a paper and you can get pop you know accept it and it in a journal but if you don't have the you know waiter to produce it it would be useless ok so there is all to this and you know one final thing is you know I will not talk too much about this the what but you know there's actually very active discussion of Ni ages genetic data sharing policies okay so and I actually got very very paranoid about sharing data at 2008 and if you're actually interested in this you should read this paper by Homer at all Neal's Homer it's on the bottom left corner of this slide and so the idea was you know for the G was studies right and I was actually releasing the allele frequencies of two variants but these guys these researchers they show that even if you put the allele frequencies of the of the studies you can still identify whether an individual has participated in that study or not and this actually scared nih a lot so they actually shut down a lot of data sharing policies so they were not sharing allele frequencies for example only the you know variant locations were being shared and actually last year they started to relax that so now they're actually sharing a lot more information they're sharing the allele frequencies and a lot of other aggregate information and we will see how that plays out and moving to the next slide so the reason why I was talking about this is yeah I mean there can be attacks like you know what these guys are talking about I'm not going to go into the details of this but what can happen is you know for example in Turkey right I mean you're doing this study and you know you you're actually studying that some common diseases like Alzheimer's I mean Alzheimer's is a very common but you know the sense of like you know 5% 1% it is coming right and you know if you have an Alzheimer's study and then you know you put the results in in a database right and then you just put you know the general allele frequencies there and if somebody can identify a person has participated in that study that that means that that person may have Alzheimer's right and that would be a breach of privacy and that is actually a big problem because that may have some implications for that person's family too so you know how do you really discuss these or understand the risks around you know sharing this these information obviously you don't want to lock up all the information because it's useless when you lock it up but you know try to understand how would you mediate or these type of attacks is one of the you know main things that people are discussing here now okay so some of the take-home messages the biological data acquisition technologies are advancing very fast okay so this creates major information overload overload on the researcher right so we need a lot of people right now in to understand make sense of this data and so integration of large you know genomic transcriptomic regular meet data sets in a holistic approaches is actually is going to be the most promising for advancing molecular understanding of human health and finally computation and ethics they create some of the big challenges while analyzing these data sets and finally I'm actually looking for postdocs and graduate students so if there's any anybody that you that you think are interested um they should actually contact me and we can see what we can do on that side and then sorry I mean this took a little bit longer than I thought it was going to take and so this finishes my presentation is and thank you thank you guys yes yes oh um yeah I mean it's going to be a competitor right but I mean as far as I know alumina is so what what they stays asking is we talked about the Lumina that can be monopolies right and then she's asking what do you think about nanopore sequencing so yeah I mean so the reason why I was saying Illumina can be monopolies yeah I mean they're now doing short sequencing and I mean short trade sequencing a long wait so you can see - but nanopore can definitely be I mean it's definitely going to be a a competitor in the long reach sequencing long reach sequencing technology but the the issue with I mean as far as I know I mean it may change in the future but the issue with nanopore is I mean that the sequencing errors is too much right so what I think what Illumina is going to do is they will probably start offering packages like you know um you know how short read have long read sequencing type of packages and that will actually change the game because people actually have shown that if you do if you combine long reads with the short reads you can actually gain a lot of a lot a lot more better information high quality information by doing sequencing I mean that you're doing this type of you know kind of mixed more hybrid sequencing type of thing I think they can easily take over nanopores I mean I'm actually not exactly sure what will happen but and one other thing with nanopores it's like you know they have this portable sequencing machine I think they can try to market it for much different purpose I think they're already doing that I mean for example like you know in Africa right I mean I think a lot of the researchers were using it for sequencing the the Ebola strains or something right so that I mean for that you cannot really you know take a whole you know aluminous using machine there I mean that that would be very hard right yeah I mean I think they both have different type of advantages but I think you lou mina is they have the upper hand right now so does that answer your question a little bit yes good question regarding okay so father is asking this question I think I have a specific technical question regarding an analysis of RNA seek data how do you combine the same type of data set from different different studies which might have different library sizes or technical differences what do you do what do you do oh wait what do you do to prevent any biases like library size normalization to hear any other okay but other than rpm or TPM because they considered gene exon length which is not the case when you compare the same gene and different tissues if you're comparing a gene with others in the same sample yes this could be useful okay so so when you say library sizes I'm assuming you have like different read lines I mean that's a that's a very technical I mean that's a very hard question I mean that's a good question so I'm assuming so what you would have is you know the the bottom line on point I mean the you know it really would look at the data and what I would do is I mean just you know you know I mean generally I just start with quantum normalization right I mean a lot of these things like you said the secret that they that already does that but it is it is a very hard problem in this you know we talk a lot about this you know whether TPM is useful or PM is useful and you know that the bottom line is I think there's no solution there's it's just it really depends on it really depends on the experimental setup because I mean if you have for example cancer tissues right I mean cancer tissues even the normalization should change because those genomes are very they are very messed up in the sense that you know they have a lot of you know chromosomal rearrangements at you know like 10% of the genome is delete or something so it's it really depends on what type of a problem you have but if you have like you know healthy people like I mean like Alzheimer disease individuals versus normal individuals I think a normalization like I mean I'm actually not even exactor I need to look at the data I guess but yeah I mean just you know quantum normalization or the you know I think trimmed mean normalization and things like that they mean they they usually solve a lot of the issues and you know there are also other things like you know you would also have the technical issues like you know library I mean laboratory effect right I mean things like that so I mean you wouldn't need to do I mean you know you would need to do technical correction like you know the peer normalization and you know there's this tool called combat and you know they would remove the technical technical areas but it really depends on the the data set but the this I don't think this is this whole this is a problem that you can solve so to speak doesn't make sense and if you have different library sizes I think it's just it is very hard to compare those data sets does that help no problem thank you yeah thank you for inviting me um and yeah I mean if you have any questions or any you can if you just you know feel like messaging you can just email me and thank you very much I think that is this is that right okay okay have a good week
