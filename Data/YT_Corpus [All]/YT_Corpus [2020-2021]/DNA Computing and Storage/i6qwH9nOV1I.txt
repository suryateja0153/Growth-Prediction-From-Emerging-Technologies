 I hope you're caffeinated and ready to go for the last and most exciting panel session yes so okay so we've got our five distinguished panelists who will make remarks 12 minutes each there will be roughly an hour and after that the panel will open up and we'll have we'll be joined by all of the five panelists and our plenary speaker Emilio so with that let me get started I'm going to go in the alphabetical order of the last names of the panelists starting with Hamza Bala Krishnan so Hamza is a professor of Aero Astro at MIT one of the things that we were grad students together at Stanford and so thrilled to introduce her she was at NASA Ames Research after her PhD from Stanford she did her undergrad from IIT Madras she works on well-used she'll just talk about that let me so quickly tell you about few of the words she received of course NSF scarier the inaugural CNA hour award in operational analysis as well as dawn pH men award well welcome to London thank you it's an honor to be here so thank you different John for the invitation it is also truly an honor to be in a session in honor of such a matter so I'm gonna start with a very quick anecdote on how I first met Sanjoy I had never been to MIT when I interviewed and some of you may know it but it's a little bit of an intimidating place and I knew offs Android from all his papers and you come in and you know it's a two-day interview the first day is just rapid-fire meeting after meeting after talk and the one thing I vividly remember is dinner on the stay with Sanjoy and you know going in you would think you know I really thought he was going to be one of the most intimidating people I would meet and yet I just still appreciate just how you know kind he was and how you know welcoming I felt and it really you know everything you share about how you know tougher play semi tears you know that first day really helped me understand and you know how nice it could be and such I really played a key role so I'm very appreciative of that and you know try to do a little bit of that every time we meet new people now you know to make them feel welcome at MIT so they're not mentioned you know when John said you got the transition section a session it's always a question of what do we do and then they would send instructions and he said go back and I wasn't quite sure how far back to go I realized yesterday John died really feedback control started in ancient Greek so I could have gone back that far but being in the era Astro Department and talking about air transportation I figured I wouldn't go quite that far just more like a hundred years to the Wright brothers you know more than 100 years and this is a talk that Wilbur Wright gave in 1901 so this was a two years before the first flight of a human power you know of an airplane and in the speech he said the difficulties which obstruct the pathway to success in flying machine construction are of three general classes it is what we teach all our aerospace engineering undergrads so Alan probably remembers that from you know it's time as an undergrad the first is materials so how do you construct your wings and your wings need to be designed such that you can generate lift so you know the sustaining wings the sustaining wings the second has to do with the engine and propulsion so those which relate to the generation and application of the power required to drive the machine through the air and the third was those relating to the balancing and steering of the machine after it is actually in flight and then he went on to say of these two difficulties to our already to a certain extent solved right so the question is which two so he says men already know how to construct wings on airplanes which when driven through the air can you know get a sufficient speed you can generate the lift it can carry the engine the engineer as well we also know how to build the engines and the screws of sufficient lightness in park however the inability to balance and steer still confront students of the flying problem when this one feature has been worked out the age of flying will have arrived for all other difficulties are of minor importance so you know going back to everything that lids does or at least starting with the control you know it certainly intro involved with the details of air transportation because the last thing that they solved was how do you actually control this and you know it goes back to a lot of the stuff that Amelia talked about earlier today as well so two years later they flew and they actually did manage to control it but you know humans human ingenuity is such that you always want to do better controlling the airplane was still hard so about ten years later question was can you actually make it easier for the pilot and so in the 1930 part of the that decade middle of the decade Elmer Sperry invented the gyro compass and his son Lawrence Perry decided that you could use that to actually build the first autopilot and he was 20 years old he built an autopilot and he won the aircraft safety competition in France and the idea was actually quite simple so you have a gyroscope which is a heading indicator you combine it with an attitude indicator and you can actually get the aircraft to fly you know follow a compass a straight and level of course it makes it much easier for the pilot and of course I have to say he was also the inventor of the flashy demo right because it wasn't enough to show that you could actually work so in the competition first time you can see that picture you know look ma no hands but he also asked his French mechanic to go out and and all the wings so that everybody knew nobody was actually handling the aircraft right so but this is sort of where you know this is a period of ten years but you already have some level of you know more lid start thinking on how do you actually army you know at a very simple control level coming in I'm going to jump forward to about thirty years and we talked about this yesterday so project world men in 1944 the US Navy approached Gordon Brown and said they wanted to build a machine that would actually help improve the way aircraft are design an aircraft you know training occurs for pilots and so the idea was that you would have a computer and you would have a joystick and some of my mechanisms that would connect to you know control surfaces and you would use that so that you would get be able to train pilots we know this of course you know John said the project whirlwind was you know what we remember it for is for you know the development of the magnetic core memory that's true but it's also the first flight simulator and and so if you think about it you know that's sort of the path of going towards you know leads was very early in coming up with ways of looking at how you controlled you know one element of your system so you know one aircraft and how do you do that but by this time you know in the forties fifties and early sixties as control was developing air travel was getting quite popular as well so that's also around the time that you actually had the problem of congestion because there was enough people who wanted to fly of course you had you know the headline from 1968 which is the FAA urges the us to construct 800 airports to ease congestion we don't quite have 800 airports with a lot of traffic right now but then that sort of in terms of what needed to be done the methodologies and the techniques that needed to be done to support the analysis and support this sort of not just one aircraft but a lot of aircraft from the collective behavior of the systems and the management of these systems was also you know there was very active work at lids you know Mike Atkins Center in combination actually with the flight transportation lab and our Center with Amedeo Dhoni and others looking and MIT Lincoln lab was involved in this looking at things like the cockpit air traffic situation display so that you know the situational awareness for pilots and also things that you know have become you know much more common areas of research since then such as how do you optimize these flows how do you merge aircraft more efficiently in terminal areas how do you space them and so on and interestingly enough I think I've worked on these problems Emilio's worked on these problems when he was in her Astro but really the birth of these problems a lot of these approaches was at lids as early as in the 1970s so there's all these two themes that have been consistently going on so one that has to do with well you know a single aircraft or a single vehicle what do you do the other that has to do with the the system when there are multiple interacting agents and of course the direction in which a lot of this was going is you know in turn the direction of automation and autonomy so this is a headline that we all dream of right so robot pilot airplane makes a safe crossing of the Atlantic from Canada to England everything being fully automatic and you know this seems like a really neat demo to have now unfortunately it's been done before this is a New York Times front page from September 23rd 1947 right so if you know first one autonomous flight of an aircraft its Heisman done so why are we still working on these problems it's clearly you know we don't see autonomous cars everywhere we don't see autonomous planes everywhere so there's two issues so the planes for now I mean you know I think of a drone it doesn't look like that right so there's still the question of how do we do this reliably and at scale and repeatably in a way that it can actually interact with everything else that's happening you know the human piloted aircraft and other autonomous aircraft and they look like this right and this is truly I mean we've talked about the commoditization of data but there's also clearly a commoditization of aircraft that's happening simultaneously and so the challenges again now have a lot more to do with how do you you need you know enable what this revolution can do where you have more drones consumer drones being sold in a month than every registered commercial manned aircraft on the planet right so the order of magnitude is much more different so a lot of the challenges now are going to be you know this issue of scalability and how do you do large systems with multiple vehicles and you know once I talked earlier today about he mentioned the impact of cascading failures I should point out that we're actually seeing evidence of this so since we live in the Norfolk you know not least a lot of people in this room fly around I want to just present some data so you can look at historically in the u.s. how many days do you have and in a year or in a given three-month period a season when more than a thousand flights are canceled and it used to be one of those things that we would say the 2015 winter was really bad right and so that would be the one time there would be large numbers of cancellations there are several days but we've certainly gotten to a point where this happens you know pretty consistently right we have massive delays visa system-wide and it keeps happening all the while and what we want to do is be able to do this plan the system with manned aircraft better with passenger flights better with cargo flights better but also do it with a large number of unmanned aircraft that we would expect to see and so going very quickly to what the future that you know is expected this is NASA's view of what the skies are going to look like and 20 t-this 2030 this doesn't actually include any of those consumer drones these are pretty much Enterprise drones operating at altitude the blue aircraft of the manned aircraft the red aircraft are unmanned aircraft doing all sorts of things like surveillance missions out here and everything else what we have right now is the ability to optimize right so we've done a lot of work on the computing side how do you actually you know leverage cloud computing resources to do real-time planning on this just optimization but that's not going to be the answer because we need to be able to do this robustly under uncertainty we need to be able to do this in you know with multiple players so issues of fairness issues of who are we serving who are we not serving which communities are being left out how do we look at behavior how do we look at security how do we look at safety you know and so all of those challenges that we've been tired you know over the course of the past two days been talking about our it's time I feel for the next transition right so we did that for one aircraft and we moved there and now we have the system-wide problems to transition to that thank you all right let me quickly introduce our next panelist going in alphabetical order next panelist is Richard Berry Richard was born in LA he's professionally focused on systems architectural new education new technologies education and philanthropy in earlier career he was assistant professor of Electrical Engineering and computer science at George Washington is it was also member of technical staff at MIT Lincoln lab co-founder density of cycle more networks the long history in industry and I'm trying to quickly sort of focus on few of the things including just I forgot to tell you he's also a Ledge alum and a PhD from 1993 so please welcome right thanks I'm I'm glad to be here it's you know it's unusual for me to be in this kind of environment again and I found I've mentioned to a few of you that I feel like certain neurons re-firing that you know weren't firing before I think David's talk especially lit up a whole section of my brain and and unfortunately that section then said your slides are all wrong you know if no equations no mesmerizing blockchains moving around but you know so we'll do the best I can so I started in lists like 1988 and so that's about 30 years ago and at the time when I started what Sanjoy was director and you know in my view let's had sort of been here forever right and now that I sit here and say well 80 years and 30 that means if you plotted this between zero and one I'm gonna get it right around point six which is a different perspective I don't know what that means but you know it's kind of an observation and I thought how am I gonna you know sort of present 30 years of optical networking in in you know two three minutes when we get there I thought well maybe I'll make some nice graph and that people like graphs and you can see things happening with time but I realized I probably have to be like a log scale and that was little depressing to me so instead we'll just go with a few few points here but I just thank you to Sandra for the leadership and also for humoring me and doing a foundations of quantum theory uh at the time when I was there and to meet you was my academic advisor and Piero I'm not sure here's today was my thesis advisor and Bob was a reader there so let's see here which one good green that's why it says so you know my my time when I was living on all this stuff day-to-day which I don't live it anymore was was awhile ago and so just a few acknowledgments with people that I'd called to help bring me a little bit up to up to speed here it's good to have friends so you know in terms of I I thinking you know so roughly like I said since I started working on this which was when I was started as a student a PhD student you know to now is about 30 years or so and so you know being a little loose with the time I divided up into like the early years and and then what's going on now and I think there's a little bit of an interesting story of what happened here so you know what was at a very high level it's simple is that you had a new application you had an old technology that wasn't really fit to that application and you had new technology which was available at the time to to solve that right of course you're dealing with infrastructure you're dealing with things that go in the ground it's slow you need a big impetus to make that change and there was an ecosystem that existed at that time to do that both in terms of deregulation which spurred a lot of innovation and different companies the rise of the ISPs and it's different when you have a a customer going to a carrier saying you know give me the equivalent of a wavelength of bandwidth versus the carrier internally deciding they need to do something with that wavelength and you had a lot of money going into it so you had like the bond market willing to fund new networks and to start that stuff so you had you had a lot of you know wind at your back to do these things if you look at sort of the details it was the rise of IP right and not particularly not just IP but the rise of high-speed routers where the speed of the port of the router was approaching the speed that you would carry on one wavelength on the optical fiber and so the old technology of multiplexing lots of little things together voice calls or private line calls didn't make sense when you wanted to carry one thing on a wavelength or maybe four things even on a wavelength at the same time optical technology was literally explosion exploding at the time you had wavelength division multiplexing you had optical amplifiers which would amplify all those signals at once as opposed to having many repeaters for each signal so you could deploy additional capacity by just changing the end points and not going into the middle and the economics during this time were amazing and that the innovation of the optics was happening faster than the innovation of the electronics not all the electronics of course you needed out at the endpoints but of those but the router technology so even though the routers are getting faster the optics was getting faster faster than that and the economics were such that people wanted needed another layer in between the routers and the physical network itself besides the fact that you had to carry legacy stuff that still was not carried on IP networks and in fact just anecdotally more than Anatoli at the time if it was more economical somebody bought an eighth wavelength system which they were at the beginning and they had only filled half of it up they would don't go and buy a 20 or 40 wavelength system before filling up the rest of that thing because it was so much more economical to get your spectral efficiency with the new system than to rely on your old system and so things were just moving very very quickly and if you look at what happened sort of in the end then you know the the standards which we were not the economics beat the standards and a new layer emerged in the network to replace sauna which had new framing it had new forward error correction which actually was sort of maybe an underappreciated at that time aspect of this the fact that you could buy lying speed Ford reed-solomon error correction starting in about 2000 so that was actually after we started right and and and and this thing emerged now if you look at what's happening now lately coherent technology and some other things that were done in Lincoln years ago has become practical and commercial hundred gigabits per second and a lot of that has been you know done by some people sitting right here and Pierre was involved componentized to be able to just go right on a line card and so in some sense the IP using WDM directly as has caught up so interesting enough if you go back to 1888 when he started that was an architecture that was being debated right it was you had sort of three camps if you would go out there and you would listen to there was the legacy camp saying you know this is my standard Network you have to follow all these things otherwise you can't get in it and we'll just makes on it a little bit better there was sort of our camp that says no you know take these wavelengths which I'm around maybe do some multiplexing in this new way not in sonic way in between and then you had sort what in the end was a forward-looking camp saying no no you just have routers and you just put WTM on the routers and that's kind of where we are today there's still optical switching in the network there's there is all optical switching in the network right now especially in the metro area you know but but that didn't win at the time that lost at the time it took a number of years for that to happen it was another cycle and it was partly just due to the different development cycles the different technology and the economics that that just really wasn't ready yet so one of the questions that was posed to me was you know how did lids help in this transition and you know at a high level I guess I would say what was the things that I take away from the lids education that that lasted through the years and not you know for me I think is maybe the ability to work from a blank slate was would be one of the major components right you're trying to do something new there's you know piece of paper you just go and do it the deep knowledge obviously helped because you have to sort of have some sort of guidance as to where to go right and you know maybes confidence or ignorance to go and think that you can do this in a new environment what would I eat I wouldn't change anything somebody was question is what else would have helped you so I don't know if I had to give up softball time or something for that you know I say that my experience was that you know like it's kind of summarize that you know Liz is very deep it was very you know a lot of fundamentals and and it was you know it's an essay question and and and a lot of the engineering that I faced there was was multiple choice right and so the you know the ability to make good quick decisions rather than great decisions that take longer it was sort of a skill I had to sort of develop later right you know other things too I think you know maybe not part of Education but the importance of the ecosystem and the multidisciplinary aspects which I appeared to be very strong now of what it takes to commercialize something you know that what you're doing your piece your new piece is only part of the whole puzzle of all the people that that that work within your company trying to do something new the people you're trying to sell it to and the people you're buying things from to make it and you have to you know interact with all those you know people I won't go over all the points here but you know interesting what's going on down in the future in terms of optical networking I you know I think there's there's a you know these David's right infrastructure constantly changes right now you're sort of mid cycle in that so people are innovating and going faster and faster you know speeds and feeds probably we're made cycle though in terms of the new architecture there's something new fundamental there's still stuff going on in networking's I don't see you know a lot of it but just a little snapshot of what I have it seems like we've you know we flattened the transport we flattened the hardware you know but we've we've expanded the software layers right and if you look at AWS and if you look at managed service providers there's a huge trend to outsource your networking right so if you're a commercial entity and you're trying to sell to somebody you may be trying to sell to an entity that doesn't have an as much really a networking department anymore right because Amazon is doing it for them so you know and if you look at Amazon trauma of course they build networks or thing of data centers and so forth right but but but you know part of their job is to Floyd lots of networks not one network right there's thousands and thousands of thousands of them and sort of the traditional problem that that that I learned here was you know Flo's sharing a resource as opposed to many networks many software layers sharing a resource that's not a new thing right infrastructure has always kind of done that but it sort of maybe exists at a huge scale now that didn't exist before and so if you're going to be able to do that that's why you see so much work going on commercially right now with automating it with monitoring it with analyzing it because you know you you can't manage what you what you can't measure and then just the last things don't know time to talk about videos but coming from LA and the fires you know I'll just a little there's you know an emerging layer here of AI between the cameras and the people right and the fire in LA the recent one by the Getty you know a tree branch fell on the power line and besides the fact that the that branch should have been pruned besides the fact that the power line should be underground the fire department about it when 911 was called by somebody seeing the flames after the fire had already spread and there's really no technological reason at this point where we cannot have early detection to solve that problem thank you all right continuing along our third panelist is Sasha bardey so Sashi graduated from IIT Bombay in 2002 with the silver medal answer of that my alma mater so super thrilled to be introducing him he received his PhD here from Leeds working with Li Zhong and Bob in information theory is one of those individuals who would not write on his bio but since I was around and observing he got a really exciting academic job offer at one of the top universities and instead he decided to go to New York because New York is really exciting and I was wondering was that the right choice or maybe it was a great choice he spent seven Disha done lots of exciting things in that what I want sort of go through that currently he co leads a group at hedge fund under engineering gates since 2015 it thanks they all read thank you John for inviting me this is a very humbling experience to be among the superstars and so many of the vendors and heroes that I continue to look up to are in this room starting from Bob to Dave and professor meter all three of them were on my thesis committee to embrace me young they were brought and what is really amazing about these people is besides being an intellectual powerhouse that they are they have built these amazing products that we can touch our text or in recent case where or run and so that is something so starting as my first lits exposure happened without before me knowing leads through many what we have many of us have shared my first ee class was wills key and open Himes signals and systems and till that class I used to think Electrical Engineering is electric towers power generators all these transmission lines and sort of happy to know that I will not have to climb on those towers or things like that it's the true story so that was nice the second exposure was probably the most fortunate things to have happen to me I got to work with Embry in my internship as an undergrad and this is a flicker here okay so I got to work on some really cool information theory stuff and Emory was by far the smartest person had met and more importantly he's the kindest person I'll ever meet and from then on I sort of decided that when in doubt think what Emory would do or did in that case he went to MIT to laits and did PLT with God Emery was very kind to and also connect me to Bob who wasn't taking full-time students anymore but he was happy to quiet voice and I came in and Lee Jong had just started and I became his first student and Bob's second last student and as you may know but Lee Jong is the student of David Shea who is the student of Bob so if you think about the academic tree I became the uncle of grad academic uncle of my academic dad there are a lot of fun for six years in this directed acyclic graph situation with a loop and one one being the first student and the other case I was sort of lodged was very interesting to how those perspectives got to interact a lot with Professor method learned a lot from his bread and let's see is this the clicker is this ring so people often ask what is common what can be common in informational or lids and Finance and perhaps the reverse question is easier what is not common there is a lot common let's start with the same giants we both share some of the same people who have done amazing founding work Shannon himself tinkered with lot of investment ideas apparently he gave a lecture in this class that people took notes on but unfortunately I don't think is published ever that he came up with some things and and apparently had developed a machine to predict the next stock price and so on Kelly criteria again very much leads like person and Birla camp being second student of Bob people prop some people may know this but he is the person who sort of turned medallion the perhaps the greatest hedge fund around while it was not doing well and early years and sort of really made into a really consistent return generator and then sold it off to Jim Simons back and Tom cover as we know had a bunch of interesting work on universe Universal portfolios and here's the interesting part that many of you may not know professor Forney had done some fairly interesting things also in early 2000s in in finance and he has a patent on it and later many years later people ended up rediscovering that and and so on while not knowing that this was rediscovered long back so you can say that - lets alums have created one of the best generating returns ever and I say this with knowing that if you backtrack what they've strategy was it would have done amazing things and I was talking to him outside at lunch today and turns out he came up with the idea without ever looking at data I just sort of intuited I has just come up with a formula and it's just genius it's hard to imagine that kind of intuition from someone who was not even in finance so that's that's let's eliminate so no pressure that's me with Alvin Burleigh camp at Shannon event few years back and I was basically trying to tell him like dude we went to the same lab we had the same adviser you're his second student I am a second lab student you worked on error exponent I worked on error exponents like we're basically grad school buddies so why don't you tell me your secret and I won't tell it to anyone [Music] you probably know where it went didn't go anywhere so little disappointed but I was like okay I'll still keep moving because maybe I got some source from the mothership and that's Marie and Bob in their visit to our alma mater iit bombay and indeed there is a lot of source code that sort of scraped off that is very useful so let's see what is it that still helps and is it's common all right that is easier to see so one of the basic things that is still useful in this problem as well as let's like problems is here again we are trying to build theory for some inherently really messy complex situation and you can't understand basic complex situation as it is so you'll try to build smaller simpler models to understand maybe an aspect of it or some insight here or there and you build up on these insights one at a time and hopefully you can get a picture of the elephant may be at least some parts of the elephant and Bob formula is very useful again it's the art is of course in building these nice models that are insightful and yet tractable and the other aspect I find very useful is the value of a multidisciplinary mindset which by definition leads is some of the ideas for us can come from information theory statistics the usual suspects of course optimization but often they can also come from psychology or sociology or economics or sometimes even fiction and that is really interesting and fun and another thing that I really find useful is what Bob told me early on in my PhD is often it's good to have the Shannon Shannon style which is have multiple problems floating in your head and you can sort of choose when and when you get excited about what just don't sort of keep doing one thing because you may get bored or frustrated and that is extremely useful here as well like come up with a bunch of things to work on and then some of them may work and most of them don't work but still you will have something to look forward to and keep moving making progress and probably the most important thing that I find valuable that I learned at Leeds is probably something many of you relate to is after I came here I often found me being the numbers person in the room and more curiously or problematically I started liking that fact so I would start to be more and more rooms finding more rooms where I am the dumbest person in the room and that was really fun there was a group meeting that day over at Lee Jong and professor Methos group had that was really exciting and so on so this kind of masochist behavior I blame to lids and I'm very thankful for that it has proved very useful let's see what is next so three slides I stuck to that except if you don't count the header let's see what did I wish I did more and this is in the spirit of adding more presidential debate like nature to this debate because John and they've already told us they can make it a little controversial or something so I'll try to be a little bit and this is more in the spirit of what I wish I did do more than what lets did so it's more talking about my narrow focus than blaming it on anyone so one thing I wish I did more was I wish I played a little more with actual data or more experiments of some sort like maybe just take a nozzle of scope and see if the Gaussian noise is indeed Gaussian or not that would have been fun and there were things to do that around me there were laps there were people doing it and I didn't do it so that's bad second I wish I learned a bit more of system design and learned a bit of more programming that bob said is is apparently good so 150 lines of code by the time I finished PhD it was not smart so so I've given a chance to do my PhD again and if Bob and Lee Zhong want another student I'll do this differently this time a little so let's see what are the big differences in our world and this lot of the statistics research at least that happens our data is really really dirty and a lot of the great things that work elsewhere don't work very well for us our SNR is more 10 to the minus 4 which is a percent of a percent Warren and Bernie have their a percent of percent they love we have our percent of percent we love and they're both very problematic so let's see people often talk about big data but for us the real problem is often small data because life is often non-stationary for humans and societies and whatnot markets and times they are a-changin as Bob Dylan told us so we are not in this data pool where we can do really fancy train the machine to play chess by creating infinite artificial data we can't because we can't create artificial market data people do what they do that creates problems that are not as much address so in the small data situation in low SNR so the SNR is roughly in the same level the only other field has that SNR is astronomy I think everything else machine like speech recognition image this that is much better so anyways non-stationarity is a problem and physics and mechanics and our machines we create don't change but people change that means we have to keep learning with very limited or time varying environments that's how short a research cycle which can be fun or frustrating based on your attitude we don't often solve the problem fully but get the 8020 rule figure it out move on maybe but revisit it after some time and best work is not often made public unfortunately again here I think this is Bob's fault because he keeps telling never published don't publish don't publish so we don't publish we don't publish this is getting better there's some better stuff coming out there's some shared open-source software that is commonly used in Python that has come out of finance and so on so I'm more hopeful on this and some of the general tools are still shareable if not the secret sauce is exactly so I'm more hopeful fooled on that it's coming quickly at look not looking ahead because looking ahead means as if I know what is going to happen it's more of a wish list what I would like to happen I would like to see more high noise small data research and a lot was already presented today by guy and Constantine that seems very interesting and and some of the research and cross-validation leave leaves a lot to be desired for us it's great but it doesn't work for this small data high noise regime because there's catch don't change but life changes you know it's there's no training data there's just markets and we'd really like to have some overfed detector which sort of says this is an overfit this is not an overfit and it's it's it's not there yet causation versus correlation things which allow you to do things causally and make sure it is causal so that it's not all frayed it's again a confusion often that is not clear I'll leave this I'm running out of time and game theory maybe to understand people's motivations better and predict better how they will act and while we're wishing why not shoot for the moon maybe there is a grand unified theory that John talked about and ones are a little bit talked about based on like all that stuff and maybe we'll figure it out together with some people in this room Thanks [Applause] all right next is the tea our comes before s okay next is Tom Richardson so I introduced Tom earlier so I think I will sort of give him more time and then give sighs remarks so thanks to have watched the instructions the meeting said that we shouldn't interpret transitions loosely or broadly which I thought I did but I really can't compete with everybody so I think I should explain the title there's two meanings the one is I think probably pretty obvious and pedestrian and we have the G transitions ins wireless 2g 3G 4G 5g now and the other interpretation was expression of some residual frustration that I have for a transition that didn't happen or almost happened but actually did not happen and I actually thought I would take this opportunity of coming back the leads to get it out of my system so I hope I hope this accomplishes that okay so okay so I thought he's a bit self-centered but I thought I'd just talk a little bit about my own case so in 2009 at that paths ahead conference Roger Brackett said that no lids type work he I think just call it systems theories but work it's kind of meta engineering and I think the point was that it's highly portable so he was trying to say you know we should move into other areas but the essential point was that it was very is a portable skillset you can move from place to place and that certainly happened to me so I did a master's degree in control theory came to MIT to work with one of the most famous control theorists in the world and ended up doing a PhD in computer vision then left MIT and it went to Bell Labs in a communications group so I was working and actually but at that point I still didn't really have information theory knowledge I was working on a project for data storage based on holography and and then turbo codes were invented and and I started hearing about them there was a talk about turbo codes in Bell Labs maybe 1995 or so and I went to the talk and the reason I went to the talk was because we needed some good error correction code for the holographic storage systems layer and they said oh I was just no big thing and I went to the talk and I thought they were very interesting and it wasn't really for any information theoretic reason I just thought they are interesting from a dynamical systems perspective which was my background so that I started thinking about them in that perspective and that's how I got into it into coding and a lot of people have mentioned this already during the meanings but I I thought that would be remiss if I didn't mention this transit transition of Bob Gallagher's thesis so what I've shown here is the Google Scholar citations from 1960 dr. today after now year by year this and you can see now there was this transition somewhere around the late 90s and and basically I was catching that wave as well but it's still one of the most remarkable transitions for a thesis you could imagine you can see it started to tail off a bit in more recent years but I think some of that at least could be blamed on their Dallaire account ok so yes I wanted to talk about the Clarion story a little bit 2 D 3G 4G transition so the company was founded in 2000 I certainly don't want to give you the impression that I was the main person behind it the main creative spirit was regime Floria he's not only lives now long but he certainly fits the mold he was a graduate of the University of Maryland and the founding of the company also coincided with this transition this is the bursting of the dot-com bubble and that was a bit sad for us that we had these hopes of getting rich quick and they quickly evaporated but you know it builds character so it was ok all right so what was the what was the idea so actually a flurry was a very audacious concept I mean the goal was actually to be the next generation of cellular and it was very audacious and and the basic premise was that there was a mismatch between existing cellular networks and the internet and this mismatch was not being corrected fast enough and there was an opportunity then kind of to disrupt and what it boils down to is yeah so the reason why this was happening is because the you know phone network and Seiler and the Internet had very different DNA and a different structure a different architecture so you know here are some of the points okay the Internet of course was really computer-to-computer it grew so heterogeneous set of networks that were connected together PACA switch GC IP flow control on the phone side you know the whole system was created for people to talk to each other person to person it was a circuit switched network not too long ago the whole thing was owned by one entity and so it had a very sort of centralized structure and a cellular that at the time was essentially designed to extend that network you know to go over the air and for mobility okay so CDMA was the dominant technology for 2g there was CDMA and GSM and worldwide GSM cover larger areas CDMA was in the u.s. and Japan in South Korea but they were essentially you know the original CDMA system is 95 was really conceived to be a voice system and a lot of the architecture and the mechanisms that were put in there we're trying to take advantage of you know many great they're many many great ideas of course in the CDMA system but really was predicated on theirs on this idea of of B Scyther voice digital voice system and things I listed on the right here so in the characteristics defining characteristics of that technology according to you know Viterbi so you can see that no there's no the big fire to me it was a universal frequency use they required very fast power control but that's probably an issue because of the nature of voice call so in a voice call you make a call you're connected for you know and and for a reasonable amount of time and then you drop so during that period you know that the activity and the traffic it's all relatively predictable in this statistics very of course but but not so dramatically okay so the internet was very different and and of course the main thing is the statistics of the traffic and also requirements for data you require you know zero error rate essentially and for voice you can tolerate something so you need to make the thing reliable and at the same time you have to accommodate all these different types of traffic much more entropy and in their demand for the resources right on the air and so the the basic question it was should cellular network the existing cellular network evolved to carry data or should the internet as he is go mobile at the time and so the answer from 3gpp for example or 3gpp to was that we should take our network and evolve it to carry data and the Flareon proposition was no let's take the internet as is and make it mobile okay okay so so I guess I was supposed to so well that I supposed to do is show how this is a Lidz problem right so these are set of questions that come up almost immediately when you try to do this so how do you predict some typos but anyway how do you provide for rapid transition in varying sized traffic laws so with voice to traffic low and say simply constant I mean there's a large range of traffic requirements how do you provide for a varying amounts of traffic how do you deal with the widely varying demands of traffic in large signal dynamic range so in CDMA what you do is you power control devices to come in at the same power to control interference but in data you might not want it you know you know said you want to do that if you might want to take advantage of he's very close to get very high data-rate save power and so on so how do you make an internal and currently unreliable link look reliable to tcp/ip and I trusted you hand off an IP network and city may use soft handoff so you connect to multiple stations sort of main content ease that's the right thing for data traffic given the statistics how do you manage the resources how do you schedule what how do you please you know protect the battery of the mobile device what's the right state space and so forth the synthesis part of this it's how do you do all of this simultaneously so I think all these are Lidz questions I realize what I forgot to do is go back and check that all the answers aren't to be treated bertsekas books or maybe Bob Gallagher's book maybe I'll just mention one so so the key idea to making tcp/ip reliable over inherent or inherently unreliable link is to use the fact that say on gaussian channels that feedback although it can increase capacity can dramatically improve the air exponent all right so you can quickly get reliability provided you have a closed loop okay so that's definitely Lidz idea okay so case quickly what happened well naturally you know when you try to disrupt something there's going to be resistance so for example infrastructure infrastructure incumbents didn't really want this either networks replace with IP networks Coughlin course had a big stake in a CDMA and didn't want to see you know that eroded so our customers that were available to us are operators and operators tend to be a pretty conservative Bunch next tile was a bit of a maverick and they were serious about the technology but then they were bought by Sprint in 2005 in Dell was pushing WiMAX they didn't really know what they were doing Qualcomm knew much better and actually always thought that Intel should have bought Flareon the Qualcomm knew that bar before II until did and so they bought the company in 2006 and reset their IP generation for a 4G okay so okay there was a comparison I would say how good was the flirting on system this is a just paper I pulled it there was a deployment in Finland and this is comparison between the flareon system and HSDPA and which is like 3.5 G system you can see the comparison it's and the numbers are very precise but the conditions are a little vague first of all they were at different frequencies and one thing to point out is if you know the secret to the Clarion design was to put in a very agile control structure and you can see the effect there in the latency and so this compared their conclusion was that each system and she's disadvantages so for so on HSDPA is a little better but no but what wasn't mentioned here I think was that HSDPA is a five megahertz wide system in and flash selfie I was only one and a quarter okay so I have I'm actually almost out of time but I thought you know what's happening what's critical now is 4G 5g and there's a lot of opportunity for lids sorry thinking not so much maybe in the core network or in the standards part of it but in the applications so people think there's a wide range of applications that a lot of new verticals going to be opened up by 5g and I thought I'd just quickly talk about one of them - coyote so the idea here is that you're gonna go into factories and you're going to put it in network it'll largely look like some high high throughput network maybe in the ceiling with radios up there and they'll talk to all the devices in in the factory including robots and so on and what's interesting here I think is that a change is the game a little bit in terms of what you want or the wireless system so even Tyler the main thing is capacity right you want to provide as many but here you really need to provide reliability so outage capacity if you like or the ability to ensure high reliability with low latency is key so design will have to change and in this case there's there's an incumbent so there's for example there's a industrial Ethernet standards which are adaption and adaptations of Ethernet to provide real-time reliability with very strict latency controls and so on and essentially what the variety system is going to have to do is try to do is displace those things in order to do that they're gonna have to meet the same kind of requirements and it's tough because of the nature of the wireless link to meet those requirements but like any kind of transition of this sort typically the first step is some kind of replacement but if it happens it'll change the game because now you'll have two centralized network that's full visibility into the whole Factory and and you'll have new schemes to try and represent what's going on in the whole factory floor at all different time scales and so that will make change what's possible even to do there or just like another possibility for lids type research ok that's it thanks I last but not the least our last panelist who will speak it will be Sri Sarma Sri is also ladies alum she received her PhD from from Leeds under supervision of Munzer in 2006 she's a controls person who does a lot of exciting things at the interface of systems biology in neurosciences she's currently professor of professor at Johns Hopkins and there are a number of words and I'm trying to figure out which one of them should I read well one of them is of course the P case she's received ok I'm just gonna sort of read one more and then give it to you a Robert Pont excellent Teaching Award welcomes tree thank you David Roth so yes I just wanted to come come and since everybody was speaking about their experiment experience at lids I think it's very I I still feel confident that I was here in the golden era so what do I mean by golden era Emilio was my contemporary I'm sure he'll agree with me the golden eras you come in here I came in as a graduate student EEE CS I'm taking DSP with Ellen Oppenheim I'm taking six three four one we have Drake then later had the privilege to TA with Dimitri bertsekas using your booklets it cyclists I took non-linear systems with sunshine meter i think you were co-teaching and of course with my first ta nicola alia according to him it was the by best TA and I was taking multivariable control with Michael Athens and finally linear Systems Theory and robust control with Windsor I don't know if any of these legends teach anymore or teach these courses anymore so that's why I think it was well part of the reasons why I think it was a golden era was incredible another reason is when I was joined lids son Joyner was the director and I since then I still haven't seen a leader or a director of any type of Institute Center do the following which is what son joy did he would walk the halls this is building 35 I'm sure he did it in the second floor I think we were on the third or fourth floor we'd be like here he comes here he comes you know doors are open he walks the halls and it wasn't intimidating because all he wanted to do is stop you and ask what are you doing you know what are you working on right now and it was incredible I probably think you knew everybody's name and you probably knew what everybody was doing so that was that was a really unique experience and then finally I joined linzer's lab because I was very interested in controls and although I think you do know I had some passions outside of controls in particular neuroscience but I was doing what you told me like he would say okay take how to take dynamic programming every controls person take time okay I'll take dynamic programming then you move on okay you got a minor in math so start with real analysis okay topology okay I don't know if he knew this he ultimately found out but I was also taking introduction to neuroscience I was taking you know motor systems neurophysiology I was in the offices of your great neuroscience colleagues like Susan cork cork in who recently passed or few years ago passed away and I was indulging there as well and you mentioned independence and the freedom that Lidz provided well that's what was incredible because I did think you know I don't think you know this but at that same time I actually wear the pink coat and I was a volunteer at MGH in the ER because I wasn't sure I was interested in neuroscience memory diseases anyways finally graduated and the last thing I want to say about the lives experience it ended it with a with an interesting ending in my thesis two men so my thesis committee was son joy Sasha McCroskey who I haven't seen here today was he here yesterday and Windsor and I go through my defense and my thesis was purely control there's no neuroscience it was controller to communications constraint and I was kind of disappointed at the end and I mentioned to him like I don't know Sasha fell asleep and he goes he goes no that's a good thing that means there was nothing wrong with your problem formulation and nothing wrong with your solution and if you know Sasha you know exactly what what I mean by that so anyway so that was kind of my experience and then since then I really transitioned and transitioned here was immersion I went right into a neuro science laboratory and neuro and I where I learned neurophysiology and neuroscience for several years here at MIT with Emory Brown so here let's see so I'm I absolutely cannot talk about neuroscience as a whole you know if you go to the CDC you know conference on decision in control maybe there's about 3,000 people now I don't know in my days it was about 1,500 2,000 people at this annual meeting if you go to the annual meeting for Society for Neuroscience it's 30,000 people it can only occur in three one of three cities in the United States because there's no convention center that can accommodate this community so you can imagine the complexity of the field so I'm going to just touch on certain aspects that are irrelevant I think at least two lids so I'm gonna start with sort of what lids like people have been doing and contributing into neuroscience for the last 20 years and I'm gonna try to highlight an opportunity and where we can actually I think make big contributions okay so the first is what I call phenomenological modeling and what this is really about is not probing the brain but still trying to understand the underlying architecture in the brain that governs behavior so let me give you a specific example here in motor control right so we make all kinds of nice coordinated movements so if I want to study how does the brain actually compute so that I can make these smooth reaching motions what I can do is I have a behavioral neuroscientist just run an experiment where subjects are seek target cues maybe cues light up and you just move your arm to those targets and you actually capture the behavior you capture my motion my trajectories either in 2 or 3d space so you have this sort of input-output behavior you have a target going in and you have a trajectory coming out and then what people who train like us modelers we understand this as a feedback system right we move and as we're moving we get proprioceptive feedback we get visual feedback and we continue adjusting our movements and so what you can do as a modeler or in this case you can now say ok this feedback control system is an interconnection of subsystems each subsystem is some region in the brain ok and now if I put these dynamics in these subsystems I can match this input-output data and that might be somewhat trivial because if you look at these trajectories they look like responses of second order systems but what's challenging about that is I said understanding neural architecture which means each one of these boxes is in some brain region there are certain types of neurons in that brain region and if I say there's an integrator there because that's what matches my input-output data then there better be elements neuron ions that can process in a way be connected in a way such that it can integrate signals so that's the real big challenge is being neuroanatomic consistent and then being able to explain this is how we think we control movements the second is a another end of the spectrum which I call mechanistic modeling and actually interestingly it's the physicists that have moved into this field I wouldn't actually say Lidz type people do this but they do under a certain situation but essentially if you just build these mechanistic models what you're trying to do is be more realistic right neurons are these electrically excitable cells they have membranes you have charge you have ions going inside and outside these membranes with gates opening and closing and then you have these action potentials voltage potentials across the membrane and every now and then if you have enough of a perturbation whoops enough of a perturbation you'll get what's called an action potential this peak in voltage and these are sort of what we call spikes in the brain and these spikes move and transfer to other neurons and that's carries information so these models are really high dimensional nonlinear ordinary differential equations if you think the neuron is a point they're their PDEs if you want to keep the structure of a neuron and one neuron will have five to ten states and so you put a thousand neurons together and you're really in a ridiculous high dimensional space but wait they're useful in the sense of understanding mechanisms of action what happens when you have this disease and this what in the connectivity changes so they can explain a lot of things what more recently the controls people have been doing when they work with these types of models is bring in reduction you know they do model reduction techniques and now instead of having to simulate thousands of thousands of times to understand something they try to reduce it to some you know where they can still answer the question of interest and it's all done through analysis so avoiding all these math simulations and finally I think this is more of an engine the control engineers signal processing people come in because it's a very hot field called brain computer in from interface your brain machine interface type system so here's the idea here is you are you put electrodes inside the you record signals coming from the rain you do some in from signal processing and modeling to try to interpret the intent of the subject and then you take that interpretation and actuate a prosthetic device and the prosthetic device could be an arm and you have some visual feedback and you can and this can run in closed loop okay so that's pretty much what's been going on in the last 20 years but I think there's been a big unmet need or an opportunity where a Lidz type viewpoint can make a huge contribution and I'm gonna sort of lump this feel subfield as almost more basic traditional neuroscience so basic brain science if you asked what is a neuroscientist what's their purpose they're gonna say okay I just want to understand what brain region or network of regions controlled behavior what's their function that's the fundamental question that they're after and if you think about the past they used to probe the brain okay typically in mice or non-human primates they put electrode wires into the brain to record on the order of tens of neurons okay while that subject is executing some type of structured behavior so they'll put the electrode in say primary motor cortex while a subject or a monkey is making different kinds of movements they record the activity and their job is to relate the brain activity to the behavior okay and a big problem that they used to an encounter is the following i probe monkey one i record ten neurons for a monkey one moving up and down and this is an eye and I get some activity in some recordings I do exactly the same thing for monkey - and I same types of movements I hit the same region not necessarily the same population of neurons and I gather that data and and the traditional analysis is correlations let's correlate brain to behavior and what you are what you may not be surprised up because we are sparsely sampling this region ten neurons out of thousand good luck right you're gonna see very different response is across the monkeys so what did the neuroscientist do they still published papers right so what did they do they say this is the trend we see in 30% of our neurons okay all right so that's fundamentally it was a big problem okay present well we have fixed the sparse data to some degree in that we have new technology that can record from thousands of neurons in behaving subjects so that's good instead of tens I have thousands now we're sort of in this big data not really but some people claim biggish data and a lot of machine learning people have come into the neuroscience community a lot of and it's been a big deal in the sense that there's a lot of money due to the brain initiative and NIH has lots of money for new ideas and when you pair a neuroscientist up with somebody who says they're gonna do machine learning that seems very attractive the problem is they actually do a good job in capturing all the variability between subjects and even though the neural activity looks different in monkey one the monkey two they can build a deep enough network to capture all the inputs and outputs observed across the animals the problem is of course that does nothing for the neuroscientist in terms of understanding brain function okay that was the purpose that was that is what they're after so here's how I think where the opportunity is today and in the future we still get the data we have thousands of neurons but instead of trying to build these highly complex you know deep networks neural networks whatever why don't we simplify okay maybe we have thousands of neurons hundreds of neurons and we're trying to hit the target region so if I'm studying motor control okay if I'm studying movement the neuroscientist is gonna put electrodes in the motor areas of the brain in hopes of capturing all the relevant neurons okay but that doesn't mean that you capture everything because you all know when we make movements we can never make the same movement twice right and let's say you're playing basketball and you're shooting and you've got an audience and they're cheering for you you're more likely to maybe hit those baskets than that they were booing for you so it's not just the motor regions that command motions a lot of other factors play a role that the neuroscientists aren't even probing like how confident you feel whether you feel good or not whether you're motivated whether you care all of these are happening in other parts of the brain not the motor areas and yet somehow they're talking to your motor regions to change the way you move so how do you get that through dynamical models right in my experience simple linear models work okay so what do we mean by this let's just take a simple state space model okay I don't know if I have this is how about here we go simple state space model this is one example of how to do this right so the state is just the brain what do I mean by that it could be populations of neurons and their firing rates so let's say have a hundred populations and it's X is a hundred dimensional U is the stimulus right remember if say if it's this motor control experiment I'm flashing a light that tells me oh I need to move over there that's my stimulus I move over there the neurons respond there in my state whoops there in my state vector and I can now relate behavior to the states now what I'm not saying here is remember this is sort of brain some of those states can be measured they are right if they're in the motor areas but what about all those other factors that I just talked about well those are things you can capture because they're latent in to these state variables okay with some sort of intuition or knowledge of how these states evolve you can construct these kinds of a models and actually capture the variability the fact that you moved this way on trial one versus another way on trial two for the same input you can capture that through the dynamical state and then of course if you got these simpler models you can use them for control now what's really important if you think about that state space model is the type of inference as you can make what can you tell the neuroscientists at the end of the day if you can build a model like this you can tell a neuroscientist at any given time which regions which neural populations these are the different states right are playing more of a role during movement or during behavior at any given point in time you can also tell the neuroscientists whether they're interacting coupled or not or our neural populations within the same region more tightly coupled that all comes from the mount the model right and then at the end how is this changing behavior and this is incredible because these are exactly the fundamental questions that they're after so I think there's a huge opportunity for that all right so clearly finally I understood the John's wisdom autonomous cars the managing aerial traffic to optical networks to finance to the G's and finally the brain so this is extremely exciting for all of us I have a bunch of questions that I have prepared but I'm also looking at the clock and I don't want to take away all the time so first I'm going to open this up to the audience and if the time permits I will ask questions well he is going to be difficult but I'm pretty sure my panel is very well probation optical communication finance where are these communication neuroscience and AV so I think control theory has played important roles and the real contributions in a future problem perspective however exact difference all these field less competitive in terms of participating agents for example under contrast in biomedical field like a cancer and infectious disease the cancer stem cell and the pathogens are self involved agents so in this case how much control theory or information theory can contribute to this competitive you favored to manage the cancer treatment or under control so I think if I understand so with an example you gave okay I'll interpret this this cancer analogy so you said a cancerous cell or versus some other so so let me give you an idea where maybe control might work in a similar setting right so when we when we develop I'll talk about the brain when we actually develop stels have no specificity at birth right order in the womb you start off with a bunch of cells millions billions of cells that divide then ultimately specialize these become liver these become this this is going to go to brain right and then in the brain they start specializing okay this can be hind brain this is gonna be this structure this structure this structure and so the biomedical scientists actually try to understand all the interactions that happen to have to happen chemically and physically for cells to move and specialize now sometimes things go wrong right at birth you might have a defect where the the cell doesn't even develop so you can imagine if you can understand the steps and processes you can inject a stem cell and control how it behaves with its environment right your feedback and so forth to make it develop normally there's one I don't know does that get it at least biology [Laughter] so on the neuroscience I think there's in deep brain stimulation and basically broader aspects of using closed-loop control to stimulate nerves and stimulate the brain where we don't understand for example why the deep brain stimulation I was having a conversation with said you know what I find interesting is we have no models for the brain so that's why we can't build the control systems well but we're building them and they work anyway so I guess the question but not all the time we don't know why so the question is to me neuroscience is a fascinating and important area to apply seven years really focus on so so when there are models out there that are mechanistic okay and so detailed that they contain thousands of neurons and all the structures in what we call the motor control circuit that's affected by including basal ganglia that affects Parkinson's disease now you cannot use those models for prediction for real-time control as you said but what people are doing now because and these are controls people is they're taking these detailed models and treating it as a virtual brain and then simulating and looking at population level activity and then applying simple linear models linear time varying whatever but there's much simpler models describing phenomena and more of a population level and there are publications and research out there that show model-based control feedback control the thing is the trick is actually implementing it's not necessarily Hardware Medtronic has this closed loop hardware but it's the idea that okay if you put it through this is an optimal controller I designed it's not clear that the device can generate that stimulation signal whether it's ten because usually these are pulses you know periodic a periodic the controller's spitting out continuous unless you constrain it or it may not be safe to for the brain depending on what you're trying to do so the models are out there is just not ready to translate so for example diabetes there's you can measure injection but what your reading or your physical activity the soft data that we don't necessarily know how to model in control systems plays a role as well and I think that applies to finance it applies to some of the applications that are interesting for 5g so so how do we take kind of these mathematical models and the very rigorous mathematics that we've applied to them and bring in soft data and and interpret data or control I'm moderating so I'm definitely not taking so let me just that so what do you mean by soft data so there and what you're trying to do within some boundary and that's what the closed-loop diabetes systems are doing but what you're eating and when you're eating and whether you're exercising or not and even some of the things you were talking about these outside stimulus do you feel that or not has an impact on you know how much you should be injecting and there isn't a good understanding of how to take the hard data which is what is your actual you know finger prick amount of sugar in your blood with these other things and and so I think it is related to the question you asked about you know what somebody's cheering for you we're booing for you how does that affect so so what I mean by soft it is is data that we don't understand its impact on this system but we know it hasn't it right so where's Rosa Rosa Peggy I put a shout out to her work so yeah so think of the case you said exercising or maybe things will be different if you're under stress like cognitive stress or something so people are and wrote this as part of Rosa's program is you know can I have a wearable device you know that you know that just measures say my sweat levels and then from that used models to estimate the underlying cognitive stress that's your state and then you build a model of state with the actual explicit measurements the hard data I guess what you're talking about to refine your model to capture sort of those variations based on various levels of stress or exercise and so so it I think it's the I think this is what's happening now other questions man-made systems you know I'm not sure whether at this point we can really control or you know maybe if we are within a band or euro some trends that's all what we can hope for and we should be sort of slow it down and bring it back down right the discussion any other question because I have a pressing question if you don't ask I'm going to go to my question thank you that was I was asking for that right so I'm gonna ask this question both for myself and the student sitting here in the audience each of you clearly at some point started from learning the toolbox let's call it late style education at no matter what background you came from and then you thought about the transition a transition in your own respective fields how did you decide that there was a right thing to do and how did you go about it because at some level it's about moving out of your comfort zone right and I mean there are lots of implications that go with that in academia evaluations sort of real-life sort of where you end up and so on and so forth so it's very crucial questions how did you guys made that decision I would encourage all panelists to take that question yeah please yes that actually have a little anecdote of you know what happened to me is that what they called a five minute phone call that you know changed my life at some point some of you may know the MIT has this big collaboration with Singapore and at some point I heard that there was a team forming for like a future urban mobility a new project and I wanted him so I called the person who was organizing the whole thing I told her about my interest and sure yeah okay you know thank you for interest but you know what do you bring to a table well I work on self-driving cars yeah but you understand this is a project on urban mobility not a project on robotics put on the spot I had to come up with something what if you had like a smartphone at that point was not even smartphones it was like a blackberry or something and which you can call a car and then the robotic car comes and picks you up and bring you to your destination at the time uber did not exist right and then she writes oh and then I started the whole thing now what happened to me at that point I just made that up because I want to go to Singapore so then I started asking okay so I want to build this submarine cars but what what is really the point how would this technology really change you know have an impact and then you start thinking more about that and then you Circe well actually there is something here then I actually I started you know doing a lot of work in that area as a professor I was giving lectures to everybody and everybody was tenia you know that the stupid will never work all the car companies or what do we want to do that I want to sell more cars I don't want to sell fewer so at some point I you know I believed in it so much and nobody listening and then insuperable you know what the heck I'm just gonna do it myself right so in a sense there was this dis transition of started thinking about why am i doing this work and then looking at what is the potential try to have an impact and then if you can't at some point you just believe in it so much that you know the reason my case I you know started doing on my own or anyone I mean I'll say I don't know I'd say you know it's it's not easy to make that decision you know and I remember it being very difficult at the time for me it was partly following the field so it was a natural progression in that you know WDM links were out there then and Steve Alexander had left Lincoln where I was and joined Siena and if links were there then networks were gonna come later was the thought and I had a belief that at least in my area when the commercial world was taking it the the pace at which it was going that you know research whether it was a Lincoln or academia really wasn't going to be the place to be it was just too hard for research to follow especially in an area where the components that were available were so important so I had decided to either go in commercial in this area an optical networking or to switch research fields right and and I just decided to to do that I actually I had a commercial offer too so I don't know between the commercial and starting your own that seemed more important I mean that seemed more interesting but also my co-founders Eric Swanson industrious manly without them you know wouldn't have felt really right and certainly with me it would have been a disaster alone so it was just a lot of things that at the right time and you know the willingness to take risk to because it's it it wasn't an easy decision at the time maybe I could just make so at the time that I joined Flareon actually there were two startups spinning out of Bell Labs and one of them was the Clarion and the other one was actually the holographic data storage project well they were both spinning out and they're both pretty interesting from a technological standpoint I think Eric the reasons why I chose Flareon one was just I mean I think also from a risk perspective both were pretty risky I part of it was maybe just you know the team that you were gonna go with you have to have confidence if you can especially going to go into an entrepreneurial setting you have to have a good team you have to have a lot of confidence in the team in and the other thing was just where did I think I could bring the most value and they both needed the expertise but on them on there on the wilder side I felt it was more opportunity for growth and more more things to do where my skill set would fit so I think you want to you know is you want to go into a situation where you can branch out I think the panics are more attractive I was sort of lucky to have Lee Jong involved in the following sense they encouraged me to do a different type of internship every time so I worked at a research lab at industrial under industry kind of job and summer intern and then my last one was a TV show as a summer intern I really liked it I thought wow I can use all the theory I have learned play with real data and actually make impact that could be affecting the real world in you know one sometimes or weeks or much faster than the other side cause I had seen in my internships so that was really fun and I thought I can I can try it for a while and if I don't like it I can maybe do something else maybe come back to information or something so this was fun and I guess the second transition was working from our employer to starting our own venture that was more of a decision because we really wanted to work together my co-founder and it seemed like a good time to take risk worst case you can always get back some sort of job so that was the second transition I think you know you said there were sort of him we all have two hats right so one is the map is beautiful but if you were a little bit of an engineering hat and I think seeing something it is hard but actually seeing something out there the real world it's its own you know reward right so I think to a large extent that's what I think made me take the transition I should say though for the kind of problems that lids you know people here work on and the theory there's this notion in you know of the Garbage Pail theory especially when it comes to policy makers and governments which is you know the the theory that you come up with or a solution you come up with is beautiful but you give it to somebody who's a decision maker and they're gonna throw it in the garbage pail but the first time something goes wrong they're gonna reach in right and pick the first thing in the garbage bailout that's going to become practice so I think to some extent as researchers we actually owe society we we need to keep the garbage pail full of good ideas that can become practice so that you know we then don't regret the ideas that actually go there excellent thank you yes of course I'll try to be brief yeah no I mean I think for me it was just the the questions I was most passionate about answering in my life so in my research career at least I mean I think with munzur we talked about communication constraints if I put this in feedback its constrained by this you know what are conditions on stability okay it's rewarding in that okay there could be some mathematical challenges you do some theory prove some theorems and you get some confidence okay so that's great and I was interested you know and still am interested but then if you contrast that for me at least saying okay what does deep brain stimulation do and you put this wire in the brain and you dump all this current and now a person can go from not walking to walking that's the question I wanted to answer was it scary absolutely all my colleagues were saying I even had one say you jump ship what are you doing but I didn't because everything I do today I use my lids training and I think it what was most important is that no none of my mentors said anything negative about that decision it was really I think that was important I think I was impressionable if somebody said if either MIT or Sasha or linzer's at anything like three that's too much then I would have questioned it but yeah then you have to be a little bit take risk thank you I think unless there's a pressing question on that high note I would like to sort of end the panel thank all our panelists please don't go there is a important remarks that jon is going to give as a closing remark some point you'd ever add I'm not going to say anything deep for that important I think I already start feeling the withdrawal symptoms that are going to be coming to me in just a few hours because this is going being going so great I feel could easily have enjoyed it another day of this it has all been so stimulating fascinating I'm even thinking I would like to go back and be a graduate student again and join this great group of people and get inspired well to partially mitigate withdrawal symptoms tomorrow we have we're showing the Sun on movie and the filmmaker of the movie is going to be present and we'll have a panel where Andrea and Bob will be will be joining so please join in that so I would like now to take the opportunity to thank most important of all our distinguished honorees who actually honored us with their presence here I want to thank all the speakers and panelists and the chairs they were really all very stimulating very interesting I think everybody I believe everybody is going to leave with the same positive feeling that I will be leaving this event and thank you all for being here and joining us so we'll have a sort of very informal light reception out there for people to mingle for as long as they wish and before you exit the room like to ask at least those of us who are still here - all of us crowd down here to get a group photograph all right thank you [Applause]
