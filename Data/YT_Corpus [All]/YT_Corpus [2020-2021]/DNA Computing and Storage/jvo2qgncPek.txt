 are you considering DreamHost as your hosting provider let's find out if it will be a good fit for your site I'll walk you through its pros and cons and we'll have a look at what to expect from its performance welcome to websitetooltester.com where we help you launch your website founded in LA in 1996 DreamHost has been around forever since then it's become a really popular host powering more than 1.5 million sites and claiming to have 400,000 happy customers but let's find out if it's for you too in this video I'll be looking at dream hosts affordable shared plans be aware though that it offers higher performing products to its shared hosting packages are simple as they only have two tiers the shared starter plan which is suitable for those looking to host only one website and don't need more than 50 gigabytes of storage bear in mind that email storage isn't included in this plan you will need to pay for it separately if you need it the shared unlimited package comes with unmetered storage web sites and email pretty generous all plans allow for unlimited traffic come with free SSL Certificates 24 hours support and a free domain name for a whole year be aware that DreamHost offers large discounts when committing for one or even three years but if you wanted you could also pay monthly it's up to you as you can see dream hosts back-end is minimalistic and well designed a breath of fresh air when compared to other providers personally I find it easy to use thanks to its intuitive system and this handy side menu that gives me quick access to everything I need even if the dream host system looks simple it still has some powerful features for example I love that you can give access and define roles for other users meaning that I don't need to share my login and password with colleagues let me show you a couple of DreamHost peculiarities like most hosting providers these days it comes with 1-click installs but only for a couple of CMS's like WordPress or Joomla if you're planning to use a different CMS like Magento or Drupal you'll have to install them manually let's install WordPress so you can see the process just click here and decide where to install WordPress after a couple of minutes your website will be up and running and you'll get a confirmation email with the site's information DreamHost has a solution which will make the WordPress setup process easier if you're a beginner for example it comes with several plugins free themes and security improvements not a bad add-on DreamHost keeps daily backups of your websites for about two weeks so you can always contact them if you have an emergency on top of that from the backup section you can create temporary backups to download sadly there isn't a more advanced on demand backup system integrated in but you could buy it as an affordable extra via it's dream object cloud storage as one would expect DreamHost takes security seriously all its hosting plans come with free ssl certificates via let's encrypt and the domains you register with it will always come with domain privacy enabled for free its servers support HTTP 2 which is encrypted by default additionally it has firewalls in place it also uses the latest version of PHP to avoid using unsafe code on top of that enabling multi-factor authentication will add an extra layer of security to your account you won't be able to log into your dream host account without your smartphone at websitetooltester.com we run a lot of tests for several hosting providers DreamHost included so I have a pretty clear idea about its performance spoiler alert it's very good let me show you unlike similar shared hosting providers DreamHost doesn't neglect its uptime we monitor several DreamHost sites in the uptime has always been higher than 99.95% impressive but of course you also want to know how good dream hosts speed is truth to be told it's speed surprised me in my first performance too even the entry-level shared hosting plan has decent speed as you can see here our test page is loaded in less than three seconds to push it speed further it uses a combination of hardware and software for example it uses SSD drives HTTP 2 and PHP 7 for faster websites note that they only have servers in the US which may not be ideal if your website's main audience is outside North America however it does provide other hosting plans with CDN services included to solve this dream host support is available via live chat in a ticketing system powered by email I always prefer contacting them via chat but that's just my preference in my experience support agents were friendly and helped me solve my issues the waiting times weren't too long either so that's all but let me summarize the main pros and cons on the bright side the performance is great both for uptime and speed the support is fast and helpful and its dashboard is easy to use and good for managing users however its servers are exclusively located in the US it's missing some 1-click installs like Drupal and doesn't integrate advanced backup functionality for free I hope you found this DreamHost review useful and please leave a comment if you still have any questions [Music] [Applause]
