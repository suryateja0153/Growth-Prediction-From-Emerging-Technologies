 [Music] hey guys welcome back nakazi here in today's video i'm gonna discuss section one part two of the ccna exam the first thing i'm gonna talk about is network architectures lan architecture and when architecture in particular i'm going to give you the cisco hardware portfolio overview of the switches and routers so you get to learn how to pick the right type of switches for your environment and right type of routers and whether or not sd-wan is the way to go or non-sd-wan we'll discuss some of those details i've also done separate videos on the topic of sd-wan so you can watch my sd-wan playlist there this is going to be an exciting video guys i can't wait to share so without further ado let's roll welcome to ccna 200-301 course today we're going to look at section 1 part 2. we're still dealing with network fundamentals but what's different is that we're now looking at network architectures and basics of cisco cli here are the topics i plan covering today first we'll look at network architectures and two particular type of network architectures in particular lan architecture and when architecture and finally we look at basics of cisco cli let's jump right in from a lan architecture perspective we have the infamous three-tier campus network design and what we have in this architecture is we got these access layer switches that have the pcs plugged in uh laptops we could have servers plugged in here different devices we could also have a voiceover ip phone plugged in to the switch directly so these are the end devices here at the access layer that needs to be connected to the network taking a step back here a switch is a very important device when it comes to building a network that's one of the most fundamental components you need to start building a network and access layer provides access to the different endpoints like i said right so we got end points that are connected to the access layer switches what ends up happening next is that we have distribution layer switches and in distribution layer these are basically aggregation switches that are taking a bunch of connections from the access layer switches and combining them into a distribution layer also called aggregation layer and here the idea is that we got all these different connections coming from the end points it becomes a point of consolidation it handles all the different links that are coming from the access layer switches and in particular we call these links that are going up and getting plugged into the distribution layer switches from the access layer uplinks they're very conveniently named uplinks all the links that are facing the clients and the endpoints these are called downlinks okay so this is an important terminology to understand when somebody says where's the problem downlink or an uplink immediately you should have you should get this picture in your head as you're troubleshooting a picture where you understand that the downlink means the the ports that are facing the end points and the uplinks mean interfaces that are facing the switches upstream and finally we have a core layer and the whole reason we have a core layer in our network is to consolidate a bunch of distribution layer switches so this comes into play this type of model a three-tier campus model is suited for large enterprises you're looking at fortune 500 companies possibly up to fortune 5 000 but these are gigantic large corporations with a ton of locations and what you end up doing is you take a bunch of different buildings and you consolidate them together and interconnect them together and core layer is what connects those different buildings together so for example in building one you may you'll have distribution layer switches in building one and then you have building two that has its own distribution layer then you have building three that has its own distribution layer such as building four same thing and so on and so forth well how do you connect all of these distribution layer switches together one way would be to actually interconnect them all in a full mesh and full mesh gets really really ugly really quickly you wouldn't want to do that instead what you do is you have these distribution layer switches and we end up using one of the buildings as the primary building so let's say building one might become the core of our network and this is where we would install core switches and all of the distribution switches from different buildings would physically run their cables and get plugged into the core into building one and that's why we need this three-tier hierarchical architecture and another reason we need hierarchy is because it's easier to troubleshoot it's easier to design our network plus it's easier to make purchasing decisions when you're looking at buying access layer switches versus distribution layer switches or core layer switches each layer serves a different purpose so it makes your choice as an end user a lot easier to decide how to plug different switches into each layer so it makes it like a lego block type approach where you just fit the different blocks into the different layers for its own purpose next let's look at the two-tier network design in this model what we have is we got these end points at the bottom our phones pcs laptops ip phones and all that they're all connected here at the bottom directly into the access layer switches and then we got it collapsed we call this a collapsed core yeah or we can call it a core slash distribution layer so here we don't necessarily need a separate core layer and where this comes into place if it's a small to medium sized business where you don't have a lot of locations let's say you started a brand new business and you got building one and a few months later you got building two your network is not that large you can get away with just having a bunch of distribution layer switches interconnected together in both buildings it isn't until you start adding more buildings and your network grows to a certain point that you would actually even consider looking at adding core switches and next i would like for you to look at the modular campus network design this is taking the access and distribution and core so here the picture is flipped so we got the access switches all the way up at the top this is where the end points are plugged in right then we got a bunch of these links coming from the access switches into the distribution for aggregation right so that's our aggregation point and from there we further consolidate and interconnect into the core and the whole ideas core is where you would have your wide area connection for example at the bottom as you can see or you can have your data center connected or internet and you might say well whoa whoa what is what is this well up at the top you got our standard campus design right access distribution core at the bottom we got access distribution and core for interconnecting different services for example these endpoints that you have plugged in so if i'm a user up at the top let's say if i'm bob and i've got a desktop that's plugged into one of these switches well what does bob need to do to do his job well bob would need to connect to either wide area network to access some applications or perhaps maybe a some server that's sitting in a data center plugged into let's say one of these switches at the bottom here or bob may need to access the internet you know maybe google something or whatever right or maybe watch cat videos on youtube uh if bob has nothing better to do right um it's all possible because of this architecture so bob would interconnect to the access access would interconnect him to the distribution distribution will connect them to the core cores where the internet is plugged in uh through its own access distribution and core and then finally it will allow access to bob and this is how the traffic flow may look like traffic flow might take a different path but for simplicity reasons let's say this is the path that traffic took to allow bob access to the internet so this is what's called a modular campus design we have these modules that we use to allow access to our end users because ultimately the network is exists for what reason the entire reason for setting up a network is to allow users access to different applications so they can do their job efficiently and effectively that's why we build networks and as network engineers we're concerned with how all the different network devices interconnect with each other and allow the traffic to flow through and that's our job now next i would like to give you a quick review of the cisco campus switching hardware portfolio but before i take you to cisco's website a couple of things i want to bring to your attention there are three main types of switches you got the fixed configuration switches you got the modular configuration switches and then you got the stackable configuration switches and i'm gonna go through each type on cisco's website a couple of things to consider before you make a purchasing decision you need to think about how many ports you need you also need to think about are you buying switches for your access layer or distribution layer or core layer or are you buying switches for the entire network if it's you if it's a brand new location and a brand new site maybe you need switches for all three layers or maybe you're a brand new business and all you need to do is just have two layers instead of three tier architecture you could do that too but these are the things you just have to consider you have to think about the port density how many ports do you need a 24 port switch or a 48 port switch what do you need switch throughput what kind of throughput do you want a line rate throughput line rate throughput would mean that if you have a 24 port switch in each port happens to be one gig that's one gig times 24 that's 24 gig so that means that you need a switch that has the ability to operate at a full 24 gig there is no contention ratio meaning there is no bottleneck each port is able to access at a line rate typically that's not the case you don't in campus environment you don't need switches because those end up becoming really expensive switches when you want to get wire speed switches they end up becoming very expensive typically in a data center environment is where you would want switches that have no contention ratio in campus environments you're gonna have eight to one type ratio is very common four to one uh 16 to one type of ratio you can see stuff like that the next thing you need to consider is poe or power over ethernet and this is important because it just depends how many voice over ip phones you have in your environment so if you're going to have a lot of voice phones or sip phones you're gonna need poe power over ethernet meaning you don't you know those switches get their power from the ethernet cable you don't have to plug them in separately into using this external power supply instead the ethernet port that's plugged into this the phone powers it up um versus non-poe so we also call that data port so data port versus voice port you need to define how many ports you need plus you need to decide whether you need a copper switch or fiber switch once again in a campus environment copper switch is very common you may need a couple of fiber switches to connect the different floors together for example you also need to consider power do you need redundant power do you need a switch that has multiple power supplies in it and finally scalability does your switch allow you to grow as your environment grows or are you stuck with that switch meaning if you get a fixed configuration switch as i alluded earlier and if it's only 24 ports and you got 24 users on that floor you're done the minute you hire a 25th person now you need a new switch to be installed on that floor so something to think about and that's what i mean by scalability now without further ado let me take you to cisco's website so we can do a deep dive so what we'll do is we'll go to cisco.com so we go to products networking switches once we come to this page what we want to do next is we want to scroll down and you want to get to a point where it says view all cisco switches click on that link and you will be absolutely blown away when you look at this especially if you're brand new to networking and you haven't really worked with switches before and let me explain what i mean so look at how many different categories of switches you got blitz which is campus lan data center industrial ethernet infiniband land network management blah blah blah i don't want you to get overwhelmed the only type of searches you want to pay attention to are these switches right here campus lan access you want to look at campus lan core and distribution and that's it these are the only two type of searches i want you to be concerned with later on in the course you can also look at data center searches but right now i don't want you to get overwhelmed let's focus in on campus land switches and the core and distribution stitches that said now let's go ahead and click on the access switches now here are the different categories of access switches what i want you to pay attention to is cisco released their catalyst 9k or the 9000 series a couple of years ago and this is the series that cisco has been pushing the most lately so if you're in the market looking to purchase switches this is the series you need to be focused on you need to be looking at catalyst 9200 9300 and 9400 switches for your campus access and these 9400 switches could also be potentially used as your distribution slash core collapsed as well and i'll i'll tell you more about it in a moment and if we were to look at the campus land core switches right here you'll see we got the catalyst 9600 it's a fairly new series it's it's uh it was launched a couple of months ago catalyst 9500 don't worry about the 6800 cisco is eventually going to sunset the 6800 platform 6500s have been around forever so so forget about that and some of these other switches are kind of going away as well you you primarily need to focus on the cisco catalyst nine case line or the 9000 series that's what you need to be focused on now let me uh take you to the 9200 series let's take a look at that as you can see here these are fixed switches and look at the let's look at the different models that they offer what i would suggest is every time you look at a switch the best way to learn more about it is you look at their data sheet and cisco does an amazing job with their data sheets i really like their data sheets they do a really good job so it will tell you how many ports maximum what type of capabilities whether or not you have redundant power supplies or not redundant fans whether or not you have different additional capabilities layer 3 and whatnot and what type of throughput overall whether or not these switches are stackable or not as i mentioned we have three different types of switches we got the fixed switches we got the modular switches and we got the stackable switches now these 9200 series switches they fit two categories they fit the fixed switches category and they also fit the category of stackable switches and let me show you here you can see if you continue scrolling down you can see how many ports how many downlinks like i said and uplink um so it kind of shows you what type of capacity you got and you got the modular uplink models meaning you have the ability to install uplink modules yourself and you can pick different types of configuration or you can purchase switches that have fixed uplink modules in them and these are the network modules i'm referring to the ones that have the ability for you to install you pick one of these like for example four by one gig you can do four by ten gig four by ten gig means four interfaces of 10 gig each four by one means four interfaces of one gig each so on and so forth and these switches have redundant power supplies in them as you can see each power supply has a single power cord connection coming out of it so you need to make sure that you have redundant pdus or power distribution units that these switches are going to get plugged into and the modularity means that you have the ability to be able to pull slide different modules out and slide them back in also these switches have the ability to be stacked so that means the maximum number of switches that you can stack together are eight and let me show you a picture of a stacking configuration so here's a picture so basically this is the back side of these catalyst 9200 switches and what we're looking at are these stacking cables and and see how they're connected together right and what that means is in this picture we're seeing four switches being stacked together while these stacking cables even though physically they're four separate switches but we need when you use stacking cables what it does is it makes them appear as a single switch instead of four different switches so one of these is going to become primary when you stack them up like that let's say the first one here becomes a primary switch when you log into it via cli and we'll talk more about cli in a moment command line interface what ends up happening is you see if each of these has 24 ports 24 times 4 is 96 ports right so what you're going to see in cli is like literally you're going to see as if you have a single switch with 96 ports on it instead of four different switches or 24 ports each so it's really unique it's really interesting makes a lot easier for you to configure also the control plane combines so it that makes it really really interesting it makes the configuration a lot easier you can take advantage of redundant links operating in active active fashion things of that nature so that was the overview of 9200 series now let's go and take a look at the 9300 series it's very similar to the 9200 series and let's go ahead and take a look at the data sheet of the catalyst 9300. these are the next class of switches 9200 are the most basic bare bone switches you can get whereas 9 300 have a lot more horsepower and much better overall throughput they're also stackable switches by the way and very similar configuration 24 port 48 port you got data only switches you got poe plus switches or upo universal power over ethernet these suck up more power so you'll see you know stronger bigger better power supplies on these compared to the ones that are just poe plus for example we'll talk more about poe later in the course and once again you got the modular uplink capability and then you got the fixed uplink capability um and you got all these different modules you can get power supplies once again you have redundant power supplies you got redundant fans so you have a lot of redundancy there in case if one of the power supplies failed the other power supply has the ability to completely take over and become the primary power supply so you continue to run operations even if you had your switch had experienced a single power supply failure that's pretty much it for the 9300 and now let's quickly take a look at the 9400 because this is a very interesting series because this is a cross between distribution slash core so let's look at quickly look at the data sheet here and these are modular switches by the way and modular switches are chassis based and you'll see what i'm talking about when the picture shows up but these switches as you can see they take up a lot more rack units instead of you know like a 1u or 2u these are much larger in size by the way there's a couple of other things you want to think about when it comes to modular switches and that has to do with the fact that modular switches require line cards and line cards are essentially the interfaces that you need right so an example of a line card would be here's an example of a line card you got this line card that is all rj45 and you have the ability to plug in copper port so this is a copper line card you this right here is a fiber line card you can plug in fiber connections in here and this is how it would look like once you plug in all of your line cards and soup modules now another thing i want you to understand and keep in mind is that on these modular switches you need line cards that provide interfaces and you need supervisor engine modules and these soup modules are also called soup modules these soup modules are the ones that are the brains of the entire switch without it switch is just a shell you need the supervisor module that has the cpu memory and all that it you know is the brains of the entire solution and it operates and it it runs the switch the reason you have two is for high availability and redundancy only one is active at a time when the primary fails the secondary supervisor engine takes over now coming back to the slots the 9404 chassis even though it has four slots you can only put two line cards in it because there are two dedicated slots for the supervisor engine same thing for 9407. here you have seven slots available but you can only use five for the line cards and two for suit module and then the 9410 once again you have two slots that are dedicated to the soup module and you can put you can insert eight line cards in this particular chassis and a lot of it's it's becoming customers new favorite switch a lot of the customers i do are replacing their old catalyst 6500s with these 9400 series switches depending on how many modules they need and you also got this 9600 series that was just recently announced a couple of months ago here's the cat die 600 switch currently it's only available in one configuration option and that's 9606 that's the only option that's available today most likely they will cisco will add additional options but right now that's all you got but it's a very very powerful switch in the catalyst 9k family this happens to have the highest capabilities like if you look at up to 9.6 terabit per second in a wire switching capacity with 3 billion packets per second i mean this switch is a monster right up to 48 non-blocking 100 gig ethernet qsfp28 ports like i said this thing is an absolute monster for being a campus class switch it's almost a data center class switch in my opinion in terms of the capabilities offers but it does have a lot of campus type capabilities and that's why it's positioned as a campus core switch and it's all about wire speed packets come in packets go out and that's the whole purpose of the core switch thanks for sticking around by the way there's a lot more to this video than what you have seen in order to watch the entire video you're gonna have to be a little patient because i'm working on designing an entire ccna course i'm gonna do an official launch in the next couple of months but until then i'm gonna keep putting little nuggets of the ccna exam out there on my youtube channel until the course is ready to be published hope you enjoyed today's video if you did give me a thumbs up hit subscribe and i'll see you in the next video
