 hi everyone my name is Eli Schilling director of product management with Oracle cloud and I'm here to welcome you to a video series we are calling networking in the cloud through the next series of videos we're gonna be talking through various components of networking security and design in the Oracle cloud to get things started we're gonna focus on the most fundamental component which is the virtual cloud network now the virtual cloud network is a software-defined network that you create in the Oracle cloud that is completely isolated independent and separate from every other network construct to understand how the vcn deployment works we first have to take a look at the proximity or the locality of where we would provision a vcn or virtual cloud network so what we're gonna do is go ahead and bring in this world map and what you'll see here as we draw across the screen a listing of many of our cloud regions available around the world now this is just a short set we have a total of 21 regions today with the goal of 36 by the end of 2020 but what you'll find in a region is a collection of infrastructure and services that are completely independent and segmented from every other region around the world now these regions are also interconnected but you can think about these as a place to deploy sets of infrastructure and sets of services for your application ecosystem alright we're gonna go ahead and move that map off the screen and we want to start by building our first virtual cloud network so if we just do a little like that now you can see we have our virtual cloud Network it's contained within a selected region here and the first thing we do when we set up our virtual cloud network is to define a Sider range or an IP range these are contiguous ipv4 IP addresses that will be used with this software-defined network for the sake of this video series we're just going to use 10 1000 / 16 that means that 10.10 is the network address and then we have 0.0 all of the addressable space within our virtual cloud network now the next piece once we have this vcn is we can segment or we can subdivide into what we call subnets so we're just gonna tap tap tap tap that's going to give us four different subnets within our virtual cloud network you'll see each of these subnets has its own cider range its own block of IP addresses which is contained within the overarching range of the DCN itself now you're probably wondering why one of these subnets is a little bit bigger than the other subnets on the screen here well to really drill into this what we're gonna do is talk about availability domains because several of our global regions have multiple availability domains or individual independent physical data centers so if we just go ahead and draw onto the screen here those availability domain representations you'll see that some of these subnets exist in a single ad whereas this subject across the top actually spans all of the availability domains in the given region so the key difference here is regional subnet versus availability domain specific subnet now within the subnets your IP addresses your private IP addresses are portable between resources that means with a regional subnet if I have a cluster of compute resources and I need to failover from one to the other those private IP addresses are actually portable between availability domains between physical locations in this particular region now the final piece to keep in mind when it comes to subnets is the notion of public subnets versus private subnets the key difference here is that private subnets are going to be more tightly controlled and designed in a way to limit your ability to connect directly to or directly from the internet this is a security control which also prevents accidental exposure of resources stored in private subnets now the public subnet just like it sounds it's designed to allow you to configure direct internet access to and from these resources in the designated public subnets we're gonna go and take this now and just move it up to the corner of the screen we're gonna wrap up this conversation on the basics of vcn and subnetting and in the next video we're gonna get into the different mechanisms or gateways that we would use to communicate out from or into our virtual cloud network thanks for joining come back and watch the next video thank you [Music]
