 my name is Henson Park I'm the co-founder and CEO of catalogue we're an early-stage startup company using DNA to store digital information I went to college in Korea and then I spent two years as part of a mandatory military service then after that I graduated from college and came to University of Wisconsin to do a microbiology PhD and soon after a complete of the degree I came to the Boston to MIT to pursue a postdoctoral research position here in the lab of Professor Timothy Luce and in the lab behind met my co-founder neighbor cat was finishing up his degree PhD in biophysics so I've always been interested in startups especially something that revolves around my research as a PhD student and as well as a postdoctoral researcher here at MIT so to pursue those kinds of thoughts I participated in programs like the the Wisconsin entrepreneurial boot camp at at Wisconsin as well as the starttime IT program here in NMIT as a postdoc and those programs really helped prepare me to look out for really three things to come together a co-founder an idea and the funding to be able to go out and start a company and those really came together when I met my co-founder and we applied to an incubator in San Francisco to get the funding that we needed so my co-founder and I had were discussing a lot of different ideas about what could constitute a great idea - for a biotech company and he had been researching a class of enzymes that work on DNA to change their state so there would be these class of enzymes called recombinases that recognized a specific sequence within a longer piece of DNA and come in and either flip that around oryx ice it from the longer piece of so that's a way to change the state of a DNA molecule and if you think about it it's a way to store arbitrary information using those different states of FDA molecules so we thought this could be a way to store digital information in in DNA if we if we take out those molecules from a cell and those enzymes and we work with them in test tubes instead of instead of inside of a cell and so it was a way for us to store information in DNA without having to synthesize new DNA because we would make these strands of DNA that contains these recognition sites before we record the information in it you
