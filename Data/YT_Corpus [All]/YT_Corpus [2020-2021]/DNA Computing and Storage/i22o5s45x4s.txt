 so first of all thank you to the C and en team for creating this wonderful event I have to say they're the most dedicated team I've ever worked with because they've asked me for more pictures than I ever took in my life so I'll be asking you for pictures and in the future now as you may gather I'm actually a theorist by training I will not take you through a theory talk today I guarantee you half of you will leave so I won't do that today what I will tell you about is a new paradigm that my lab in crap in collaboration with some some very excellent engineers at Brown have been thinking about which is how can we use molecules to serve as a computer so the way we've been thinking about this is by thinking about putting small molecules in a solution and using the identity of those molecules to store information and also to perform different computational operations so today I'll talk a little bit about that now my motivation for this is actually the Fujitsu FA comm 655 line printer from about the late 1970s or early eighties and so this printer sat in my basement for quite some time my father was the conventional computer geek and he was one of the first people to get into the sort of the confluence between computation and transit way back when so if you know the easy pass he was one of the founders of easy pass and so he used it because it was incredibly compact but when I remember it for something very different it was a totally awesome hiding place so this was me at about five years old and and I used to frequently hide in here and in fact all the kids from from my block would come and if they weren't playing stickball on the street and and come in our basement turn out the lights off and we'd all you know sort of hide in our different places and in these printers and so it was that compact back then that in fact I could actually hide in it but we can even go to to worse situations so I should say this was the rest of my basement until about five years ago we can go to worse situations and so here's my grandfather my grandfather was one of the original mathematicians who worked on the UNIVAC and actually programmed it to predict the 1952 election and needless to say of course the UNIVAC took up even more space than that right it was super compact for 1952 which meant the entire room was basically Philips why I'm pointing these things out to you today is because of the fact that you should remember that there's been an exponential growth in in computation so just looking at the compactness of all of those different devices you can see that we're on an exponential trend and of course that exponential trend has allowed us to realize many of the benefits of modern day technology in modern day society and so right now we're almost at the point we're approaching the number of computations that we can perform being similar to that of different types of animal brains and so you know I'm not going to go into this I'd love to talk to you about that but you know you can imagine what what will go on here but the key point is that this exponential increase has really been feeding all the different things that have been evolving in technology and the underlying law for this is Moore's law right so 1916 Gordon Moore one of the primary founders of Intel essentially articulated that every 18 months the the number of transistors that you can put on a chip will double and so so this is the number of transistors you can put on their chip and you can see that it's it's essentially growing exponentially but there are a lot of key signs suggesting that Moore's law is actually reaching its end if not that it hasn't already reached its end so if you look at other indicators of what's going on in computation such as thermal power design and clock speed those things have actually already turned over and so yes computational scientists are coming up with a bunch of tricks in order to keep us on this exponential trend but this should be somewhat frightening to you the fact that we're actually turning over means that are the pace of our society is also not going to grow just as it was previously there are other problems that we're facing in computation and and one of those problems is actually Big Data so big data is great for all the movies that we want to you know see on the airplane but we're producing so much data that we actually can't store it so society in general over the course of the year produces roughly two point five exabytes of data in 2013 we produced 4.4 zettabytes of data we've actually gone up to 44 zettabytes of data and we'll be here very very shortly so we're producing huge amounts of data but let's just say the amount of storage media that we have to store this data is falling far beyond the the same exponential curve in in the data that we're producing so we can produce a ton of things we have no way of actually storing those things and that's of course a fundamental problem so one might ask can we actually go to something super super compact so I showed you compact from the 1980s but we can think of molecules is actually being much more compact than any of the the silicon devices that we create today so in the previous slide if we go up here if we look at the size of transistors many transistors are approaching 10 nanometers or less so we talk about 10 nanometer fab 7 NM either fads we're on the road back to 2 5 nanometer fabs if you want to think about what things are actually smaller than 5 or 10 nanometers you know molecules very easily fit that built right so if we think about nitrogen bonds we think about DNA these are on the order of nanometers or smaller and so the key question that I'm going to post you today and what I'll show you today is that in fact you can compute on things that are naturally of this dimension in a real way right we can store real amounts of data in these types of molecules now just to give you the the exercise for why you might be interested in doing this if it's if it's not obvious is that you know I'm a theorist I like back-of-the-envelope calculations so if we do a super messy calculation and I think of this glass water an account of all of the molecules in this glass of water if each and every one of those molecules can store a bit of data just one bit of data it's my assumption then we would be able to store 200 Empire State buildings of Terror drives terabyte drives of data in the same space right so where we would be able to shrink 200 of these into a single glass of water now of course we can't use every single molecule we're certainly far from it in that class of order to store data but if we did you can see exactly how much we be compressing now the other reason why I'm not completely crazy about the things that I'm talking about is of course we already store tons of important information in molecules right so that the old way of doing this the very old way of doing this isn't but also in the other metabolites that that live in your body right so DNA stores 1.5 gigabytes which was your human genome and that 1.5 gigabytes the DNA does a great deal of computing operations on and so we know that there is something fundamental about molecular computation being compact and also very very efficient so what did we do how do we actually make small molecules into a computing device so the idea behind this interesting slide the idea behind how we got here is that we decided to take a bunch of small molecules these are specifically products so I'll show you these in a second on a better slide and we realize that you can store information in these by changing the different R groups involved so earlier we heard a talk about combinatorial chemistry right if you take a few different R groups you can actually rearrange them in thousands to millions of different combinations and so what we decided to do is to store information in the identities of each of these molecules we realized that we could very quickly read back what the identities of these molecules are by using mass spectrometry and so we can we can actually look at millions of different molecules all at once using mass spectrometry and then we decided to store a variety of different data sets in there so I'll show you a couple of examples and then to compute on them using a variety of different classifiers so to get into the specific chemistry we decided to do were to create loony molecules which are four component molecules based on the reaction so we're actually using loogie dummling fer for what if people are very familiar with this the next thing about the use reactions is rate if we have four different or groups and let's say we have 10 versions of each then we can easily scale to 10,000 different compounds actually we can get much larger than just having 10 R groups each right we can go to hundreds and thousands of our groups each and then we're automatically of the scale of having millions of different molecules that we can store information and the other nice thing about this reaction in particular is that it seems to be incredibly simple so when we first started this project I talked to some of the synthetic chemists and they said you know who the reaction you're gonna get a 99% yields no matter what you did and I'm sort of a theorist and I said no way but but actually way so so this worked really really well and we do this all using liquid handling which I'll show you very quickly in a second and we get 99% yields which is still very incredible to me so all right we have all these molecules how are we actually storing information so here's an example I love the rhode island acs they fund many of my programs which we'll talk about at the end so let's say we want to store the words rhode island acs well we first have to do is we have to convert this into binary suzie rose and once and once we convert this this into binary what we can do is we can assign a molecule to every digit in this string and so i'm giving you the most basic way of doing this of course this is not actually the way you do this any electrical engineer would get very angry at you immediately but i don't want to go through the math of those things but here's just to give you an idea right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say that at this position we're gonna have molecule 1 molecule 1 is different than 2 then 3 then 4 and if we see molecule 1 in our solution we're gonna have a 1 if we don't we're gonna have a 0 in that position right so in this case we wouldn't if we have a 0 here we would not have molecule 1 in our solution you can do this for all these different positions and simply detect which molecules you have and you don't have right now if you want to get really smart instead of you know storing one molecule for each digit you can think of storing actually blocks of things and you can think of permuting them and inverting them excetera now in order to do all this you actually have to do a fairly large amount of synthesis and so when I first started one of my first graduate students who had some synthetic background you know he was actually doing this all by hand and the complicated thing about this is right you have to be able to make each and every molecule correctly in the proper mixtures to store information and so we quickly moved to AI so this is our friendly andrew robot and we now have a lab site liquid handler that very quickly mixes all the molecules that we need in order to convey the information we have and like i said we're using mass spectrometry the nice part about the mass spectrometer so right now we were able to acquire the largest mass spectrometer in all of New England we can actually read in ten to the six to ten to the seventh different charges which means about 10 to the 4 to 10 to the 5 compounds could read out all at once so there's a lot of magic that goes into reading these mass spectra but let's say we do that magic using machine learning and so what we end up with overall is that we can take a picture we can vectorize it and then we can permute it right and so the point of permutation is to make sure that if you make an error it doesn't you know take out one whole part of the image it distributes that error we then form our chemical vector out of different molecules we make those mixtures we put them into our mass spectrometer and then we figure out based upon the the ms spectrum exactly what image we have so this is the image that we got out you can see we made a couple of chemical mistakes but no big deal and so we're actually able to store very very large images and I'm very proud to say we've been able to store the most information anybody ever has in molecules so this is actually one of our smaller images so this is 257 544 bits but we can actually go to many megabytes of information all at once and this is the largest people I've ever done in small molecules and one of the largest examples and any molecules in fact whatsoever so we're very proud of that and now what we're looking towards is doing computation so we'd have a few examples of how to do computation but I'll certainly impress upon you that computation is certainly non-trivial so thinking about what molecules can do that regular silicon cannot is let's just say occupying much of my time right now so this is one very nice problem but really what I want to end with is a bigger problem that takes up most of my time and so that's the stem gap so you may have thought based upon the description that I gave you of the computation in my lineage that I would have been a computer scientist from the start and suffice to just say I came from a relatively poor background I came from a town that did not have a good educational system where people mostly grew up to acquire a high school degree and nothing further and so I actually never knew how far behind I was until I went to high school and so I heard a couple teachers in the audience so TJ's my enemy at Bergen Academy so I also went to a magnet school Bergen Academy but before going there I never even knew the difference between those that are poor and the education people receive when they're richer so in my area they actually group different districts and so the a through G districts in in New Jersey a would be in basically Newark J means the the wealthiest district in New Jersey so only about 10% of us including myself came from these a through G districts and of course the population of these districts is easily ten times as large as this 90% and so I never even knew that disparity existed until I went to high school and and what I can say is that I was very fortunate to be plucked out and to go to such a high school but before that I never even imagined what these inequities were and so over the past years I've been equally devoted to trying to increase equity in stem and so two of the programs I'm very proud of are the Rhode Island project seen in Rhode Island advocate program which fund roughly 20 students a year to do scientific research in the field and so my whole goal is to make sure that those students are also able to come up with the the scientific advances that many of us talked about today and so with that I'll thank my group so this is my my darpur team consisting of many very brave engineers and my group for bearing with me when I'm not doing the electronic structure so thank you [Applause] you
