 cloud computing is the next significant wave in technology everyone is using it in some way whether you know it or not but what is it and how does it work in this video I'll shed some light on the topic but before I get into it click the subscribe button and the like button below the video those two quick clicks really help the channel out okay in simple terms cloud computing is an on-demand pay-as-you-go computing service which is typically managed over the internet the concept of cloud computing is that the location of a service is irrelevant because it's all conducted over the Internet hence the cloud in the sky metaphor the term cloud computing was coined in the early 2000s but the principle of the service has been around since the 1960s when desktop PCs took over from time sharing services this renting of computer power gained momentum again in the late 1990s and early 2000s though as big providers such as Amazon Web Services adopted the model cloud computing is a useful tool for tech or IT startups because the companies don't need to invest huge sums of money in their own infrastructure because they're essentially renting services such as storage processing power artificial intelligence and applications from a cloud service provider owning such systems can be complex costly and time-consuming so by outsourcing this and paying for it only when they need it companies can manage their budgets more efficiently cloud computing is also a benefit to the cloud service provider because they can scale their business with the infrastructure that is already in place and reach a much larger customer base almost any service that doesn't require a person to be physically sitting right next to a piece of hardware can be delivered through cloud computing and there are a lot of companies using it individuals use it on a daily basis - if you have a gmail account you're interacting with cloud technology if you have a box or Dropbox account and store files there you're using a cloud service anytime you take a picture on your phone that picture is backed up to the cloud I could go on and on with examples of everyday cloud usage here's another one video streaming giant Netflix also uses cloud computing interestingly enough Netflix rents cloud space from its competitor Amazon there are downsides to the service though for businesses the costs can increase as they're Cloud usage demands increase there are also security consideration for companies because they don't control the data so there are legal and compliance risks as far as the average individual our risks are pretty much the same if you have an iPhone for example you'll have to pay for more storage also if a company like Dropbox has a data breach your account and files could be vulnerable I use Dropbox to back up my files what cloud storage solution do you use let's talk about it in the comments below well that's it for this video I hope your question was answered please click the like button below the video subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and as always keep those questions coming
