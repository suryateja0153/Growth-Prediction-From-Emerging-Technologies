 so this fintech course this is for those who want to explore fintech how the technologies are disrupting financial services that's the core of it technology is disrupting finance and we'll talk a lot about this that finance and technology has lived in simpatico in some relationship together for thousands of years in fact money and ledgers were initial financial technologies and we'll talk about what makes something in in this faculty's mind a financial technology that's really changing the world and then just the technology that existed the telephone for instance at one point not time in the 1920s was in essence of financial technology it rapidly changed the world of finance or even in the 19th century the telegraph rapidly changed parts of finance when you could send your first moneygram or in those days it was called something different but it was a telegram attached with money in the 1870s and 1880s but this course is going to be about the cutting edge and we're going to be talking about business models and the like around ai deep learning blockchain technology open api 10 and 20 years from now open api will not be taught by my view in a fintech course but it's the relevant topics of the day and we'll be looking at the competitive landscape those of you that have decided to take this course on top of consumer finance course the half semester course that was at the same time you will know that i usually teach in the concept of business strategy what is the strategy that these startups which big tech which incumbents are looking at at this point in time in this day and age in this sector and uh this course is also i should say being recorded it's being recorded for some students who can't join us uh simultaneously or what's called synchronous learning and this these recordings will be posted on canvas within a day or two uh lena and romain and i just have to remember how to do that and actually post each of the recordings they also might be shared just to alert you in open courseware in the fall or later i've chosen with mit that if we're recording them anyway maybe if they come out uh being anywhere uh valuable that we would open up to the broader community so these these might be shared more broadly come the fall as well um it's also really to gain critical reasoning skills around the ground truths of fintech uh separating hype from uh uh reality uh every week there's a posting of of three or four readings i understand that even if we were all on campus you might not read every word of that but they really are sort of the the foundation and i hope that in each lecture in each class we can go beyond that but this week the bank of international settlement working paper and the financial stability board are two papers that a lot of people turn to the now the financial stability board is is a group of 20 countries the g20 countries uh uh that have banded together and their their treasury secretaries or finance ministers and central banks and securities regulators have formed this thing called the financial stability board and they published very good work this paper came out in 2017. it feels a little dated right now but it still felt quite relevant and then of course the bank of international settlement is 60 or 70 central banks that out of basel and they write very good work i thought it was also interesting to take the current chair of the u.s uh bank regulator the federal deposit insurance corporation uh uh chair mcwilliams and and her view as to the future of banking what's going on right now so that's that's why i grabbed these three as an intro if you've not yet read them i think go back try to at least skim them get your sense of of what they are and each class i will also list study questions and the goal of my listing study questions is not just for you to think about these questions beforehand but you'll also see where do i want to land the class where do i think these are the central learning objectives um and this is usually in a classroom setting where i'll say let's pause here and i'll engage in some conversation now i do cold call in the in the regular classroom i don't know if anybody wants to raise their hand now and answer any one of these questions but it would be great to get a little bit of life and community in this if anybody can address themselves what are the major technological trends materially influencing finance right now that you think about whether it's in the us or anywhere around this globe um and and this course will be taught from the perspective around the globe even though i'm more knowledgeable in the us we will be talking about europe latin america asia throughout a little bit about africa as well romaine i'm pausing for you to do your we have our first volunteer thank you very much luke the floor is yours i'll ask i'll answer the first question the major technological change trend we see in u.s and outside the uss versus open banking use of a lot of apis that can be applicable to other websites all right and we're going to spend a whole class on open apis in two weeks but this is an important part of marketing opening up the banks ledgers and their data and data as as people like to say sort of the new the new oil in the business it's very valuable of course uh anybody else for me yes um the natural language processing so that we can have the robotic advisors right so natural language processing is the concept that you can take something that's in human language and put it into machine or computer language or go the vice versa and it's not actually new in 2020 some form of natural language processing has been around for decades just in terms of reading reading computer code and putting it into an audio voice or going backwards or every postal service of a major country around the globe has had something to read our scribbled handwriting and trying to read that handwriting and then put it into something where they know which post box to send it to but natural language processing will spend a fair bit of time on in robotics romaine and now we have ivy raise your hand yeah so i think we've seen a lot of digitization and e-commerce space as well especially in places like china and so and you see this kind of diversion between like china and say the us and the way we use mobile pay and the way that they really adopted like alipay and we um and we pay as well and ivy why do you think it happened so uh as you say at this divergence why it happened maybe a little faster in china so i think it's pretty interesting because um i think a place like china as an example is uh probably less developed in terms of even just their financial structure whereas the place like the us it's quite dominated and it's really competitive but it's also really consolidated so you see these countries where um i mean i think the way i think about it is like the subway systems in uh like china or like taiwan or a lot of these development countries are are much better because they were they came a little bit later um and like i just look at that analogy similarly to kind of where payments are because uh you kind of go from like zero to 100 versus we were kind of so i think ivy's raised a good point there's times when a country is growing rapidly and china for instance had been growing at eight and ten percent gdp growth a year uh and before corona had come down to still a robust six percent a year uh but within that context many things leapfrogged incumbents in europe and in north america and in the payment space in particular two big tech companies alibaba that really is the dominant online retailing company and tension was was the dominant online sort of social networking and messaging company leapfrog the banking system the traditional banking system and now with wechat pay and alipay control well over 90 of retail payments small dollar and small and medium-sized enterprise payments they don't dominate large wholesale payments but but in the retail space absolutely and i would agree with ivy they kind of leapfrogged us but even kenya leapfrogged us with m hesa a technology that was pushed forward by the telephone company safaricom when they noticed that folks were trading mobile minutes as a form of money uh gary we have two more hands that are up we're gonna start with those and then move on so uh who who are the two people and they can just go in in turn so we had lyra but she just disappeared so we'll go with alida all right juan thank you um yeah so i just kind of add on to ivy's point is a lot of financial institutions and emerging markets did not typically cater towards the mass market uh consumer population and so it really allowed very quickly for these big tech companies to jump in in a way that you couldn't do so in the um in more developed markets where the financial institutions already were catering to the large majority of the consumer population right so it's about about actual financial inclusion and reaching out and so forth um so what i'm going to do today is try to cover in the minutes we have a little bit about the financial world what do we mean fintech shaping the future the financial world what do i what do i think of it having spent my life first i was at 18 years of goldman sachs uh then i worked in the public sector but always sort of around finance at the u.s uh treasury department with paul sarbanes doing sarbanes-oxley and then later running a a market regulator the commodity futures trading commission uh in the obama administration um what would what what do we mean by the financial world a little touch on fintech that's the whole class of course but just a little touch on fintech thirdly again just a little review of these three big trends of ai open banking blockchain technology what what do these trends mean and and then and then the actors and the actors i i think that some people will use the word fintech to mean this disruptors companies like toast getting into the payment space for restaurants or lending club and peer-to-peer lending or robin hood an app you can download and trade stocks a lot of people constrain the study and the topic of fintech just to the disruptors i think that that's too narrow i think that we really need to think of the actors and the field more broadly about the incumbents this is sort of big finance we might say you know the barclays banks and the jp morgans and and and and so forth and we need to think of big tech as we just talked with ivy about uh alibaba and intention getting into this business but we see apple credit card and others and facebook trying to stand up a world currency and then it's the disrupters so i think it's a much more uh robust conversation and an important conversation the strategy amongst these three pieces and then of course we've got to do a little bit on our teaching team our schedule and assignments and so forth um so what what do i think of is in the financial world what it is well finance basically stands like this hourglass in the top right hand corner stands right at the neck of an hourglass intermediate standing between people that have money and need money people that have risk and want to get rid of it lay it off and somebody that wants to pick it up and i've for decades since i was at goldman sachs thought where we were we were at the neck of the hourglass and for good or for bad that's also part of why finance in many countries is able to collect economic rents economic rents is that classic conceptual framework of collecting profits or revenues in excess of what classic economics might tell you would be a competitive supply and demand space but if you stand at the neck of an hourglass between trillions of dollars of money flowing from those who want it and those who have it and effectively trillions of dollars of risk between those who have risk and want to lay it off and others who are willing to hedge it if you're at that neck of the hour glass so to speak if you just collect a few grains of sand for the trillions that go by it can collect a lot in the united states for one for instance our financial sector takes about seven and a half percent of our gross domestic product nowhere is it written it has to in fact in the 1950s and 60s it was more like three and a half to four percent uh but persistently it's grown as a percentage of our economy standing intermediating money and risk the um uh let's just see if i can get this to work uh there so the functions the functions are intermediate and credit that's lending investments we all know that risk transformation think of any time one of us buys insurance on an automobile or a car or in our life but also risk transformation that investment banks do even between somebody that's issuing stock and somebody that's buying stock that's a transference of risk in terms of whether that startup will do well of course there's the capital markets and at the center of the capital markets is to price the money and risk that's flowing through the system and there's plenty of advice to go around now we usually think about it in sectors and every one of these sectors whether it's commercial banking asset management insurance investment banking advisories we will touch upon during the semester and please interrupt if you if your keen interest is about insurance companies or your keen interest is about investment banks then pull the community into that in in these discussions but we're going to try to talk about multiple sectors multiple functions as contrasted to the half semester consumer finance course that was really just about one slice household lending and largely the commercial banks and investment banks around that this is a much broader topic and i hope the learning objective is ultimately to understand how technology can transform finance at any particular given time um romaine are there any hands up i'm sort of every once in a while looking to you to see if i keep going or pause no hands at the moment all right the financial world in this i think four key things to think about and this is sort of in a framework of thinking about financial technology data of course data is the that new oil so to speak for investing for market making for marketing trying to get new customers i mean how many times do we get a pop-up ad i found in teaching about student loans i was researching student loans so my god the last six weeks i've gotten more advertisement for student loans even though i'm a professor at mit it's because i was researching the topic of student loans and all of a sudden now i am getting a lot of uh unsolicited ads and emails even on the on the topic uh the financial world always has to think about the management of their balance sheet and if you're starting a fintech company are you using your balance sheet or somebody else's balance sheet and just as there's cloud computing that today cloud computing is dramatically shifted the ability of startups a disruptor can come into a business and basically the rent versus build decision changes i can rent somebody else's data storage capacity i can basically rent the cloud instead of building my own uh data warehouse that was a big change about 15 years ago and it's made startups more viable in the 2020s also the ability to raise money in the capital markets what's called securitizations which started decades ago really took off by the 1990s also allows a startup like lending club and others to say i'll raise my money elsewhere i don't have to have a balance sheet and then there's the various risks that you have to manage and most importantly we're going to spend a lot of time during this class from this fourth point user experience user interface much of what's happened with mobile phones with apps that you can download for free have given all of us a better user experience than online banking online banking has been around for over 20 years most of the major banks around the globe had a viable platform for online banking by the knots whether it was 2005 for summer 2008 or for others or so forth but by the naughts most most had online banking and yet their user experience wasn't what we all wanted and certainly wasn't what maybe the newer users as millennials were coming into the marketplace to do it on your mobile phone to do it conveniently so the user experience and the user interface is a critical competitive place so what do we mean by fintech i like going back to that 2017 financial stability board report it doesn't mean that they're have it quite right but they basically talk about that it's technology enabled innovation in the financial world that's going to some new business and that it's material so as i mentioned earlier the telegraph in the 1830s comes along and by the 1860s and 1870s we're starting to see digital money the first form of digital money is already about 140 years old i mean we think we're living in this digital age and we are and and i would note this about the corona crisis that we're living in the corona crisis in my opinion will accelerate this digitization we've already in the last 30 years significantly digitized our world and if we were all together in a classroom i would ask by a show of hands how many of you have used paper money or currency in the last two or three days and maybe a quarter of you might have said you had used paper money in the last two or three days but let me ask you in the middle of the corona crisis and romaine you can tell me if any hands go up we'll use the blue hand anybody that's used paper you know physical money in the last two days thank you alita for volunteering the floor is yours um i have for grocery shopping and so forth so so you actually and then and there's they'll still take the paper money behind the counter uh without like wiping it down with some uh cleaner uh yes and i took out a lot of cash before everything happened so ah anita i asked was that just sort of insurance managing risk as we say is part of finance were you managing the risk that the banking sector and the atms and things might not work yeah and do i see devin's hand that is correct i can only do laundry using cash i might use it for now but but but see how few of us of 80 plus people two people now we're in the middle of a corona crisis i would predict that as we come out of this whether this is if well whether this is a matter of a couple few months or whether this is unfortunately as long as a couple years wherever we come out that the corona crisis will accelerate an already existing trend and that already existing trend is towards further and further digitalization of commerce that that laundromat that devin goes to will take a qr code or a swipe of a phone uh more readily and um yes i think it was anita said that she took out cash before the crisis and that's true there's still still going to be some people that probably also went and bought gold and and and we should respect that that that's sort of an insurance policy against a digital world collapsing gary it seems like devon has a follow-up yes please you know maybe devin just left his hand off if after you speak you you actually then take your hand down so what are the technologies of air times what's sort of rolling with it now no longer the telegraph or or so forth well i put up my favorites and then i kind of think well maybe i shouldn't have put the cloud there maybe the cloud really isn't a technology that's pushing us forward right now and yet what's interesting is finance uses the cloud less than most industries and this is particularly the case of incumbents country by country it doesn't matter whether we're in brazil whether we're in europe whether we're in the u.s big incumbents like jp morgan and bank of america and barclays tend to still have their own data centers now that's shifting i think the 2020s will see them shift over but they've tended to want to sort of control their destiny i think they will shift because it's lower cost and better cyber security generally if you have it frankly at bay do in china or or microsoft or aws and so forth here but startups dramatically use the cloud this is this buy versus build sort of scenario why build my own data center i can rent it i can use somebody else but all the others we're going to talk about and i should say that there's a little um a little sleight of hand by my list because many of these are actually artificial intelligence machine learning which is part of artificial intelligence natural language processing in essence is part of artificial intelligence chat bots are are sort of that as well and robotic process automation but i split them out because i think it's relevant that we kind of have a chance to talk about each of these uh as we go i'm pausing every once in a while uh romaine but you can let me now um i like to think of this in the context of history maybe that's just because i've always loved studying history but what's the customer interface that we've seen all the way back from sort of pre-history that the customer interface was in tents or bricks and mortar later all the way up through where where are we going credit cards invented in the 1940s and 50s that was a fintech that was a new financial technology visa here in the u.s was a network of banks started by a california bank called bank of america and they wanted to have a nationwide network and other banks joined it that became the visa network but but where are we now what what are the technologies now that um i want to make sure i'm clicking on the item um so the base that you might be thinking about mobile payments the internet even contact list cards i would say that was kind of the last phase that was the phase that really shifted finance in the north and early teens and that where we really are in terms of customer interface is now conversational interfaces chatbots and conversational interfaces that's the that's the cutting edge yes contactless cards are important yes of course we need mobile payments no doubt about it but if you're starting a new business right now if you're going to start a disrupter and say i'm going to do online banking that's yesterday you have to find a way to do that online banking in a way that has such a better customer interface and you might be using some form of open apis or robotic process automation and chat bots to do it but these all kind of build up on each other then there's risk management so one is the customer side one is the funding and risk management side and you can look throughout history and i spent a lot of my life in my career around the capital markets i was at goldman sachs for 18 years and i had to think a lot with hundreds of other people about risk management and what we were doing and in the 1980s and the 1990s a big thing was asset-backed securitization and interest rate swaps and even yes credit default swaps that helped bring down several economies in 2008 but those innovations of the 1970s to 1990s were dramatically shifting dramatically shifting what was going on but i would say now it's really about machine learning machine learning is an ability to extract correlations extract patterns from data in a way that we couldn't before and many of you have studied uh linear algebra uh we're blessed in this class to have remarkable science technology and math uh uh folks uh not all of you we accept all the english majors and history majors as well but but i'm saying that you know that from linear algebra and basic statistics you can do a lot of regression analyses machine learning is going a little beyond that and extracting patterns from that which was more difficult to extract when you were just doing regression analysis and so you know there's patterns that we might see in the data that says you're a good risk or or a less good risk that you wouldn't quite see in the traditional credit scoring systems i think that's where we're going right now remain anything in the chat rooms or i'm going to pause for a second nothing so far gary all right so um it's fertile ground and we talked a little bit about this before but the fertile ground of finance is we've basically digitized money securities and credit over the last 30 years the corona crisis is just going to push that further faster in my opinion we have this vast amount of data and we're starting to see patterns in that data that we didn't recognize before i mentioned this uh in in the consumer finance course that some of you are with me on but somebody's actually studied something like this to say that if you charge your phone overnight every night if you charge your phone every night you apparently are a better credit than if you don't charge your phone every night you might think oh my gosh i better be charging my phone because apple is watching they're going to be watching whether i charge my phone and in china there's a whole social credit system that takes data from many of your online apps it's not just taking your payment information from alipay or wechat pay but that social credit system is checking even your participation in dating websites i kid you not i kid you not so that social credit system in china or the private sector's approach to collecting data in the west have sort of the same goal in mind to understand the customers more and to basically provide more marketing but also to assess risk and by the way the corona crisis might change even the west's view of data sharing because when we have google and the us partnering up to say we can track everybody to see how this disease how this disease is propagating through society that we need the modern uh technology of our position location trackers a position location tracker is called a cell phone a smartphone is tracking where we are if you go running with it if you go driving hiking all of that data but now here even in the u.s and in europe we're starting to say do we partner as the official sector with that data to keep our societies maybe a little safer and then of course the rapid expansion of computation power and so forth now i think it will change something this disruptive potential i think has a dramatic change we'll be talking about this slide the whole half semester but managing risks updating the customer user interfaces and financial inclusion are the three that i want to focus a lot on managing risk and ai is also about targeting products as well i think the interesting challenge is near the bottom will some revenue models shift we saw a company called credit karma store here in the us credit karma started basically with the idea to get a free free is the operative word a free credit score the founders of credit karma couldn't get their credit score from the traditional companies transunion experian and the like and so they started an app just in the last 10 years and in january they sold credit karma for seven billion dollars now credit karma is still a free app and you might say how could credit karma commercialize a free app in 2019 there was a billion dollars in revenue in credit karma because they basically had built files on 106 million americans they built data files and 106 million americans providing a free app and by the way they do not have 106 million customers they even built credit files on people that weren't their customers and they were able to commercialize and build revenues around that data stream and in essence referencing they get referral fees when somebody then does buy a loan or takes out a loan through the credit karma uh platform gary we have a question from one please you you might need to unmute your your uh yourself we we so i am normally including yeah okay uh i'm just wondering what is the difference between big tech and fintech and why it is important preparing and learning the fintech now so i i understand the second part of the question you said the difference between what in fintech at the beginning big tap okay big tech so by that i think of of of i use the word fintech in the broad way the financial stability board does i use it as is the intersection of finance and technology where the technology is new so not the telephone not the internet but it's something new like ai and machine learning that may materially change the provision of finance so i use it to capture uh the whole field why it's important is i think it's important every decade i don't think it's just important now because i think technologies will come along each half decade each decade that will materially change finance and provide the entrepreneurs in this class an opportunity to break into the wide margins in the u.s seven and a half percent of our economy or one and a half trillion dollars is is the revenues of finance so if you're an entrepreneur you want part of that one half trillion you you want an opportunity and usually it's technology that's changing business models when the internet came along in the 1990s that provided an opportunity for paypal to start and say maybe we can provide a better payment solution and subsequent pay payment solutions like venmo and transferwise and square have all been opportunities to chip away a little bit i would say only in in the opportunity the opportunities came because technology was changing the field what's the difference between big tech and fintech big tech to me are big platform companies uh in the us the facebooks and the amazons and the apples uh in china baidu alibaba attention uh in africa even if safaricom got in we could go country by country india big tech has gone into payments as well i think that big tech companies have dramatic advantages and then i separate what i would call fintech startups or fintech disruptors i i always put the second noun in there disruptor or startup because to me the word fintac is the whole field i hope that helps and we have another question from [Music] please yeah hi professor uh one question that i have and actually one concern is with privacy uh like at some point do you think that we would have to give up um some extent our privacy in order to for me to get a credit uh from a startup or get a credit some well i i think you raise a dramatic issue for society at large and finance is one example of it but yes we have we have shared our personal data much more broadly in the last 10 years and certainly in the last 30 years than we did in societies before that and in terms of getting a credit card yes we've been sharing data for 50 years through various credit consumer credit companies the fair isaac company was founded almost 60 years ago by two people out of stanford actually one named fair and one named isaac and that led to something called fico scores which are used in over 30 countries around the globe these fico scores took some personal data as to whether you were paying your bills on time but now we can go beyond that and capture alternative data we can capture somebody's digital footprint and in china they are doing that with social credit scoring and alibaba is with alipay and wechat but amazon is capturing our data as well amazon captures any amazon prime customer and i'm sure amongst the 80 of us there are many amazon prime customers that data is being captured in some way now it it leads to more financial inclusion but it also raises all sorts of issues around privacy that we're grappling with the societies in europe they pass something like called the um gdpr global directive of privacy regulation here in the u.s only california stepped into this and passed something that went into place uh last year the california consumer protection app so these are things that society will grapple with technology can enable privacy as well as take away privacy technology actually can enable us to keep our privacy but but the technology companies and the financial companies want our data so they're not going to necessarily want us to keep our privacy so it's an interesting uh technology can enable it but technology can take it away as well so just just moving on a little bit the three big areas we're not going to spend a lot of time but artificial intelligence machine learning i love to give a shout out to another mit or lex friedman who has a wonderful set of online courses if you wanted to take lex's courses this was online before online became such the bow now that we're all doing it but lex has this wonderful course and i i captured his one slide what is ai and machine learning um it's extracting useful patterns from data you don't have to be a computer scientist but it's basically that's the key thing and something that might not be linear something that might not fit into that old statistics class and regression analysis or linear algebra that we think about it all relies on good data cleaning up data and good questions but where do we see it we see the facial recognition image classification speech recognition etc this list from lex's list that you can see online medical diagnoses in the midst of the corona crisis a lot are turning to ai and machine learning to see what patterns can we see beyond the patterns you can see by classic statistics it's going beyond that but in in this field in this field in finance we're seeing it in every one of these areas and we have two classes uh so i won't dive into it now but whether it's asset management where blackrock is literally taking and and all the news items for the top companies every quarter that a company reports its earnings blackrock is listening digitally to their shareholder meetings and their shareholder conference calls and seeing which words in there which words relate to stock markets going up or stock markets going down using machine learning and asset management we talked about cost centers and chatbots uh and so forth um i don't know how many of you are bank of america uh customers but bank of america has millions of its customers using erica i think the siri of banking i think the alexa of banking a virtual assistant called erica bank america get it all right that was their marketing thing i guess you know um so ai and machine learning is dramatically shifting the question in fintech for the big incumbents how do i do it to raise my revenues lower the amount of capital that i have to use raise my profits the question for big tech is how do i do this maybe to get into the business to leapfrog as ivy said that alibaba and wechat pay leapfrog the chinese banks and payments if i'm big tech can i leapfrog big finance because frankly if i'm google i'm better at it right now google has a comparative advantage can i maybe use my comparative advantage in ai and leapfrog if i'm a startup maybe i can give a better customer interface i can do something with this to better manage risk with alternative data so so that's how uh to think of it open api i should pause romain any questions or hands up yes we have one from leira please um yeah so i was just curious to know how internationally speaking regulation you know hampers the capacity of fintech companies um to expand just on an international level so for the us is it more regulated and hence more um you know harder for fintech companies to expand than for in china great question again who who asked i just didn't leia all right lyra good to see you again i don't i i'm i'm uh sorry that i don't physically see you but good to see you remotely um every country is taking a little bit different approach and the range of approaches here could be from you're a let's call them a startup or a disrupter you're starting something you better just come into whatever traditional regulatory framework if you're taking deposits and offering loans you've got to be a bank if you're just doing payments you might come under a european us african e-money law and just have to do do the things around money laundering and anti-money laundering if you're like robin hood here in the u.s you would need to register as a broker-dealer and there's been this big debate around cryptocurrencies are they securities or not and in some countries like the us they they generally are uh unless you're like bitcoin and ethereum um but the the debate lyra is really country by country is um are these startups and these uh technologies do they fit into the current regulatory regimes by and large if you take deposits and you make loans you're banked pretty much anywhere around the globe if you facilitate the movement of money you're probably in some e-money laws around the globe securities if you're actually facilitating the raising of money and the selling of securities you usually have to register as a securities broker dealer somewhere around the globe but a lot of places also have this concept of some form of regulatory forbearance called sandboxes the idea is let's promote some innovation whether it's in hong kong whether it's in asia whether it's in the u.s promote some innovation by saying if it stays small enough and it's new enough you might not have to comply with all of the regulatory regimes the other interesting challenge is sometimes things come along that don't fit in a box they don't quite fit in to something so the internet came along in the 1990s it internet in the 1990s was facilitating a rapid change in finance the internet comes along and then the question is literally a question that the securities regulators around the globe had to deal with what if i put a bulletin board up on the internet that offers people to buy and sell securities on the internet it wasn't a traditional exchange it didn't look like the tokyo or shanghai or london or new york exchanges of old where there were humans yelling and screaming on the floors of stock exchanges around the globe it was just a bulletin board where buyers and sellers could meet and usually they were insurance companies and various asset managers that question was a right question the 1990s and over time we ended up with two tiers of regulation for exchanges we had fully regulated exchanges and this was true in europe and the us at the time china sort of got got there a little later but in in europe and the us it was like all right there's going to be these fully regulated traditional exchanges and then there would be another tier in the us we call them broker dealers alternative trading systems atss and in europe there were various roles that became known as mythic um uh which now i can't remember what all stands for but electronic trading platforms were regulated a little differently so i hope that gives you a sense and puts it in a historic concept i think over the 2020s ai and machine learning will lead to tremendous challenges around regulation about if you see a pattern in the data but you can't explain why the pattern is there you you fall into some challenges of explainability and for the last 50 years or in many countries if you deny somebody credit you're supposed to be able to explain why you deny them credit we talked about privacy earlier it bumps up against privacy issues and a third area bumps up against is biases what if there's a bias in the data like when apple credit card just rolled out and it seemed like husbands were getting more credit than wives in the same household so biases privacy explainability are the three sort of cutting edge what i call the big three public policy issues around ai and finance though there are other issues as well romaine did i see you for you yes sir we have carlos who has his hand up all right and then i'm going to keep going because i want to talk about where we're going in this class as well carlos hi how are you um just a comment on on regulations sort of to build up on that so i think ironically for example in latin america a lot of countries have an issue where the big banks have a massive concentration of deposits but for example if you look at the mexico fintech law which was fast end of 2018 it actually raised the barriers to entry for other fintechs so sort of ironically i'm sorry carlos it raised what for fintechs the barriers to entry bayern country okay i think i think uh our faculty member luis negari who helped work on that when he was finance minister of mexico we should we should ask him and i'll see if i can get his answer for the next wednesday or next monday's class but keep going okay that would be great um but the question is do you think there's a risk that new regulations in the fintech scope are actually going to perpetuate some of the problems that we saw before with the more traditional banking sector uh great question can i carlos can i hold that for a minute because i'm going to do that when i do the actors but i think yes incumbents in every field and these would be incumbents in the pharmaceutical fields in the in the tech fields and airlines whatever incumbent tend to be able to uh deal with regulation a little easier they're big they're they've got great resources they can build uh systems to comply with those regulations now they don't necessarily embrace new regulation but once those regulations are put in place by an official sector they tend to have the resources to embrace that and startups sometimes have more challenges and thus you may be saying that regulations become a barrier to entry they're kind of grains in the sand of innovation at times so there's always a public policy trade-off protecting the public whether it's protecting the public against consumer fraud or investor protection or protecting the public against systemic risk that big banks will fail and hurt the rest of the economy also comes with some trade-offs that it could raise the barriers to entry you're absolutely right there we're going to talk a lot about open api and open banking we have a whole class on that uh so i'm going to keep moving on just so that we we finish by our 10 o'clock deadline blockchain technology you've heard about it we're going to have a class on this about cryptocurrencies and blockchain some of you actually uh have were in our blockchain and money class some of you are in the crypto finance class that starts in about 30 minutes um but we will talk about blockchain technology i want to say and lay it out right from the beginning these two issues ai and machine learning and these eight areas are dramatically more relevant and open api and open banking dramatically more relevant than blockchain technology potential use cases as of 2020. the interesting question is will that shift is there is there an over abundance of investment in ai and machine learning and not enough in blockchain technology you get to decide for yourselves but i'm saying as of 2020 the the sort of the real potential that we're seeing and the dramatic changes around user interface and open api and machine learning and natural language processing are more dramatic than this space and yet cryptocurrencies are dramatically changing what central banks are doing and we saw facebook trying to stand up a worldwide currency last year so don't think you can adequately discuss and have a course on financial technology without really having some slice on blockchain technology and it is shifting everything that's on this list it is it is is a catalyst for change i would say my takeaway on blockchain technology it is definitely pushing the financial sector in places it wouldn't be pushed otherwise i guess that's really saying open api and artificial intelligence machine learning are so much bigger in terms of what's happening in 2020 um romaine unless there's a question i'm going to do the actors quickly we have one specific question from eu on whether a machine learning an ai can cause a dark box where creditors could deny and approve credits based on unreasonable grounds absolutely it's a risk we our first big data revolution in the u.s and then it was about a decade later elsewhere was in the ninth late 50s and early 60s credit cards came along invented really in the late 1940s and then popularized by the mid-1960s came along and then the official sector passed laws and two of the first laws we passed in the u.s was something called the fair credit reporting act and the equal credit opportunity act why i speak about those two in this question 50 years later is this was a question with the first big data analytics at that time and the idea was you couldn't you couldn't use data analytics to deny somebody credit because of their race because of their color because their ethnicity because of their gender and other protected uh uh attributes and that was called the equal credit opportunity that same act is important now as we move into machine learning credit decisions fair credit reporting act also said in the u.s and europe did some similar things elsewhere later said if you deny credit you have to be able to explain why so to this question just because you have a black box you still need to have those basic tenets of explainability and fairness or lack of bias and that's why i say the three big challenges are explainability bias and then privacy there's also challenges of robustness and so forth but great question the actors i think of the actors we've talked about this a little bit and and in several buckets i think a big finance uh i apologize i sort of borrowed this a little bit from the central bank governor of brazil i i met with him last year and he he and i were talking about brazilian banking and he said they're like fortresses so this was actually his kind of uh articulation of itu and the others in brazil and i said how do you see him as fortresses he says they all have their moats towers and they have sovereign protection and and to to him and i liked it so much i repeat it they're towers they're sort of basic tenets of of sort of of financial strength is around payments they usually control payments they have big balance sheets that they can use and balance sheets allow you to lower your risk frankly and leverage they have a lot of data and yes they have hundreds of legal entities their corporate structure is one of their both complexities but but benefits a company like a jp morgan or a goldman sachs or barclays at a minimum has probably a thousand legal entities it might have three or five thousand legal entities when i left goldman sachs which was already 22 years ago i was the co-head of finance with with david vineyard who went on to be the cfo we had 700 legal entities but if i recall in that quarter of a trillion dollar balance sheet that we had to sort of help manage and fund only about 70 or 80 of those were regulated companies so we had a lot you know we did everything legal i just want to say but we had a lot going on amongst those 700 legal entities that's kind of big finance from a sort of central bank governor of brazil's point of view like fortresses but then big tech the bank of international settlement did a wonderful report last year and they said it's like dna data networks activities and if you're alibaba or your facebook you want to layer another activity on your network facebook already has two plus billion people in their network they have a lot of data already they are supposedly a free app they are free if you download it but it's data for services and if they can put another activity on top of it that means they get more data so every time they add an activity more data and data they can commercialize and so that dna network is why you see big tech trying to get in payments around the globe and then adding credit products on top of it um startups startups have advantages don't count them out some people just call that the fintech but they're flexible they're disruptive innovators they can they can sort of rent their data storage on the cloud in some circumstances they can rent their balance sheets by doing securitizations they also have some asymmetric risk and that asymmetric risk we'll talk about all half semester the important asymmetric symmetries they have is one they're not protecting a business model so let's just talk about payments and credit cards for a minute the big banks are protecting a very profitable credit card business and there's seven big banks in the u.s there's seven big actors in the credit card space bank of america and and chase and city of course but also american express and discover and alike that cap one they're protecting that business model but then somebody comes along maybe it's a small company like toast in the payment system space for restaurant payments and before corona crisis toast was doing pretty well and they did a c or series to c or d round at 4.9 billion valuation well toast can come along and provide a payment product for the restaurant business and they have they're not protecting any business model or even lending club that came along 10 or 11 years ago can come into the personal loan space and say we're not protecting wider profit margins and interest rate margins in the credit card space you can come into the personal lending space which is growing dramatically personal lending in the us is is about 170 billion dollar asset class credit cards is a trillion so it's only one-sixth the size but the personal loan space is growing rapidly in part because those actors in the disruptive startup space are not protecting the trillion dollar asset class which caught credit cards um and then there's the official sector so i think of these actors as importantly all of them and just some pictures just for fun we don't need to stop but big finance i of course i left companies out but to give you a sense it's an asset management like black rock and fidelity in vanguard it's in banking it's an investment banking it's global if i left your country or your favorite company out i apologize but we i could have put 200 500 companies on this page but then there's also big tech which i only picked six or seven at the top and then the startups and we're going to talk about startups in every one of our classes but i think you've got to sort of bear with me and think about it more broadly as well um and then i'm just going to close before we talk about our actual course and so forth is where's the investments accenture puts out this wonderful report i think on a quarterly basis as to the number of deals in different sectors and then the funding and and i don't ask you to study this on your screen now but think about it maybe pull up the essential report itself um but the big bulk of it is in payments and credit if you look at the kind of purplish blue boxes nearly 50 of the funding is in those boxes insurance pretty good size too but it gives you the sectors that actual funding is going on in this marketplace remain questions no questions my god romaine where did you get this picture taken anyway that i grabbed off the internet that was when i was working in the middle east for bcg i see i see all right so uh you've met romaine you've met myself lena is the course administrator if you want to set up office hours and yes i am committed to office hours it's great to also copy lena you can probably do it with me too but lena is going to be better to uh sign it up uh as as well um the course so after this intro we're going to take the technologies we're going to take two two classes on artificial intelligence machine learning natural language processing and the like and then talk about the customer interface on april 8th and then blockchain and technology these three slices now there are other slices we could we could address as well so then we're going to go through the sectors we're going to talk about these sectors and what i could see is payment and credit uh trading a little less on the risk management so maybe on may 4th we'll squeeze that down a little bit uh as well um and then of course we have the intro i've just shows and i re revised the syllabus this past week i want to take the next to last class and just talk about corona crisis and how it might be shifting the landscape i already said i really do think this shifting this this deep trend towards uh online from bricks and mortar that was already happening but we've even seen in the last three weeks we've seen winners and losers i asked each of you to think about this who are the winners and losers within the financial sector big tech and the financial startups i talked a little bit about toast host is a very successful boston company uh that is providing payment services and credit to restaurants for a moment that would have you'd have to say that's a company that's taking taking it on the chin so to speak not as badly as all those individuals that have health care worries that are ending up in the hospitals and the families losing loved ones but i'm saying from an economic perspective there are some winners and losers robin hood an online app a mobile app for trading has crashed several times in the last three weeks and there's some data out of europe already that online fintech apps as as a sector have seen usage up 70 and 100 and some alps apps up 700 but not all will be winners not all will be losers and so i thought we'll take one class towards the end and just sort of discuss it and and get your feelings and thoughts as well going forward how this might uh play out so mit chose this is pass fail so welcome to not only remote learning mit but technically pass emergency no credit emergency incomplete emergency just so that you understand what this is is it's almost pass fail pass emergency pe will be on your transcript hopefully for all of you i can't commit to it because it's up to you whether you pass there are assignments and no credit emergency you can think of as an f but it's not going to be on your transcript so this is an emergency circumstance right now there's still assignments because we want to give you the most learning experience you can have you might say wait a minute wait a minute i thought i thought assignments were just about so that the faculty member can decide who gets a's and who gets b's and the like i look at assignments in a different way than that i look at assignments really as a way to help you engage in the subject and so in this class and you those of you who know me i do this in a couple classes there's one individual paper one group paper and it's all geared to writing a group paper for either a big incumbent bank of america a big tech company jeff bezos and amazon or a kind of a startup company a big vc company andrews and horowitz that you form groups and you decide on a sector you can decide on credit or payment or trading you choose and it helps you engage in the subject and then i ask you to split if it's a three or four person team or even if it's a one person team if you choose to do that because we're all so uh separated then split up and write a three or four page paper 900 words or so on one of the topics that i lay out there the traditional competitors the startup competitors and so forth the technology that you're interested in why do i still do assignments when it's p-e-n-e it's to help you engage in the subject and romaine and i are committed even if we slap a pe on most of these hopefully all of them we're trying to give you feedback so you engage in a subject and yes i'm willing to do zoom group meetings zoom individual meetings look this is not an easy time for any of us but i want to make sure that i deliver as much as i can and that mit continues to deliver for you as we're going through this this sort of challenging time um class participation uh is still important if you can't sign up if it's the time zone doesn't work or there's something going on in your family or it doesn't you're interviewing for a job god bless uh then listen to the recording we'll put the recordings on on up on canvas as well um and so professionalism i just want to say yeah excuse me just on the assignments um i'm being asked whether listeners also have to comply with these assignments no thank you um i'm trying to get rid of the poll here okay um i've never been asked that question a little word on professionalism just for my god knows 30 plus years in in business and this is just sort of my closing thing is my my advice for all of us is success goes for those prepared curious and self-starters if you read the assignments for this you'll do better in this class but if you go into a meeting if you go into a pitch you go into an interview if you read about the person you're going to learn more about and by the way if you're curious when you walk into somebody's office whether it's a video office or a real office look at the walls what does it mean that gary kenzler has this stuff behind them or not i'm not asking you to analyze me right now but i'm telling you if you walk into somebody's office whether there's u.s senator the president of the united states some job interview a colleague and you look at their laws and you ask them about their family show some curiosity you'll do better off um as i said respect and courtesy builds reputation and networks and so forth um engage it's going to be hard with this many students online but engage in this class you'll learn more if you engage with me also offline gensler mit.edu but also engage by setting up office time i also think in understanding both strategy and detail matter some people are really good tactical people really good detail folks they'll do fine in their careers but if you step back and understand the trends as well you'll do better some people are really global strategists and not really good at the details they'll probably do okay but i'll tell you my experience whether it's in in finance whether it's watching people at mit in the faculty or my time in public service the people that can merge both broad strategy and can execute on the details those folks are unstoppable often those are folks that you really you want them on your team that they can do do a bit of both so we're going to talk a lot about strategy and the trends but we're going to get into the granular details as well and then lastly it's always better to stay true to your values now i do say this it's going to be a little it's we're in this past feel thing but if you want to know one way that romaine and i will drive this a little nutty we're going to try to put your your papers through some plagiarism software i use grammarly i actually check yes and if you have one like eight or ten word section that you pulled off of wikipedia and i've had students grab the first 15 words off of wikipedia and put it right in their paper that's kind of a sloppy thing to do and usually if i was grading that paper would get like a c or a d and it wouldn't get an a or b and i'm not going to be a hard nosed guy about 10 words but if you extensively plagiarize you know a couple hundred words in a 900 word paper you're going to get an f on the paper now you can recover on the group paper but don't plagiarize on your group paper because you're also going to bring down your colleagues i don't know in past fail land what i will do but if somebody really is trying to test the limit you would test it by extensive plagiarism enough on that i've had it in the past occasionally so you know that's i gotta say it um i would say speak up in class if you can keep your videos on as most of you have keep your audios muted but but please speak up i mean don't don't be hesitant um at all um and then i do have office hours and the crazy thing was i set up office lunches so on those following tuesdays and thursdays i had there's a spreadsheet romaine maybe we should send it around to this group we have to there's this there's a google spreadsheet if you wanted to sign up and right before we left before uh sip week uh a student said hey i'm signing up for the 31st will you still do the lunches i laughed i said listen i'm willing to do it i'm willing to do remote lunches it's crazy um uh so if you want it if nobody signs up i'm fine i'll go for a ride i li i live in baltimore and i'm still able to run here they might shut that down too at some point in time but for now i'm able to do my runs so uh i think that's it on the slides and then um i think i'm supposed to finish this class right now i went over i want to thank you all what's that just one clarification because i'm getting a lot of questions on the group formation so groups will be from three to four students and you're supposed to group yourselves right through the canvas function if that doesn't work out for you we're going to send out a link where you can find other team members who also are looking for for team members so do not worry about the group formation and i thank you all i know this is unusual i see you on wednesday morning 8 30 a.m uh and and please stay safe and be well you
