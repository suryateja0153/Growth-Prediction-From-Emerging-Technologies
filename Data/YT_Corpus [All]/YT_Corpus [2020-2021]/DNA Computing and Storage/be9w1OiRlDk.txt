 my name is Chris Dickens I'm here to talk to you today about data box edge which is one of Microsoft's portfolio of edge devices that allows for running hybrid ops at the edge and specifically we're gonna talk a lot today about bringing sort of AI and machine learning to the edge and sort of ways to do that and what kind of things you can accomplish with it I know you've seen this slide before right like we like to use this a lot and it really just is about this idea that as a company we talk about the power of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge and it's more than just running things at the edge it's the idea that you know you can take this this amazing sort of thing that's happened with cloud computing where you can scale as cloud and use all these machines and have a centralized source of all your compute that runs across everything but then also there's a lot of times when you need to have something running out on the edge because that's kind of where the real world is and bandwidth can't solve all your problems between the edge and the clouds you have to move some things close to the edge I saw to you likes to say that data has gravity and I really believe in that as well right that the stuff that's getting generated out in the edge has gravity and you have to move the compute and the processing of that thing out to the edge where it is as opposed to trying to move all that data up to the cloud you just they're just times and you can't do that do it that way and so at Microsoft we really believe in this and we have a whole entire spectrum of kind of intelligent edge products right so obviously you know kind of on one side of this we have the hyper scale cloud right which is a sure that you know and love at Microsoft conference and on the other side way down at the bottom there's these azure sphere devices and microcontrollers do you see these little tiny things and there's really a whole spectrum in the middle right we have sort of normal IOT devices and those are sort of in this kind of sensor area but then you get into this idea of like things that run out at the edge to process those sensor data and those readings and like be able to do things with that data out where they're getting read so IOT edge allows you to deploy containers out to the edge to process sensor reading to kind of control those devices out from the edge instead of from the cloud as your stack lets you run a full kind of version of Azure at your look in my fully disconnected environment and data box ads we had kind of an out to the middle where data box edge is like IOT edge and you can run those containers and do that compute out on the edge but it's a much larger machine than you often think of with IOT edges it's server class machine it's a first party device from Microsoft and it's something that allows for sort of sophisticated edge computing out on the edge so so this is data box head it's a 1u server device it comes from Microsoft right so you don't go and buy this piece of hardware and then install some software on it and figure it out it's actually an appliance so you order it from the adjure portal like you'd order anything else from the azure portal and then you pay as you go so you order from the hydro portal you pay a normal Azure meter and we ship you a server if you install it in your location and you use it for however long you want to use it for and then when you're done you send it back to us and you stop paying for it it's great so you just pay like a normal addre meter do not have to have any capital expenditure cost it's all operational expense all that stuff and data box edge includes a variety of capabilities so it has in it a network storage gateway so if you're wanting to move your data from the edge to the cloud and you don't kind of want to figure out how to sort of use the blob api's or you don't want to kind of teach your systems how to teach blog or how to talk blobs or kind of use command line tools or things like that it can sort of serve as a great pipeline for moving data to the cloud it has edge computing so it does full iot edge or in the full iot edge instance we'll talk a lot about iot edge in a little bit sometimes people get a little confused by the naming there because think I'm not doing IOT stuff but the right way to think about IOT edge in this context is that it's a way to deploy and manage containers at the edge on your device and so you can run these compute to containers out at the edge and that works really great for being able to sort of do whatever edge computing you want and had it all managed from the cloud every data box edge has an FPGA in it it's powered by agile machine learning so you can do accelerated ads or machine learning inferences out at the edge on the FPGA and the whole thing is clog managed so you can put it somewhere where you don't have like key stuff because everything you do with it is from the cloud through the azure portal not at the edge with the device so we talked some about the use cases for native oxide I talked a little bit about data transfer right so if you have a lot of data you want to move to the cloud either with like an exist you might kind of lift and shift move where you just need to migrate a bunch of data once data box edge can help be there or you know what we see often is if people have sort of data that's kind of ongoing and getting generated all the time and they just want to build a nice pipeline to move that data to the cloud data box edge can be great for that you can do pre-processing of your data at the edge so imagine all that data that's being generated and you want to move it to the cloud but you don't actually want to move all of it to the cloud because a lot of it you don't care about that much and so you can do things like run a compute module down at the edge that looks at all that data as it comes through and only transfers to stuff the cloud you care about so it saves your bandwidth that makes it just much more kind of approachable to be moving your data to the cloud and then like I said the focus today is we're talking about machine learning and franciene at the edge so you can make a lot of decisions out at the edge on data and machine learning is so optimum for this because as we kind of all know it's really the it's the best at figuring out large piles of data and getting sort of knowledge about what's going on with that because you can kind of train you know train the algorithm to spot sort of patterns in your data and to make decisions about it so we'll go through briefly each of the things that I mentioned around how you know what data box that is meant is kind of built out of and we'll start with the storage gateway so data box edge has a storage gateway and what that looks like is on your local at your local site data box edge will explore I suppose network shares so either SMB or NFS shares and this is great because almost anything can talk to an SMB or NFS share right and you just have to copy files on the SMB or NFS share and we take care of the rest right so we then move all the file you copy there up to Azure cloud automatically there's all kinds of neat stuff we can do right you know like if your connection goes out like we're happy to keep stuff in our cache and wait till the connection comes back you can do kind of what I like to feel like a burst coffee so like if you have like a big pile like a terabyte of data or so thing that you want to move to the cloud you're like oh is gonna take like four days to upload and I don't want to babysit an upload for four days you can copy it at local speed to data box edge is very fast right because you can copy for Tara but you terabyte over here the local network pretty quick and then you're done right it's on data box edge state of oxide takes care of the rest it'll upload it for you and it'll kind of make it to the cloud as it can and if you don't want it to use that much bandwidth during your workday that's fine you have a bandwidth meter right so you can set a schedule to only use a certain amount of bandwidth during certain hours and use more overnight that kind of thing and I'll do one last note which is that when you're offline data box edge has that local cache and so you can continue to copy data to it when you're offline and it will sort of happily take that data into its cache and when you come back online it will upload it all and on this point as well when we get to compute the compute continues to function offline as well so you set your configuration when you're online you set up all the all your containers and get them all running in the right way and then the device goes offline and that those containers will keep running and even if one fails little restart and those sorts of things in order to kind of like make sure that you can continue do your job while you're offline and then when you come back online everything will work again I do want to take a moment to mention another product in the data box family called data box gateway data box gateway is a virtual machine version of the storage gateway functionality I just talked about so if you're really interested in that data transfer functionality and you don't want to like get our 1u server you can run data box gateway on your own hardware right in your own hypervisor and and it can do all that same storage gateway functionality so all the same like copy into the cache it can be offline it's all cloud managed all that stuff all works a data box gateway so we talked a little bit about these sort of network data sort of scenarios or these cases and kind of I talked some about like ongoing data pipelines I talked some about big data migrations I talks about bursts of data and I just want to kind of reiterate that those are kind of the three places we see that a lot right so migrating a ton of data you just have data kind of coming through all the time and then like kind of a when you have bursty situations and you want to do like a local copy that's fast and then let the cloud copy go as it can and so you don't have to teach your other systems how to deal with like cloud transfer speeds like data box edge and gateway can fit in great there and we have a couple of customer stories that kind of exhibit this as well so hogarth is a company that had a bunch of on-prem storage that they were using and they got kind of tired of having on-prem storage for all the reasons that people get tired of having on from storage it's kind of hard to manage it's expensive they didn't really want to keep sort of buying new storage systems they wanted to move to add your cloud storage but they had this problem they're like oh we got to get our stuff to the cloud and we got to do it kind of quick because like the IT team doesn't like you they want to decommission this old machine and we have a time line and they were having they were struggling just kind of getting it there and they got data box hedging like ah this is great because it sort of it became a very fast transfer experience for them they didn't have to be babysitting copies all that kind of stuff so they were part of our preview had a very successful preview and they've continued since they've now actually transferred five petabytes of data to add your cloud through data box edge and a box gateway so they've been a fantastic customer it's just an example of like you can do really large-scale transfers through this stuff increase another preview customer that we had free makes in addition to their light bulb business you may not know they make these fancy silicon carbide chips that use all kinds of power transform applications like solar cars and windmills and all this stuff and in their manufacturing process right they take images of each of these chips and it generates huge amounts of data and they have to keep them around because they kind of keep them for quality control purposes and legal purposes and compliance purposes and they had the same problem as they ran beat up their manufacturing realize like we don't we don't want to ramp up our local storage to be able to store all this stuff and and they realize a data box edge can help them to sort of move that data to a sure as they're you know as they're sort of ramping up their production and they can ramp up their sort of storage costs of having to buy a bunch of on-prem storage and these data boxes i just part of that pipeline so that's an example of where they're generating did all the times or manufacturing they move it to the edge so now we're gonna go into edge compute and what data box edge does is it runs edge compute on the box in addition to the storage gateway and this gives you lots of different options for how to use the computer out at the edge so like we talked about there are the still dos SMB NFS shares and you can copy data to data box edge and you can actually build a pipeline so that all of the data that you copy if you copy and file data to the cloud can be run through your compete for it goes to the cloud to make sure that you either like cleanse the data to make sure it doesn't have like the wrong stuff in it or filter it out or you know whatever you want to do there but also now you have this concept of lots of sensors or other systems that you can talk directly to those I of T edge modules and every time I say module today like that's a term that IOT I juices I want you to think container because that's really what's going on here each of those modules is a container and you can have you know other systems talking to those containers either through API calls or a video stream or all kinds of things they can talk into that container and then those containers can process data as it comes through the containers can either use IOT edge messaging to send messages to the cloud about results of things they can make calls to any Azure service right because their code running on the edge and they can make calls to Azure or they can also make use of that same storage gateway so if your container wants to save a blog to the cloud all you have to do is save a file to like your local file system and the storage gateway will take care of moving into the cloud for you you're sort of like you know a rough diagram of kind of how it works so you have data box edge sort of out on the side and it connects in sort of does on-prem systems it can talk to SMB or NFS or to your modules through API calls or you know any kind of sensor right so pressure sensor video camera any that kind of stuff can talk into there as well and they can all be hanging off of the IOT ID system and be IOT systems and then you have up in Azure you have sort of you know IOT hub which sort of controls all the modules and systems that are running on data box edge and then you have a variety of other services in containers so you have many azure services we'll just talk about a minute have IOT edge container versions there are lots of third-party services that you know could run to build IOT edge systems or edge modules you could run and then separately you can build your own custom modules of course you can run on the edge so those all go up into the azure container registry and then you can deploy them down to your box all specified from IOT hub and we'll talk about how that works in a little bit but you can sort of deploy all these modules down to the edge and run them locally and have it all be kind of cloud management cloud controlled so once again that gets you to this place where you get to run arbitrary containers on your piece of server hardware at the edge kind of an all managed from the cloud it just opens up a ton of possibilities it's great I mentioned this concept of integrating the storage gateway and the edge computing and the way that you could kind of build a pipeline to you know make sure that you kind of inspect any files before they get uploaded and we've actually built sort of an integration between these two systems so that it works great for you and the mechanism for this is the data box edge actually acts as an IOT device that sits downstream of your of your edge and so you have we have this concept of like a local share and a cloud share and the way that works is a local share is sort of an SMB or NFS share and data box edge where we don't upload the stuff to the cloud lands there right and it's just your local kind of sandbox you can do what you want there you can make use of our very fast storage and just kind of have this local place where there's kind of some data sitting there and then anything that shows up that you write to the cloud share will automatically kind of right up to the cloud we also have this concept of that you can bind these shares up into your containers right so you don't have to worry about kind of authentication and those pieces from your modules you have a way in the deployment which I'll show you in a little bit where the actual shares here show up as a piece of the local file system in your container right so all you have to do to interact with these shares from your container is it's exactly the same as talking to your local file system so what happens is a system writes a file to the local share and instead of you having to like know or realize that's happened data box edge knows right data box side sees there's a new file there and then it sends a message into the like kind of IOT hubs it's Wow - edge that's running on your device and that IOT edge sends something over to your module and in this case what we're talking about is an azure functions module so as your functions has an IOT edge version and you have the ability to write an azure function and publish it as an IOT edge module and there's tools for this in vs code and there's you know kind of documentation online for how to do all this stuff and then what happens is your function your snippet of code will run every time one of these messages comes in right so it's sort of that same serverless concept and it's sort of reacting to events so what your function does the message comes in says hey there's a new file and it gives you a file path right awesome new file right so now your function reads from the local share it does whatever magic commute stuff you want to do on that file and then when it's done it just has to write it to the cloud jar which like I said is just as easy as writing to a local file system and then from there we take care of moving it to a blob or a file and Ezer storage and so this whole process makes it really easy to kind of both build these kind of storage pipelines that we talked about and also just when you're doing development out at the edge and you want to think about how to kind of copy things up to the cloud you don't have to be quite you don't have to sort of worry about this cloud transfer right at the State of Trance for peace like data box edge can do that for you so I talked about how as your functions exist in in data in the kind of an IOT edge but there's also a bunch of other things as well right so there's Azure functions Azure machine learning has IOT edge modules stream analytics cognitive services cognitive services all just add a note is super cool so in Microsoft's AI landscape right we have this concept of like as our machine learning is where you build your own model and you train it with your own data and you make a model like specific to your use case which is great cognitive services lets you just use one of our pre trained models and we actually use this sometimes in demos we're not gonna use it today but you know where you can like download a model and I've done this you download a model you deploy it to data box edge and then you hand it an image and it says oh I found some text in this image and here's where the text is and here's what it says right like oh great super cool hey and I have to do anything right I just got this module from Azure and I ran it was great they can identify people I can identify objects and images they can do all kinds of cool stuff there's AI toolkits for doing kind of more advanced AI things there's even like sequel server databases and actually I didn't update this slide yesterday we announced a new sequel server on the edge version called sequel database edge and they have a boost down in the expo if you want to check them out that's another IOT edge module it like works on IOT edge works as part of our advocacy stem and you kind of build this pattern where you have all of these as your services right so you have this space that you can write your own containers also there's all these other azure services that have containerized versions that can all deploy out to these edge devices and kind of you build that kind of thing you keep hearing about where you have the same services available in the cloud and the edge and you can kind of work across them in a nice way and like I said you can write your own write some modules or containers put a lot of stuff in a container we have lots of tools for writing sort of IOT IDE specific modules but your module does not have to be an IOT edge module to work on data box edge right you can deploy any kind of module you want our modules are glued to Linux based modules kind of the most common in standard thing and you can deploy that to the edge and away you go and there's lots of Doc's about you know how to kind of do some coyote edge module stuff you want to edge a wear module like we talked about right like as you're doing all of these edge computing things there's this concept of like machine learning becomes a very powerful tool at the edge and there's a reason why you see a lot of the stories that we tell about how data box edge works involves machine learning because that's where we see customers getting the most value so in general when I think about edge computing you're kind of trying you're always at some level solving a bandwidth problem right because that's why you're doing it out on the edge instead of at the cloud and there's sort of two classes of this problem that we see a lot the first class is the idea that going to the cloud and back is just too slow right you just need a faster result then it can then you could get if you like set your data to the cloud and came back and even if your cloud connection is super fast and all that kind of stuff you're still like you know you're yeah when people want like sub-second latency and things like that right you got it you got to do something locally and so that's this concept they're processing it immediate results and I actually like to say that this is sort of a latency problem right so you move up to the cloud and you come back and that's about how much latency you have to go there and back but this also extends even if like like if you're disconnected you really have a legacy problem right like going to the cloud and coming back takes a really long time so if ever ever you want immediate results that are faster than you can get by going into the cloud and back right edge computing is a good set and the other one we see a lot is you have data that you want to move to the cloud or you have things that you want to move to the cloud but you don't have a big enough pipe for it so instead of latency now your problem is bandwidth and this is the kind of concept where you're generating tons and tons of information and you just can't move it all to the cloud and so you need to kind of figure out how to have like a smaller set of that data go to the cloud and this is where you get into things like you know you can imagine like video camera feeds like video city like city traffic feeds is kind of we've talked with some cities about this where they have all these traffic feeds going by and they possibly save all that data because it's a giant huge amount of data but maybe if they run to some analysis and what's happening in those videos they can save the interesting bits right so you know maybe if they maybe they only want to save the times when they kind of like thought a collision almost happened right and that can help them to study that you know study the safety of that intersection if they can see all the times the people almost hit somebody but didn't right those sorts of things and then also there's this concept that you hear a lot of people that have sort of information that they can't move to the cloud for legal or regulatory or policy reasons and they need to kind of scrub it right so they need to remove personal identifying information they need to do other things like that so we see this a lot and like autonomous vehicles right want to move stuff to the cloud for training purposes but they have to blur out faces and license plates or you know other places where you have to kind of like remove identifying information we're actually going to talk about that a little bit as well a few minutes so one of the things the data box edge has is it has this onboard FPGA so FPGA czar field programmable gate arrays this one comes from our friends at Intel or here thinks Intel and what it does is it it allows you to sort of create a piece of code like it allows you to program the chip at the edge to be accelerated to exactly the thing that you need to accelerate it for and the cool thing about this as far as you're concerned is that so programming FPGA is actually kind of hard but we build systems so that you don't have to do that right so we have our machine learning which knows how to program the FPGA to be optimized for your machine learning model that's running on that specific box and we'll talk about more like more about how that process works but I kind of wanted to sort of kind of set that idea that there's this FPGA that does its accelerated machine learning and it's part of this whole FPGA effort that Microsoft has Microsoft has a pretty large investment in FPGA is we use them a lot for first-party services so a lot of the Bing stuff in the cloud uses FPGAs a lot of our network and storage services in the cloud PGA's and we're now we talked about it some last year at build and we're sort of continuing that this year we're sort of opening up that concept of using FPGAs for third-party developers right so we have services in the cloud where you can kind of use FPGA enabled services and then with data box edge we have the edge service to use data to FPGAs I have another customer story to share and that's Olympus Medical and they are doing some really cool stuff with data box edge and FPGA so I actually have a fun video that talks all about it Olympus is really about solving problems in healthcare we see our role as to empower the staff let's help them do their job more efficiently and more effectively the operating room is probably the most complex area within the hospital it's amazing all the different services human services supplies equipment cleaning everything that needs to be coordinated in order for a surgery to happen and to happen effectively one of the big problems in healthcare is the operating room and the turnover time we have all these cameras in the operating room that we've already installed the cameras are really there to help the staff understand room state today it's a manual process we can leverage that infrastructure and we can use AI to analyze the video in real-time we have lots of data that you can't necessarily send up to the cloud and process it and send it back it just won't give you the performance in the application that you need when we learned about Azure data box edge we became very excited the on-premise nature of the data box edge and the intel-based FPGAs make it really seamless for us to be able to integrate that device into part of our natural application data box edge and azure gives us the ability to interpret this video in near real-time and gain insights if I know when the patient arrives in the room and I know when the room is prepped and ready for surgery I can let the doctor know that and we can be a little bit more efficient about getting the doctor to the operating room on time it's about automating processes we're just scratching the surface with this particular technology and the AI that it can bring and we're just super excited to see what problems we can solve with data box edge and measure sorry and we actually have Mike Porten here who's in the video and we're gonna have him talk three minutes about sort of using native oxide and the problems they're solving so welcome like yeah thanks morning everyone thank you to Chris and the the data box edge team and the the brain wave teams for collaborating on it video is a tremendous experience of ours I think no brain wave is a Microsoft name for that PJ so so Olympus is a global medical technology manufacturing company it's an imaging company that provides devices for therapy diagnosis and treatments of patients the olympus customer solutions group is a group that has 20 years of experience focused on solving problems in healthcare and really the patient experience our focus is really about enabling technologies such as data box edge to solve some of these problems in the the operating room as Chris mentioned there's there's bandwidth issues there's lots of problems taking all this data that we collect in the room and processing it and doing something with it to solve some of these customer problems many of the problems that we encounter in healthcare really around efficiency and things such as just getting the physician to the room on time to start a surgery is a big problem and many institutions are really focused on gathering data to try and improve those that that physician getting to the room in time there's also turning the room over many many hospitals have an issue just getting the cleaning staff into the room to clean the room in time to get it set up for the next patient and with technologies such as ours with the various cameras that are already in the room we can use the data box edge to analyze the video provide feedback and then notify the the cleaning staff or the managers that it's time to get a patient there we can do that automatically and then there's lots of other problems that we can solve with data box edge and to enable some of these great technologies but it's it's a super start for us and we're really excited totally and so one of the things I think is really interesting about this is that you like this idea that like you already were capturing this video it's like it's sort of already tacit you had yeah right and people were looking at it but like you kind of like you can bring in like sort of this machine learning technology to be able to kind of get automated stuff out of it right right we have we have a product that's called status board which is typically located at there the nurse's station it's kind of a central location inside operating rooms and and some of these might be 40 50 different operating rooms and you can walk up and you can visually see what's going on in all these different operating rooms this one's in cleaning this one's in the middle of a procedure this one's about ready to finish and it helps the staff just kind of coordinate and understand what's going on with with all these cameras that we've already got we can process this data and help automate that step and one thing that you know helped me a lot was when we were talking and you said like it turns out that like because you had like obviously like you could build like a little button like oh the patient right yeah right right like but there's but there's a lot of reasons whether it's not as good it's like doing it automatically that's a great point our one of our core products is called easy sweet 4k and it's a it's kind of like a home theater for the operating room it brings together cameras video image capture room state and there's there's certain buttons that the user can click to transition from one step in the procedure to another those telemetry signals along with the actual video itself of the room state and the awareness can help gain a lot of insight into what's going on in that room and enable some of these really good efficiencies but also you talked about how like you don't want to give the staff more to do because they're like yeah that's that's a great point them press a button like the piece right here right like they forget and your data is not quite right and then like also it's one more thing right do that's that's a great point there's something called the the triple aim and the quadruple aim and won't go into detail on that but the quadruple aim is really about staff burnout and staff satisfaction as well as the patient satisfaction the outcomes the efficiencies but you don't want to add more to their workload their focus is on the patient and in solving that patient's problem whatever it may be not worrying about another device that's been wheeled in what you know what cable do we connect to the wall where do we do it do we take the high def do we take the the 4k signal the jaw the what we really believe is we try and make it simple and easy to for the staff so that they don't have to worry about all the technology in the room don't add more tech just to solve a problem use the existing technology to make their job easier and a focus on that patient and then overall is you kind of work kind of pulled data box added into your system to add sort of a Microsoft AI smart it's kind of into that like how is that experience been and kind of like plugging it into your system and yes so we we've had the data box edge installed in our data center for a few months now and we've been building a prototype application to take the video that's already on them on the network decode it send it up to Ashur or I'm sorry to decode it processed it right there and then provide the results back to the road yeah yeah and that all kind of fit into your existing stuff and reasonable ways yeah it fits into our existing fits into our existing kind of platform the way we work the tools that we use and it's been actually fairly fairly seamless great ok thanks so much Mike thank you yeah thanks coming it's a few other kind of customer stories so Kroger we actually have on the expo floor downstairs we have a Kroger set up and Kroger is doing a very similar thing to what you just heard from Mike and Olympus Kroger has existing cameras and their stores they kind of know how to look across the stores and see things but they don't actually know how to like process that like today it's a person who kind of looks at it to kind of like make sure nobody's shoplifting or something and what they can do is they can put data box hedge in there and they can solve this sort of surprisingly interesting problem which is that stuff being like physically on the store shelves is actually a huge problem for retail right like if somebody walks up and takes the last thing of a product like they they want to get the thing out of the back and put it out on their shelf and it turns out that they actually lose more money in sales to stuff being not on the shelf than they do to people stealing stuff so it's a giant problem right and to be able to get more efficient at running their stores right just even knowing like when something's no longer on the shelf is a big deal so they use data box edge to do that and we actually like I said have a live demo of that down on the expo floor so you can kind of walk up and like you know take box cereal off the shelf and it will see oh look there's no more cereal there right and you notify somebody to go put more cereal back on so you can see that over in in the expo as reason another one of the customers we work with so ESRI does a lot of work with a national natural disaster response and this is like kind of more of an offline use case right so Ezra is a mapping and just kind of spatial company and they already have software that knows how to sort of get footage from drones or like people on the ground and update sort of map information with what's going on there right it's like what structures are you know destroyed where are there people that need help like those sorts of things but a lot of times there's a team that's working out somewhere where they don't have bandwidth right to go up to the cloud and kind of update like the master maps so what they can do is they can send them out with like a local copy of their maps and their laughing software and then as they get kind of footage back from drones or from other things they can use that footage to automatically process it and update the mapping systems and direct sort of the response out in the field to where it needs to go and then we have some mil five actually is a solution integrator or a Microsoft Partner that's been working with Olympus on sort of all of this with data box edge and and so what we're gonna do actually is we're going to show you a demo of the video that we just talked about or the kind of this but same stuff and what and what Mike talked about about sort of their sort of prototype app to sort of do all this and kind of and see this piece so I'm gonna start that demo as Shri comes up and you know I mentioned that data box edge overall is this cloud managed thing right and what that looks like is that here we have you know the azure portal and inside the azure portal data box edge has a resource right so your data box head it's at your site it's all controls in the cloud this specific data box edge we're actually going to talk about two different ones briefly and there's actually a fun story on that here as well this specific data box ID is actually in a lab in California and I'm not connected to it right I'm just connected to the edge of portal and and I can see on it that it has you know we can see some basic stuff about it we can see that kind of shares we talked about they're all kind of setup modules and things and also sort of on this resource pane we kind of we pull in like kind of the modules that are running on it and so there's all these different modules that are running and really what this is is like I said this the control plane for all of this is IOT hub and IOT edge so what I'm going to do is I'm going to switch over to the IOT hub that's controlling this thing so this is the IOT edge device right from IOT hub and IOT hub is you know it's a developer tool right I want to be really clear about that but it lets you to deploy all these modules and what's nice about it is in addition to doing kind of some of the stuff that I'll show you today just sort of on the website right like at some level this is just a wizard to generate a JSON deployment script and that JSON deployment script can be used with an API nazzer to sort of deploy to wherever you want right so you can deploy to an individual data box head you can deploy to a bunch of different data box edges you can sort of tag your data box hedges as in different buildings or different workloads and use you know a single deployment script to deploy to everything with a certain set of tags right they have all these sort of management functionality for deploying across kind of a suite of devices and this is a list of our list of modules the edge agent and edge hub modules are part of IOT edge that's sort of part of the functionality they're denoted with the dollar sign at the front to mean they're special and then after that we have this app that you know tree and Olympus have built where you have a variety of these different modules that all do different jobs so all light if I light a few of them the fabric module is really cool because it just sort of it accepts kind of commands from the cloud and sends them back and Sri will kind of show you how that works this SSD vgg image module is one of those Azure ml modules I talked about so this is a container that comes from Azure ml with a trained model specific to their use case and what happens is when you install it on the device yet refined z-- the FPGA card and it reflash is the FPGA to like kind of optimize for SSD vgg which is one of the models machine learning modules models and then can run not model and then like the other kind of big one is this inversing management module that's some one where all the kind of smarts of the thing are and that's kind of how it works and the key is all these modules right all they're all containers that are running down on the client and there's a few ways for them to communicate IOT Edge has a messaging system that you can that you can take part of and when I talked about a coyote edge aware module that's sort of what I was talking about you can get andrás you can kind of get those IOT messages and you can send them kind of on to another module or on to the cloud but also IOT edge sets a local docker network for you and it uses like docker dns down there as well so you actually can just do a lot of communication straight across right so these modules actually I think this is very all communicate just with like API calls between them that's right yeah one of them using G RPC in the array yeah exactly and so and all you have to do you just have to be like Oh send my API request to you know SSD VDD - image : port number right and you can do all that communication locally between the modules specifically when you actually go to deploy modules right like in the UI here you kind of set modules and that creates that the wizard I talked about the kind of can create this deployment JSON so overall you have all these different modules and you can configure them so for example this inference management module is a good one to talk about because it has a lot of stuff going on so you have you know the normal thing you have the name of the module you have the image you know the place where doctors pulled an image from and then you have this variety of you can set environment variables right so if you want to set like this is the best place to do like I want to set a configuration that doesn't require me to recompile right you can set an environment variable for your module so these are a variety of things right so it's telling that like you know oh when you're calling this when you're calling the adderdean learning module this is the name of the module to call and this is the port number to use right so then in the module when it's running just kind of pulls that out of its environment variable and away you go so you can set all that through okay configuration instead of having to hard-code those pieces they can be different across your installation and then the other key thing to talk about is this concept of when I talked about binding shares up into the modules so what we do is it's like I said we had these local and cloud shares and those are just the shares that we've created over here see see over here I have a share called local and a sure called cloud and the cloud one you know is connected up to the built my sort of storage account right so anything I save to that will go to the cloud and over here I bind that local share in that cloud share into something in the modules local file system so when this module is running and you'll see we don't kind of where there's this process when it's running that we sort of save an image file from the video just to kind of make the demo kind of work and help you understand what's going on and what he's doing is actually saving that too in his local module let's slash home slash output slash file name right and the data box had automatically uploads that to a cloud storage for you that's all you have to do and then so once you have one of these things you come through here this is routes which is sort of how to route IOT edge Mathis messages around if you're you're gonna use those to kind of talk between modules and then at the end you have this concept of like I said this is just now generated this JSON deployment manifest it has all these different pieces it has all the modules it has all of the kind of things you would only use for those modules environment variables like docker create options which are those kind of config options and all those pieces so like I said it's the concept of you know you're just deploying containers to the edge and you can specify the docker Creed options for them you can specify environment variables front and we can do all of that kind of from the cloud and then click a button and it will deploy all that to the edge and then we'll have tree show you what that ends up looking like right so what you're going to see now is a small portion of what Mike had described as the larger solution that Olympus is actually trying to build right so this application what you're seeing is a test app that engineers actually use you know we have these IOT modules we have the machine learning model that's actually deployed on the data box edge so what you know we use this application for we rely on it quite a bit you know is to make sure that the changes we make and the deployment you know modules and model on the data box edge are doing the right thing so you know we get a lot of the test data back into this application we're able to look at it you know fine-tune it you know and then push it again you know run the telemetry and invoke certain things on the data box edge you know because again you know it goes through the IOT hub stuff right so we're able to send device telemetry into it invoke certain workflows you know specifically the in the fabric module that Chris was talking about and it goes through its inference we're able to look at what it's actually collected and it surfaces up here what I'm going to do you know like Mike said you know there's a certain workflow that happens you know in procedure room so doing a register patient here calls into the data box agent sends it a telemetry that device and the procedure room would normally do right you know it's basically before you know a patient gets we know worked on you know there was a registration that happens in the room and that's the message that I've actually sent it and for these demo purposes instead of looking at a live video stream we have a snippet of video that we've stored on local share on the data box edge and I'm going to send it a command by clicking on the capture video which tells the data box age to load up this video and then start doing its inference on it right so this is the video that we're actually playing on or the data box edge is actually picking up and reading to the right of this video you'll actually see the frame that causes the that causes the the actual inference success you know and what are you looking for you're looking for a person a patient coming in the room or a patient coming inside the room on a gurney and it's going to find that you know it's going to highlight it right here and you also see other frames you know for varying confidence that it actually identified you know and this helps us sort of you know fine-tune it a little more right in a normal production scenario obviously you won't be you know sending these images out of the data box edge because for compliance and regulatory purposes right so but for this testing reasons you know it's great thing to do right you know and what it's doing is is writing it to the cloud share on the data box edge and data bar station does it's magic sends it over to the to Azure you know into blob storage and what this applications really doing is just retrieving those images down and just playing it out what I think is actually kind of neat about this which does not necessarily make sense for like you know in a testing lab but it kind of it helps especially for here for demo logistics as well is that you're not actually connected to the box right this box is in Boston is in Boston right and so what you did was you sent a message to the Box through the cloud right to say like hey like start processing and then it processed on its own and then when it found something it said it sent a message back to you through as you're saying hey found something and here's the path in Azure storage where the result is that's correct right and then you just load it up here in your application yep right yes you do you have this kind of like you know like even though you're doing all the processing down at the edge you don't have to kind of have something you know you can kind of like do all this routing out through the cloud and have it all be cloud exactly leveraging the IOT hub to to do all this Zen we have well we'll do questions a little bit but yeah there's just like thanks much Ria's Taylor yeah absolutely there's one more project that I want to talk about briefly and that's this thing that we're doing sort of on internally and on the Microsoft campus we have a bunch of parking lots and it's the same concept again it's this idea of like infrastructure you already have that you can make smarter so we have been to parking lots on the Microsoft campus as you can imagine we have a bunch of employees they drive to work to any place to park and we've actually kind of started working with our facilities team about hey how can we like make some of the parking lot stuff more efficient and what's really actually interesting is like some of the garages at Microsoft campus the new ones have like all this really fancy stuff right they have like a little they have all this hardware above each parking space and a little light like nose if a car is in them or not and like you can tell like where cars are and you know but obviously that's sort of pretty expensive to outfit the garage it's a lot of stuff and so we've been talking about like hey like you already have cameras right they used mostly for security and facilities purposes like what if we could figure out what's going on in the parking lot just from those cameras and so what this is this is a map of one of the floors the parking garage and kind of overlaid on top of it is like the camera coverage that exists for the existing cameras for those and like kind of what they see and sort of some sample images that come from each of those cameras and what we've done is we were kind of building this thing that can kind of look at those images and kind of figure out what's going on and then once it kind of figures out what's going on in the image it can kind of map them to what's going on in the parking lot and kind of the same idea of getting kind of things out of the data so here you have this concept of right the original image and then you know cars that we detected right by running in a a module on data box edge then also like this idea that we talked about about sensitive info removed right like if you want to be maybe saving this data or doing something with it right this is an auto-generated thing you can tell it's not super sophisticated we detected cars and then we blurred out the box where the car was right sometimes you don't need to do super crazy stuff sometimes you can just do kind of simple stuff and that's actually I think one of my favorite things about like the Olympus scenario as well like there's a lot of times with machine learning we're trying to do these really complex hard things but sometimes you can get a lot of value just by doing the simple stuff right like having a fixed camera in an operating room identify when a gurney comes in and out of the room is actually on machine learning scale problems like not a super hard problem right it's relatively easy to kind of train that model there's only one camera there's a fixed lighting set it's in a static location right most of the equipment in the room you know kind of is sort of generally static there's a lot of people in the room but the concept of like a big horizontal table and a person on it like looks a lot different than all the other stuff and all you got to know is like it went in the room and it went out of the room right so you know the surgery is ready to start because the patient is there and you know the surgery is done because the patient left right and in doing that like sometimes just doing those little things can get you a lot of value and I think that's kind of one of the really neat things about kind of looking at these existing kind of pieces of data that people have available to them and trying to figure out like hey how can we add a little intelligence to this and we don't necessarily have to do like super hard crazy stuff we can just look for the easy things and start there and like and build from that so this you know this is kind of how the parking-lot image works this is the same kind of concept right so we have you know a bunch of you know you have the parking lot actually and I'll talk about the unity stuff in a minute which is also a pretty cool idea so you have the parking lot and then that comes into all these containers those so you have here in the set you have the image acquisition containers and that's a container that sort of designed to pull data from each sort of video feed or each camera feed obviously like you know most of the time with stuff you're using like you're kind of doing test data so you don't actually have like a live camera feed but what we can do is and what we've done is we set up sort of like this archived video they can kind of sort of broadcast a sort of a test scheme and then those containers can kind of pull that feed down and then it runs through object detection it organizes the frames to figure out what's going on and then from that it can it can kind of like compute with kind of what's going on in the parking lot with all those different pieces and and then it kind of uploads things to as your files in this case and then you know the developer for this wrote a as your app service on Linux which is up in the cloud and that's sort of a web page right that allows you to have a dashboard of what's going on the parking lot and it actually has you know it does do the thing where it uploads kind of some decent-sized frames so you can kind of get a sense of what's going on in each place if you want to kind of click through or see if something looks weird and you know we'd use IOT hub causes DB for some of the storage stuff all those pieces so it's the same idea that you have something at the edge that's running and it's kind of calculating this calculating these things down at the edge but then making kind of full use of the cloud Jim question right so the question is if we train the model in unity and then in deploy it on real feed and what and so what's happening here is sort of two things so we train the model in so we train the model with the video but then we also use unity to supplement that training data and so what unity allows us to do is build synthetic data that allows you to so we built sort of a unity model of that same space and we use the video plus additionally kind of this concept of synthetic data right synthetic data to Train and you put it all together and it does actually increase the value of the bottle yeah yeah so they said that's interesting to use the cons reason synthetic gator to train and then use it for reality stuff which is something that we've seen a lot this idea that like you can use synthetic data to supplement real data in order to do training because that a lot like real data is sometimes hard to get right and especially if you want to sort of train on certain circumstances or certain things you want to create you can train you can kind of it's a lot easier to create that when you have control over the environment what you do when you're doing something and kind of in a simulated or synthetic environment so overall I like to talk about the way that compute model modules have these sort of endless possibilities right and we've talked about a lot of those today and a lot of the different ways to do things but it's really just this concept of like you know you can do these like serverless event-driven as your functions you can filter out values you can like process data you can run you know you can read video streams you can call out to other Azure API it's like you're not limited to what's built in and kind of help in the box you can do local API calls either in or out of those modules right so your module now is running on your local network it can do an API call to a local system that you have and kind of interact with those local systems your local systems can do API calls into your modules sort of all those things are all possible with these containers right on the edge because you're deploying kind of whatever compute you want in a container down to the edge this is my market tech chure slide right classic joke and so overall I see data box edge kind of in the left over here and it has those three things I talked about it has its sort of local like kind of cache storage it has as IOT edge modules and it has that FPGA with agile machine learning and it has this optimized data transfer to move up to the cloud sensors can talk into sort of the IOT I just system your on-premises data can talk to the local storage do as SMB or NFS shares and really there's this concept here to that that I want to talk about this idea that like even if you don't necessarily want to save all your data at the edge the storage gateway can be really useful when doing machine learning because you can be processing the data as it comes in and maybe you get a result you don't quite understand or get something that's in your like kind of gray area a confidence level you can take the source data for that and write it to the storage gateway will save it up to Azure for you and then you can now have it up in Azure and you can use it to retrain your model right so you can go you can look at that data the confused your model you can then go and kind of like label it figure out what's really going on there and then crank it back through the eyes machine learning system create your new model and then because we just talked about how easy it is to deploy things down to the edge and your model is just a container you just add it into next we add the new version of the model to your next IOT hub edge deployment and we'll deploy that container back down into the edge and you have an updated thing so it's this sort of ecosystem or workflow of improving your machine learning models even out in the field that you can do by detecting kind of what's not working and then getting that source data up to the cloud like a little bit about adder machine learning so overall there's an azure machine learning service and it has a variety of different ways to kind of build and train your models right so you can use you know there's command-line interface there's vs code there's notebooks just kind of the most common thing that we kind of use and see internally there's open source Python IDE stuff there's all these different ways to kind of and the goal with the adsorption Learning Team is to kind of bring you kind of let you use the tools that you're used to to train an agile team learning model so when you train that model then also you can use local resources you can scale out we using Azure machine learning compute right so we obviously have a wide variety of cloud services that you can use to like you know run compute things and train models and then also Apache spark is supported by Azure ml and overall what happens with these things though is it like I said it kind of you get that model and then you call into a Zorgon machine learning service and it will create for you the docker container that we talked about right and that docker container you can now use to deploy on-prem through a normal dry OT edge kind of any IOT edge device as we're going you can run it and as your container instances you can run it in the ashram management IT service you can do some IOT accelerated targets and of course the one we're talking about today is it can target the FPGA on a data box edge so when you install that module when it boots up and starts it finds the FPGA device it flashes it and then it and kind of and what you know flashes it with the acceleration for your model and then away you go talked a lot about cloud manages let's say again I mean you saw the demo that the whole thing is managed from the cloud through the azure portal and I guess there's an important point there right you can configure the system monitor health install updates rights if you want to update the system that's a button or an API call in the azure portal pricing is really important data box edge cost six hundred ninety five dollars a month and then it's available in the United States and in the EU today we're working to expand that quite a bit like I said that price you don't have to purchase the hardware use of the hardware is included in that price and you pay as you go so you get this large server class machine which is like I said it actually has two Intel Xeon processors in it it has a 12 terabytes of local flash storage as a giant pile of fast storage it's a 1u server it's got a ton of networking so it's got all these different things that you can use for all that purpose and then kind of an away you go we think it's a great value at the price point it's at and you don't have to buy the hardware like I said there's no kind of capital expenditure there's something to kind of keep on your books those pieces yeah yeah and all these slides will be available as well kind of to the build site as well so availability like I said it's a it runs only in certain adjure services but you can connect to any storage account kind of worldwide so you just the availability for the Azure region is just about what what region you use to control the device and then like so you can order it today so you can go to a kms and that'll get drop you in the right place in Azure portal to order a device or you can just search for it in kind of you know creating your resources thing and as my data box hedge there and get to that same place I will say we always value your feedback so we'd love for you to fill out a session or fill out a feedback thing after your session thanks so much for coming there's like a minute left if anybody has any questions and I'll be up in the front as well afterwards questions yeah hello I got a question about critical edge devices first is a how do you handle streaming data I know the event how about that service pass or even that little finger they are too heavy for the edge it's the first part you mean the like sorry it is like stream data to the cloud or oh yeah okay for the ideas they have to yeah so usually what happens is you have your module which either has will read like an RTS T or streaming image feed everything about video images or you know you doesn't have that it we don't we right now don't have tools to do it automatically I think in the future you might find some of those other Microsoft services I talked about with edge tools might have those the second part is how do you secure the bugs so the boss itself is an appliance model and so it runs sort of with so we also going to need a full like kind of we have sort of a the security to expect for a machine as a TPM chip it has all those pieces running on it but the actual kind of login process you use so you use natural portal see I'm on a secure account and then we kind of weave secure to that and then locally it you kind of you kind of access it through a username and password stuff yeah what type of data gets stored in the provisioning regions in the provisioning regions that's just configuration data for the box so it's things like the name of the resource - name of the box name of like the the name of the shares and what storage accounts are connected to those sorts of pieces there's not any none of the file data ends up there yeah one one quick question so for the for the use case that was shown fabric up or something that all of us had built right if I'm developing a version 2 of that app can i deploy from a Sherpa to that custom-built app down on as a continuous module and replace the existing one like something of yeah you can right so when you deploy a new version you just specify a new deployment and it will replace your existing thing and instead of and deploy the new one on top of the existing one at that make sense like it takes down two modules and turns it and do more deals I deployed this one and then phased out the earlier one it doesn't do a phase out it takes it down and then starts up the second one so you do enter a little bit of down down there alright and one last question yeah we are maintaining the high availability down at the IO th I heard someone's like session about kubernetes cluster powering IOT is that that's something we're working on I know hear more about that soon okay thanks very much thanks very much guys I got the red light up here so enjoy your conference Thanks
