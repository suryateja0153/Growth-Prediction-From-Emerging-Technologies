 welcome to techwisetv my name is Rob Boyd today hyperflex 4.0 that's right it's time to check back in with our favorite hyperconvergence platform now hitting its stride and its fourth techwisetv episode what a ride it has been from initial launch to market leadership as proven with recognition from Forrester Wade and the Gartner Magic Quadrant while Mike Zimmerman is gonna join us here in the lab to show us just how easy it all gets with hyperflex at the edge and inter-site Cisco's cloud-based automation and analytics platform we also have guests from both Intel and Citrix as we dive into the how what and why around storage performance and what that's doing for our customers with all nvme but first KT the face of Cisco hyper flex for the show anyway joins me right now in the lounge all right Katie hey so good to have you back here we're talking hyper flex of course right yes yeah you're always here for hyper flex because now it's four dot oh you guys continue to come out with new innovations but let's set the groundwork first and just kind of from your perspective what is the state of the data center these days yeah I think the fundamental question is what is the data center oh and the data center is where the data is okay but something's changing the data is moving right it's moving into the cloud some of it and some of it is moving into the edge the edge location so that data center that now needs to move to all of these locations the data center needs to move to the edge and needs to move to the cloud but all of these whether it's the edge the cloud or the core need to work together to deliver what our customers are looking for help me understand what is important about what we're doing now with 4.0 what do you hang your hat on well the first thing on for dotto is what we're doing in the edge environments so we've got the hyper flex two node edge divides for for those environments it's managed from the cloud with inter site and it's managed with a nifty new innovation called a cloud witness that allows us to have a really slim form factor to node appliance at the edge locations that offers the same data resiliency that you would quickly get from a 3-node a much much heavier infrastructure with from the other players interested because it because the importance it's certain edge locations is how small can you go but still have a level of performance and a low level of data integrity and availability that's that you normally wouldn't associate with a with a site that small but the importance of the edge is saying we need answers for that area we need answers for that area but more importantly we need to drive the simplicity that people demand right so what's happening on the edge locations is people want to deploy a lot of edge locations in a very short amount of time with a level of control and simplicity they want so let's take an example let's say you were a store that had you know a hundred different edge storefronts okay and you wanted to deploy an edge cluster each one of those in the past you'd have wrapped and stacked all the equipment in one location then trucked it from location one to location 2 to location three and actually moved or flown people and technicians to each one of those location to get these things up it's super error-prone and it takes a lot of time how do we append something again well we've got inner site to help us today with hyper flex edge okay what we do is we just send all the equipment in parallel to all the locations the equipment calls in to the cloud - inner side inner side then delivers from the cloud the management capabilities to install the system bring it up get it running to upgrade it to manage it and to monitor it through the entire lifecycle ok so you're talking about a lot less people on the end that have to be involved with setting that up you just need to rack it and get it on get an IP address it's gonna be able to get all the information it needs once it's claimed back at the at the central site and inner site is now going to become your your central window for all your management across all your sites in one simple location that's right as well now you guys have always been really good about third-party validation testing and and making sure that that work loads were were everything we said that we claim them to be helping understand kind of where that's come out of historically because testing is important yeah you know how this started was we got ESG which is a third-party company to do these deaths in a much more controlled neutral way for us right comparing us against a competition and they found that we could do with four nodes what a competition needed notes to do oh okay so you're comparing four notes to their four nodes and you're seeing higher performance on it on a comparison of nodes between competitors yeah four notes or four nodes we get higher performance better consistency but if you just take what are four nodes can do you will need big multiple of nodes depending on which competition if you're looking at to do the same thing that we can do to support the same number of VMs you'll need much much more from our competition what is that well does that translate to in terms of customers if they just deploy a few more nodes is that a big deal or does it make a big difference well first of all they're paying more right so they're paying more for the nodes it's much more licensing costs it's much more space in the datacenter it's much more pooling and complexity in terms of rack management and so forth but then again even if they did all that let's say money was no object for these guys which it doesn't but let's it was they're still not getting the consistency that we deliver with our four nodes even with they're much more complicated system okay well now that you guys have done those comparisons I've seen those and that was the all-flash system which is still really does really well but amazingly enough what's been the testing now with all nvme so all enemy takes this to a whole different level right and when we started looking at the all nvme perform and he said well who do we compare against and we'd really need to now look at the next best thing that was out there which was our all-flash systems we had yes you look at you know are all ran nvme versus our all-flash system and you again deliver much much more for the customers on this much better performance much lower latency really you know shines in those applications that demand it like like the databases Oracle's and so forth of the world oh wow so a lot of mission critical workloads now can can run on these hyper converged systems from Cisco specifically so hyper flex that's right you don't really need to to worry as much about whether or not you can count on it you've got the performance and the latency the demand before we go and we're gonna go to a panel in just a moment and talk to Intel and Citrix and talk a little bit about the co innovations been happening there but I wanted to ask you you were with Google Next recently we made some announcements there one if you could just give us a little recap what is it you we announced it Google Next so when IT wants to serve its internal stakeholders one of the stakeholders is do and what developers are talking about is containers today yeah Google's a leader in that space Google pioneered kubernetes which is one of the dominant technologies in the space we've been working with Google for a long time or this technology in fact we got a technology partner of the year of war two years in a row for the container category so we allow a little bit about a partnership last year earlier we announced at the Google next event a partnership with Google clouds anthos now what Altos does is it takes the kubernetes control plane and delivers that from the Google cloud but to take that Google technology and democratize it for enterprise customers to use in their controlled data centers that's where we come in right so we've partnered with them with number of technologies hyperflex as the elastic infrastructure on which anthos will run with persistent storage plugins that we've developed with them so that their containers can access the storage in our infrastructure we manage our infrastructure from the cloud with inner side they manage Antos from the cloud with their control plane networking is important when you're talking containers because now you've got a network at multiple different layers you for the physical network you've got a container networking area you've got these virtual network and they've got networking and the services layer if all of these aren't married together and don't work consistently in terms of policy and intent you get chaos so we're working with them with ACI and their technology in order to integrate those networking technologies so there's a number of technologies from Cisco and and Google coming together to bring to enterprise IT a elastic infrastructure that they can support containers on for their stakeholders that developers stakeholders back home Wow okay you guys have been busy a lot a lot of stuff happening thank you so much I know we're not saying goodbye yet because in just a moment we're gonna go we're gonna go step into the panel will talk to Citrix and Intel and after that we're gonna be in the lab with Mike Zimmerman where we actually get to see what it looks like doing this type of deployment through inter site angle little look at the gear it's gonna blow your mind just how easy this stuff is getting but hold on for that first we go to the panel right now alright so we have a panel a panel of experts no less Katie of course any time I'm talking hyperflex also Jim from Citrix thank you so much for joining us John from Intel you guys represent a lot of work that's been going on recently let's start from a Citrix perspective we talk about new things with hyper flex on this show today you guys have been right there with us working on new services and possibilities for your customers as we work together can you go through a little bit of that yeah you know I'd sitter's we think about the future of work right in fact we think a lot about the future of work but in particular we talk about the digital workspace and that's really the aggregation of multiple applications whether it's mobile labs SAS apps virtual labs or on-premise and present those together with files and data in a unified fashion for where the worker the the beauty of is that we can now deliver that via a Citrix cloud service which is really a control plane that sits in the cloud but allows for that absent data to be residing locally on-premises in this case on a hyper flex environment right now and so that provides a little bit more security level of control for the customer to be able to do that and what we've done is establish a cloud connector between hyperflex and citrus cloud services that allows for a simplified deployment and manageability of those environments Oh interesting so on the edge appliance because it still becomes important even in these mixed environments something we have to be able to process at that edge yeah it's a recurring theme just like we talked about as data moves everywhere where as work moves everywhere data centers move everywhere need a control plane in the cloud whether it's for infrastructure which is what we do with inner site or whether for work and the Citrix ecosystem that you need a control plane in the cloud to manage the work space on the edge so we need that control we need that flexibility we also need performance I think that's a that's a popular word at Intel so what have you guys been doing lately for performance it's definitely part of our DNA and I think one of the Holy Grails we look at for performance is a relationship between the CPU memory and storage and what we can do to open up more high bandwidth connectivity between there to get better utilization that ultimately allow you to do more with that data that you get through so for us octane technology is when the most exciting developments over the last 25 years for the memory world and being able to take nvme technology now bring it high-speed interconnect with the CPU working on this spec working in the platform engineering with Cisco doing the optimizations with our partners it's districts and bringing together performance that is exponentially better than what we could have delivered with previous traditional all-flash environments it's exciting for anybody that doesn't understand what nvme is is there a high level way to maybe explain what it does differently you know the way I would look at it is if we look at the traditional relation between memory and the CPU it's almost like traveling on what I would call a two-lane highway versus a superhighway as far as your ability to push information back and forth between the two and a really coherent high speed way and to be able to do that when you can access information with lower latency higher performance better endurance better density the attributes are compelling if we look at performance in a sequel or an Oracle world where it's high double-digit improvements over an all flash environment with latency that's more than 30 percent reduction I mean that's that's for us that's the holy grail when you have that meaningful improvement in your ability to process and transact the data with that latency just getting to a place that's pretty compelling well if one of the things Rob just to add to that is all the brilliant work that's happened to make this possible at Intel right we've worked together with them our teams and the Intel teams to take that take that innovation and make it Enterprise great so that when a tech in a data center accidentally remove the drive or accidentally insert the drive the system recovers from that or doesn't even feel feel the pinch yeah so making those technologies enterprise creating something that's been a perfect collaboration between the two companies I wanted to talk about a healthcare example as a as a way to understand kind of where the rubber hits the road in terms of the increased performance gains that we're seeing here what we're able to do with hyper flex and the type of applications and databases and things we can support now that that maybe weren't ever considered previously are now all on the table it really seems like that Jim you guys have worked with epic for quite a while I just did a high-level can you kind of give us an idea of what epic is it's in healthcare it's about medical records yes from the epic is a technology provider that services the healthcare organizations and the ability to provide medical records imaging to either clinicians organizations healthcare organizations as well right and so these serve as a highly regulated industry with a lot of mission-critical data as well okay there's less to that platform like when we think of database is one things of Oracle sequel sa P right and one thing to medical software software for the for the healthcare world one things of epic and there's the epic hyperspace which is a which is a presentation layer which is what the doctors and nurses interact with when they're looking at your bed tonight and then there's the epic cached database which requires the performance and all of all the performance you can throw at it this is mission critical and now we're able to support that database and were able obviously the presentation layer we can do these things with hyper flex and nvme be honest we're doing a lot of things along with long with citrix to do serve healthcare companies with that presentation layer with all the innovation that intel's bringing to the table that epic cached database gets the performance it needs to be working along with epic with that with apartment and intel and and Citrix do to make this all work together and I think really what it does is you know improve reliability right the better performance and of course better experience for the clinicians as well in terms of using that medical records we also think you're in environments they where workloads are incredibly dynamic their most you no longer have the ability to work at workloads in a very singular fashion so being able to support these mixed environments with high performance simplified management the ability to deploy it and be able to serve the needs of that user and then healthcare environment at scale I mean that's a pretty profound solution if you get it right you talked about reducing latency and I'm always struck by the fact that well each of us potentially looks at latency as a different set of things and and really what we're talking about with is all nvme is we're talking about getting rid of what is essentially that kind of that slow storage area that sometimes doesn't keep up with the data processing capabilities now you guys are able to marry this much closer so that together we can deliver applications and services in a predictable fashion which is something we're always fighting to get more of I think here so this is impressive thank you so much for taking the time thanks for having us appreciate Citrix coming out as well and appreciate your partnership is that it's a lot more stuff coming out as we move forward thank any final word Kitty yeah what I would say is it is so unbelievable to have partners such as Intel such as Citrix innovating and getting us all this innovation so that we as Cisco can certainly innovate within our walls but we can innovate with partners and bring those technologies to market whether it's the healthcare or any kind of market in the data center at the edge yeah thanks for helping us make some really great platforms Mike welcome to techwisetv always excited when someone's willing to bring in the gear especially when the gear is not that easy to travel with tell me a little bit about what you brought here first sure we've got a couple different things to look at here closest to me are a couple different systems but these would be more traditionally found in the core or the data center so the first thing that we've got with hx4 Otto is are all nvme converging of four hyper flex okay so there's a 1ru system with all nvme drives in it we've also got our all flash 240 which is a 2 are you ok again these are traditionally you know higher performance traditionally found more core and data center they're closest to you we've got a two node edge system so something new with HX 4.0 is our 2 node 3 node and 4 node options there for edge so we can actually deploy a remote edge deployment at this small yeah with just these two nodes but one of the big stories we talk about 4.0 is we talk about inter site so we're talking about different things we can do with nodes and we're also talking about inner site every wonder if we'd start there you've got this up on screen yeah yeah yeah so inter-site really enables you know our global view really of our infrastructure any UCS based infrastructure right so if it's your UCS servers and your hyper flex clusters so as we talk about you know data at the edge and infrastructure at the edge as well as obviously we know customers have data centers still as well you know it becomes a lot to manage and and really being able to get a global view of all of your infrastructure across the globe it is huge with an inner sight ok so what we're looking at here is the dashboard for inter site so as an admin when I log in I can see my customized view of the information that's really pertinent to me or my business right so you know in this case I've got hyper flex information up here but but don't forget UCS is also a big part of inter site as well so again that's that customized dashboard that I see when I log in we also just something I want to point out here is with inner site this is a cloud-based you know run by Cisco offering right so it's a SAS model and the cool thing here is that we can add new features to enter site really as quickly as we can develop them so customers don't have to wait for upgrading their management systems that's how you know is that white line pops up you go right by the way you've got more capability that's right that's right even more by clicking here I like that my Meraki and some other things that I use at home you're always on the latest version have the latest bug fixes that type of thing now perfect so now what we can do we've kind of seen our dashboard here let's let's quickly go over to our hyper flex clusters view here and you can see I've got four hyper flex clusters running here I've got three edge clusters here okay so these are all two node hyper flex edge systems I've got one just to show you kind of across the globe here I've got one running in Atlanta ones actually in Colorado okay and ones in Sydney Australia as well and then our fourth one here is actually an all nvme so this is actually running back in our data center actually here in San Jose ok just like this one here that's right so what we can actually do is drill down you know we've got that high-level view but let's say we want to now kind of drill down into a specific cluster ok how do we do that so we can actually pick a cluster here just go over here to the actions here and we'll launch hyperflex connect so this is now a kind of streamlined view and this is this should be very familiar to our ivx customers because this is the same kind of management platform that's now proxied through inter site so now we get that specific cluster view creating things like virtual machines and clones and creating data stores that type of thing so very familiar right where you knew you'd be but you did not have to open any other application to get to the right it's all from the site that's right we jump to Atlanta ok yeah yeah we did and and the really cool thing you know we'll be talking about the hyper flex for auto 2 node edge system right yes this one here and really when you think about a two node clustered system sometimes that can bring issues and sometimes you have to run things of something called a witness or an arbitrator so our competitors typically this is a virtual machine for each cluster that you would have to deploy and operate and manage upgrade that type of thing better you have a slide on this let's bring that slide up for one second so understanding when we when you talk about an invisible cloud witness you're talking about solving an issue that some may forget about when you get down to two nodes what is that problem that's being solved here that's right when you have a clustered system that's only two nodes you know and those nodes lose connectivity both nodes kind of think the other one you know is not healthy right so so they kind of take control they want to take control they want to be the master right so it's kind of a short way to explain that but I want to leave my two teenagers at home and I'm tried here to San Jose they're both in fight for control that's right that's right this is an arbiter that's right so you have an arbitrator a witness virtual machine sometimes that's as many as one VM per cluster and so you can imagine running resource or resources that are required to run those virtual machines especially at a large scale yeah tens hundreds thousands of clusters that's the same number being she doing is simply resolving arguments or potential disputes between these two boxes which is a big thing an important thing to do but you're saying we can do it in an invisible way so in other words light no touch support let's right through inter-site that's right and so you see here if it's one site up to you know beyond 2,000 sites it doesn't matter this is all invisible behind the scenes from inner sight there's no management burden for our customers there's no cost included in the do it like the cloud we got security taken care of in there it's a sound protocol and I believe you had told me it does not use much in terms of resources across the lands right you're not a very light ok let's go back over to your to your inner sight interface yeah tell me what's important to to go to from here yeah so now we're gonna kind of take a look at you know what does it take to actually create a hyper flex cluster through inter site okay and and this process really comes from our heritage with UCF's right if you're you know service profiles right yeah so these service profiles are really logical configurations that we can apply to a physical server so we actually take the same approach with hyperflex clusters in this case we have something called hyper flex cluster profiles and that profile that hyper flex cluster profiles is again really very analogous to a UCS service profile where we can define the configuration and then apply it to a system after the fact so let's say that I'm working on a big deployment I could be building everything I care about in software here through inter site before anything has had to ship and once it ships as I believe you had said as part of a deployment or maybe haven't talked about that part yet but the idea is that they can come in and be connected I think ever Devon Cady they come in and they claim ownership essentially within a nurse that's right I mean you think about if you're rolling out a number of edge sites right really the ideal situation is I can ship the the the gear out to each site not really have to send all my expertise you know it's very expensive to send your your experts out to each site and go figured as we ship it for them like straight from the fact we can reshape it don't have to touch them in a central site at all right you don't have to stage it in the data center okay ship it right to the the the target site basically the edge site and we basically need an IP on the system for management at that point we can manage and push down the configuration for minutes the way things are done these days yeah yeah about time we did for computer I like it okay and so this is just kind of showing a deployed r2 node edge cluster in Atlanta showing our profile and this really is just a collection of policies that define the information required to create a cluster yeah so things like IPs DNS time is live just text files aren't they so their policies policies become something so you can replicate them you can modify them in small ways if necessary can modify the cool thing is the reusability so right if I'm creating a number of different cluster profiles some of that data some of that information is going to be unique but some of that's going to be reusable too right so waste not want not that's right if I have multiple sites in the same time zone yeah they may use the same DNS and NTP server right so we create one policy and we can use that policy across multiple cluster profiles that kind of reminds me I hope I'm not jumping out of order here but in just in terms of automation what type of tools exist for us to be able to interact with this with if maybe we're already bought into some automated or script based things right really everything you see in the UI is available via the the rich API as well so there's a rest-based API so okay the really cool thing is when we talk about scale you know large you know hundred sites thousand sites that type of thing right if you're doing those types of deployments we can actually create all the data in an Excel spreadsheet and feed that into inter-site and have it create the policies and profiles you know if you're talking a thousand sites I mean that's huge right so and again what we talked about as all the gear for those thousand sites can be sent directly to each location yeah and then all we do is marry the two together the HX close I'll come fall with the gear the logic of that okay so it really just becomes a no-brainer in terms of deploying across you know a large scale a number of absolutely so yeah so you know we've talked about you know creating through API right at a large scale we've talked about the policies and profiles here the other thing we can do is we can actually clone cluster profiles as well so you know if we're maybe creating a few you know not large number let's say we can actually select a cluster profile and clone as well okay we're gonna click clone and and again we can create one or more cluster profile you can do this in mass or you can do one onesie twosie that's right as needed it seems pretty easy and straightforward intuitive yeah that's right yeah any other the cool thing here's you know we've talked about deployments right but if we start talking about de to operations too right we talked about throwing the operation afterwards that's right okay so we're gonna keep these things running right yeah so when your site helps with that as well that's right so we can actually do things like upgrades through three inner site as well so we can actually select one or more clusters and select a target version of hyper flex and upgrade those as well in parallel that's the cool thing is no it's not one at a time so okay so this is okay very nice and they say man there's obviously inter sites also telling you if you've got anything that's kind of out of balance that's right if you will in terms of things being at different levels or something like that so when we talk about automatic upgrades because they're cloud-based system we're only talking about the interface and the the system running that so it's not touching your operation you're obviously fully in control of what you decide to push out that's right and kind of a good segue into something we call connected tach as well so this is you know something that and customers can actually opt into having inter-site create tach cases for them to write so if we if we notice a an issue with a drive something maybe even before customer notices the inner site can can open tach cases automatically so it sounds like we're moving to a much more proactive notion of what tach can do there's an awareness before you're having to get involved per se so when you do talk to tach they're already in motion on something or aware of something so that you're both moving at the speed of the business it's being proactive and taking the burden off and cost off the customer yeah but I sort of make sure everyone understands or make sure I understand it's either site is a it has a free tier that we encourage everyone running UCS or hyper flex you can participate in the system very simple to just simply see what kind of data you can see because what you'll notice is there's some free things what are some free things that we get out of inter-site right off the bat pretty much everything we've talked about here is available in that and that free based here and if you have a Cisco of CCO account would you very much anybody have email or the email account you can log into inter site and start managing your components from your UCS based components from there and then when you start adding up then you say connect attack and some other things like that may cost a bit more but you can at least start getting immediately getting the visibility understanding what's happening add your components there you kind of see the value we keep invisibility stuff I think that's an incredible amount of value right off the bat Mike thank you so much thanks for your time guys thanks for watching I hope you learned something today about hyperflex 4.0 be sure and check out inner sight that's an obvious one but obviously go to the website you find on the screen for more information thanks for watching techwisetv we'll see you on the next one
