Huntsville Alabama the research that Huntsville Alabama the research that Huntsville Alabama the research that happens at Hudson alpha is some of the happens at Hudson alpha is some of the happens at Hudson alpha is some of the latest and greatest findings that are latest and greatest findings that are latest and greatest findings that are going to translate into better care and going to translate into better care and going to translate into better care and really just a better quality of life for really just a better quality of life for really just a better quality of life for humans all over the world is happening humans all over the world is happening humans all over the world is happening at Hudson alpha where we're at Hudson alpha where we're at Hudson alpha where we're concentrating human genomics right now concentrating human genomics right now concentrating human genomics right now is in the area of rare disease we is in the area of rare disease we is in the area of rare disease we recently opened a clinic for children recently opened a clinic for children recently opened a clinic for children who are born with the condition that who are born with the condition that who are born with the condition that can't be diagnosed these children will can't be diagnosed these children will can't be diagnosed these children will almost certainly go through a diagnostic almost certainly go through a diagnostic almost certainly go through a diagnostic Odyssey of going from hospital to Odyssey of going from hospital to Odyssey of going from hospital to hospital to try to figure out what's hospital to try to figure out what's hospital to try to figure out what's wrong with them the ability to sequence wrong with them the ability to sequence wrong with them the ability to sequence the genome will answer that question the genome will answer that question the genome will answer that question half the time within the genomics half the time within the genomics
