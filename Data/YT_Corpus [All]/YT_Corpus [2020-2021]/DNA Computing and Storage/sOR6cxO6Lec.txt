 this is my pleasure to introduce you to miss Terry Onica is the director of the automotive company QAD as director of the automotive at QAD Terry is responsible for global marketing activities which include strategy and positioning her product and offering people and knowledge and field and sells marketing support for the automotive vertical Terry works in close consort with customers to try best practices and [...] for supplier status she also is an industry leader in the development and global [...] on our supply chain industry standards and best practices prior to joining QAD Terry worked at GM for and Johnson Controls she has been immersed in the automotive supply chain and technology space throughout our 30-year career currently Terry is an active member of our Automotive Industry Action Group which is AIAG supply chain steering committee Terry is one of the authors of the global material management operations guideline and logistics evaluation which is used by thousands of automotive suppliers globally currentl-right now she has been awarded several times by AIAG and awarded for rising the government of global supply chain standards in the areas of assessment key performance indicators supplier agreements and EDI additionally she has been awarded for her global work in supply chain in 2005 she received practitioner pro to know by supply and demand chain executives in 2018 bronze [...] winner by [...] hour for women in business and 2018 notable woman in technology by [...] Detroit of business so she's also our graduate from black Bachelors of Science degree in computer information system and C graduate in 1990 lets give her a big hand and welcome her to our campus today Thank you...such an honor to be back here I was telling you when I have flashbacks of this room I used to be my economy class so when I walked in I'm like oh that's what it was so such a pleasure to be here with you all today what I'm going to be talking about is really the automotive industry and some of the challenges that are going on in the industry and really how we can apply technology to solve these issues that we have in automotive to really we all want a cheaper car right we don't want to spend a lot of money for our cars so that means that the automotive suppliers have to really always keep their costs down right and in order to do that one of the key ways they do that is to really be able to manage their supply chain efficiently so I'm going to talk about this in a standard that I helped to co-author in the automotive community and then also talk about advanced technology like machine learning and data Lakes all this new technology that's out there to help us solve solve business problems but before I get started just a little bit of background on myself I know she already introduce me but I think the most key thing is I'm an LTU graduate of 1990 I hope I give you all inspiration it took me 10 years to get my my bachelor's so I went started at Macomb Community College I got my associates and it was at the end when an associate's really wasn't meaning very much I went to Oakland University for a semester and I just didn't like it and then my brother-in-law well he's not my brother-in-law my sister's boyfriend at the time he was going to Lawrence Tech and he liked it he talked my sister Kim to go to Lawrence Tech I thought they said you ought to try it so I came here and I really enjoyed it and I got my my option was in computer information systems so I hope I give you hope sometimes life seems like it's a real struggle you might have multiple jobs lots going on in your plate but you can get through it another thing I want to share with you is back when I was in college talking in front of a classroom would be the last thing I want to do and you know another thing I can tell you to really force yourself to grow and my job because I was involved with industry standards I had start speaking in front of of audiences and I remember I would be rehearsing and practicing and I was a wreck but today you can really fight through it so I hope I bring that message to today life you can get through it just put the passion behind it and you'll you'll you'll be able to do that so very excited to be here today again have a lot of expensive background in supply chain another thing I wanted to mention too just to give a promotion to supply chain and information technology I know a lot of the young Millennials in the new people really want to be able to travel the world right when I started my job at QAD seventeen years ago I had never left North America today I've been to 32 countries because the auto industry is so global and my job best practices I need to teach it everywhere so it's a great thing to keep in mind with the advanced technologies that are out there the global the opportunity to travel and see the world is really amazing so I encourage you to think about that as well too we need more supply chain people just real quickly about my company we provide ERP software so you you automotive suppliers that provide like a steering wheel or an airbag or a seat use our software to manage their whole company so they have we have finances purchasing supply chain it's a full ERP system so we're very global and we've been around for since 1979 I graduated in 1980 so actually a year before I graduated from high school actually QAD was started so great own our owners are wonderful people another great story you know typical American Dream - they were our one owner he was his feet were really big so he had a hard time with shoes so he decided to start making his own and he had so good at it today the business is now Hoka or Uggs and so pam which is his wife the co-owner said well I needed to develop software for you to do that manufacturing and so that's why - they've been very successful and that's why our thing I want to mention in the verticals that we support I'm responsible for automotive but in the verticals we support it's all manufacturers that's all we support we don't do any other kind of business at QAD and just to give you an idea again this is the Chevy bolt bolt it's both an electric vehicle and an autonomous vehicle for General Motors and all these companies that you see around it are our customers so we are very strongly focused on automotive we call them tier ones because they provide perch directly into the OEMs like Ford Chrysler Fiat Chrysler so you know wiring harnesses power trains all kinds of things brakes and a lot of what you see around here is kind of scary because it's gonna be going away soon with the autonomous vehicle I was with a custom-prospect yesterday and I saw he they made horns and I was thinking you know in another 10 years we may not need horns right if everything's autonomous they should be riding off of each other they're not gonna be beeping at each other I don't think when you don't have a driver so so that's just a little bit of background about my company so you know where I where I'm coming from so in automotive it's all about quality cost and delivery I've been in the automotive industry my whole career it's all about that that's always the focus how do we get get the best quality because we don't want poor running cars how do I give them to the customers at the best cost and how do I make sure that we deliver those parts on time right we got to make sure that the parts get to the assembly plant at the right time so that you get your order from the dealership when you want to have it so very very important and we're living in a lot of uncertainty Akio Toyoda said we're in an era where the era where the only answers are really unknown we don't know Mary Barra from General Motors said we're gonna see more change in the next five years and we have in the last 50 so we are on full-fledged moving fast right now in the automotive industry and on top of that we have all these things going on with technology out there it is really mind-boggling change a change that we see right now of all the different things Internet of Things 3d printing I had a VP of BMW show me some printed parts that are actually going into a production vehicle you would never hear on that even five years ago so we are really going through a lot of change with technology and it's it's pretty exciting and kind of scary the other thing that's going on right now is the auto industries we're under major transformation because we're going from this combustion engine to an electric vehicle into autonomous vehicles and a Paul Eichenberg he does a lot of guest blogs so if you go to QAD dot-com slash blogs Paul Eichenberg he does a lot of really good articles about what this means to the automotive industry and that you really need to be prepared for what's ahead of what's ahead of you in the future and it's kind of scary because I go work with some smaller suppliers and they are not thinking electric vehicle autonomous vehicle they are still focused on this combustion engine which we know will go away so I can see that there could be some potential disruption if everybody doesn't really catch on to where the industry is really headed and then at in the industry actually teach a supply chain class where a lot of Tier one suppliers come to the class and now you know I'm a runner I love running you know when I think a Garmin I think well I have a Fitbit but I think of a fitness watch right so I'm teaching classes and now Garmin is coming to my supply chain class so we see brand new entrants and they're more and more technology going into the vehicle so it's really really really exciting so what's really driving the industry so this is a big deal right here is this volatile demand if you talk to anybody an automotive industry it's always like oh you know can they ever predict how many cars were gonna make right now it's always off it's too much it's too little but really what drives that volatile demand is us as consumers so years ago SUVs weren't popular now everywhere you go SUVs are popular in every country I was driving with my colleague in Shanghai and she was like I want an SUV I'm saying wow you know I'm not used to hearing them talk about everywhere so we start to shift what we'd like to have so that causes all the demand to change in the industry how fast or slow all this electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle is going to come in we're really not sure we've got guesses so all of this drives automotive companies crazy because trying to predict what I'm gonna build to keep my inventory right to keep my cost low is really important the supply chains are longer than ever and I'm a- I can tell you I've been to 32 countries they're all over the world you know they're very long in Russia there are supply chains and China Indonesia you know just every place you can think about has automotive production of some shape or form so really how do we manage these long supply chains globally and again deliver products on time achieving industry compliance you all automotive suppliers if I'm making a steering wheel or a brake you got to become a preferred supplier to a Ford or Chrysler or General Motors you got to really show them that I've got good delivery capabilities I can meet good quality standards I can meet cyber I don't have any cybersecurity issues this list goes on forever of what they demand of you as a supplier and so if the automakers themselves don't have a lot of expectations now we have a lot of government compliance so you know corporate responsibilities Conflict Minerals all kinds of financial things that they have to deal with and then the last column here is really how do you have good consistent global processes so for instance Yang Fang which used to be I used to work at Johnson Controls and now part of it is Yang Fang it's been bought by the Chinese so they have over a hundred manufacturing facilities all over the world that support production car production so hundred we've got Lear that has 200 sites around the world so lots of automotive production but what these suppliers really want to have is they want to have good global processes they want to have systems that run out of the box to best practices because my customer is breathing down my back that I have to be really good at what I do they always are trying to improve their performance right we've got to keep our quality cost delivery we need to keep that in line and then today what they're dealing with is industry 4.0 or these advanced technologies like machine learning artificial intelligence data Lakes so not only do I have to manage all this but now I got all this new technology coming in how am I going to manage that in my manufacturing facility to take advantage of that and a lot of what we're doing here with industry 4.0 is actually to help with skills gaps because a lot of people Millennials aren't interested in manufacturing anymore so if we can't replace those at the manufacturing facilities then maybe we need to do more projects with industry 4.0 to leverage intelligence to try to do some of that job that maybe we don't have the skills to do anymore so all of that really adds up to risk right you can see that an automotive supplier has so much risk facing them so how do we help them to manage that well through the industry AIAG and naturally I would encourage it's just across the street it's called the automotive industry Action Group it's literally right across the highway there and they manage all the standards for North America and Asia Pacific and then Odette manages all the standards in Europe so oftentimes these two will come together and they'll create a global standard so that if I have a standard on how to be best practice and supply chain it's not just for me and my in North America but I can apply that wherever I have facilities in the world because the auto industry is so global anymore so what I'm going to talk to you about is a document called MMOG/LE it stands for the materials management operations guideline logistics evaluation and this really is a focus to help you really improve your delivery or your supply chain in your manufacturing facility it is actually now just recently it used to be an Excel spreadsheet but it's with the modern times now it just got put on the cloud so there's thousands of suppliers all over the world I mean there's probably 10,000 suppliers they have to fill out this assessment that we put together and now they do that online they kind of go through each best practice and they tell their customer I have that capability or I don't once they get done then it'll tell them whether you're a world-class supplier or you have a lot of deficiencies so I started and actually 2001 and it's currently was just released and its fifth revision so I was thinking the other day I'm like wow it's not far away from being around industry for twenty years but it continues to get updated because it helps suppliers so much with their facilities so it was developed through the two standards organization and I've been a member of the author group for many years I think since version 2 and again you completed at the manufacturing level so if I'm a next tier they make steering wheels I would complete the MMOG/LE assessment for that one site now next here has probably 60 sites around the world so every site would have to complete that because every site runs differently has different management so they would have to complete that and then again once they're done it scores you and tells you just how good they are now obviously all OEMs want A suppliers they don't want a C supplier right nobody wants that disruptive supplier so if you score a level C your OEM is gonna be saying okay we got to work together we gotta get that score up to a level A this is actually what it covers within the supply chain so our students familiar with EDI okay good so they starts out getting that EDI those forecasts and the shipping requirements then I get those what my demand and my shipping schedule is gonna be now I got a plan on how I'm going to support that right so I may need to order from my sub suppliers and then from the suppliers then we'll ship and that obviously goes into inventory I also need to schedule out to my floor what parts I'm going to produce today and then eventually I ship that off to my customer okay so very important very important in today's age to is contingency plan so if something goes wrong if my suppliers can't ship me if I can't ship my customers if I don't have enough resources to build the part what am I gonna do because if you shut an assembly plant down so if I'm an Yang Fang GM down for one minute they charge me twenty seven thousand dollars every minute the ticks that you stop an assembly line is twenty seven thousand dollars that's the average going rate yeah (external question) what's the difference between EDI and ERP EDI is the way that a customer will communicate with a supplier so if I'm if I'm GM and you're Yang Fang I'll send you a schedule today and I'll tell you I want 100 pieces today I want 200 pieces tomorrow they do interior so maybe I want 100 seat sets today 200 seat sets tomorrow it gives you that schedule ERP then takes that feed ERP manages all of this it manages the whole everything in here would be a portion of ERP (External) So thats what you're company is (External) so is your company is there actually an office or is it all just cloud based our corporate is in Santa Barbra, California and we have an office here because of because of the automotive industry in Farmington Hills and we've got I think 27 offices all over the world so my role that my (External) So what you do then is the whole software the ERP so my role at my company is is I look at what's going on in automotive industry and I make sure our software can meet what's what's gonna be happening so I see that machine learning is taking off so I'm starting to help our R&D to develop to develop machine learning applications that fulfill a use case that will help our customers to be better does that make sense and I'm also listening through the industry what the requirements are going to be from them as well and hear what the OEMs are going to be requiring does that help (External) Is it hard for QAD to break into the buisiness there has to be a key right like how did - what was the - how did you become so successful (Terry) uh I think because SAP is our big competitor I'll be quite honest they're a very big competitor of ours I think with us what we've done is we've only focused on manufacturing where you've SAP does everything right so QED is just stuck to manufacturers and and in that area and I think we being here also in the auto industry really being at the heart beat of it and understanding what they need has helped us to really develop great software too I would say that's the success yes good questions and up at the top are the chapters and we'll talk about those a little bit later on a couple things I want to mention this assessment does have a hundred eighty-two requirements there's a full which is a hundred and eighty seven and the basic is just half of that that's used with the lower tier so you've got a Tier one then sometimes supply-chain tiers to the OEM can be six levels deep right so they can be very long so the basics use down the supply chain the key thing here this important is there's these F3 questions and if you just miss one you could get a hundred and eighty-six right and you miss just one you're automatically go to a c-level supplier why is that because if you're missing that one practice best practice we know you've got cracks in your foundation it's just like a house it's been translated into 11 languages and those F3 questions are really centered around everything needs to be automated anymore if we use Excel spreadsheets we know things are gonna break you can't communicate a spreadsheet quick enough around an organization and so it really does focus on using ERP the EDI bar coding even the quality processes making sure everything's fully integrated and automated so everybody can respond quickly yes (External) Fascinating how do you verify that the responses are true is it a written response or how do you verify This - The OEMs will come out in a nod at you the customer comes out and checks it yes yes and that's one of the things that we do at QAD too is we kind of help so before the OEM comes out we go in there and we tell you hey this is this based on our knowledge of this we know this will fail so we kind of help them before they get there if they need it (External) Is that what Boeng did wrong they didn't have (Terry) yes yes (External) They didn't have a validity follow up (Terry) so yeah the OEMs will definitely go out and take a look at it (External) So after the listing is it published is it available to the public yes you can go on the AIAG website AIAG.org (External) So you know who's A Who's B and Who's C oh no no that only the OEM knows that or the supplier knows that yes they right now they don't share that with each other no yeah but that they really would like to go there but thus far as I know I'm not going to share yes (External) is that like universities the grades are confidential (Terry) uh-huh (External) if I'm applying for a job and I asked my university to send the grades same thing when GM I want to be a supplier for GM (Terry) mm-hmm (External) then I've gone through this process and I ask that the company please send me my my scores to GM right that's when it gets A B or C (Terry) absolutely a great example is Ford is the most toughest on an MMOG/LE assessment I don't know if you ever seen a supplier you see Q1 a Q1 means that's the top level certification you can get for Ford that means that you're you're gonna keep getting business at that plant from Ford they so when people get that Q1 this is a part of having to get Q1 is to go through this audit so they'll say look at I got my Q1 flag I passed this with Ford and they'll use that as a selling point to get business yes but they'll do that but obviously if they didn't ago they wouldn't probably not want to say anything until we get that score up so again the full assessments use between the OEM which is again Ford Chrysler GM and the Tier one and the basic is used down the supply chain but the interesting thing today with technology is all those technology points doesn't matter if you're a large multinational tier 1 supplier or a little tier 2 or 3 you're expected to have automation within your organization so no manual processes because manual processes are just known to break and be slow and then the other thing we've done with MMOG/LE that the equivalent on the quality side is IATF 16949 so we've really made sure those work together so for instance automotive there's a term called the corrective action that means ok I I'm GM and Lisa just did something bad so I issue her corrective action and I tell her you need to fix this and you need to tell me how you're gonna fix it and make sure it never comes back again so those corrective actions could be towards supply chain people or it could be towards a quality issue so there's a lot of overlap in some places between and so we made sure that we minimize the duplication but we want to still make sure the thought is not missing that you look at it with both hats on these are the OEMs that use it around the world here's a list here of some of them in the middle these are some of the tier ones there's a lot of tier ones that use it with Tier two the interesting thing here I've been to Korea and also in Mexico where they really want to make sure that they keep their automotive base strong so they actually subsidize training in those countries for MMOG/LE and then we've got some OEMs looking to do it here I'm actually going to be going to China the week of April 6th and I'm gonna meet with NEO they're around 60 minutes a few weeks ago they're a brand new electric vehicle supplier and they want to roll out MMOG/LE with their supply base so so very interesting it continues to grow and it really does bottom line help your supply base this was a tier 1 supplier they actually make the windshield on your car and they were struggling with Ford they had lost their Q1 so they had lost their ability to get new business and so we went in there with MMOG/LE and we really looked at their processes and what we saw they had a lack of work instructions a lot of new people nobody really know what to do so lots of skills gaps lots of spreadsheets which are just a bad word in managing supply chain they were using purchase orders of instead of what we call a schedule order schedule orders is just it takes you know I'm gonna be needing this many amount of pieces over the next two weeks so instead of saying a PO every day I want this much today and tomorrow if you do a schedule order it's it consolidates that much quicker (External) and you say they lost a Ford Q1 which means these practices in the past they were able to get Q1 they got it and then they lost it and so that's why the OEMs required them to update this every year because I could do something five years ago but it was just today I was updating a - I do amount a faculty for a supply chain certificate at with Wayne State and AIG and I'm - just a year ago I had to update all my presentation right it's so change and so what happens is they if you don't keep up with that and do the annual assessment take it seriously then you're gonna get back into trouble again so that can happen some suppliers may say you know I'm not gonna really update it this year I'll just submit my score again because the only way you get caught is when you start to be a poor performer or you go to get new business because for instance like GM has 3,000 suppliers so they can't get out to audit everybody but maybe they can do 300 a year and those are typically new suppliers or poor performing suppliers so everybody else may - could ride the tide until they get caught (External) Can you go back to the slide before OEM using for this is Jaguar and Land Rover what does that line meanyep so this means that they require you to complete the MMOG/LE assessment with your if you're a supplier to them so if I'm next here and I make parts that go to Jaguar Land Rover over in the UK I have to complete the MMOG/LE assessment so these are all people that require it of their suppliers so these are OEMs but then you see the tier ones are now pushing it down to tier 2 does that make sense (External) Yes because Jaguar and Land Rover they have an enormous problem with quality (Terry) yes yeah they're having a lot of issues over there in many different ways correct (External) so is that so this software can help the management or the people in Jaguar and Land Rover (Terry) this would help their suppliers so to be quite honest with having Jaguar/Land Rover they're struggling so much to just get that going but they haven't had a time to do assessments so I think it's like a double-edged sword there right because they can't they're having trouble now now that everything's kind of slowed down there they may have time to go out and and to be able to do that but they were they were struggling initially because they were really ramping up and so they had to kind of get away from doing assessments to focus on just getting the plant going so that's why they've been having something (External) See Chrysler has improved drastically my son works for Chrysler but it used to be number 31 on the list now it has gone to number 16 in terms of quality okay so stick you know it was ranked very very low so is this because of the supplier (Terry) this - it could be sometimes supplier argues it's the OEM that they're changing making too many changes it's hard to tell it could be either/or I hear both sides pointing at each other so sometimes you're not a hundred percent sure but it could be either way either way yep no problem but one thing I did want to mention is that once we went in there and we made sure they were meeting each of the best practices of MMOG/LE just with one inventory they were spending a million dollars they got that down to four 400k so it helped them to reduce sixty percent so imagine you your bottom line by just going through this assessment you reduce 600k of inventory their inventory accuracy went up and then just this management of communicating with their suppliers got much more efficient and much more faster and when you fill out an MMOG/LE assessment it really does take every direct report from the plant manager to complete that so it's really a team effort there's questions that would apply to every single one and actually this this supplier here is in the Honduras who would think they're suppliers in the Honduras I was this is my colleague here from France but it's just sometimes it's amazing where suppliers are located in the world (External) What do they make (Terry) they they do electric chips so in the chapters of MMOG/LE I'll kind of I'll walk through these but basically in the first chapter is geared towards executive management so strategies KPIs of your supply chain how are you gonna correct things if issues come up chapter two looks at all your processes and procedures making sure people are trained properly to do the job it also looks at risk then we look at chapter three and looks at capacity and production planning so how do we plan production chapter four looks at all these these are all requirements all OEMs you know how you're gonna package your product label it ship it transport it so this looks at all the customer requirements chapter five looks a lot at inventory how you manage inventory engineering changes and traceability and then chapter six looks at how you manage your sub suppliers so it's looking down a level and so if we look at some of the just I wanted to give you just a quick few examples one of the key things in Chapter one is those objectives or the your KPIs so what does that look like this is an example of a Ford delivery performance rating so all the suppliers have to go out to Ford and get their report card every month so here the the suppliers target is to hit at least ninety percent of it and so they're they're showing how did they do so Ford this is their production business and then other one is their after sale so if so either I produce to the production line or somebody's going into the dealership and they need a part replace right so it's the difference between the two so at ninety percent but then what Ford wants them to do they're like don't just look at you know here we're three points off I want you to map what went wrong why you missed a point and so down here from a supply chain perspective was their shipping discrepancy acumen balance means that ford says I should be a thousand pieces for the year but I'm only I'm saying I'm only at nine hundred so it's not balanced between the two did you over ship are you behind schedule did you not answer when I told you you had a shortage and then ASM timeliness and accuracy that's telling the OEM electronically when my shipment is going to arrive so they have to look through this and manage through that also corrective actions what I talked about earlier with Lisa because she did something wrong we can go into the Quality Management System and so now we can bring up what are all the things we're having problem with so if you think about Takata when they had that airbag because they weren't using an automated system they had no idea that these issues were bubbling up at every single plant around the world so if you apply technology and you can see that clearly then you're going to be ahead of the game and so that really helps a lot in this chapter and chapter 2 again processes and procedures are very key lots of concern about the skills gaps I've been into facilities I think this is the worst part of supply chain people don't want to take the time to document what they do but then they're not here one day and then no one can back up and now we start having problems so very important chapter in that as well as training and also the risk assessment (External) Terry why don't they is it because of the culture or what why don't they take a note (Terry) you know I have every every manufacturing facility ive ever volunteered just does I think it just takes time if people are always like I don't have time I think the other thing too manufacturing facilities are very lean so people don't have a lot of extra time to so it's like oh I don't have time to write that work instruction I've gone through audits where they have to do and like well when are we gonna do them and I'll have to do them on the weekend because they're so busy during the day making sure that product gets out the door on time to the customer so they don't have that $27,000/minute penalty that I think all of that just takes up a lot of time and they're just so lean very lean at plants (External) just because have you found the Japanese manufacturers good at this if - do you have any Japanese companies I - you know the ones I've seen here - yes I have Japanese the ones I've seen here I think suffered the same thing what Japanese are more visual in their processes so but still writing things down I would say it's common amongst German Japanese just a global issue I just think they're so so lean that those facilities just they just don't have any extra time right (External) The equality processes are very lengthy it reminds me of what we have in higher education accreditation in essence is you know assuring quality right you mentioned next week you're going to visit a company in China that is just starting how long does this process take if the company just starting till everything's - how long is it years (Terry) so so from a NEOs perspective they're gonna roll MMOG/LE with all their interested in doing that with all their suppliers so that'll take time I'll probably sit with them you know you got to have a staff that's gonna look at them are you going to look at all of them are how are you gonna audit you can audit only on problem ones there's a lot of things you have to take into consideration so that may take you know six months for them to work through how they're gonna staff it and then from a supplier perspective to answer this I've seen suppliers they have to do it because they procrastinate so long take up to six months to get through it too because you go through the assessment now I have gaps now I got to fill those gaps in so based on your gaps you could have another you know five months of work to do to get it corrected so it just depends on what your gaps are and how prepared you are yes and you have to go back every year make sure you're staying with those practices you should be doing that (External) Do you consult the team that's doing this as part of QAD (Terry) yes (External) What kind of educational requirements like could any of our graduates work for QAD and do this (Terry) you know I learned from I would say with with a mentor yes they could learn it I don't think there would be any issue (External) so Business Administration or an I.T. would be perfect for this kind of stuff (Terry) yep I had I.T. I.T. is perfect yes (External) and what's a typical pay for a job like that (Terry) For like an auditing job like that for I so when we go to audits companies are typically in trouble so you know you can get quite a I would say you can get I would say anywhere probably to get about 2800 a day to the audit because typically and that's because companies wait too long so now everything's in crisis mode so yeah yes but I having a degree in a in an assembly plant I mean not a degree having worked in an assembly plant any portion of it is a big jump start is a big jump start if you're at a plant for you know a year and really started to understand how the floor worked in the front office then then it goes even faster (External) so would you suggest that even if you want to be more like I.T. kind of behind the scenes programmers in the cloud or Business Administration maybe kind of management or leadership position doing an internship in an actual plant or in a place where there's (Terry) an internship at a plant would be great or at any OEM and a supply chain department would be perfect absolutely perfect internships there absolutely yes (External) what you're describing here is so this foundation is so transferrable and applicable to any degree (Terry) yes and any vertical really the best practice (External) This is fabulous because it offers the framework for success no matter what product (Terry) exactly a lot of my colleagues can use this exact same and their verticals that are maybe life sciences or something else (External) Terry would you be able to share you're slides with us (Terry)sure sure absolutely so what we've like done what we've done at QAD is we've actually mapped that process map right into QAD so when when new people come in if I want to go planning I just click on the planning and it takes me right to where I need to go so we try it we're trying to help that skills gap and make people learn much quicker but the other thing that's really nice if you drive down we'd never go more than two levels deep so here if I was to go to the next level and I needed to register a routing exception if I click on anything with an arrow there's the work instruction so tell us you right off the bat what you got to do it tells me all my compliance so what do I need to do from a compliance perspective it'll take me right into the area of the system so each we're trying to cut that time to learn by providing all these tools so that everything's right there so as people come and go the knowledge stays in the system so it doesn't go away and so some of the key things here we've already talked a lot about it but here's the backflush transaction at what that is is at the end of the day or the end of the shift you log all the inventory you log everything that you've produced but these are really key OEMs I would say this is the most important point on an audit is you're gonna have to show all your work instructions so they have to be in really good order the other just key takeaway in this chapter is the risk and these are some of the risk plans that for sure and supply chain you are gonna need to show your OEM that you have thought through and you can handle those so these are just some of the things this is really huge right now because there's been so many disruptions there can be a fire at an assembly plant and shuts down 30% of the automotive industry because that supplier ships to so many people globally so that's why good contingency plans are important then really the tracking of risk is really in your quality management system and and why is it best to go there because every time you do something wrong it typically goes in your quality management system so if I'm missing my targets I got a log that into quality if I have corrective actions I put the results in quality audits all of this all goes into the quality system so now I really know where all my risk is because I'm I'm marking down every single thing I'm doing wrong with my customers internally or with my suppliers and then you can store your contingency plans you can trigger training I was once with the materials manager and they had a fire at a plant she had no idea where the fire alarm was can you imagine that we learned when were little kids I can remember I went to a Catholic grade school I remember sitting in the thing put your head down and yeah like I you know it would have been for a tornado but you know I was just amazed that they had no idea where the fire alarm was I mean capacity and production planning this is where it starts to get a lot of use in technology because again I've got market forecasts I've got customers telling you what they're going to do so really trying to plan that look at what I really believe is gonna happen in the next 5-10 years and then planning my downstream production so all this again can be done automatically through tools and then this is kind of what it looks like you you put in what you think is gonna happen and here's the system telling you this is what I would do if I were you based on historically what's happened the future forecast what you see here in blue is what the system would tell you this is what I would plan and then also from the system too when you come in each day you can take a look at was my what does my customer telling me to ship and quickly we tell you if you're under if their way over or way under right so the system tells you that immediately so I know right away to go talk to my customer because you just increased the quantity by something I was not expecting or decreased it (External) Can you go back to the previous slide so the graph is what you're planning to do or is that what you're actually going to do and then what is the blue area so (Terry) so the blue line here would be your forecast from like from like say an IHS there are global forecasts and then the other of the red line would be what your forecast would be from your OEM so then it's pulling that together plus what you've actually really shipped historically and then it's suggesting what you see in blue so it's it's it's taking all the numbers and (External) So that is what the OEM the one that you are supplying is saying I need from you and then the blue is what you are gearing up to produce (Terry) you know I stand corrected im looking at this again sorry I did this wrong this is your shipping information this is your historical shipping then this is actually what your forecast and what the IHS so external and then the baseline is what the computer says you should do what you should do (External) so I am underproducing or planning to underproduce (Terry) yeah so these forecasts is saying based on what you've done the past and based on what we see is going on we're saying you should go higher than what then what you actually (External) Intuitively it seems like the blue is correct but amazingly you are saying that the system tells you no you actually have to gear up for less (Terry) right and then you can come in when the system gives you this you can still come back in and tweak it because you might say well the system didn't know this data point so you still have the opportunity to move things if you need to but it will recommend a first time for you and then you can tweak it if you'd like to yes and then in the customer interface one of the key things in automotive is shipping so here's the this right here you know the windshield on your car or the window next to this company made that and so what they're doing this just came off the production line so he's scanning it the production label and now he's getting ready to ship this off in this case it was Ford it creates the label that Ford needs to have and then once he's done he scans all the labels and that electronically tells for it right away what's going to be shipped out the door in two minutes so Ford knows exactly that this is on its way and that's actually EDI all done through EDI barcode scanning and then in Chapter five the other key thing to is is is another thing that people use technologies if I have a rework area this RW 102 is actually in the ERP so I'll scan this here to say you know if I put hundred pieces and rework you scan it I know that an ERP if I look here it's gonna say hundred and there's a hundred pieces in the cage too so you make sure you don't lose any kind of parts everything's consistent and then the other exciting thing project I'm working on right now is traceability so we're going to look at so for the young students here are the college students is is with digital twin and the data Lake so how can we take because a lot of the traceability so knowing when a problem started and when it ended and you need to get it from different spots so how can I take that which would be a data Lake so think of like if you googled my name if you go a little Terry Onica you will see videos I've done you'll see pictures of me you'll see articles I've written right so Google's giving you all it could see any kind of format on what you're doing that's kind of exactly what a data Lake does that's exactly what it's doing so you can query across multiple different things and be able to come up with an answer and then the digital twin what that is it'll be a representation of something physical so it'll be the the digital twin will show here's all what this part is look like from the time it was incepted to the time it was shipped and it's a physical it's a digital representation of kind of a physical object is what it is so I'm really excited to be working on this I've just started this project this last week in managing suppliers the key thing here is electronically communicating to them sometimes we do come across the pliers that are too little they can't afford to have the technology I mean in this case we can actually put the the requirements that they need to do out on the web so they can see what they have to ship on the web and they can also then send that advance notice to let the tier one know it's on its way through the web as well and they can also print the barcode label so it provides all of that for the suppliers risk identification is another big thing in Chapter six and when you think about all the OEMs want you to map your suppliers out globally why is that because if there's a trade war who's all my suppliers that might be affected here if there's a tsunami I can quickly know who who got impacted right so by mapping your supply base you know exactly where to go look at when there's any kind of issue obviously with sub suppliers are they financial viable what's their future strategy are they ready for that electric vehicle what's their performance looking at annual assessments and really taking all this information and what we're starting to do today is take all these insights and then be able to tell the customer hey there's two or three things that are triggered here you need to go look at the supplier because you've got a problem supplier so again using technology to find that for you versus you having to dig for it (External) Terry it's interesting that there is none in Russia (Terry) Oh this is just a map we pull it just yeah yes yeah there's definitely suppliers in Russia for sure I've been there I've seen them and then also the other key thing in Chapter six again now we got to show that report card down to our suppliers we got to measure their performance and let them know how they're doing and they can see that on the internet as well too and then just to wrap up just to show you I worked on this project to leveraging advanced technology so in this case there's a lot of different advanced technologies out there I just talked about digital twin black chain is something else I'm monitoring too but I'm gonna give you example of machine learning and I think everybody's familiar with machine learning if I go into Netflix it's gonna say Terry you're gonna want to watch this movie because I'm watching what you watch and I know what you want to see right we all have that experience the and that's really machine learning at play you know keeping track of what we're doing and then predicting what Terry's gonna want to watch on TV right or on on Netflix so what we did is we applied this also to the forecast processes because remember I told you beginning this volatile forecast is one of the biggest issues in the supply chain so what we set out to do is that the the OEM sends in this forecast to the supplier every week okay but and we all know is a forecast gets closer it's going to be really accurate right I'm gonna know probably pretty good a week out what I'm gonna want to have the supplier provide me but five weeks out is it it may not be very accurate so but there's times when I have long lead time parts I have no choice but in week five I have to make a decision because I don't have the luxury of waiting this long sometime lead times are twenty weeks they could be eleven weeks they can be very very long and so what we did is we set out to say can we take machine learning apply this and be able to predict against the with the OEM or the say the General Motors or the Ford can we predict better than them what they're gonna have to build on that day so what we did is we took here the blue line is what the OEM said that they were going to want into this um what they were gonna want into the assembly plant right what the blue line is is what they actually ship so with five weeks out of the OEM said they wanted this month but on the actual day shipment I only produce what's on the red line so as you can see the OEM is always over asking consistently for the most part so what we did is we took this data we applied machine learning so right here is the Green Line is what the machine learning predicted and if you look at what was actually shipped pretty darn close isn't it very very close very very close so we look at the percentages the OEM is seventy percent has errors where the machine learning only had 13% so very amazing so we're working with us with quite a few different customers because it'll give them a better more accurate plan (External) So how come the OEM wouldn't get quote unquote mad or whatnot at the supplier if the OEM is saying we need 1600 units but were only shipping you 800 is that because actually the OEM only ordered 800 units (Terry) so like for instance in this case the OEM is saying they want it on this day the OEM said they want 1800 but we only shipped what is this about 600 a (External) So that really means then that the OEM only really needed 600 (Terry) right yeah (External) They estimated they needed 1800 but they really only needed 600 (Terry) they were way off so what we working on now is how much safety stock you know just figuring out like a safety stock you would be much better than carrying all that excess inventory (External) Can you just from your own experience it looks like the OEM are peaking every so often so has anyone sat down and told them You just roll out your own peaks that actually comes closer to the red (Terry) That is really true I've seen these debates with the supplier say you're always you know your schedule is always out it out of you know it's always out of whack and they're they're not but what the OEMs do will do is when I showed this to the OEM who is the culprit here they're like oh my gosh tell me more because now you can show them data points now I can argue with you more I can I'm bringing to tension your attention with data that you are really way out of whack because I don't sure they don't want because that eventually comes back to them and a price or something when they're way over estimating like that (External) Is your goal - is you're big sort of company vision that eventually there it's all automated everything that's just happening (Terry) I mean that's really where it seems like things are going in the future with all this advanced technology yes (External) and QAD then would be sort of the brain behind this (Terry) based on the business data yes yo help supply it yes yes so with that just to conclude here so just showing you that the obviously the industry is high chain in general is going through major transformation I don't care what vertical your you're going through major transformation right now maintaining a good supply chain is really key to success and really leveraging technology I don't think if you're not in the future you won't survive you just won't you won't be able to keep up with the pace of change so with that I want to go ahead and conclude (External) what advice you have to supply a change student (Terry) right now I think technology is really good understanding technology I think getting somehow your self exposed to it I know plant life is probably not the most thrilling life but that would be a great place if you worked there for a year or getting an internship in some kind of aspect of supply chain I really like I think the plant gives you the best perspective I started my career out in EDI and that's all the data coming in to help us plan and then our shipments and just being exposed to all of that I got such a wealth of knowledge on supply chain so I think that that's really good as well too yes yes (External) you mentioned earlier that you were investigating blockchain do you see that playing significant role the next five years so there's a company you can look on the internet they're called mobi M O B I and they start out looking at some things I think with insurance and then some things and just more making the autonomous vehicles and things like that work so I've been talking to them one of the first projects they want to tackle is traceability so how can we have every member of the tier so so say if I'm General Motors and you know that Takata airbag goes it goes wrong how can we quickly get done all the ways to the supply chain know exactly where it stopped and started because right now it's a little bit more of gas and so then you you lose money because you may have went too broad obviously there still recalls going on you mean it went too small so so black chain would be nice because every member of the tier could then post what they're doing and you might be a little much more quickly get that information than it would be today by going one tier at a time so I see that you know Mike my company there's people really think it's gonna take out there off other people don't it's kind of in between right now I still think it's gonna take off I personally do but I've got other people that think some of the news right now and it's not as good so I don't really know but it seems like it's got a lot of promise to me if we can make it work but I think I have my email in here so it's  tjo@qad.com so Teresa Joanne Onika tjo feel free students connect to me on LinkedIn I'm on LinkedIn email me any questions I'm here all the time I I love working with students and try and help you advance through your careers and I was here one time and I think this is a great school I think you've got a great opportunity how do you it's very exciting and supply chain huh okay I got it I have a presentation that 3:30 so for (External) some asked me and wanted me to offer a certificate in the field to the public you may be interested in having a I don't know two three day one week here and do maybe online certificate in what you discussed (Terry) oh sure let me I probably have to talk with AIAG yeah and they're for you that's great because you could walk there from here they're just across the street yeah and yeah yeah yeah I would think they would be grateful to have any more supply chain that all the OEMs want supply chain people right now so it's a good field great thank you thank you
