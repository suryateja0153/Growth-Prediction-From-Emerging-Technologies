 Solutions Review Defines Integration Platform as a Service, or iPaaS   is an emergent integration technology used by  organizations in hybrid cloud environments.   An iPaaS is normally used for use cases like cloud  service integration, application integration,   B2B ecosystem integration, API publishing,  multiexperience scenarios, and Internet of Things.  Interest in iPaaS solutions is reaching a  fever pitch as innovative pricing models and   cloud solutions help adopters avoid licensing  and hardware investments. iPaaS solutions can   also be deployed much faster than their legacy  EAI (enterprise application integration) and   SOA (service-oriented architecture)  middleware counterparts.   This facilitates faster-paced development  cycles, governance, and digital transformation   among forward-thinking organizations. Vendors in this marketplace include both pure-play   cloud integration providers and some of the  major players in traditional data and application   integration tools. iPaaS buyers can secure  products as suites of capabilities in either   a single package or via individual subsuites.
