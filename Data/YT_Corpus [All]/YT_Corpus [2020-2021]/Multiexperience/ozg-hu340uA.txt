 Neutrinos provide you with a low code app development platform to create and deploy your apps you use the neutrinos studio which is the integrated development environment to develop your applications in a low code platform starting from version 7 this IDE provides you a broader spectrum to visualize application functionality not only by providing you with WYSIWYG editor to design app pages but also by enabling you to perform flow based designing of your application services configuring Oh orthe strategy for the application and much more now what do we mean by all this let's look at the features in detail server services designer by using the server services designer you can build server applications and create HTTP endpoints or AP is these HTTP endpoints or AP eyes can interact with databases where you can drag and drop server nodes and configure server flows to integrate with relational database management systems such as ms SQL Maria DB PostgreSQL and Oracle SQL to perform crud operations or connect to no SQL databases such as MongoDB this comes with support to connection pooling where a cache of database connections is maintained by server services so that the connections can be reused when future requests to the database are required you can also use the HTTP endpoints to perform identity authentication and to create and manage sessions for your application you can configure how your server should handle every incoming request through the global middleware sequence you can pass data from one format to another by using parses nodes that can pass and serialize date during message transfer between systems such as AIB or translate messages these nodes provide the capability to connect message processing applications like Kafka regardless of message formats or protocols here is the complete stack of nodes we have in server services designer ranging from storage notes to parser notes and HTTP notes we also have the global nodes which helps you design how each server endpoint should work you can define and create the entire API economy on neutrinos platform using the nodes in the server services designer that includes creating and publishing web application programming interfaces controlling access of these api's nurturing the subscriber community collecting and analyzing usage statistics reporting on performance you can also on the go generate the swagger documents to describe the api's that you have created on the SSD once the HTTP endpoints are defined you can call them from client applications to perform the required functionality and send a response back to the client if you enable an OAuth strategy with your application then the server services designer automatically created all the authentication endpoints to validate a user and create his or her session details for example here is an HTTP flow to handle user login the client requests the server to authenticate the user by calling the login server end point the server checks the user credentials based on the OAuth strategy enabled in the application username and password if valid it redirects the user to the home screen of the application if invalid sends the client not registered error to the client in the next releases of the studio you will also have access to the node SDK using which you can develop your own client and server notes and can contribute back to the platform you can even publish the nodes to neutrinos store the marketplace of neutrinos which can then be monetized and whatsmore notes can be built by anyone who understands the basics of JavaScript client services designer just like server services you can also configure everything that takes place on the client side in an app by using the client services designer though this feature was rolled out in the earlier releases of the studio the power of this feature is enhanced with the introduction of server services you use client services designer to create HTTP requests to call server HTTP endpoints or AP eyes along with any actions that an application performs within the users browser you identity server or IDs another interesting feature in this release is that you can define your own wealth strategy when you design your application you can have your client registered with the neutrinos orth strategy that is the neutrinos IDs where neutrinos identity server or IDs is a standards-compliant oo earth 2.0 authorization standalone and a certified open ID connect provider or connect to other award providers such as Active Directory Google or Azure ad with the introduction to IDs in neutrino studio the development efforts of the integrating Active Directory and as your ad to your application is reduced from five working days to just ten minutes the development efforts of integrating your app with Google authentication is reduced from 10 working days to 10 minutes based on the earth strategy you choose the end user will be displayed with operations to log into the app for example if Google auth strategy is enabled the app login screen will show the sign-in with Google option which when clicked will allow you to log in with your Gmail credentials and logs you back to the application node process manager p.m. - you can configure the process management workflow for your application using the PM 2 settings where p.m. 2 is a daemon process manager that helps you in managing and keeping your application online it manages your application States so that you can start stop restart and delete processes as and when required not only that you can also configure the logger settings for the server apps that you create using neutrino studio log files are useful in debugging and auditing applications and their flows neutrino studio supports these types of logs the internationalization last but not least we have included internationalization in this release of the studio internationalization allows you to create applications that can be adapted to different languages and regions you use the locale setting' for the editor pane to set the locale specific information by using keys and languages for example if you enter element as the key water as the value and select the language as Arabic then the translator used from neutrino studio will convert the key word water to Arabic and displays it to you like this in Arabic when you bind the key to the components display name for example on translation if you want the key water to be displayed in Arabic then double click the button to open its attributes window and enter this in the button name field when deployed the button name looks like this in the app what's in it for me now why should you use or upgrade to neutrino studio version 7 well here are some pointers which helps you understand better studio version 7 saves almost 70% of your app development efforts when compared to writing code from scratch the nodes do not have any proprietary code embedded and hence the code generated is j/s which means no lock in the flow based programming approach allows you to visual model and remodel your application functionality at ease we are abstracting the underlying JavaScript framework and therefore you can move it into any other framework as and when required practically anyone including non-techies can create applications easily the basic knowledge required would be of HTML CSS and JavaScript entry barrier to get into complex software development is hugely reduced so what are you waiting for subscribe to our free trial account today
