 traditional modeling techniques such as regression or tree based models often have an understandable relationship between the input data and the decisions in the model outputs for this reason they are often called white box models the advent of more complex modeling techniques however such as ensemble models and deep learning promises increases in model accuracy but often at the expense of model explainability because it is difficult if not impossible to understand the relationship between the input data and the output decisions these models are often referred to as black boxes in some situations we may be comfortable with this trade-off between accuracy and explainability we might not care why an algorithm recommends a particular movie if it is a good match but we certainly do care why someone has been rejected for a credit card application all it takes is to scan the headlines for examples of why we might have reason to worry about bias in artificial intelligence bias in models of course can originate long before training and testing stages the data used for model training can be entangled in its own set of biases although learning how to identify and handle bias in data sets is an important component of any responsible ai strategy in the next few lessons we'll restrict ourselves to three specific tools within dss that aim to help you build trustworthy transparent and bias-free models the ability to understand how a model makes choices is important for three reasons one it gives you the opportunity to further refine and improve your analysis two it makes it easier to explain to non-practitioners how the model uses the data to make decisions finally explainability can help practitioners to avoid negative or unforeseen consequences of their models these three factors of explainable ai gives us more confidence in our model development and deployment dataku dss offers multiple methods within the realm of explainable ai all within the summary report of any visual model in the following lessons we will learn about partial dependence plots subpopulation analysis and individual [Music] explanations
