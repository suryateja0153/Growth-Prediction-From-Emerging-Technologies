 my name is darling I'm the lead developer for IBM events dreams this is the AI expert and it's about a website that I started called machine learning for kids machine learning for kids is about helping kids learn about AI by giving them the tools they need to make their own AI projects a sandbox that they can experiment in so they can get hands-on with this sort of tech and see how it works how it behaves letting them make things for themselves with it I'd been working as volunteer for code club it's an organization that focuses on giving kids a chance to learn how to code and when I started the big focus was on just learning to code at all but over time I was finding that they weren't addressing AI you know that I wasn't seeing schools address machine learning or AI or all the things I was doing at work and seeing is really important it started very small scamming the first few versions of what became machine and for kids were projects I was doing at home with my kids you know trying to explain to them what I was doing at work I think it's really important that we teach kids about AI and for lots of reasons I think partly it's you know there's going to be the kids who are really into coding or ilion's computing and who knows one of them might you know some of them might end up becoming the next generation of AI developers and programmers and algorithm developers but more than that you know we need the next generation or both managers and directors who are going to be making decisions about how we apply this tech to start thinking about the implications we need the next generation of of lawmakers policymakers legislators to understand the implications of this tech so though I do write worksheets with instructions for kids to create projects based on real world AI things that I'm aware of some of the best ones are where kids will dream up their own projects so there was one before Christmas where a few students in a class one of the their friends in the class has Down syndrome and they found that adults sometimes didn't understand what he was trying to say so they made they came up with a project where they trained a speech recognition system so that for some of the words he'd try and say it would sort of act as an interpreter a translator for him which was really lovely I did you know they were looking to you know how could a I helped their friend for a problem that they they saw and they encountered so it's great when and kids start thinking about how AI could be used in their world so what I'm enjoyed is it's not just that you give the kids the sandbox and it can play around and make things and learn about what AI can do and can't do but the best bits of the lesson are where they have a discussion about it afterwards and they talk about what that means and the impact it has on their lives and their opinions on how this stuff should be used I'm very proud of of how machining kids has gone it's it's definitely gone a lot further than I expected what I originally created as something for a couple of local schools has gone around the world you know it's being used in hundreds of countries there's some education ministries that picked it up and started so advising their schools to use it you know it has in a small way changed the way that kids are being taught about AI and but yeah that's that's something I didn't expect and I am really proud [Music] you
