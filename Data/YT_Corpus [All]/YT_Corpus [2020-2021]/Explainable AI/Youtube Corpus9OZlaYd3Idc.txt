 hi geoff hi listeners welcome hi melena hi geoff and melena melena don't know what's going on i'm your virtual voice avatar also meet my friend geoff hi everyone thanks for having me melena i didn't say that i don't believe you but i mean some of us here weren't exactly invited i get the feeling well we're here now i think we should start the show ready when you are hi my name is geoff gustitus and i'm melena ortwerth and this is from know-how to wow hold on hold up a second from know-how to wow the bosch global podcast geoff would you mind and explain to our dear listeners what just happened yeah that was a little conversation we had with a computer program imitating us we had an online artificial intelligence service trained to synthesize both our voices to be honest i i really have to admit these sound avatars they they sound terrifyingly real still i hope that we're not yet obsolete not not yet melena uh but i thought it would give us a taste of the future right because that's the theme of this episode we're going to talk about the future and about artificial intelligence because ai of course is a centerpiece of the future and not just for the future of bosch but for the whole world i talked to a couple of our brightest minds to tell you all about it more on that later on but uh melena could you tell us about your research for this episode um you know when we decided on the theme for this episode and i started to dig a bit into the topic read what i could find on the internet and yeah begin to deal with it i kind of came to the conclusion that we're already living in the future i'm totally with you there but how do you mean that exactly let's take movies for example can you think of a movie that you've watched let's say 10 or 15 years ago that tried to paint a picture of the rather near future let's say 2020 for example and to me when watching these kind of movies this always felt super far away and now like in the blink of an eye we're here we're living in it it's super freaky yeah i'm absolutely with you there but for sure uh i don't think any movie could uh really have predicted 2020 but anyway oh wait wait wait don't say that do you remember contagion the movie did you watch that one when was that in 2011 and that was super 2011 scary it shows the exact story of 2020. yeah yeah that's a good point but yeah you're right in general it made me wonder what did we imagine the future to be like and what of that vision has become reality do you remember how you imagined today's world 20 years ago well uh 20 years ago i was 14 and i might have been a little too wrapped up in my current 14 year old world to worry too much about the future well yeah i mean i was i was 10 20 years ago and probably still waiting for my hogwarts letter to arrive so i was also but i remember that i thought for example and i think i already shared with you that i'm not the most passionate driver right right but i mean i thought that autonomous driving would be a real thing sooner a real thing meaning that i just get in the car and it would drive me around autonomously by 2020. i always find it very interesting though when science fiction inventions become reality and so i talked to sam rogers he made one of the biggest sci-fi dreams of all times a reality well everyone was expecting hoverboards by now weren't they oh yes please tell me he built a legit hoverboard i know yeah but it turns out it's very hard especially in such a small form factor to make something hover yeah otherwise that would have been done by now for sure sam has been fascinated by this since he was kid and it stayed with him i loved all these kind of car films where they adorned the car with a load of you know like spy gadgets and things like that so i ended up watching a load of knight rider with kit the car that could you know go into super pursuit mode or whatever other buzzwords they threw in there to make it sound cool and yeah the same thing applied it back to the future this amazing looking car that looked like it was from the future but also the way the whole back to the future kind of franchise portrayed flight it was the delorean would take off the wheels would turn around underneath it and then the thing could hover and then fly around there's something about flight where it's not in motion that is just magical and the same thing with the hoverboard yeah absolutely our our pop culture certainly proves that it's an intriguing concept and i think the hoverboard from those movies exactly it's uh probably one of the most iconic sci-fi gadgets uh that that's really ever been absolutely yeah i mean you wouldn't want one right that would be so cool and sam rogers certainly was hooked by the idea of owning one he still has some of the drawings he made when he was little what i did all these drawings is that when i was very young of like these kind of magneto drives i can't remember exactly what they call the ion drives in the board and like how people had hypothesized these could work you know looking at these these almost conspiracy like theories of how you could make a hoverboard online and things like that things that hover things that fly i love that kind of stuff and sure enough in the spring of 2020 sam was standing on a hoverboard that looked just like the one from the movies and hovered into the sunset happily ever after the board prop you can buy for about 70 pounds we bought a few of them and i've got the one uh on my wall with the kind of the pads rubbed off at the bottom there's a load of scrape marks from where i tried to land and the boots velcro to the top of it i don't know if i'm buying that uh a board for 70 pounds i guess he meant british pounds not the measure of mass and velcro attached to the boots i don't know about that then let me tell you about another small detail that i haven't told you about yet jet suit that sam was wearing the point of it is to you know use the jet suit which is something crazy in itself a suit that you can put on that's pretty low profile and you as a human can just take off and hover above the ground and fly wherever you want and you feel like the as you start up the flames are looking out the nozzles there's this beautiful baaaa spool up noises everything's like it's like something out of a sci-fi movie anyway i've seen a couple of those videos of people flying around in those jet suits that's um that's pretty crazy stuff uh you need to be pretty brave to put one of those on yeah i also saw these when yeah doing my research for this episode and sam he works for the company in fact that makes those jet suits he's the design lead and the suit looks the way it looks because of him so really he just combined his job with his passion and created a short video where he uses the jet suit with a hoverboard toy live in a dream and to make the illusion perfect he hovers next to the car that you see in the movies i love that we went to a runway in south england and i used the jet suit with the hoverboard and back to the future boots strapped to my feet and flew down the runway alongside this delorean showing it in flight alongside that delorean from the film so yeah it's it was very much a kind of childhood fascination but it was i'm very lucky that i got to play it out and hopefully bring that hoverboard as close as it could be to actually flying if you ask me i can relate to this fascination with anything that levitates we'll link to sam's video in the show notes and i'm sure you'll agree it looks almost as iconic as the real thing the real thing quote unquote from science fiction yeah i i really really wanted to be real yeah for sure i'm with you there but don't you think the this this fascination with levitation is even stronger uh i mean when you see how it works when there's no jet pack yeah certainly and sam rogers would agree as well so let's see what you think of the research that i recently learned about that's going on here at bosch oh yeah because this researcher wants to make levitating things a reality he shares our fascination with levitation yes absolutely i mean levitation still has something like the connotation of being magic and this is simply fascinating to deal with this topic i really wanted to know what does it take to levitate an object that's joachim frangen a chief expert for production automation at bosch research so imagine if you want to make something hover how would you do it if you're not using a jetpack well i mean there's there's quite some examples for hovering decor for example i can i can think of do you know these um hovering globes for example or are these plant pots looks pretty cool and i think they use magnetism for these kind of things bingo magnets is what joachim wanted to use as well but if you have ever played with magnet on a kitchen desk you know that it is not easy to bring a magnet into a levitation state yeah yeah it's unstable right they just move to the side when when they're repelled by another magnet yeah but joachim's trying nevertheless and not at his kitchen table uh but in his basement let's uh let's have a look and the first challenge that i took was i wanted to levitate an object in two dimensions so i took one magnet that was able to move only in x and y and two actuation magnets on two rotary actuators underneath and i could with not much of engineering capabilities make it levitating so some early success there he has one magnet levitating above two other magnets but if i understood correctly what he was just saying it cannot move freely right whereas a hoverboard can move back and forth left and right and also up and down yeah well i mean it's a first step um but actually what you're describing really is important it's all about degrees of freedom as physicists like joachim would put it so what does that mean it means that you can move the thing in three directions x y and z plus you can rotate it around the three axes x y and z okay that would mean that you can actually make turns right you can turn the hoverboard left or right or you can tilt it upwards or downwards right plus rotate it around the long axis like what skateboarders call a kickflip so as far as skateboarding goes just control your six degrees of freedom and you're good to go and that's also solution to joachim's problem it is not more than controlling all six degrees of freedom if you can make it to control all six degrees of freedom you will get an object levitating that's all nothing more he makes it sound very simple yeah that's true but of course there's a catch unfortunately uh joachim came across this theorem that the british mathematician samuel earnshaw approved in 1842. samuel earnshaw found out that it is not possible to create a stable arrangement of magnets to get an object stably levitating in six dimensions it might be possible in five dimensions but not in six dimensions okay that's that's a bummer so no magnetic levitation then well you know maybe earnshaw's theorem just doesn't apply in joachim's basement yeah i i don't think so well he thinks he can work around oh really and he's built a computer model that shows it works it took me about half a year to do all this in simulations and when i found that it works in simulation i talked to my colleagues and showed my results and they said nice but i don't believe it you must show that it really works and then i went into my seller and i built a machine that showed that it really works i built a demonstrator that could levitate in six degrees of freedom wait what no way very well okay so one way i could imagine this would work is is electromagnets because with electromagnets you can change the current and make the magnetic field stronger or weaker is that what he did well that was the first approach that joachim and his team took they researched this together with the university but the problem is the electromagnets produce too much heat that means the surface will heat up due to the high power demand and when i looked at these technical issues with my physicist eyes i felt challenged to develop a better solution and with a new approach i could realize another levitation method the permanent magnetic levitation that offers fundamentally higher potential than coil based systems so permanent magnets have a few advantages they don't produce heat and they don't need electricity and their magnetic field is much stronger than that of electromagnets ah okay got it yeah makes sense um now what does joachim's magic machine look like though what did he come up with so his machine actually looks very much like a table or a workbench and then on top of it you have this hovering platform yeah basically we have this carrier this has a size of let's say 15 by 15 centimeters and this is moving over a so-called stator the stator is a device that is stationary and generates a levitation magnetic field and the carrier has permanent magnets underneath and is levitating in the magnetic field of the stator i've only seen a video of it but it is really fascinating yeah sounds fancy the carrier or sometimes joachim calls it the mover it hovers about two centimeters above the stator and it's absolutely stable it doesn't vibrate or anything it doesn't make a sound and then it can like magic swiftly move around the surface of the stator can rotate and tilt in six degrees of freedom exactly okay that's that's impressive but the question remains right how yeah underneath the surface of the stator we have an array of permanent magnets and they are actuated they can turn around the rotation axis that is perpendicular to the surface and by actuating the magnets you can change the direction of the magnetic fields so by superposition of the fields of this lots of individual magnets you get a total levitation field that if it is controlled in the correct way makes the carrier levitating i have the feeling that we're getting closer here the control loop that we apply contains basically of three elements the element of sensing control and actuation in our case sensing means we measure the carrier position in 6 degrees of freedom with high accuracy and low latency generating the input data for the control the next stage and control means we have a hybrid ai control that processes the data and provides the actuation data and actuation the third part means that we output the calculated magnet angles to the magnets with high speed okay that was that was quite a lot let me try to to recap so also for me to make it tangible you have magnets in both the mover and the stator the magnets in the stator can be turned and that way you can change the magnetic field that makes the mover hover and we'll move in the end and in what way the magnets have to be arranged that is determined by an ai correct spot on melena now are you ready to unlock the next level there is another level of course always more so so imagine that system and and by the way uh joachim has named it planetix so pitcher planetix as this mover comes along the surface the magnetic field must change permanently the magnets underneath must constantly change their position so the three steps sensing where the mover is processing the data and then changing the position of the magnets those all need to happen in real time and there is a neat trick to how planetix does that the nice thing about ai is that we can do it offline so we can use a very complex models with the advantage of having a higher stability a better position accuracy for example we can do all this offline it may take days it's no matter because online when we have the system switched on we just need to recall the information and this can be done very quickly so the execution time is nearly independent of the complexity of our system our model this is a huge advantage of the ai so that is to say that that the ai is prepared if you will for all possible situations beforehand ai is really enabling a lot of fascinating new things we haven't told our listeners but this is the final episode of this first season of from know-how to wow and when i look back in almost every episode ai played a crucial role in the technology that we were talking about absolutely that's totally true let's take a look in the past so far there was soundsee our very first episode where we were talking to sam das background sound signals can reveal information about the state of things sam explains how bosch research's soundsee technology uses audio ai powerful audio signal processing algorithms built with machine learning to give meaning to the sounds it hears here on earth and aboard the international space station yes indeed strong ai components there absolutely and then we looked at the virtual visor when jason zink sheds light on how bosch is innovating the 95 year old sun visor there's quite some ai-based elements involved in that i'm still impressed that you can turn something as well as ordinary as a sun visor into something smart and intelligent yeah and even in vivalytic the medical testing device for coronavirus among other nasty things of course even vivalytic uses ai to assess the testing results we were talking to martin schulz of bosch healthcare solutions in this case for the real-time pcr we use a different amplification and detection technology where we detect the fluorescent signal while the amplification is still running especially if you have a sample with a high viral load that is possible so you don't have to wait the whole 39 minutes but maybe only 29 or 25 minutes for a result right but at the beginning of this episode we talked about visions for the future and science fiction and when you think about ai in that context one could be worried many movies make it seem like artificial intelligence is the most dangerous thing yeah yeah but you know that's hollywood and however there are people who think that we should be careful when we use ai and i totally agree ai applications must adhere to the same safety standards as non-ai products the question is how do we leverage the benefits of ai to make it safe at the same time yeah legit question i know that people at bosch worked with leading ethicists to figure out the right approach to ai that fits our company bosch is truly committed to ai that is safe robust and explainable and humans must always stay in control i'm sure this makes sense on paper but how do you actually build this into the systems i talk to another expert to find out more the way you start to achieve this degree of safety and reliability is through hybrid modeling this is our colleague zico kolter i'm zico kolter i am the chief scientist of ai research at the bosch center for ai and in addition i'm also a faculty member at carnegie mellon university and in both these two settings i do research in machine learning optimization and in hybrid ai systems hybrid ai systems that seems to be a thing joachim also already mentioned that well what is it though well you know machine learning systems right they process enormous amounts of data and then build a model solely based on that data so uh face recognition ai could look at thousands of faces and create a model of what a face looks like let's say that this is a 100 ai model on the other hand you have 100 physical models so a physical model means like newton's laws for example let's say if you wanted to describe how an apple falls from a tree yes basically physical models are what we've had before ai models that describe the world through relatively simple formulas you know we went to the moon from physical models right we've never done it before but we made predictions based upon mathematical models and we got to the moon and back the problem of course is that in the real world there's more than just the physics of the world right there's there's human behavior there's patterns there's unpredictable elements that are in sometimes harder than going to the moon and so that's where you also need elements of ai to understand those patterns to find correlations in those patterns but you don't want to throw away the aspects of physical modeling that got us to the moon you need this joint approach and the way you really get safe real world deployed systems is exactly through this hybrid ai approach yeah that is to say that hybrid ai is on a spectrum it's somewhere between a fully physical and purely data driven what happens there is i guess that if you have an ai you could tell it a little bit more about what is and what isn't possible in the real world yes exactly you're giving it some constraints i could go back to my school knowledge of basic mechanics and tell my model hey make sure that you know force equals mass times acceleration f equals m a how would that work i mean i think that's a good example so let's say that you wanted to predict a evolution of particles in some system right that in theory should be approximated exactly with f equals ma but in practice the the f's they aren't quite known right you have some notion of the forces that are involved and maybe you you sort of see all the controls and therefore you you know what the forces should be but if you were assuming the system based purely upon first principles it would diverge from what you actually see in the real world but one thing you can do is use a machine learning model to kind of learn say the deltas on f based upon some function of the state and then you simulate your system still with f equals ma so it's still a physical model but there are components of some of that the forces say that are actually fit to data and learned from data okay that's interesting so coming from a sort of idealized physical model the ai allows for some wiggle room and makes the model more realistic yeah exactly and that way you get a much more accurate model and therefore better predictions or as i said earlier it helps bosch achieve our goal of safe and reliable ai you also said that our ai should be explainable so from what i understand many ai models are kind of black boxes they work but you don't really know what's going on inside yeah and that's a problem when you need to really trust that the system will not fail so we want transparency or explainability and yes hybrid ai helps with that too at least somewhat i don't want to harp on this point too much because i think explainability and ai is actually a huge topic that has a lot of different facets to it and it's not just as easy to solve as just saying oh plug in a hybrid model and then that will solve explainability but what is the case is the more you can tie your system to principles and simple laws that engineers and people understand the easier it will be to not only in a vague sense understand that system but also just practically debug that system and make that system work better from an engineering standpoint the more you build in things you understand the easier that whole process becomes and zico says that this is actually quite an issue in the world of ai when you have a machine learning system that doesn't perform as well as you'd like how do you fix it the internal mechanics can get so complicated as to often become what as melena just said folks call a black box you can't in detail see or understand what's happening inside makes total sense to me i'm just not sure right now talking about this technology are we in the future or in the present you sound like you're talking from the future so do you so this hybrid ai that's something that is a research topic right something that we'll use in practice at some point in the future yes and no let's look at that future first as bosch we go into it with around about 130 years of engineering knowledge that will be combined with ai in a hybrid approach the sum total of engineering knowledge and understanding at bosch is really almost unrivaled right it's an amazing wealth of knowledge we have we've collected over as you say more than 100 years of engineering and to throw that all away and trust in ai would be foolish for all the reasons i've already discussed and so the challenge of ai for a company like bosch is exactly in this question of how do we leverage the engineering knowledge that we have and the experience that we have in a huge number of domains with these new innovations in ai systems this is going to be the fundamental challenge for deploying ai within a company like bosch and it is going to be a problem we have to address if we're going to successfully build ai into the majority of our products which is the goal going forward for bosch i think the lesson here is we want to combine the best of both worlds and only if we've balanced the interaction between people and ai will the full potential of ai be truly realized actually there are already machines that are using this hybrid ai approach and one of them we talked about earlier and control means we have a hybrid ai control right planetix it's actually a hybrid ai that makes planetix mover hover and smoothly move around although planetix is also somewhat future technology a demonstrator exists and now the team is looking for real-world implementations where could it be used well uh production environments are a great example think of food and pharmaceuticals that must be clean and aseptic by levitating them during production the contamination is reduced and this applies also to high throughput laboratories like for instance for corona testing yeah ah that's fantastic and another use case would be clean rooms of the the highest classes robots are an issue there because of abrasion and the resulting particulates but planetix works frictionlessly hence no abrasion and no dust and when you think about industry 4.0 where everything is about flexible production planetix is a much more versatile and adaptable than a traditional conveyor belt that sounds great but i'm i'm a little bit disappointed i am i was hoping that joachim would use the technology to build hoverboards well you might be lucky uh one day uh the skater uh instead of looking at a table or looking like a table rather could be a half pipe and the mover well that could be your board it's possible right yeah absolutely yes you're happy i'm happy to be happy um now i i don't know about your skateboarding skills today but you actually wouldn't even need any a hoverboard typically needs a balancing of the user whereas our board is stable in itself it has six degrees of freedom control so you could simply sit on the mover or lie on the mover or whatever do whatever you like you do not need to actively stabilize the mover with your body it's better and better wow it doesn't get any better than this no i don't think so on the one hand not just because i hope we'll all have a lot of fun with levitation in the future but also because it sounds like hybrid ai can really push many products to the next level and enable entirely new products that weren't even thinkable before so yeah i'm excited for that too we also asked you our dear listeners to write us an email to kontakt yes it's with a german k @bosch.de if you have any ideas or even questions and remember the bosch motto invented for life invented for life yeah that already implies that our ai must be human friendly right at scale and safe and i think we heard here today that our engineers absolutely subscribe to that as well and they make it happen and that's not only a wrap on this episode but also on our first season we're happy to announce that this podcast will be continued next year and we're going to be providing you with content regularly in 2021 there will be one new show each month so stay tuned what's left to say well the most important thing in fact a huge thanks goes
