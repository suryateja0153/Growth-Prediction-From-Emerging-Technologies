 today we're wrapping up next and talking about confidential computing and machine learning i'm jenny and welcome to this week in cloud where we serve you the lowest latency news if you've been hanging out with us for the past nine weeks we've worked on an actual ton of content with next on air it's been a lot of fun but it can also be hard to keep track of all the different topics we've covered that's why we've compiled a full list of announcements so you can review and get more on all your favorites no matter how you want to use google cloud your data is your data we're always looking to improve security and now we've announced confidential computing this keeps your data even more secure by keeping data encrypted in memory and away from the cpu we've recently launched confidential vms and are now expanding that security to confidential gke nodes building ml and ai apps can take a lot of work but there's more tooling than ever to help you capture the power of ml dale markowitz applied ai engineer has put together a list of helpful tools and tips to how to spend more time on your application and less time on tweaking your models we love good documentation as it can help make a hard project possible code samples are always welcome and now it's even easier to use them thanks to interactive documentation you can put in your specific values and the code samples will update to match exactly what you need and you can even preview actual results if you want to read more about these announcements or see a full list check out the link in the description any thoughts or ideas leave us a comment or tweet us and we'll see you in the cloud
