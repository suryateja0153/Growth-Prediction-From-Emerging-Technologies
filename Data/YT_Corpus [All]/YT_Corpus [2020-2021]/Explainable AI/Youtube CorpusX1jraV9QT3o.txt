 good afternoon so the way we slightly designed this opportunity for disaster and together is to have me first tell you a little bit about the the air Republic which is like the umbrella under which we're going to talk today but this is pretty much a Q&A opportunity for us to talk and to really exchange on an important topic which is not wholly artificial intelligence but the implication that these technologies and this architecture technology are going to have for us in the next few years so I love for you to ask me question and making sure this becoming a dialogue between us I still gave you a little bit of the story behind the eye Republic so with my Co thirst Terence II was one of the two cultures at the book back in 2015 we started the journey of our understanding megatrends and we wanted to understand what is currently happening because we were starting to notice a lot of anxiety and angst in the world we tend to teach business leaders and so we we tend to see that a lot of their their pressure was coming from not really knowing what's gonna happen the years to come so from there we started a journey that brought to build the network a framework called drive which was a framework that was supposed to really captured the idea about what our this trajectory their rapidly changing and they're creating a lot of change in our society as well so DRI stands for demographics resource scarcity inequalities volatility and enterprising dynamics and out to these five trends that we studied and making sure we understood how we can help organization and governments to navigate this these exponential changes we start discovering that technology was becoming way more than what technology's always been before before technology was a means to an end it was facilitating the efficiency in any given process and today technology was become in an architecture that by itself did not need to have people to operate they need to have space to operate and it was to some extent globally distributed because we see more more country trying to use technology solution to address some of the challenges we are but this technology was not wholly creating an impasse like the displacement of labor or the fact that some of the traditional institutional factor like Ledger's were now being shifted over to smart contracts or things there were resemble block chains but there was also a fundamental change in what we think this technology will turn society to be and we are living in and as you feel it as one of the leading companies in the world for technology this is really at the very the very midst of a transformational period that will change forever everything that define the 20th century institutional frameworks so we got intrigued and we wanted to go deeper with that at the same time as Google has introduced we co-founded a company called Nexus frontier tech like every good story which is good to tell we started with nothing and now as she mentioned we have 130 employees Meli based out of Vietnam so we have a Academical ruby ki we merely train Meli women to become coders and then they stayed three years in the Academy they work for us for about one year and after one year they get headhunted 4x15 or the seller we can pay that's normal it's part of the problem we have in the industry that most of the talent is going in the hands of the very few companies that can afford to have talent but we know this from up front so we understand the turnover will be very high so Nexus became for us a bit of a social incubator but is equally a quite successful company we are a real AI company which means that we have real AI scientists our entire scientific background come from Japan the Japanese have been ahead of the game since you know we even started to understand what is AI so they are 20 years I had in the conceptual understanding of AI they don't have the financial capacity to turn into organization like this or any sort of organization that is AI its specific so for them is more of a cultural paradigm than anything else so they are perfect in training mainly the Vietnamese coders to understand AI from the perspective of conceptual models that we have a one pocket in Bangkok we're now opening one in in Kuala Lumpur with a small pocket in Singapore but our office is in London we started as a small small company now we're shifting into a bit larger company we are like every company that wants to survive trying to expand our financing and we are on the route to IPO 2022 2033 most likely Gnostic and so we've been working with KPMG to get underwriting so that we are ready for this we restructure the boards so it's one of those story that follows any form a technology company story that eventually is free not acquired will go public now what this was the learning from this you know we're not coming from technology as a school introducer I come from economics my quarters came from a finance and Danny is the technologist so he came from from technology but is not a scientist so to say so we started to say well why do we while we understand technology is becoming more predominant weakly understand that artificial intelligence as an architecture is becoming the most interesting story to tell because it's the one that is integrating multiple technologies is within the spectrum of what we call the fourth Industrial Revolution and this was something that was reinforced by my experience with the World Economic Forum which coin determined the first place we started to see that this integration of technology they are interoperable and compatible because they are converging and as they're converging they're creating this intelligent euro system there was mainly replacing some of the most repetitive tasks were used to have before so we start to notice that this technology is becoming predominant but he also started with a number of different strings attached number one this technology is not distributed the conversion between technology development and general-purpose technologies is quite low it doesn't become shared across different code of mass customizations we noticed that the technology company that our mushrooming around the world they tend to have a really short life span and they get acquired by the traditional players there is almost like a systematic conversion from startup to acquisitions and interesting they're not acquired to preserve company ideas they merely acquiring the asset but most likely the people we start having over dependency on very few companies and where is the rest going if it's not enough from a geopolitical perspective with the exception of US and China nobody really is competing for AI u.s. is on the private sector it does not necessarily scale down and cascade down to the private sector many Americans see they are still somehow attached to the 20th century design so we haven't seen the conversion between American technology penetrated into the livelihood of people but in China instead we've seen that government government activity is shifting AI to be almost like a national asset make sure in that from commerce to IOT sensors security surveillance and of course artificial intelligence we're way more way more presence in China in a number of different waves of AI than what we notice before so we started to write about this so we took about here and a half we wrote with Danny in terrence di republic we have one major purpose number one is to tell everybody is not intelligent it's just a computational capacity that has the ability to replace a lot of our jobs because our job were designed when none of this technology was there number two is much more about intelligent automation rather than just intelligent that the term was coined in 1956 for the first time it was a way to define some form of of cognitive skills but we are far from thinking that he can think of course it does good enough to make us look relatively limited in the amount of possibility we have to preserve our socio-economic structure the way they are and many of our jobs are somehow related to some degree of repetition none is really here at Google but of course outside of this environment you know this many jobs are still designed with 1950s or like job models and interesting if I'm asking the question how many jobs exist in 1950 and I have an answer to say X and amenities jobs still exist today the answer will be that about nine percent of the jobs that exist in 1950 they still exist today so naturally they get exposed over time to be replaced so the social implication is much more profound that the economics one somehow the economic one is way more important than just the technology one and government have been quite absent and understanding technology is an opportunity to readjust social gaps so we would like to think the government maybe can start stepping up because with exception of very few government's most of them very small and very entrepreneurial most government still struggle with the idea of technology as if technology was still just the IT department which is you guys know it's not and that started to be our journey so we wanted to thank can we think of technology becoming much more diffused and distributed we actually had a working title which was there's no intelligence in AI but our publishers said if you guys want to sell this stuff you need to make him more appealing so we started to say well what could be a sense of distribution of technology so we talked about the Republic the idea this technology is now share and diffuse and available to everybody because going back to one of the major concern that I have and that I like to share with you which will also will finish my like preliminary conversation before your questions is that if we're not distributing this technology across very few country will have control across everything we do the problem with that is that it creates no holy ethical issues but then it changes forever the nature geopolitics equally change the natural democracies and it changed the nature behavior because as much as we do research about behavior we notice that no matter how special we think we are we're quite predictable and our behavior tends to be somehow summarized by pattern default mechanism decoys context social norming peer pressure so as much as I think we were special I still like to believe the story from from a perspective of societal value we tend to be quite predictable so what will happen when company will be able to know everything about my life better than myself and what how does this change society so this was our original conversation now the paradox is that we have an AI company so we have all the interest to be advocate and evangelist for AI but we also not scientist from AI we're mainly social socioeconomic scientists right we are we are merely school professors business school professors so how do we make sure that we are navigating this conversation where we have an implication for the economy for governments and alotta and that's the nature of the book NASA cool has introduced the book went very well we were lucky that we were able to get to Amazon bestseller status within the first few hours of the book launch he gave us a lot of opportunity to engage and meet people so beside the teaching and writing most of my time these days doing book events or book conversation like the one we have right now but this was particularly important to me number one because my constituency today is an important one you work with technology every day and you are defined by technology more than other companies you probably have dilemmas as you see as people the evolution of this technology you must find yourself that is a global company compliance operating in multiple contests is becoming more more challenging you know the government can accelerate but also shut down things right away and we have lack of governance on technology we currently don't really have a blueprint to this technology governance be orchestrated at the international level at the multilateral organization define money should we think that we should operate like the banking system should we think about regional cooperation like d-u was the original plan there was a model of super parties that was interested about regulating the interest of the region should we think about inter-regional cooperation that could happen for example in an area like Asia where many country might need to orchestrate their resources also foreign technologies or should we just let the market decide should we where is the MARTA Bandar between market validation and innovation graveyard how much can the government decide this is something I want to control because it's in my best interest and how much will that eventually lead companies to leave and go elsewhere so these are some of the dilemmas that I guess you face you ask yourself I ask myself and today it's just an opportunity before go figure they will get all current time for some reason to have this conversation talk and get maybe the opportunity to meet each other and this you know comfortable setting as we are so that's my little intro and I love to hear more about question or comments or things you'd like to share the more we make this a conversation I think the better it will look like right especially on video so let's start that we say like any question yes so you mentioned about countries and governments taking the lead on AI and the examples you gave Germany versus China are very different sorry US versus China what might be quite different from especially from from the point that where they're approaching AI participation versus control innovation versus you know efficiency and so on from your work in in APAC do you see that there is a chance that AI can be democratized and can follow an open-source kind of I don't want to call it a revolution but the movement and sort of counter or at least match a government force on the field thank you for the questioning my name is Lesley as well thank you for this hustle so I think first of all I have to tell you what prevents AI to become applicable imagine that we could number one is that we still have to digitalize a lot of stuff they are many organization and government that still operates like 1970 1980s they have not modernized the processes they still are stuck in to control and command they still do not trust they need five steps to approve a process because you need four people before you to trust that the fifth people person will say yes let's do this so I think we especially from the from the entrepreneurial side my job we notice that many companies don't have the ability to digitalize fast enough they come up and say we like to have AI sure but their entire value chain is still quite analog so how do we do that I think the first question is how do we recognize opportunity for technology to really correct the inefficiency in what companies and entities do and help them eventually discover a higher possibility for them to position themselves in the market without feeling that they are left behind once you have desktop the next step we find is the question on what do I need in terms of the type of needs I have most of the time they don't need AI then it's some form of software and that doesn't have to be even intelligent you have to be smart enough to make sure that he is is autonomous but it's not AI some advanced are having interesting question there apply predictive analytics or predictive modeling then machine learning kicks in but how many of them really require AI a very small part so I would say we might get to an AI model when we start digitalising more and more what we have in government funding help in modernizing the infrastructure that we have in business then I think we can start asking can this become open-source will this become open-source well so far the country that control this technologies they don't have any incentive to eventually make it available so far because there's still a lot of value in proprietary technology like the one we're talking about furthermore shifting from traditional asset to data made it quite interesting that if you have control on the data set you pretty much control a lot so I think we have to start thinking what is the economic incentive for any entity to distribute these technologies the only answer I have is to be driven in collaboration with governments this government interests would be to make sure this technology is becoming distributed there's government need to figure out how will we modernize an economic model is now becoming obsolete technology like AI or anything related to has the potential to create jobs we don't have but we have to start suspending some of our usual suspect number one technology virtual human who is more efficient that's a quite dumb question to ask so you cannot run it as an equation you have to run in as some form a combination between human job and technologies so in more physical ja we call it Kabaddi X you guys know this in less physical job we call it sim your intelligence is the ability to integrate technology in what we currently do and by doing this you generate in a spectrum of skills the currently we don't have I think that would be a lot of value we can create millions a job that we currently don't have without fear in they all were trying to do is to bring manufacturing back to a country no match in your country whatsoever or to make a country you know a game predominant again because that model nationalism will never work in this day so I think is really about first of all multiple step require before we're gonna get to that point do I see this happening I see this in small country they have not a lot of historical heritage this desire to modernize in the future but in places like the u.s. I'm not talking about the technology companies in the valley but in San let's a country and in the EU I still see so much attachment to the past there's more interesting in reviving the past and looking forward to the future unless you're Ireland and therefore you have got nothing to look backwards you can only look forward right but go to the UK and for example the UK is a perfect example being trapping this Mirage of the past you know what used to be an empire now it's gonna be an island isolated from the rest of the world but that's my political stunt so but thank you for your question hi my name is Ron two-part question first of all how different is the AI revolution from the Industrial Revolution or the invention of electricity in terms of an impact and the other part of the question is if it's just about replacing mundane let's say or jobs that can be automated why not just leave it as it is what's the risk of main the status quo between us and Jericho can you build a question and and beautiful because I think they help our conversation right to to go to the next level I'll start from the second one the issue with keeping things as they are is that a number of people are difficult it's difficult for them to get trained to do anything else why for too long they've been doing the same job and they their skill gaps become wider and wider up to a point in which you can't train anybody anymore take for example petrochemical engineer with a degree if you're replacing that capacity with an automation there's no much that this this expert can do outside of that contest because he is so deep in his knowledge or he or knowledge that transferring over is a significant cost so one of the problem we're going to have is that a large part of the population will become unemployable if that happens it's not the issue with an employability is the fact that when population loses economic incentives it's easy to radicalize public opinion and when you radicalize in history monsters show up we saw this when we saw the the last integrated part of the UK decided to vote to leave they have less a stake the most the most forgotten part of the United States the Rust Belt the one that was less less impact or least impacted by the prosperity of the globalization decided to vote against the establishment in part of the world like in Brazil the constant dis content that people have allowed nationalism populist to rise again just to be very candid the problem with that I have when nationalists is not nationalism per se because it's perfectly fine to look after the interests of your country if when nationalism is understood as a contrast with globalization the best nationalists are the one there actually are globalist because it the only way you have to defend your own interest is to play in the global world right so I think that's my problem is that those kind of polarization the holy they polarize public opinion but they give space to people to use rhetoric to Mellie enchant people you know when when I'm gonna say for example and I don't wanna have a reference to any country particularly fine going to tell you that the job that I have lost to technology will come back I am lying because no job lost to automation will ever come back but if I have lost my job to automation I read that maybe my factory move over to Mexico to China somebody else I kind of believe that maybe something can be reversed back so I find it difficult that if we're not addressing this the the current situation we might have even more dis content and this content is an engine for a lot of issues sort of so to say to the first question which is a beautiful question in every other revolution we had that displacement all ever happened but we were shifting people from one simple job to a more sophisticated one so interesting if you looking historico lee in the previous three every time that we move from one level to the other more job we're being created so if I was working within a farm and now I'm having you know maybe a tractor that does the job many does people leave the farming and they go to the cities where they now become in mechanics right so that evolution has improved their position in life they shifted into a different level economic mobility and they start planning their future by saying I want to get married gonna have kids I will say for my kids and my kids eventually will go to university and all of that so the previous three model were always I displaced but I'm improving the position in fact if you measure in the number of job created historically during those three every time we displace more job we've being created I'm gonna give you one simple example when the ATM was introduced in banking in the sixty people working in a bank were freaking out they were saying if now you have an ATM that's doing my job will I lose my job well no it's because of the ATM the people in the bank could do things more significant then maybe just the counting money so ATM has allowed the banking industry to prosper even more and so imagine these apply to every single injury before it was actually a blessing now that's like actually the catch by this place in the job and by creating efficiency I do not necessarily create new jobs because you can have a dark factory that runs is a factory running without people merely robotics that is called dark because you don't need light when you don't have people that is as efficient it's not more than a normal factory could now you work in 24 hours a day where the revenue of the firm tends to be quite high but that specific revenue is not redistributed back into anything other than tax either the company pays there's no jobs in the same proportion that you actually displace in so that's what the 14 distribution is a blessing if you embrace it because you modernize the way you think it's a curse if you don't embrace it because the level of gap that you're gonna have in the future will become unsurmountable you might have country company or entity they will never be able to catch up button that's the main difference reason why we had to be vigilant now is because by itself auto automation make us quite redundant in most of the job we have unless we redesign in education let me start thinking that the way human labor should be measured should be with KPI they reflect in no linear distribution unless you're trying to think that you know we are going to be used in non repetitive tasks across the system but I know a lot of job when I'm not not necessarily at Google but when I'm talking this to a my to a class of executives and I ask the question how much of your job is repetitive and all it takes is that you've writing emails PowerPoint and spreadsheets if they say 30 to 40 percent I always say economics is much more in favor of the mission than in keeping your job because bear in mind that in a company in average labor cost is about 33 percent of the entire cost of the company to somebody when they say save money the easiest way to do is to replace it with automation now people will say at first is expensive but you can easily demonstrate it after 12 months they operate the operating expenditure the OPEX is now paying off and now you have in you know profits so I think that's the danger we have but thanks for your questions [Music] my name is Waleed's I want to go back to a point around the danger of AI technology being controlled by a few companies and a few countries and contrast that versus the developing countries that are dealing with the the basics of having electricity feeding people and so forth so the gap is huge and the gap is only accelerating so how do you see this playing out because as you mentioned the developed countries and so for the behavior is not very benevolent and so how do you see this playing out do they the third world countries and developing countries have an uncertain multiple tasks are they really behind now or how will this kind of how will they benefit from the tech and AI thanks for this really for your question so I find that that we have examples of country that 25 years ago we're fighting for their life like Rwanda and now it's one of the most internet penetrated country in the world they start having they start having block chains in part of the government functions and if somebody would ask us 20 years ago can this country ever become a major permanent country in Africa it would be difficult for us to say right we've seen some specific areas arid like Morocco becoming a leader in renewable energy and some specific kind of manufacturing because they understood the energy and energy storage is key so a lot of the energy that used to come for example from France now come for example from Morocco in country like Spain they have been struggling with energy efficiency for quite some time or Tunisia following similar trends so I see examples a country that they were able to leapfrog because they have nothing to hold them back and I think this is like my answer to your question if you have a lot of a narrative structure from the past it's difficult to change because you start having a lot of resistance from the fact that you have in inherited structure and fight generation of people at work you know people there at the end of their career they don't have the same thirst and appetite for technology as somebody we just started but because the life expectancy in longevity we now have literature five generation of work plus robotics and AI just kind of a complex environment to have to but then to play up a bit on your question many dis governments they get loans they get funding they want to track the investor but they still attract investor they speak a twentieth-century rationale so they don't bring technology company over to help them build an ecosystem they merely build being a company to bring real estate or oil and gas as much as they are profitable businesses but they do not really reflect an image of the future so I think it's how do we help them and educate them to think that the investment in the country to start building an infrastructure that become a trestle for the digitalization to come through for the automation to come through I think this is the way forward I don't see this happening immediately because I find and to be to be honest in with my answer in some part the world the political class is very detached from the reality of the country or you're so old in comparison to the average age while the first thing I say when I'm teaching more geopolitical content is the in the African continent we have probably won the best representation of average age 20 years the politician running the country might be ninety nine ninety four eighty nine so we truly have a gap in the priority that you might have in making decisions I think this is somehow won the challenge I see so to finish on that if they don't catch up they will become what Harare the guy who wrote homosapiens called that the colonies no jurisdiction any more digital sovereignty means that sovereignty will be in the hands of very few companies I let you imagine a much power you have if you control every single aspect of an economy because it's now a digital data set so I think this is the risk that we're running and I'm not sure if this is something that will happen because the estimate in things like this always demonstrate that the difference between the estimate the S petition and the forked that the reality might be very different but it's a risk that we run it so how do we encourage the right level of investors coming to this country how do we help the political leader to understand the technology is no longer just efficiency in the production with a way of defining competitive event and comparative advantage multiple conversation to have but thanks for your question yes hi mark my name is Ryan my question is around you talk about the digitization of data as a step before getting to AI models so as we digitize the data there's a lot of bias in that data because we're creating it as humans so are we gonna get to a place where we actually teach AI models ethics and values and if yes who's ethics and whose values mm-hmm good question and beautiful question so first first of all yes the number data that is merely being somehow discovered is more and more visible I think we are in discovering today two things there is the explicit biases which are the mistake that we discover like in the case of the facial recognition and just because you have a different dark skin connotation the algorithm does not recognize you that's easy to fix but there's a lot of implicit biases they really are about judgment and I think you are reflecting exactly the problem I will have a problem with the cultural predominance of a given group of people when school was introduced in my company one the reason why we pride ourself for having 80 percent women as coders because the nature to buy it we're gonna have first of all will be very different but also much more mitigated from the bias or the traditional engineering culture I think one way to eventually mitigate we can never solve biases biases are part of human behavior is to mitigate by having a number of cross-cultural teams they're able to defeat the predominance of the mental model if I have five engineers in the team I will keep on having a bias that is coming from their mental model after having a diversity in the talent I'm actually employing eventually I decrease the less dependency on one mental model we saw this for example with singularity University which is powered by NASA this guy asking people from all van is a life to come and address major challenges and their solution are extremely robust because they're not coming from a specific cultural set that said I think there are two possibility one is changing the hiring making sure we're no longer hiring people that looks like us and second diversify much more making sure that we can train people to think about technology as a possible career especially people that now are not part or considering that the second part is that how do we build capacity to start discovering biases and correct it so I have a friend who was she's a scientist she did her postdoc at MIT she's very prominent so she had to decide what she wants to do as she has all sort of options she can teach she can go into coding and she can consult so she's consulting with Boston Consulting Group on discovering biases in algorithm and helping company address that now when I asked her how much competition do you have she said I am the only one so how do we start building capacity for almost like you know you wish you have ghostbusters how do you have bias Buster's people they're able to use coding as a way to discover biases engage in a debate final point I would like to share with you many biases coming from the fact that the coders are not integrated which is part of your ethical question they're not integrated into the core strategy the company you should go to a CEO today and ask them do you know what your tighty does I don't know they are somewhere and the door is locked so they can come out and ask the IT guys do you know what's the record business of your business of your company many of them do not really know and in some cases because we wanted to horizontally integrate we have sourced this to somewhere in the world so we need to link again technology with strategy so that the technology guys know what they're planning and programming the c-suite understand the technology is much more than technology is a strategic positioning that will decrease a lot mistake of interpretation final example because your question is is profound somehow it can go into multiple level of implication what a problem we have in biases is an algorithm used for education in school systems where we're using algorithm to determine performance of children but many of these kids if they come in from these advantages or disadvantages that have family backgrounds they will never perform well so what do we do by using algorithm there were designers standards we keep a marginalize in those people who need us the most but what happened if you're a rich kid you go to private school private school don't use them to dice testing they use people the same happen for if you're asking for a loan to a bank and you're in the US and you asking for this this this federal score the credit score people that perform poorly the algorithm will decide that you don't qualify for a loan therefore you don't have access to an opportunity there is a bias and what determined to be viable but if you're very rich you go to private banking where you have been private banker so you have a person that will manage your portfolio so rich kids are are coached by people rich people are advised in their wealth by people but poor people are measured by algorithms that's a major problem we have in the ethics of AI I think that we have to address plus profiling which is a different conversation which goes into am I using historical data to forecast performance if I do doesn't mean that if I'm using historical data from a neighborhood that has historically been exposed to crime does it mean that I will always forecast the crime will happen in the same region so am i using technology to discriminate even more I think that's that's where we have to be extremely careful but thanks for questions just before we continue a couple more questions and then maybe we'll do the closing as well sure great hello hi Lee hi hey honey if I may I'd like to take a step back to look at things in a bit more macro way sure and if we look at a technology overall throughout history and how its contributed to us as a species particularly since we landed to the moon and that accelerated phase we've had since then too we are the probably healthiest we've been ever we are we lead the simplest life possible we have the most potential possible but that has been followed or simultaneously come with an inversely inverse correlation with happiness loneliness as an epidemic increased anxiety and it seems that we tend to at least from my perspective whenever we have a milestone technology that arises we tend to address it the same way so we start regulation we start talking geopolitics government centralization using it as a weapon potentially etc right and then even in the discussion today case in point what we're saying today we always discuss it end up discussing the economic implications of it while the social implications of it take a back seat what do you think those social implications of AI are knowing that all the previous milestone technologies has led toward more individualization or individualism in society and then on that as a follow-up question and do we need to or are you for or against teaching AI emotions and recognizing emotion and then what would that have an implication on us socially as human beings right well the social implication are inevitable now more than before merely because the system is clearly showing signs of fragmentation and I'm not talking about a I am talking our socio-economic structure there fragmented if the 20th century was a a with the age of convergence 21st century clearly showing that the traditional in Spoleto and economic actors are failing we have in coronavirus and the fat cut interest rates what does it mean more debt into the economy who pays the debt with people that don't have capacity who benefit from this whoever already has money so we keep on having the same rhetoric so I think a leader question is will the system duty to run as it is and I don't think so we are really getting into modelling with perpetual growth that was somehow envisioned by GDP and industrial model it's coming to an end it can't work forever especially with 7.5 billion P other which 5.5 are actively into the economy so I think we are gonna see the end of the system as it was devised and design before I think the implication will be Wow by the way death system defined the purpose of Labor in many parts of the world the Constitution is based on the foundational labor but what does it mean to work in a situation where a lot of our job are redundant he changes the relationship with the planet because we now know that the climate imperative is not just a buzzword but we see this more and more it was reminding in a class I was teaching these days that if we are really showing signs of inconsistency with coronaviruses imagine what will happen when the system is melting down where we have in climate refugees but we start having outbreaks of viruses because biodiversity going to mainly collapse so I think we're gonna be facing the limitation our model as it is technology is the potential to redesign what is the concept of value in a society where no longer be measured by efficiency because you're modeling of your conversation on individualism if I'm gonna be measured by my KPI my KPI are all economic conversion or was something that is defined performance clearly the relationship with that and life is conflictual my life cannot be measured on KPI we are the least organized the most chaotic the list linear entities on this planet life and growing up doesn't follow in a straight line relationship don't work always according to the manual and if you have kids try to read the manual how to raise the kids he never works right the console misbehave so I think we are facing the reality that technology has accelerated this that almost that the reality moment moment of truth that the economics and the obsession on growth can no longer work forever so I always say can technology especially when it's so powerful helped us to navigate the institutional framework of a new emerging structure we call it the new world order it's a little bit dramatic but it's pretty much what it is is a system that is no longer design humans being part of an efficiency model shape around 24 hours / 3 8 hours a day a productive unit but more about what did this like to be human and what does it mean to thrive to have economy they're merely prospering but without having that dependency on mathematical models and I think technology can help on your second question you know I don't know whether we should teach emotion and you can say emotion our algorithmic I can teach a series of emotion anyway to a machine and eventually I'll be able to recognize things like sadness joy euphoria I think the Japanese have been doing this as a way you compensate in the lack of labor or the lack of young people so I always say question is what do we need technology for my my bottom line is that technology is designed to maximize human well-being if I have to and human well-being has to be defined by society in their determinism what is human well-being it might be my ability to find a life made of fulfillment it might be my ability to be considered a father a husband before being consider an economist or a professor right you have to define what that specific is and technology can help us a lot it can help us to make injustice visible it can make things transparent so you're not only generating this red tape culture you can make things actually accessible you can it can facilitate access to people that don't have access so I always see technology and by default are much more of a technology optimist but I think what we're lacking is the design what for because if we're using technology as we use it before all we're gonna do Ally is to reinforce the system that we have before by making it even more dry and acute in in the implication we're gonna have socially we should never forget that them that this content we feel in the world today is merely social inspire by people that suddenly have no economic modeling centum ability one day they wake up and they say what do I live for so what do you do there you try to upset a little bit the status quo because you get nothing to hold that to but your question like all the question guys asked a question that could be taken forever right because they are so profound but hopefully just just helping the economics of the conversation we have one last question here yes thank you for coming when it was a hood we imagined that AI is not intelligent so I just want to understand more like what is intelligence in your opinion and what could make AI intelligent well I don't know whether we should pursue intelligence and objective or technology I think technology should be instrumental all the way to achieve something that we can't achieve when I ask this question to the AI scientists they almost ask they always look at me is like AI is almost like not the right word for this is algorithm computational capacities they be able to do think quicker and faster with more precision so I think we should teach I think algorithm to be able to answer the question that we want to be address so for me much more about how do we help our ability to select and structure the problem to be what algorithm are designed to do so that's what I think can improve is that we can use technology in question that now we're not addressing one quick example we're not using AI for climate change very little you know we could address climate change guys few years back with a little bit of GDP we would have gone way past what was the problem is that the moment that somebody thinks the climate change is and somebody say is not it becomes a political ideology and therefore everything changes but we could use the AI to generate generate scenarios for responsiveness we can generate this for outbreaks one question we were talking with my colleague Alessandro is also here the whu-oh doesn't understand multiplication of the virus so what they do they regulate the accordion by thinking that virus is ever late ever evolving linear models but they don't they evolve in nonlinear model but how do we use technology to do that I think that's what technology should do and that's what will give them a sense of intelligence although I don't think the term is intelligence but I think it was give the sense of social implication so the technologies used for social benefit that's where I think what it is my definition telogen is our imperfection is intelligent our ability for us as humans to generate bonds relationship to create and to actually to obstruct ideas you know the fact that we can think something does not exist is a phenomenal ability for people to see that things that don't exist can become reality that ability or converting ideas into project the ability of suspending a decision for something is greater than us the ability of surrendering to something that we recognize greater than us in that's what defines us intelligent for me intelligence and being human too much understand they're interchangeable terms I simply find it very difficult to use the concept of intelligence to an algorithm not because the algorithm is not good it just did this design for something very different but thank you for your question so this is where I think the time is against me and I have to stop I will continue for another three and half hours if I could eventually I will eat the banana that is waiting for me right behind but I mean thank you for having me thank you [Applause] [Music] you
