 great so welcome to the webinar today we will  be talking about ai enabling your business so   a little bit about me i am ram prakash and  i lead the ai efforts for zero corporation   i have been with the company for close to a decade  now i started off the ai efforts for the company   uh long back sometime around 2011 early  2012 where it wasn't really called or helped   ai back then it was known by a lot of terms it  was called probabilistic programming it was called   you know big data deriving intelligence from  big data and so on but now eventually a lot of   changes happened and today ai is talked about  a lot and a lot of people are trying to do ai   and there is always a constant fear of missing  out especially in the field of ai uh think about   it you you you are running a business and uh you  would have read something about ai in the media   and you want to know how to get ai into your  business process so that you can reap the maximum   benefit out of it there is always this constant  fear of missing out especially when we talk about   emerging technologies like these uh the goal of  today's webinar will be to demystify all of that   and clearly give you a view on how ai can help you  today in your business process so we'll get going   the notion of traditional intelligence in  software right so we have been having enterprise   software for decades now and we have had a lot of  enterprise software and uh there has been a lot of   traditional notion of intelligence right  so you software has been termed intelligent   probably some 10 years back by the notion of a  scheduled task let's say there is a task that runs   at every three hours once that runs every four  hours once you can pre-configure it you schedule   you do a set of rules and then you schedule a task  and that was all called intelligent software right   you also had a lot of threshold based workflows  remember when you were signing up for some leads   when leads started coming in and you have a  rule set up on your uh tool in let's say in   your crm where whenever 10 leads have signed up  then probably run this promotion or when a lead   has signed up and has done so and so activities  send him this email right so you would configure   rules and that rules would execute as and when  such events happen so a lot of complex ensemble of   if and else statements were traditionally called  intelligence now enter artificial intelligence   what is so different about artificial intelligence  that the traditional intelligence didn't have   i would call artificial intelligence as statistics  on steroids we have been using statistics for   centuries together almost every drug that came  into development used a lot of statistical   techniques to prove if it is effective or not so  the whole evolution of human being we have been   using statistics but now i would call we would  in fact very funnily call ai is a statistics with   marketing team right so if you think about it lot  of or all a concepts have deep roots to statistics   but the only thing that is different from  traditional mainstream statistics is that ai uses   a lot of past data it learns from its past data  and then the predictions are being applied unlike   traditional statistical techniques where you  look at the current data and make a prediction   or make a determination out of the given data  set but ai also looks at your past data so it   understands a lot of trends so that in a nutshell  is what i would call the definition of artificial   intelligence there have been so many variants  of it so many uh classifications on what it does   supervised unsupervised classification regression  clustering but let us put all of it aside for now   for now let us just think about ai as statistics  that uses a lot of past data and this particular   artificial intelligence differs over traditional  intelligence by the fact that in traditional   intelligence you write your rules in artificial  intelligence you just need a ton of past data   the system derives the rule out of itself so i  hope i've said the context uh on what artificial   intelligence is now we will see more on how  to get it going in your business process so   the first uh sub section of my talk would  be uh looking at the recent trends in ai and   what they mean for you running your business  uh this is from uh nithya yog's india   ai report which came sometime in 2018 uh it  clearly states it's not just about ai it's always   a i plus x uh for example zoho as a company has  been around for decades it has been around for   all products have been around for 10 plus years  now we are not a startup that that just does ai   right so we are trying to retrofit ai into  products and sell those features to customers who   are who have decades of experience with the same  product who know their business much better than   an ai feature that was introduced last month  right so it is not just about ai it is how well   ai integrates with your existing workflows with  your existing business processes and so on i would   like to share a small story here it was somewhere  around 2014 where uh it was a very complex aia   system but then initially we were all excited  about the math uh so we cracked the math we we   solved it on our language we uh you know we made  a lot of nodes we it was very good to understand   the math right so this was at the start of  the ml team where we started off with the   math and uh we need to plumb a lot of data  pipelines to get things together like i said   uh the products have been around for decades and  traditionally engineering management and product   management always cared about code reusability  code extendability and things like that but what   was totally new sometime in 2014 2015 was product  management should also take care of the kind of   data points the product is going to generate so  that the product becomes ai and analytics ready   right so that story ahead we started doing  ai where we launched a very beautiful complex   feature powered by ai that that did a lot of uh  influence on the products decision making system   and uh we launched the product and we were  all excited and we were waiting for feedback   we were continuously refreshing our inboxes like  throughout the day throughout the night because   across time zones we'll have to take care of  it team was very excited but for the first week   we never had any feedback anything from  the customer at all after about 10 days   i think after about 10 days there came in  an email saying hey how do i turn this off   and uh we were actually not so happy with that  feedback right so interestingly during the same   point in time we launched a real small feature  a real small a feature that we ourselves didn't   care about much we launched it and then  we forgot about it but this feature became   our most used ai feature for at least the  first two years i'll show you what that is   this is from our local development platform zoho  creator where we recommend icons for form names   so whenever you create a form uh you we recommend  a select set of items from uh the given uh thing   right so so this feature was widely used and got  raving feedback from all of our customers in fact   there was somebody who called up and said uh i  i just created a form named california leads and   your system beautifully recommended the golden  gate bridge icon to us we have never actually   uh seen that before we it it wasn't covered in our  ai test cases and the team was very happy about it   that was a big learning to us now now if you are  somebody who is looking at uh building ai tools   take this ai plus x mantra to your heart it's  about it's not about how great your ai feature is   it's about how well it integrates into your  existing workflow even the most trivialist of the   trivial icon recommendation can can be a herpinger  to a lot of things right just give me a second i'm told my video is frozen so i'll  just turn off my video so that great all right so this is how the whole of the  fandomic has been turned on video turn off   video you're on mute etc but thankfully we are  all able to connect that is the silver lining of   all this bad stuff uh perfect so let's get going so ai in your business is coming in to actually  do a process automation to decision automation   transfer let me explain what that is the  last decade we were all talking about process   automation digitization and things like that right  which essentially means taking out paper forms   and automating it and digitizing it so that the  records become electronic once the records become   electronic it becomes very easy to search it  becomes very easy to do calculations on uh to take   to take insights out of it so data information  that was the 2000 to 2015 maybe that was the   decade where a lot of digitization happened but  now ai is going to do decision automation let me   let me walk you through what that is let  us take an example of inventory management   this is our traditional warehouse looks like  think of it like a biscuit factory or or an   ikea's warehouse just imagine what you would  like to but in a typical warehouse let us see   where ai can help so initially uh it was  all about having these records on ledgers   uh writing nodes and as and when a part of your  inventory is shipped you make notes on the ledger   and as and when new inventory comes in you  make notes and then that was digitized you had   some variant of erp for the inventory and uh  people were you know keying in us and when   things came in things went out the the biggest  possible automation was barcodes where you   scan in and scan out inventory as and when it  came in right but now with the advent of ai   you can do three powerful things on it which is  going to be ocr object detection and forecasting   if it is too much of mumbo jumbo to you i  have uh explanation coming in next slide   but again we are still in process automation we  haven't ventured into decision automation yet   now look at this this is about your ocr  which is optical character recognition   right imagine you have an inventory of let's  say sports foods and you want to find out   what all adidas products you have barcodes might  not really help you because you need to have fed   all those information into barcodes but you have  pictures of it right that's how e-commerce works   right you have pictures of everything you  have and here the first picture uh you see   is something which says when you search for  adidas it has formed an adidas in the football   and an adidas indie t-shirt so basically it is  doing an ocr from the list of items you have   and then it is bringing it up for you the  next thing is going to be object recognition   where of course uh you wouldn't be searching a  giraffe in your inventory management system but   i i think that relates right you could probably be  searching for a sports shoe you could probably be   searching for a blue jacket right or a red jacket  now all of that could come out of your inventory   again we are still in process automation where we  have automated this process from paper to computer   and then we have we made it digitally searchable  very optimally searchable and so on and then you   have a forecast algorithm the forecast again when  you use ai it looks at a lot of your past data   it knows how your demand is forecast it knows uh  by the before diwali what would be your demand   on weekdays what would be your demand on  weekends what would be your demand it knows   all of your traditional seasonal patterns and it  also knows that your business is growing at 10   percent every year so you need to factor that 10  room every year so that you stock enough inventory   right so the first three things that ai can  bring into traditional inventory management   is ocdr object detection and forecasting but from  where does this get on to decision automation   this is where packet geometry comes in   so package geometry is a feature that is available  in servo inventory that tells you how to ship   boxes efficiently so that you can you know save  a lot on shipping costs now you're generally when   you're about to ship something you probably have  a fixed set of bigger boxes and the cost is per   dimension per weight etcetera and today it is  all human judgment on how many boxes to uh fit   in into a bigger box right so we have all had the  experience of a small nail cutter being shipped in   a very big box right i i have had that experience  many number of times but now with techniques like   these that employ optimization techniques and  computer vision techniques can really tell you   how to optimally pack in your boxes so that when  you have an integration with your shipping partner   it would be able to send it at a lower  cost than sending it an individual boxes   or putting a too heavy box versus two slightly  lighter boxes can be cheaper sometimes so this is   where decision automation comes in now your human  being might not be able to optimize this to the   code there might be a lot of relaxations in human  judgment especially when when trying to save last   mile costs but now with a and statistics coming  in it's going to be a real powerful game changer   where your decision is automated your decision on  how to ship how many boxes to ship how many small   boxes in a big box all of it is automated  just by looking at the dimensions right so   this is something we have available in our zoho  inventory tool now we started with an example of   the decision automation starting but a lot of  ai features will help you in that direction   generally when an enterprise or a business  is deploying ai what would be its goals so   broadly two goals very straightforward goals  the first one is process optimization right so   the last case was a clear example for process  optimization where you you have a process in which   orders come in you stack them out of the  inventory you you take things out of the   inventory and then you put them into boxes and  ship right now there is a lack of efficiency   in the last process where you can probably you're  sending different items in different boxes but now   this process is optimized think about it  anywhere in any business process there is always   there can always be a room for optimization  uh think about something like a help test   right think about something like a support disk  where support tickets come in and how well is it   distributed across the support engineers uh is are  you optimally responding to your customers what   what takes just one day to solve is it taking four  days to solve right so process optimization is one   uh broader goal of a in enterprise software  next thing of course like any any digital   transformation technique revenue maximization  is the second goal so now broadly these are   the two goals of ai now let me give you more  examples from uh the zoho car suite on how   uh ai can help in process optimization and  revenue maximization by doing decision automation   so this is a screenshot from our zoho expense  mobile app so anybody who has gone out on a   business trip knows how frustrating it is  to come back and file all your expenses   you need to have all the receipts and then you  need to scan it then you need to type the details   about it and you need to upload it and then there  will be processes in your organization saying how   much do you spend on a business dinner uh what are  the unloved items what are they not allowed items   and is this under the threshold now that  you booked a flight ticket booking is is   this under the company's budget you have a lot of  things to do now zoho expense is an app that does   a lot of these that does the first step of  digitization right so this is where we launched   ai features into zoho expense where all you need  to do is just click the picture of your receipt   and then it extracts all necessary details  out of it the name of the cafe your payment   mode uh the items you ate the total amount  and probably if there is a tip then there   is a tip and what category is it for is it  excess baggage is it food expense and so on   right so now you see the power of a i coming in  and doing a process optimization here what was   a very laborious process before a came in because  now you just click on it with your camera you just   upload it then and there and so  expense takes care of the rest   right so this is a powerful ai feature  that has saved on a lot of time and here is a screenshot from rcr uh where  the leads are being scored right so a lot   of time can be wasted chasing the wrong  leads uh it's a mutual waste of time for   both your sales person and the lead you're  talking to but things like these can have a   360 degree view of a customer and see  how well is this evaluation coming up   how well is this chance if this is the chance of  this lead to convert into a customer right uh we   the the a module actually looks at a lot  of information beyond what the user gives   you and identifies what his profile would be and  then gives you a prediction score now there are   two outcomes to it one is you you find out the  people who are most likely to convert and you   you know you probably pamper them you give them  what is missing out and so on at the same time   you find out people who are less likely to convert  right somebody with a prediction score of 50 or 45   as as you see in that yellow thing somebody  who's a cat on the wall he can either convert   or drop right so then such cat on the wall leads  can be given a treatment with your best sales guys   out there and you can win such leads right so  like i said it comes under revenue maximization now here is a screen grab from zoho desk the  customer support product you see the sentiment   analysis in action here now let's say you're a  support manager and the time you log in you have   so many tickets out there waiting for your action   now what if you can just filter tickets where your  customers are very angry right and spend most of   your time on it to make them happier and you can  also see the trend in which the sentiment changes   now especially in the screen graph here that  comes in the customer who is very angry the   sentiment is negative at the start it slowly  becomes neutral and it becomes positive at   the end of the ticket which means it's time  to pat your back on the support rep who has   given an awesome support to this end user this  is the power of ai this is process optimization again uh enterprise data can be really complex  it is not very straightforward you know you have   a lot of details uh even enterprise software  uh things are changing now enterprise software   is becoming to look like consumer software but  enterprise software traditionally when you hear   the word enterprise software you you know that  you are looking at a lot of tabs lot of icons   a lot of places where you can go  fiddle with to get your right answer   now this is where conversational interfaces come  traditionally we have had the web interface and   the mobile interface and mobile kind of  standard on two operating systems you had   android and you have ios but now the third thing  that is coming in is a conversational interface   now think about this if your search is actually  tied to a really powerful conversational interface   that makes a lot of things easier for you in  your everyday business right now here you can   see uh that somebody is searching for males from  so and so that has attachments most often we as   human beings remember such things right i know  this person sent it to me i know and sent it as   an attachment but what keywords do i go and search  it for so this not just in your emails across your   business process right it can be a lead in crm it  can be a customer support ticket and server desk   it can be a candidate that submitted this  resume via the recruitment portal it can   be your own payroll it can be your inventory it  can be anything right you have powerful visual   search features combined with the conversational  interface then that is real process optimization   right so now we saw a few examples on  how ai in the zoho suite is helping us   achieve its objectives now let us talk  about the elephant in the room privacy   so whenever somebody talks about ai the first  notion that comes in is privacy right so again   uh the reason ai is being very hyped now is  because we have abundant amount of data one   two you have awesome data collection capabilities  think about the smart watch you are wearing nobody   was counting your pulse every ten minutes and  you know storing it on the cloud 10 years back   or even five years back but now you have very low  very cost efficient data collection capabilities   coupled with moore's law so you have very good  data processing capabilities but the third reason   for ai to become stronger and stronger is the  fact that the consumer world has built a lot   of business models around data think about it that  search engine you use you don't pay for it instead   you pay with your data that social network you use  you don't really pay dollars or rupees out of your   card on it you actually pay back with your data  so that you are being targeted with relevant ads   now this this is where a lot of ai came in right  i i always think of enterprise software having its   roots in the consumer world it has a late mover  advantage where it looks at the consumer world it   learns the best practices it drops out things that  are unnecessary and then it gets filtered think   about it the last five years five years back you  didn't have a lot of enterprise mobile apps you   were doing a lot of your mobile work or enterprise  work on laptops connected to particular networks   right and but today you have a lot of mobile apps  with which you get your enterprise work done so   which means the the enterprise world has borrowed  the technology of mobile apps from the consumer   world and it is working now the same thing goes to  ai you have lot of lot of microphones this case in   the name of smart speakers sitting in your homes  and listening to all of your conversations right   and then showing relevant ads to you uh  relevant or irrelevant that doesn't matter   but but doesn't it seem inclusive now it can be  very serious when you are in the enterprise game   now let's say you are deploying ai ml in the  medicine world now there is a cancer patient and   he is ready to share his uh data points uh so  that he's given a better treatment he's given   uh you know better care uh and so on but now what  if you look at all those data points and start   recommending other relevant items to him or start  you know uh selling him other items that knowing   his condition you are trying to you know sell  him stuff you're trying to overprice that stuff   which he needs most that all becomes really bad so  enterprise ai your data privacy has to be intact   because in an enterprise your data is built as  cliched as the statement might be data the new oil   yes your data is your wealth you will  have to put it to the best use of it   and there can never be an ai system that is  going to be compromising your data privacy ever increasing data privacy requirements  of course there is there is very good uh   data privacy awareness in the world right  now think about indian railways where   we had the id card numbers ages and gender being   stuck on the coaches before you bought that  was all available for the public to read but   now they have a better sense prevail and all  of that is done with and missing a data privacy   requirement by law not only causes monetary loss  to you it also causes a lot of reputation velocity   somebody comes to know that there is a data breach  or there is a privacy breach in your organization   then he will probably think twice or thrice  about having business with you in the future so this is where the need for an integrated  business suite comes in so gogo is positioned   at the operating system for business where  all of the applications are tied to and   they act as one single entity and given  the ever increasing geographic rules uh   it is also important that the data stays  in the same geography for example uh this   this meeting uh where we are talking  is coming in via the data center that   is being hosted in india right so and across  the world we have localized data centers so   So privacy is taken care. Your laws are being taken care. The idea of an integrated suite   is really useful for technologies like AI because  AI is something that erodes all data boundaries.   You don't want to have data in silos for  AI to work better. You need to give full access to   all of your data points so that your AI model can take a better decision. Think about it, if your   AI model is able to look at 360-degree view of a  customer, from the time he came in as a lead, how   did he convert? What are his support tickets? Where does he need help? Which other features   has he not used for which he is paying for so  you can send informal or formal emails to him   in such a way that he is going to use it and get the maximum value for money. So the idea   of an integrated suite goes well with technologies  like AI evolving that make your data interesting. So, this is a screenshot from our word processor  called Zoho Writer, where you see a grammar   assistant trying to correct all of your grammar mistakes...possibly confusing words   or an incorrect adverb placement.  The beauty of this lies in the fact that   it just doesn't flag that it is wrong,  it also tells you why it is wrong and   also gives you a brief explanation  on why it has been flagged as wrong. Again, this is from the same  word processor— oho Writer.   You'll see that it also gives you a subjective  score on the right hand side of the   screen. Gives you ease of reading, a readability  score because you know especially    when you are talking to customers, it's important that you keep your communication simple and clear.   So that things are conveyed very clearly to  him and clear communication has its obvious    benefits and it also gives you very subjective  feedback on—let's say—you're using a lot of   wordy phrases. It does a lot of improper word  choices. So when I try this it   always says I use a lot of long sentences. I'm  trying to cut it down but I hope I'm keeping my   sentences short for this webinar, but this  is the feedback I always get when I write   on Zoho Writer. and it personalizes to  the best of you now there is somebody who writes   a lot of short sentences and somebody like me who  writes a lot of long sentences connected by and   are connected behind connected by annette right  so so so it gets personalized to you as well now   the notion of privacy comes in when your stack as  such has a suite that takes care of your grammar   imagine you were to submit your composed  email to a third party browser extension   and it means the browser extension is reading  all of your proprietary enterprise data it's   your business secret you don't want to share it  with one more person whereas your enterprise suite   runs on an integrated suite and you have this  facility in it that is where the power comes in   now we start off with this grammar thing in  our word processor most of enterprise software   is filled with editors you have customer support  desk you have email you have a recruitment   portal now you have editors everywhere enterprise  software 80 of enterprise software is getting in   input via some form it can be a form it can  be an editor where people can come and type in   and then it does all its analysis  on it that is just the 20 of it   right now now that is being passed on the  word processor the grammar feature in the word   processor is being passed on across all of your  apps right think about it here look at it here you   have a note taking up and the same grammar engine  which knows your style of communication your style   of writing is being deployed here to make sure  you write properly even when you're taking notes again the same thing goes for translation you  don't want to translate something to a third   part in a third party tool where you are giving  out your business secrets to the third party tool   but here you have it inside your compose window  you have it inside your text editor so that you   can translate it right right then and there  this again uh today at the zoho suite of   products we have about 15 languages and about  one not five language spars that can translate   between each other so you can communicate  your customers across the globe at least right now that you know how ai can help your  business process what all problems can it solve   uh what are the privacy requirements that  it brings on the table and okay you you've   identified all of this you're you're all set  you're trying to uh you have narrowed down on   a vendor you've got your a tools or if you're  building something uh you built all of it with   with the right specifications now how do you make  it work how do you make sure ai that you purchased   ai subscription or any products that you got in  or the a features you have is being put to best   used by the employees in your organization so  that you can extract the maximum juice out of it the first thing is going to be the case for  explanations generally ai or the way ai has   evolved it doesn't really explain why a  particular decision was arrived most a   algorithms are black box right so we saw that our  ai features usage increased up to 70 75 percent 75   percent when we started giving explanations  on why that particular decision was taken right so this is a screen graph from uh our  monitoring product site 24 7 where uh we're   trying to detect anomaly again when you do anomaly  detection using ai it factors in a lot of stuff   it knows what is normal for a 9 a.m in the morning  it knows what is normal for a 3 am in the morning   think about it a monday morning 9 a.m is  not the same as a saturday morning 3 a.m   what traditionally when you use rules  you would say 10 fail logins per minute   on a monday morning 9 a.m is an anomaly right so  it happens that way people come in on monday and   they probably forget their passwords they they  log in a couple of times it happens to everybody   but the same thing happening on a saturday  morning three am means there is a brute force   attack or somebody is trying to you know brute  force your passwords and get into your system   so this can be very time oriented your your  anomaly system has to take care of all of these   and let's say your organization is growing  let's say it's growing 20 percent every year   which is a good thing and your your ai system  has to factor that 20 growth is not an anomaly the page load time has surged to 7.5 k  milliseconds in amsterdam this has resulted in a   1.8 time increase in page load from the baseline  average 95 percentage value the baseline value   is so and so and it's calculated for the same  period between 2 and 3 am over the past four   weeks now this is what explainable ai looks like  it just doesn't flag it as an anomaly and go away   it tells you why it was flagrant normally remember  the same thing we saw in the grammar editor it   tells you why it thinks that it is a grammatical  error and also gives you a write up on how to   correct it because a an average is eighty percent  right a very good trained a model is eighty   percent right twenty percent of the time it's  wrong and you as human being know it very better and uh this is again uh for both ai producers and  a consumers if you're trying to build ai products   the deterministic to probabilistic shift is a  huge thing traditionally if you're a programmer   and you go to brute force like you randomly try  a lot of things and make your code work then   you're a bad programmer but a good neural network  engineer a good ai engineer a good data scientist   has to do a lot of probabilistic things the same  way let us talk about the uh anomaly case that we   saw in the last screen from site  24 7 then the monitoring tool   let's say the a module there is capable of  predicting outages right so you generally   have a workflow let us forget ai for now  you have a workflow and outages happen   right so what you do is you you intimate  the social media team to communicate to the   end users on on social media feeds you intimate  the network team you intimidate the teams that   are involved the networking the product team  uh the engineering team uh and so on to try   and fix that issue right you you probably  have a workflow whenever an outage happens   intimate the ceo intimate the social media  team uh do this do this do this the beauty   about enterprise software is that when ai is  trying to make automated decisions in enterprise   software it's going to be a team or teams of  people that are going to act on the decision   think about it your social network recommends  a friend or it recommends something to read   you are the only person who is going  to act on it but your site is being   shown that there is a possibility of outage you're  not the only person who is going to act on it   right now let's say i'm the person acting  on it i cannot just go tell my boss saying   uh there was an a alert that came in so i went  and added more servers that would not be a valid   reason you also need to tell them why it happened  right so that is where explanations come in and   let's say the outage prediction module tells you  that there is an eighty percent chance of voltage   so now the standard operating procedure is  going to be uh intimately social media team   intimate all the stakeholders etc but when  there is a 40 percent chance of outage you   needn't involve the social media team probably  you needn't involve your ceo but it's it's just   within the bonds of the technical team to solve  it so that nothing explodes right so so remember   your standard operating procedure varies on the  probability that comes out of your ai system   so this change has been driven through the  have to be driven through the organization   for better usage of ai because we are all used  to deterministic process boolean s or no but   now what if there is a 60 percent yes what if  the lead score is 60 lead score is 100 you will   buy lead score is 20 you wouldn't buy or the lead  score is 50 60 what is what if it is 40 right you   need to know and the system should explain why the  lead score is shown so which areas is he lagging   probably the time he used there was a server  bug and you need to given all those instincts so now we we discussed a lot about  uh how the past trend has been how ai   uh is going to bring a change what are the  features that are there that can really help   in process optimization and revenue maximization  so here we're going to look at future ai trends   and probably we'll cover this in the 10 minutes  and we'll have the last statements for q a   right so to understand what future trends are  happening we need to go back to the start of   the 19th century and uh we need to talk about the  hearts called clever hands who lived in germany   so this particular class was owned by a mathematic  professor living in berlin and the the story in   the town was that the heart is able to solve  mathematical equations right i strongly believe   that mathematics is something that has made human  beings evolve this much that is that is the unique   nature of our race uh that we can do think about  it anything that is a mathematical equation is   science anything that is not a mathematical  equation is a belief it's a superstition probably   right so math is a holy grail that only humans  have cracked now all of a sudden somebody was   telling hearts is doing nothing so you ask  what is seven times three it taps tapped it   uh tapped its legs exactly 21 times you asked  what is two times four it tapped it legs   tapped its legs exactly eight times and the  people started flocking in uh you don't have   to worry about social distancing and all that  people started flocking in to look at the hearts   and in fact it got a worldwide attention there  were a group of animal psychologists that flew   in from new york to test the animal they did a  lot of things but the hearts answered beautifully   the first thing they did was kick out the  owner the math professor out of the room   because they were wondering if he  is probably giving the heart second   apparently what happened was there was this  one particular animal psychologist that   blindfolded the horse's eyes and it stopped  doing all the math i will hold you there a lot of you would have heard this correlation  is not causation correlation is not causation   right so think of mathematics as a notion you say  force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration   f is equal to m a you can also say m is equal to  f a you can also say a equal to f by m now going   back to the story of the hearts the horse actually  took a lot of visual cues from the audience   right when you ask what is 5 times three and  whenever it is stopping the fifteenth time   people's eyes blow out with curiosity they  were also excited that the horse would stop   the hearts took a lot of visual cues from it and  stopped right not just the owner anybody there   are a lot of people in the room whenever  you reach the answer people were brimming   with energy that the hearts was able to get a  visual view of it and stopped tapping its legs   now today's ai is built on such things mathematics  as a notion doesn't imply causation that is that   is what you see in the f is equal to m a formula  you never know what is causating what here but   if uh now think about it an a system or a  three three-year-old they probably rely a   lot on correlation right you cry you get a  candy you you uh you call mommy she comes   right so it's a lot of correlation but that is not  really causation right so so the ai community is   working towards bringing in causation there are a  lot of efforts that are going on in uh especially   people like udapal who are who are bringing in a  lot of research experience into the causal domain   especially in enterprise software  causal ai is going to be a game changer   right so the traditional notion of mathematics is  being amended to bring in the notion of causation   so the first step they did was uh they said  whatever things like grandeur's causality sorry   that is that sounds like a buzzword but the idea  of grandeur's causality is that whatever happens   first is going to cause it the next one right so  you look at two uh incidents the first incident is   going to cause the second incident it doesn't  work in some cases like uh the rooster cruise   the rooster grows and then the sun rises right  rooster crows is not causating sunrising they are   correlated with each other whenever the blossom  grows the sun rises yes that is a possibility   but the idea is let me give you another  example your shoe size increases as you grow   or you grow because your shoe size is big  you are tall because your suicide speed   now this is the notion of correlation you don't  know what is costing what you know you don't know   force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration  or mass is equal to force divided by acceleration   right now now things like causal graphs come in  where you try to now there can be two things that   cost a particular thing there can be a time  lag between the effect and the cost right   so that that itself is an area of research but  i see a lot of future potential for castle ai   the next thing is going to be human in the loop  ai now uh people are talking about artificial   general intelligence and things like that but  as on date we are still very narrow intelligent   that is a module that can identify if it is a cat  or dog cannot identify if it is a male human or a   female human right that is the state of ai  we are in today we are very custom built   ai modules uh what does grammar in english will  not be able to do grammar in tamil will not be   able to do grammar and think we should not be  able to grammar in spanish and they need separate   modules we are still a long time away from  artificial general intelligence but humanity loop   ai can really be a game changer for enterprise  software today now let me give you an example   again we'll have to go back to 1983 for this there  is this particular mr stanislav petro who was   working in the army of the soviet union uh soviet  union had a missile detection system and all of a   sudden the system detected two incoming missiles  from the united states the system was programmed   in such a way that whenever it detects an  incoming missile it files a response mistake   right but now our man knew the political  climate around at that point of time   between ussr and the usa and he overruled  the response missing he stopped the excel   apparently he lost his job but he played a  very crucial role in stopping world war iii   he knew it was a false alert he  knew the political climate around it   let's also look at an online process what is the  webinar in 2020 if we don't talk about covered 90.   so this was the time early march late february  when who declared it as a declared covet 19 as   a pandemic and like everybody people in uk were  also flocking towards their supermarkets and   you know getting a lot of things holding a lot  of things the modern really didn't understand   the a model for that online grocery really didn't  understand why people are buying six months of   toilet paper in a matter of a week right and it  started blocking access to legitimate users now   what a big burden it would have been because one  time your your denied access you probably wouldn't   come back to that online grocer again irrespective  of it being abandoned or not now your ai is only   as good as the past model it was trained on  and probably you never thought of modeling a   health pandemic into your model right you never  thought of modeling a world war into your model   fortunately that is not happening right now but  the health pandemic was not modeled and the human   being would have known it it is very obvious that  the pandemic is going on people are trying to come   in and you know buy a lot of toilet papers and go  right so so the idea is the human in the loop ai   your ai becomes maximum powerful when there is  a human in the loop and that is feeding things   that are not modeled outside that is fine-tuning  uh your ai models then and there the same way the   human can also become more powerful by the  inputs from the ai model right so this is   what i call human in the loop ai and enterprise  software at least for the next decade is going to   rely on a lot of human in the loop a human plus  a i can really be a superhuman combo a cannot   individually be a human cannot have superhuman  powers but ai plus human is going to be superhuman now here is a screenshot from zoho spreadsheet  uh here you have some data points on um a   support ticket a lot of us manage everything  on spreadsheets right everything from finances   to babies growth to system provisioning in the  enterprise and so on now here is a thing where you   have a technician you have a department and then  you have the type in which they do i i hope you   can see that data on the screen now here the ai  assistant is actually giving you a lot of insights   where it picks the interesting insights from the  spreadsheet and charge it with you right you see   most frequent sla violated person distribution of  department and it also gives you a graphical view   so that your data is well represented and you  don't miss any information out of your data right so so so again this is ai helping  humans becoming better it tells you   insights which you normally don't see now  here is the second screenshot again from   service desk ticket data put in a spreadsheet and  you as an user is asking a question to the system   what is what percentage of sla violated is false  right so the system also gives you the formula   it tells you that i applied this countif formula  from these cells to give you the answer you asked   now look at the power it brings sometimes  the a system can misinterpret what you told   right you can be a spreadsheet expert so probably  the next time you wouldn't use this conversational   agent at all so this is where humanity loop ai  comes in ai gets a lot of you know gives you   the insight so that you also get an idea of what  is happening this is also called explainable ai   but broadly that is where human in the loop comes  in by giving an explanation this again is from   our bi tool zoho analytics where it gives you a  lot of insights which which you naturally don't   see when you just look at the raw data points you  see that small deal sizes will have higher win   rates right so this is the power of ai feeding  input to the human and uh taking it from there   so ai is here to aid and not replace human beings  a will make better humans humans will make better   ai they'll complement each other but no one  is going to replace the other one so the last   thing i want to talk to you about is bringing in a  low data tech you don't need bigger data points to   train your a models lot of research is going on to  train ai with the limited amount of data you have   especially like these uh catalysts or so catalysts  are serverless platform where now we are trying to   expose the ai to developers at the same time you  need not want a a small grocery vendor that is   building on our platform to bring in 500 images  of this biscuit packet right just give me five   examples i will have to expand on that this is  the ocr thing there this again is exposed to   air being exposed to developers via our  deluge runtime environment where you can   bring in your models by using some pre-trained  models that are available in the zoho suite   right so just a parting thought ai is going to  impact everything around us because there's a lot   of data everywhere a lot of intelligence has to be  derived from data so ai will touch all aspects of   life from manufacturing from health from education  to everything you do is going to have an impact   right start small don't get overwhelmed by  generally when people talk about ai they talk   about cancer cure self-driving cars no that icon  recommendation is a good place to start understand   how it works understand where it works if you are  a bank trying to deploy ai probably don't put a   into your known system first try putting ai into  recruitment try putting a into small aspects of   your customer support and then when you move it to  loan management division also try running a shadow   ai have humans wet the applications have ai with  the applications see what percentage do they match   where do they have maximum confidence where  do they have lowest confidence let's say   for salaried middle aged urban dwellers your model  85 of the time agrees with the human judgment   for old age rural lenders to rural people who are  applying for the loan your model always is wrong   with the human judgement so now find out you you  know where your ai strength is now automatically   do all the urban middle-aged salaried people  via a and find out where a doesn't perform   so you do the human part on it and then  automatically the data gets trained and   things get better so that would  be my parting thought to you so
