 from the cube Studios in Palo Alto in Boston it's the cube covering the IBM think brought to you by IBM hi everybody this is stable ante of the cube and you're watching our coverage of the IBM digital event period the multi day program tons of content and it's our pleasure to be able to bring in experts practitioners customers and partners true Rama Raghavan is here is the vice president of IBM Research in AI Triomphe thanks so much for coming on the cube thank you pleasure to be here I love this title I love the road it's great work if you qualified for it though tell us a little bit about your role and your background you came out of Stanford you had the pleasure of sure of hanging out in South San Jose at the Almaden labs beautiful place to create but give us a little background absolutely yeah so maybe go back puts in Bhangra what do I do now my role responsible for AI strategy planning and execution and IBM research across our global footprint are all our labs worldwide under Virginia I will sleep with accomplish the parts of IBM our software and services business that take the innovation a our innovation from IBM research to market to our that's the second part of what I do and where did I begin life in IBM as you said I began life at our Albertan Research Center up in in San Jose and the hills beautiful I still think it's the best fewer high I spent many years there doing work with the intersection of AI and large-scale data management NLP went back to India I was running in India lab there for a few years and now I'm back here in New York money that's awesome let's talk a little bit about sort of AI the landscape of IBM's always made it clear that you're not doing you know consumer AI you really trying to help businesses but how do you look at the landscape so it's a great question and it's one of those things that you know we constantly measure ourselves and and VI in our Harkness tell us I think we you probably heard us talk about the cloud journey but look who is like barely 20 percent of the workloads are in the cloud 80 percent still waiting yeah that number is even less and but of course it varies depending on who you ask you would say AI adoption is anywhere from 4% to 30% depending on who you ask in the straightest case but I think it's more important to look at where is this direction airy and it's very very clear the adoption is rising the value is is more it's getting better appreciate but I think more important I think is there is a broader recognition awareness and interest in knowing that to get value or the way I you start with where AI begins which is data so the story around having a solid enterprise information architecture as the base on which to drive AI is starting to happen so as the investments in data Clarkson becoming making your data ready for air starts to come true we're definitely seeing that adoption in and I think you know the second imperative the business look for obviously is the skills the tools and the skills to scale AR it can't take me months and months and hours to go build a a model I got have accelerated and then comes operationalizing but this is happening and the upward trajectory is this very very we've been talking a lot on the cube over the last couple of years it's not the innovation engine of our industry is no longer Moore's Law it's a combination of data you just talked about data applying machine to that data being able to scale it across clouds you know on Prem wherever the data lifts so right having said that you know you've had a journey you know you started out you know kind of playing jeopardy if you will it was a very narrow use basin and you expanding that you space I wonder if you could could talk about that journey specifically in the context of your your vision yeah so so let me step back and say for IBM research they are going to think about how we what our strategy ambition we we think of it as in two parts one part is the evolution of the science and techniques behind the ayats when you said it right from narrow bespoke AI that all it can do is this one thing that it's really trained for it's a large amount of data a lot of compute power to how do you have the techniques and the innovation for AI to learn from one useless to the other be less data hungry less resource empty be more trustworthy and explainable so we call that the journey from narrow to broad area and one part of our strategy as scientists and technologists is the innovation to make that so that's one part but as you said as people involved in making a I'll work in the enterprise and IBM Research AI vision would be incomplete without the second part which is what are the challenges in scaling and operationalize India if this is sufficient that I can tell you AI can do this how do I make a I do this so that you get the right are why the investment relative to return makes sense in you can share an operation possible so we do both of these imperatives P AI and the need to scale and operationalize and what are the things that are making it hard the things that make scaling an operationalizing harder data challenges we talked about that skills challenges and the fact that in enterprises you have to govern and manage here and we took that together if we think of array R at time T advancing trusting and scaling air advancing is the piece of pushing the boundary making AI narrow the product trusting is you building AI which is trustworthy is explainable you can in control and understand its behavior make sense of it and all of the technology that possible and scaling AI is when we address the problem of how do i you know reduce the time and ask for data prep how do I reduce the time for model tweaking anything how do I make sure that a model will you build today when something changes in the data I can quickly allow for you to all of the things think of day two operations away all of that is part of our scaling a a strategy so advancing trusting scaling is sort of the three big mantras around which the baby already Adam yeah so I've been doing a little work in this around this notion of data ops it's actually you know DevOps about the data data pipeline and I had a great conversation recent pop and REI global chief data officer and he explained to me how first of all customers will tell you at the very hard to operationalize a eyes he and his team took that challenge on themselves and I've had some some great success and you know we all know the problem it's a you know AI has to wait but the data has to wait for the data to be cleansed and wrangled it can a I actually helped with that part of the problem compressing that hundred percent in fact the way we think of the automation and scaling study is what we call the AI for AI school so AI in service of helping you build the AI that helps you make this right so we think of it really in three parts it's AI for data automation or data ops they are used in better discovery better cleansing better duration faster linking a quality assessment all of that using AI to do all of those data problems if you have to do and I call it AI for data order the second part is using AI to automatically figure out the best model and that's why I fought data science automation which is which your engineering hyper parameter optimization having done all the world why should a data scientist pick weeks and months experimenting if they I can accelerate that from we know matter of hours that's data and then comes the important part also which is operations automation okay I have put a data model into an application how do I monitor its behavior if the if the data that it's seeing is different from the data that was trained on how about quickly detect and a lot of the work from research that was part of that Watson open scale offering it really addressing the operational part so AI for data AI for data science automation and AI to help automate production aware is the way we break that problem so I always like to ask the folks that are deep into Rd how they ultimately are translating into commercial products and offerings because ultimately you you got to make money to fund more R&D so can you talk a little bit about how you do that and what your focus is there yeah so that's a great question and I'm going to use a few examples as well but let me say at the outset this is a very very close partnership so between the research part of AI and our portfolio close partnership where were constantly both drawing problem as well as building didn't post on the offer so a lot of our work much of our work in AI automation that we were talking about he's part of our Watson studio what's in machine learning what's an open skill if an open scale came out of research were interested AI and is now a centerpiece of of that our Watson let me give a very different example we have a very very strong portfolio and focus NLP natural language processing and and this directly goes into capabilities out of what's in the system which is a system for conversational support and customer support and what's in discovery which is about making enterprise understand and structure it a great example of that is the working project debate leader America which is a grand challenge in research about building a machine that ended the page now look we were looking to go sell you a debating machine but what did we build as part of doing that is your answers in NLP that are all making it into assistant and discovery and we actually just talked about earlier this year announced the set of capabilities around better trust advanced summarization people sentiment analysis these make their way into assistant and discovery put a ball out of research innovation in solving a problem like polling it that's just an example of all that that journey from research the product yeah I mean the debate or documentary I've seen some of that so it's actually quite astounding I don't know what you're doing there it sounds like you're taking natural language and turning it into you know complex queries with data science at AI but it's quite amazing yes and I would encourage you you will see that documentary by the way on on Channel in the think even and I would encourage you actually the documentary or know how the Baker happens sort of featuring back to the you know you know back door interviews with the scientists who created it was actually featured last minute that open hug an international document because I'll invite viewers to go to channel 7 and data and hey I kept on demand to go yeah you should take a look at it so it's actually quite astounding an amazing true what are you working on these days what's kind of exciting projects or you know what's your focus area today look I think there are three imperatives are who are really focused on and one is very you know it's really depression the talking about NLP NLP in the enterprise look text is a language of business right text is the way business is communicated within each other with their partners with the entire work so helping machines understand language but in an enterprise context recognizing that data and the enterprise's live in complex documents unstructured documents in email they live in conversations with the customers so really pushing the boundary on how all our customers and friends can make sense of this vast volume of unstructured data by pushing the advances of NLP that's one focus a second focus area we talked about trust and how important that is and we've done amazing work in monitoring in explain ability and we really focus now on this emerging area of causality using causality to explain right the model makes is because the model believes and the third big focus continues to be on automation so NLP trust automation those are like three big focus areas first term how far do you think we we can take AI I know it's a topic of conversation but you know from your perspective deep into the research how far can it go and maybe how far should it go well I think we are let me answer it this way I think the art of the possible is is enormous but I think we are at this inflection point in which I think the next wave of AI the AI that's going to help us just narrow to broad journey be if that matter the garage journey is not like one big point hood we're talking about a hip innovation but I think we are at a point where we were going to see a wave of AR that we like to call neuro symbolically which is AI that brings together two sort of fundamentally different approaches to building intelligence one approach building intelligent system is what we call knowledge driven understand data understand concept logically reasonable human beings do that that was really the way I was born the more recent last couple of decades away I will say patter machine learning give me vast volumes of data I'll use noodle techniques deep learning to get back we're at a point where we were winning both of them together if you can't build trust toward the explainable systems only using one you can't get away from not using all of the data that you have to make answer so noodle symbolic here is I think going to be the linchpin of how we advance AR and make it more powerful attraction so are you like living your childhood dream here and anytime you know you can't have find a technology person was in terms of building intelligence who's another job where I can work applause our worldwide sort of 2050 searches and I know think and brainstorm instead you do they are and then most importantly not to forget right that you talked about being able to move it into our portfolio so it actually makes a difference for our client I think it's a dream job well she remembers great having you in the cube a lot of fun interviewing you know folks like you I feel a little bit smarter just talking to you thanks to be here alright thank you for watching everybody watching the cubes cover it IBM think 2020 this is Dave Galante we'll be right back for the short break [Music]
