 Assalamualaikum and Greetings In the previous video, I talked about the six types of AI domain In this video, I want to delve into machine learning Machine learning is the ability of a machine to learn from data Normally in computer science, when we want to create a software or perform any tasks, we'll do programming We create a program and we put in the data From the data, we'll obtain the result In machine learning, it's the opposite, right? We have the data and we know the result How can we do programming? What does machine learning learn? It learns from the data to do programming or to look for rules If we look at us, we don't simply learn things When we learn, we want to get an ability This is similar to a computer It learns to get an ability There are two parts for this The result of learning is used to achieve an objective For instance, machine learning lots of things It detects objects understands languages, There are various objectives But the concept is, it learns from the data If we look at machine learning, it has four categories The first is called Unsupervised Learning Second is Supervised Learning Third is Semi-supervised Learning and the fourth is Reinforcement Learning Unsupervised learning has the data but it doesn't have the result for us to teach the AI It only has the data We want the AI to explore the data by itself Normally, it used for clustering How do we group the data? We have the data and we want to understand it Therefore, we'll insert it into unsupervised learning It'll learn and group the data This is what we called clustering Clustering is a famous word for those who are doing data science When we want to divide the data into several parts It will group the data It will look for the similarities For example in marketing, there's a term called persona analysis We have the data of our customers We know their ages their location and the items they purchase Based on that, we have grouped them according to the persona When we apply clustering, we will obtain the groups From there, we have to understand what a group would mean and we can make a marketing strategy This is very common and has existed before Unsupervised learning is also used in association Association is like what we've seen in marketing It is called basket analysis A person who usually buys eggs, will also buy milk This thing requires no training From the data, it will explore things on its own and teach us This is unsupervised learning The second category is supervised learning Supervised learning means we have big data as well as the result We have the label of data If we have lots of pictures We have the picture of a person's face, the picture of a cat, a dog or a fish When we have big data, we teach the AI From the label, the AI will learn the picture and its grouping Normally, supervised learning is used for regression or for prediction The time-series for stock prices or sales It will predict based on the previous data This is called regression Another popular thing is classification Classification is like what I've mentioned before For example, we want to classify vegetables or fish We want to detect whether a fruit is ripe or not If it's a word, it's either positive or negative This is what we called as classification It is popular now in big data Many things in computer vision are actually classification The third category is semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning is still developing We don't have many applications on this From the term, we understand that it's a combination of supervised and non-supervised learning When we use supervised learning We need to teach the AI step-by-step The cost is high If we look at company like Google, Microsoft They spend a lot of money to train the AI separately This is cost-consuming Semi-supervised learning means we partially teach the AI Sometimes AI can detect and we just teach them what it doesn't know We teach the AI partially and we reuse the hypothesis In the future, if I have time I'll explain about this For instance, transfer learning or active learning These areas combine supervised and unsupervised learning In simple words, we train small data but we want to apply it to big data We want to teach the machine to create a hypothesis and from the hypothesis, we make predictions It is interesting and still developing The fourth category is reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is a very interesting area It is widely used in robots Reinforcement learning is like unsupervised learning For example if we look at a foal Its mother doesn't teach it on how to stand For humans, we go through the process slowly A horse can stand in just a few hours Why? In its body, it has a mechanism that will let it to stand after it fell It tries to stand after falling When it repeats the process for several times it has a reward function Our brain has dopamine and adrenaline, right? Our brain will label things either a plus or a minus If we fails, then it would be a minus If we do things correctly, we'll get a plus AI will learn to maximize the ways to get the reward The positive Later on, it will learn how to stand In robotics we use reinforcement learning in balancing We can't program a condition for balancing, right A walking robot It's hard What should be done? It needs to make sure that the robot walks At first, the robot can't walk It'll fall When it falls, it'll get the minus point When the action is correct, it'll obtain the plus point So here, as an architect designer We need to design an environment in reinforcement learning The agent or the AI will monitor the environment It will obtain the state The current condition Based on the current condition, it needs to take an action It needs to make a decision For example, a robot would move forward or lift things up balance its body to the sides It must act When it takes an action, it will get a reward from the environment Does the action right? If not, it'll create a value When the same thing is repeated it'll know how to balance its body This is how powerful the reinforcement learning In the previous video, I've mentioned that deep learning is also machine learning, right? Why deep learning is not included in the four categories? Actually, deep learning can be all four because it is the ANN The Artificial Neural Network We can apply it to supervised, non-supervised and semi-supervised learning But the fundamental question is how does it different from machine learning? Normally, when we do machine learning and it's not deep learning We need to create features like in the supervised learning For example, I want to get a positive or negative sentence I need to reprocess the data I need to have the features For instance, nouns, verbs, right? If there's a "no" word I need to create the features Therefore, we create the process and features then we work for clustering or classification But deep learning is easy We put in the data We label the data as positive or negative We don't need to create features It'll learn on its own It is multi-layer and it'll learn It will find out the reason it becomes positive or negative It's an automation of the data scientist's work when we run deep learning The problem with deep learning is it requires big data Deep learning is possible with big data Logically, when we have big data we might make a mistake in creating features We make mistakes We missed it or we never thought about it Therefore, our model can't generate an accurate result But when we have enough big data, and we put it into deep learning We'll obtain impressive results Sometimes, we obtain the things that we don't even realize That's why many people are interested with deep learning However, there are many researches showing that deep learning is pointless Because deep learning learns It's not a model where we know why it obtain results It's like the black box This is the problem with deep learning Imagine, if we create a bank system for a loan application We put all the information Deep learning will inform us, "Your loan is approved" "Why is my loan approved?" "Why is it not?" If we use deep learning, it's hard to get the answer There are methods on how it analyses data by layers But we don't know the reasons It can't explain This is the problem of current deep learning Many researchers now seek to create an explainable AI, to find out why the AI generate results When I was a student, I learnt about knowledge management There are two types of knowledge In Japanese, it's called "Anmoku Chi" and "Keisiki Chi" "Anmoku" is tacit knowledge "Keisiki" is explicit knowledge "Anmoku" is the knowledge that we can't explain It's unclear We know it based on our five senses and experience But we can't explain and can't see it Explicit knowledge is the knowledge that we can clearly see on paper or in a system In knowledge management, it talks on how tacit knowledge changes to explicit knowledge and explicit to tacit knowledge The way deep learning learns is similar to us We don't know why we can stand But we can stand because we have the senses that serve as tacit knowledge In Japanese, it's called "Kankaku", using our senses, right? Deep learning is an algorithm that creates another algorithm We can't be so proud because we just put in the data and the AI will learn Data scientists are not that great The AI will learn by itself We have to understand that deep learning is an algorithm that finds another algorithm If I were to talk about deep learning, I can make a separate video for it This is it for this time I will share more information in the upcoming video Assalamualaikum and Greetings
