 greetings all and welcome to our discover cal on artificial intelligence my name is howard hebner and i'm the executive director of annual programs here at uc berkeley first a few housekeeping items if you'd like to ask a question of one of our speakers this evening please submit it using the queen q a feature it'll take a few questions i'll take a few questions following each speaker and as time allows after all their presentations the program tonight will run similar to a ted talk where we have given the faculty a short time to present their work the speakers will try to respond to as many questions as they are able as well we are really excited to be able to showcase some of the cal's amazing faculty to this evening tonight we'll discuss artificial intelligence or ai we'll cover everything from new technologies how ai can help the environment and the ethics of ai i don't know about you but my first introduction to ai was in my early teen years reading isaac asimov books as it was as it was one to do my imagination ran wild with the vision of what the future could hold and now as we are in this feature space it's exciting to learn what the term actually means today i'm incredibly excited to hear from tonight's speakers i want to take a moment to thank you for your amazing support at berkeley we're proud to offer this program to the members of the charter hill society and the wheeler society you are among cow's most loyal supporters and that means the world to campus think of your continued support to help berkeley light the way before we get started up our amazing faculty i'll give you a quick campus update as always there's a lot going on at campus and a lot to be proud of you thought may look a little different this year the biggest needs of the day is our virtual student experience this fall all of our classes are currently being held remotely and the campus is certainly quiet without the normal busyness of sprout plaza or packed lecture halls we're planning to have much of the spring semester as virtual as well but we are actually working with the city of berkeley to allow some small in-person classes students will not be required to be on the physical campus for their classes for the spring semester but we're working to figure that all out uh in more exciting news and positive news is today u.s news and world report ranked cal the number one public university the number four overall we're incredibly excited to hear this news and to be to have that ranking the fall semester is different than most and we expect to have our first but we do expect to have our first football game without any fans present on november 6th we're working with the pac-12 for similar schedules and plans for basketball and the olympic sports i have been asked to remind everyone that no fans also means that the campus parking lots and tight walk hill will be closed for game days if you're planning to watch the bears please plan to do so from the comfort of your own home earlier this month the campus had the great delight in celebrating not one but two new nobel prizes on campus professor emeritus of physics and astrophysics reinhardt ginzel was aware of the nobel prize in physics for his research in the discovery of a super massive compact object at the center of our galaxy the second was a nobel prize for in chemistry awarded to professor jennifer daudna the lee khan sheng chancellor's professor of biomedical science for the development of a method for genome editing that has led to the amazing crispr research jennifer was the 25th nobel that the campus has received and the first female faculty member to do so it's been really an exciting month and these great honors and with these great honors honors congratulations professors ganzel and dogno with that i'm very excited to get started on tonight's topic we have a fantastic variety of speakers who will speak briefly about many different aspects of artificial intelligence and give you just a brief tease of the amazing work berkeley is doing in this area it's now my pleasure to introduce your first speaker for the evening roojino baichi is the nec distinguished professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences she is also the founding director of the center for information technologies research in the interests of society otherwise known as citrus in 2001. she played a founding role in establishing a program of digital humanities dr baichi's current research is in the use of robotic technology namely measuring and extracting non-invasively kinematic and dynamic parameters of individuals in order to assess their physical movement capabilities and limitations that is just a mouthful to say and amazing to have hear her talk about these things professor baichi please uh share your your slides and and we're happy to have you here well good afternoon everybody as i mentioned before i have been in this ai business for 60 years so i have lived through all these variations of ups and downs and a artificial intelligence and initially i worked with john mccarthy who was my advisor and he was always dreaming about that we will eventually and try to understand what what intelligence is but i should say to you that we are far from that we don't understand too well the intelligence however little by little we are getting to to some aspects of the intelligent behavior so all my life what i have been trying to do is to understand the physical intelligence how people interact with the environment and can one build machines that would collaborate with people and help them that was my goal for last 60 years and that's what i'm going to show you a few nippits from my students who are actually doing the work so think about it you have here a motivational slide here that you see that people are carrying hairy objects and simple heavy manipulations that machines can help so this is an uh aranbastic who finished his phd in 2017 and he here examining how to collaborate with the robot now those of you who are more technically tuned to this this whole area of robotics understand that each of these joins have rotated in three dimensions so each translation x y z and rotation theta three alpha gives you six degrees of freedom now the same way in order to have a formal model you have to also be able to understand human capabilities of how they move with respect to the robot and therefore you have to be able to measure and here we have these markers where we can act at least you know how the individual joints in the limp and how the human is moving therefore collaborating so that's sort of the idea now in order to the previous slide from you and what we call is how you can control kinematics which is velocity and position so depending how you move and you should also remember that depending on the object whether you are picking class or you are doing a screwdriving the motion and the interaction will be different so therefore you have to have some more generalized ways of detecting velocity position now in order to understand the dynamics and those so we really need to understand the forces and indeed i have a student uh laurie hallock who has been for last four years studying muscles because the muscle in your body is actually that motor that engine that exerts force so we have been and of course they are focusing on non-invasive way of measuring that so here's a setup where we are using ultrasound measurements on trying to detect how much the muscle stretches or contracts i will show you some examples so here is the ultrasound picture that you can detect and this is but as you can see it's not a nice ellipsoid or a regular geometric structure but it's this funny structure of the muscle but indeed we can detect change in this shape of the green which has no force to a maximum force which is the red one okay so and then you know if you really want to look at it with respect to the the human arm so the muscles change depending on whether you have which angles and angles of the configuration is and therefore you can see these red segments of the muscle we can detect segment and measure how they change from no force to high force so now going to next slide is is caroline who caroline metal who has been working and trying to understand touring and how can you from detecting your velocity on your wrist or in robot to detect that how much so let's let's heal um uh i hope you protected this properly but the idea is that we want to measure how this interaction of this the the arm or the robotic arm or a human arm how does that can we measure the physical physical parameters so that then eventually we can control it and as you probably know from it from the from the [Music] news that people are talking about robots helping in the kitchen so if that's what you have to do what you want to do then you have to deal with operations such as pouring as it is shown here or in the middle was having like let's say material like liquid is very different in viscosity physical properties than for example flour or salt or sugar so you know they that and you have to understand how they physically behave so that you can build the robotic system to deal with that and help the human and similarly on the last window you have a dough and a dough is a very interesting material because it can be deformed but it depends on how much water you put into the flour that will you can control the elasticity and the plasticity of the dough and that's why you can make from a dough you can make a bread or you can make a pie pie chassis or so first and so on so that's what really is its problem all about and what you really want is to extract these parameters so that then you can put them into the computer and control the robotic arm and help the human okay so we because we are so interested in in contact sensing and tactile sensing of course vision is important and many of our colleagues have been working on visual information but my group has been focusing on tactile because we are interested in manipulation no your hands are very tactile sensitive so we build a camera here that's camera with one tactile sensor which has elastic surface so that will deform depending on the hardness of the object and we can measure through the camera the displacement and therefore derive what the hardness of the object is and how hard we should press or not press so i'm right back so so then we are the student is looking in stacked ups and can control even very curved surfaces that is very important um many other application so here i'm not sure whether whether i know how to make this play but okay all right so let me just go back now i want to show you uh want to show you um second okay here we are so i am also a dedicated do you see this or yeah professor we can't see it you can see to share that look good no we see your powerpoint professor we need you to share the screen that has your video oh okay sorry sorry yeah i appreciate it okay it's okay okay so i have to stop sharing and then go back to sharing yes yeah share the video okay okay okay i'm coming back yes all right technology technology okay all right what i wanted to share with you and this is less research than really application for teaching i have been very concerned ladies and gentlemen that that the course which i taught which was an introductory course to robotics i had about 180 students and they loved and of course we had labs every week they could go down to the lab and test you know and program these robots to move and grasp and push and fool and suffers and so on and now what can they do they can just stare at the the professor i'm not teaching anymore so if shankar she has to cover my course but anyway that's all so the only thing they have visual information so i have been very concerned that the kids today don't get the enough physical impression what it means hard surface soft deformation elasticity fluidity you know all these basic newtonian physics concepts so i set up with a colleague of mine the electronic engineer and we started to build and this is just a very stre beginning prototype we started to build a tactile display the idea is that you saw a student has developed this tactile sensor so we can measure you know how hard the surface is or how deformable the surface and all that but then we can send it just like we send visual information this information into this gizmo that you see and based on the amplitude of the data of the um the force sensor the individual packs will be moving just as they are moving here so this is sort of just the prototype this is not a new idea but i was really interested to develop something like this for students for 150 dollars so that we can then make it in the larger numbers and send it to them home so that they can learn how to feel the environment rather than just see so this is my and and and the device so i'm i'm really very committed to the well-being of our students because that's our future thank you yeah well thank you professor bachai you know we have we have time for one quick question and so uh the question that came in i thought was really interesting um is that um you know you've been of course you uh in the field for 60 years and yes and the question was do you think do you think innovation in this space is happening at a faster rate the same rate slower than earlier in your career like when you think about in your starting your career to now it feels like we've sped up have we said every subject of mine yes because i'm there so let me just tell you my prejudicial way of thinking about it we have we were dreaming ladies and gentlemen in the 60s when i was at stanford the ai lab we were dreaming about all these things okay but we didn't have the compute power we didn't have the memory they did not have we didn't have we didn't have internet in the late 60s okay and let me tell you folks when i took my first job in as an assistant professor at university of pennsylvania i built my own digital camera because there were no digital cameras available right okay yes so so frequently the ai software people don't give enough credit to our hardware colleagues who developed all this hardware technology that now facilitates that we can store all these gigabit data and do the big data stuff okay which of course we couldn't even dream about it right we can run robots in almost real time we can control 30 degrees of freedom which it was impossible to think about it so the hardware on every level has changed and with that came all these smart students and developed all these new programs and so forth now the fact is that i have to tell you that the speed right now the progression is much faster now because a the industry sees the value in those days we dream you know just like i am still today a dreamer okay all right we were dreaming and that's what academia should be we should be dreaming okay but the industry has picked up things that worked or don't work and and they run with it so yes that's fantastic professor i i thank you so much we only had time for one question but thank you so much for uh sharing some of the work and and just your perspective and the history you have with it is just uh it's just amazing so um just grateful to you spending some time with them i am lucky to have very good students and colleagues but really students at berkeley they are outstanding and i thank everybody who sends their kids to berkeley that's fantastic well thank you so much i uh appreciate it we'll um we might have some more questions for you uh because at least one more question in there that that maybe you want to try to address them actually sure my colleagues can probably help you do that if need be next we're going to move on uh into our next presenter and i'm excited to introduce jordan diamond and and jordan as the executive director center for law energy and the environment at berkeley law as well as a law school alumni herself jordan channels the expertise in creativity the berkeley law community into a pragmatic policy solutions uh to environmental and energy challenges in california and across the nation tonight she'll speak to us about um about ai and the environment jordan i'm going to turn it over to you thank you so much howard and i will do my best to start slides okay uh how does that look looks great you're it's we're all set fantastic uh well hi everyone i thank you so much for joining us tonight uh thanks for the invitation to be part of this panel and it's a pleasure to engage in the conversation uh and also professor bachai is humbling to follow you and the the path that you have carved in in this incredible area uh as howard mentioned i'm jordan diamond the executive director of the center for law energy and environment uh if you're not familiar with our center we are an in-house policy workshop within berkeley law we work on developing pragmatic real world policy solutions to the environmental and energy issues that threaten our future our collective future on this planet we are mostly but certainly not all lawyers uh but we specialize in working on cross-disciplinary teams that incorporate a wide range of perspectives in order to craft holistic solutions and we get to do this within the number one ranked environmental law program in the country on the campus that pioneers some of the leading research on the thorny issues that we work on so it is a privilege and often humbling to be affiliated with the university especially right now as for why an environmental lawyer is on this panel i will confirm that indeed i do not know the first thing about developing artificial intelligence um absolutely nothing but for the past several years i've been working with colleagues at yale university and the environmental law institute in dc on an initiative looking at the environmental and energy impacts of the digital economy including artificial intelligence my partners and i think about the direct and indirect impacts and the beneficial applications on energy in the environment our coal goals are to stimulate research and focus on the intersection with the environment so we've provided seed funding to researchers work to connect them across disciplines and generally are striving to develop this as a field of practice so that we can in fact maximize benefit and minimize harm a few examples of what we mean recognizing at the outset that people have often joked that non-engineers often call any piece of software artificial intelligence but let's start with our behavior and activities on the road so we rewind a few years to the vw diesel emissions scandal i had a so-called queen diesel jetta sport wagon now if you recall it turns out the diesel was not so clean rather it had a cheat device installed that helped detect when the car was in testing mode at which point it would turn on various mechanisms to reduce emissions below mandated levels but when not in testing mode the control shut off and emissions would reach up to 40 times allowable levels of nitrous oxide and other pollutants this was simply an intentional bad act but i mentioned it because now contrast that with the reverse imagine a car that analyzes circumstances conditions and driver preferences and then adjust adjust operations to actually achieve better environmental impacts imagine if the car were continually making decisions so to speak about what settings to use in what circumstances to maximize energy savings fuel savings safety or whatever whatever other factors you prioritize and you can take the next steps to think about self-driving cars and the thousands of decisions being made about routes speed safety etc or you can think about ride handling apps and right now the directions that they give to drivers and the shared ride choices being made what if all of these systems actively considered emissions and their overall environmental footprint in their decision making so what if we weren't just hoping that ride hailing would someday lead to a reduction in vehicle miles traveled which it has not so far but rather we programmed emission reductions into the underlying architecture as an explicit goal uh or we can look inside the home our devices and appliances are increasingly connected and some of this is sheer convenience it's convenient to be able to turn off the thermostat from down the road when you forgot to turn it on before you left the house but while they make us feel smarter that device isn't actually fundamentally operating any differently but then take that next step looking at some of the thermostats today such as nests that look at behavior patterns and adjust accordingly what if your home appliances and systems were working in concert with one another to actually maximize sustainability at any given time making the decision about whether it's better to say run your dryer or turn on the air conditioning at a certain level based on factors such as demand response on the grid or balancing whether it's sunny out and the grid is likely to be heavily kind of empowered by solar at that time or when you run the dishwasher or water the garden depending on forecasted rainfall et cetera and then you can look online um which since the pandemic started is of course the only place we've been going we've been we've seen significant upticks in online shopping and for anyone who bought anything on amazon prime day recently prime day sales rose roughly 45 and year over year and almost 150 percent i'm going back two years now anyone who has ever purchased anything online um is familiar with the suggestions and the you might also like items that will then pop up the next time you're online but what if those algorithms were programmed to incorporate sustainability goals to interpret shopping behavior and supply trends and even shipping routes and determine what more environmentally friendly purchases or actions you might be open to further um do you need that toddler halloween costume i say with two toddlers in my house who are very worried about their halloween costumes do you want to get it on tuesday or can you wait until wednesday if that means you can actually get more sustainable or recyclables and packaging um or is there a shipping route that avoids sensitive marine areas i mean the idea is is there a way that you can actually and then an ai system could actually know your preferences and scour relevant information to help you make more sustainable decisions in addition in addition to learning the footprint of your purchases could an ai system help you make better online selection generally measuring items you're less likely to return thereby reducing the enormous increase we've seen in the return of items many of which unfortunately go straight to the landfill so there are countless other examples that we could give of both direct and indirect impacts um but there's also the other side and i won't go into much detail because i believe some of my esteemed colleagues um we'll go into this later in the session but suffice to say that algorithms can embed and extrapolate biases and most of us don't know enough to detect them and then there's a fact that machines make mistakes uh how confident are we that we don't need a person or a human referee involved to check the outcomes environmental and energy decision making often carries very significant consequences to use a timely example aia is often cited as a possible solution to better helping manage the electricity grid to reduce power outages and catastrophic wildfires so think of the liability associated with a wrong decision where does responsibility lie when we've programmed a machine to teach itself i'd also like to note the asymmetrical development of our access to ai in the private versus public sectors a 2016 gao report noted that 75 of federal agency i.t budgets are devoted to operations and maintenance of existing system leaving 25 percent for development modernization and enhancement and on top of that there are can be public institutional barriers to innovation boast based on little reward but high risk if something goes awry all of which suggests that the majority of ai innovation and deployment is occurring in the private non-public sector which can leave regulation in the role of planning and catch-up so all of these factors can make governance challenges significant policy makers regardless of their technical expertise must determine how to regulate and deploy these systems and or how to consider them in legal settings and proceedings and in a legal system based on the concept of mens rea or the knowledge of your act of wrongdoing where does an ai system fit in so how do we at the end of the day maximize benefit uh okay i said screen sharing shop stopped apologies well i will continue um but at the end of the day how do we maximize the environmental benefit and minimize the environmental harm and this is the point where my law and policy nerd flag flies true and strong and i get to admit that i get very excited about discussing process so without going into too many details i simply note that what i enjoy thinking about is first in order to be able to address this we need to be aware of the potential impacts we need to be aware of the potential harms of the potential non-obvious benefits in order to be able to take action and that requires communication and communication between non-obvious actors communication at the development of the new systems and throughout deployment to make sure that we are identifying potential unintended consequences as well as potential beneficial applications um and this is true for both technologies that are intentionally focused on the environment as well as technologies that aren't and i would say the latter are often more challenging because that's not an automatic part of the system and this all calls for adaptive management so we need systems so that we can monitor detect and then adjust when we encounter unintended consequences and this is both in terms of in the mechanics and the machine itself so we can adapt things and so so we can adapt and also on the human side so there's a process for that monitoring flagging of issues and then a determining of appropriate response um none of what i've just described is simple none of it um but there are many dedicated and incredibly talented people that are making inroads that are building governance mechanisms developing protocols centralizing contacts in order to make progress and that's what keeps me talking to incredibly smart people who are entirely out of my league and actually creating artificial intelligence trying to figure out how i as an environmental lawyer can help ensure that we do as much for the environment as possible so with that i'll thank you again for the chance to talk with all of you tonight and share a bit of what i've been thinking about thank you jordan that is uh it's really an interest another interesting perspective on the subject you know i know the question that occurred to me while while i was listening to you it's really thinking about you know i mean amazon's the easy one but even the rideshare apps and and the gig economy right like so all of those all those platforms are using forms of artificial intelligence now basically to determine to predict how we're going to behave as consumers so is it really just is it in part i guess to very says the question what are the barriers to them to actually redirecting some of that already kind of um you know uh structured you know intelligence gatherings they're using like what's the barrier for them to to not make the delivery process smarter right like what what is it that's preventing them from doing those types of things um so without um well they getting in shoes or 72 cents um these are meant to optimize um they're supposed to reduce your ride length and reduce overall cost while maximizing profit for the company right um so there are some some very clear kind of incentives associated with this um in terms of the steps i think this is one of the things that for me is a great example of why you want to have the conversation at the outset rather than trying to go back and revise the system um afterward because now going back and actually changing the system um is a lot more is a lot more difficult um than if you had actually built in some of these parameters from the beginning and so we see this that's kind of a common tenet of commenting or you know and influencing decision making period it's much easier to be part of the team developing the system than asking them to go back and change it that's fascinating well i wanna there's a question here from one of our uh one of our participants i wanna make sure i try to present it correctly so when thinking about you know and this might be a little bit um i know because your environmental law this might be a little askew as far as you know thinking about um any recommendations or thoughts about how do you balance you know the concern with any of the things you're talking about right the concerns of privacy versus the optimization opportunities of ai right like that balancing act and any thoughts on that or you know how do we how do we as consumers you know either um protect ourselves or also push to um get change made to actually using the data in the best way possible absolutely um so i have a few thoughts and a few comments um with absolutely no solutions uh so i will say i think that's spot on i think that's a critical issue um one i will flag just how much information is already being used um and so without going further than we have already gone um i think that there are questions about what more we could already be doing or how we could deploy that information in in other ways um second i think there's some interesting potential and developments to be made in terms of how information is in fact stored or access to that information um and and i've worked with some researchers without going into the details of what they've been doing but how do you create a collaborative and shareable kind of vault of information but that you still kind of own your information um which is incredible and far beyond my technological capacity um i will also flag the work of some of my colleagues within berkeley law um and specifically the berkeley center for law and technology who has some leading privacy experts and they also have some broad initiatives on artificial intelligence and it's just a really flag um their work because they have some great people thinking specifically about this these intersections um so i think that's an incredibly important question and then the last thing i'll highlight is just the flip side of this information that it about you that is available to others there's a huge question of how do you gain access it to it uh and so for example um and this isn't a ai but your energy usage in your home it is very difficult to get information about your own energy usage other than how much you used each month but if you did have better information about that how would you change your lifestyle your habits etc um so this question of access to information who has a right to it and who has a right to keep it private um i absolutely think i appreciate the question um and think there's a lot of work to be done there yeah it's super interesting i yeah i really appreciate i really appreciate i'm so excited that you're part of this there's such a kind of a different take on on the subject that is um very there's very pragmatic questions they're involved in what you're working on so um thank you so much it was such an interesting talk think that you're part of this there are some questions building up in the q a that may be appropriate for you to try to address if you want to um so hopefully you'll stick around and help us out with that a little bit so thank you so much thank you thank you of course all right oh okay uh all right so our third speaker this evening is joseph gonzalez an assistant professor in electrical engineering and computer sciences professor gonzalez is a founding member of the uc berkeley rise lab which is real time intelligent security and secure execution is uh research interest okay um yeah you're getting a little background can you can you meet for a second yep i apologize it's okay we go okay let now give you the appropriate introduction so his research interest from the intersection of machine learning and data systems and his students are working on a wide range of projects including real-time model serving machine learning life cycle management model based cloud resource management software platforms for autonomous vehicle research um professor gonzalez i'm super excited to have you please and and thank you thank you um let me know if the audio does have some issues i'm hoping it'll be good um yeah so i'm probably the more junior the people here i'm still an assistant professor i do research at the intersection of machine learning and systems as i said one of the co-directors of the ryze lab i thought i'd start by saying what is machine learning it seems like a meaningful question to answer if we're going to talk about it um so machine learning is often uh awesome so sorry to interrupt there's some background noise um i don't know if it's a video playing there it's better now um it sounded like uh maybe uh traffic on the freeway or something yeah let me do something uh that's okay um can you hear me now a little bit better yes that's better thank you i apologize thank you we have so one of the things we had to do to upgrade our teaching is have new audio equipment and still getting it right um anyway so machine learning uh what is it well it's often called artificial intelligence but it's really the ability of software systems to adapt or improve to experience your data um and so we've already touched this a little bit there's been an explosive growth in machine learning uh and what do i mean by that it's the new moore's law so this is actually a plot of publications in machine learning the papers we're supposed to be reading uh is actually outpacing our growth of the semiconductor field so this is an exponential growth in publications a lot of excitement in the field and a fair question one might ask is why so i've been in the field for a while and i'd like to claim that the advanced algorithms and so you've probably heard of stochastic sun if you work in machine learning or you know adjacent to it this is an algorithm from the 1950s so that is not it what else there's a lot of excitement around neural nets deep learning or advancing our ability to fit to new tasks advancing our modeling capacity when did those come about when where is this picture from it's from the 1990s so the core ideas that are advancing machine learning aren't actually from maybe the core areas of machine learning they're from other areas and regina alluded to this earlier one of the big things we're seeing is growth in data so exponential growth and access to data tools for processing data the cloud has made it easier to process data at scale and to collect data sets like like imagenet this is on water okay all right very good uh compute so that's the next thing so we've seen a big growth in the amount of compute that we have access to so the hardware people have made multi-core processors many core processors gpu accessible to researchers the the research started on gaming rigs and now we have huge clouds of gpus that are powering the research that we're doing and enabling a lot of these advances in ai and then finally abstractions and this is something that often gets overlooked but the software tools that the power ai that allow us to express these models um are getting easier to use it's used to when i was a graduate student you had to derive variational bounds work through complex mathematics the things we teach in these classes but today you can use basic python code and people with very limited backgrounds in machine learning or in statistics even in computing can build models to solve really intense new problems so there's a lot going on there is still advances in the algorithms and the the models but there's these these confluence of major trends of data compute and abstractions that have power there enable this this explosion in machine learning so uh that was now or that was the past into now so what's the future um and so i'm one of the co-directors of the ryze lab and so the horizon we're trying to think about where where is the future machine learning systems headed this intersectional study and so we've been looking at the design of real-time intelligent secure and explainable algorithms and systems this touches on some of the things you've already already heard about so problems like supporting uh fraud detection things robotic surgery high frequency trading or financial markets autonomous driving which i'll talk about in a moment where iot devices that collect and then operate in our houses collected and operate in our houses so when i say real time i mean being able to respond in milliseconds using sophisticated models and algorithms when i say secure we need to be able to protect not just the the data but also the models and our interaction with end users and then another thing that's kind of emerging as we apply ai everywhere is can we understand the decisions that we're making can we provide explanations for what what the ai decided to do why did it choose to run through that intersection um so these are the dimensions that we're starting to explore when we think about the intersection of aion systems one of the things i think is really unique about work in berkeley is that we're doing this by bringing people together in backgrounds and ai security hardware and systems so really large collaborative efforts and you'll see when we compare to other universities that most of the publications here bring people multiple faculty from multiple different areas in fact even collaborations with the law school for example to to address these kinds of problems so really collaborative work um and so even within the computer science department we have really tight collaborations with the big berkeley eye research group which i'm also part of and berkeley deep drive right so that's kind of a high-level picture of what we're doing in the rise lab um and why we're seeing these explosions in ai and where i think we're headed i wanted to just show a few vignettes of some of the cool things that we're doing uh to kind of give you an idea where this work is going um so i alluded to real time being able to interact and build cyber physical systems that can can be powered by i probably the most obvious one is you know systems for autonomous driving um we have real vehicles but i'll show you what we're doing in simulation first because it's the safest place to do it i'm starting to understand how differences and algorithms and interactions between time accuracy and models can lead to safer driving the model on the right is running over a pedestrian the model left is not the model left is actually less accurate but faster so understanding these trade-offs to be able to optimize for those allows us to build better safer systems with that in mind we do actually put uh people inside these vehicles as you go here so this is actually our postdocs driving the car actually well their ai is driving the car um with one of these real-time systems um i won't finish the video because i don't want to show how it ends uh so so that that is our work on autonomous driving building real-time systems we also think about how to make the systems more intelligent we look at ai today we often think the same way with all inputs your neural net that you know classifies images is going to look do the same amount of work when it sees you know a blank screen as when it sees a really complex scene so we want to be able to distinguish between hard and easy problems to apply resources and computation where they're most needed um and so this is kind of building on this this uh nobel prize-winning work on think fast and think slow uh how humans approach the world can we bring that to ai i'll play a quick game which may or may not work over zoom so i'm going to show you a picture was that a cat or a dog if you saw a picture and probably if zoom worked you saw a dog let's do another one is that a cat or a dog uh so hopefully this one was a little bit harder um so this is actually it's not clear what this is um i believe it is formerly a cat uh so you had to think harder about the scene we'd like to capture that in our ai technologies and we've been developing cascades or approaches of differentiating between hard and easy images that allow us to compute or spend less compute cycles on things that are easy and more compute cycles and the things that need it and we can take those ideas and build them across networks within networks a lot of cool research and i won't go into the details on those security is something that's often overlooked and that's a big part of the rise lab is how do we make these systems more secure and actually one of the cool things that we've been looking at is how to enable collaboration so one of the crazy ideas is that with better security we can actually unlock more data we can solve bigger problems so more secure actually means better ai and one of the things we've been exploring is algorithms that allow us to bring parties together in a way where they don't have to share their data or they can't see the intermediate computation but they can derive models and solve problems um without having to you know know what the other party is doing and this shows up in fraud detection or multiple banks might want to tell if other banks have people high risk or they're frauding across constructing fraudulent transactions across banks um and so we'd like to be able to identify those people without sharing the banking information across the pink boundaries all right and the last thread that we're exploring is how to make our systems more explainable um and so there are a lot of variations on this i'm going to touch on just one we're also looking at explainability and data provenance and data lineage but i'm going to talk about the kind of ai side of that and so if i presented this image to a neural net and the neuron that goes well that's clearly a dog uh that's probably not the explanation you know that it's not a very complete prediction you might like that looks kind of like a dog but it's your body doesn't look quite right maybe it's also a bird when we design our neural net technology it doesn't really think through the or it's not designed to express its thinking process and so we've been looking at ways to combine advances in artificial intelligence from the present the neural networks with some of the more classic ideas and things like decision trees to build out more elaborate decision processes so that we can start to reason about what's going on our scene by giving a sequence of decisions that led to our conclusion um this is important we start to think about how you might audit a model or or say look i disagree with one of your decisions but otherwise you know i'd like to know what happened if you hadn't um made this conclusion about a person when let's say denying a loan um so having these kinds of processes are critical to enabling advances in the ai to be applied to to real world problems all right so that was kind of a whirlwind tour some of the cool projects that we're doing i want to step back and just sort of talk about the impact of these research groups uh so the ryze lab and the amp lab before have been building not just writing really cool papers but building real software um with impact in industry and this in fact multiple multi-billion dollar companies have been launched from these projects i mean some of these software artifacts power the the back end of amazon apple the technologies we use every day are coming out of research projects in these these big labs so that is the story of the rise lab i want to allude to one more thing there's a really uh cool new division of computing that is science and society that's trying to bring a lot of these ideas that we've already heard about today where in fact are you starting to think about how to make ai systems address problems in sustainability this is also bringing new educational models together to allow us to teach data science computer science machine learning to a much broader group of people so that that is that is it thank you great well joseph first of all thank you uh really interesting work and also uh you're the presenter with the images that most likely to give me nightmares tonight because that dog bird thing was uh strange uh but i do want to um i did have a question that um i wanted to that one of our participants um asked i thought it was interesting to get your thoughts on um so here's here's a go here we go so our society seems to have shrinking attention spans it seems clear that knowledge and understanding of ai or machine learning is going to be essential in the years and decades ahead are you concerned that over time people become more and more dependent on their devices and machines will be more intelligent than the general population i i think i call this the matrix question um is that is that a you know is that future state where we are so dependent on ai to do some of these thinking pieces for us that we are you know we're no longer as functional and used to be it's a great question i like to think of machine learning not as something to replace us but to make us more capable ai is it's an enabling technology i can't compute square roots um i in fact i can't do basic arithmetic most of the time i rely on computing i think ai will find its its way to solve some of our problems and allow us to embrace new challenges to to be more creative to take on things that we couldn't have done before um yes there are some dangers i think that the more insidious dangers that are immediately facing as is ai is allowing us to strengthen our opinions um enforce our own biases and understanding how that works and how to prevent it is a critical challenge that we face uh but my hope my optimism is that ai will now allow us to be better uh to do more you know i um i want to we have to with the move to our next next uh speaker but i i think that when i think about this i think about things like how youtube is using algorithms to four-speed you know the same uh reinforcing messages and things like that and i think it's such an interesting your work is so interesting because the possibility is amazing and also a little scary you know i hope that you'll um there's there's a bunch of questions in the q a it'd be great if you could kind of pop through and answer some of those and and thank you so much really fascinating work and grateful to have you participate tonight thank you of course okay our final speaker this evening is is dave rocklin dave is a continuing lecturer and the executive director of the haas innovation creativity and design practice as well as the faculty director innovation for positive impact program as well as a cow alum he is a consultant social entrepreneur focused on market-based approaches to social environmental issues including deforestation climate change corporate social responsibility sustainability business and ethical globalization and will be speaking to us about the ethics of um ai so dave the the floor is yours here well thank you howard thanks for having me i really enjoyed the panel so far um and joseph all the cool kids work at the ryze lab i know so i enjoyed hearing uh what you guys are up to so um as howard mentioned i'm dave rocklin i teach at the intersection of innovation and responsible business at haas my institute also runs what we call the inclusive ai initiative actually which is uh uh through our center for business analytics and as i mentioned i'm gonna speak tonight about ai ethics also known uh these days as responsible ai and i'm sorry we can't be live i'm pretty sure wherever you are the parking is better than around campus so that we have that going for us um so i start most of my responsible business courses and as you can tell i'm not gonna have any slides tonight i start with most of my responsible business courses with an overview of ethics and uh the reason is because i have to emphasize that ethics is often not clear-cut black and white right as much as we want it to be there's tons of culture issues i'm sure many are familiar with this including you know the value of business transparency the role of authority the idea of caveat emptor um even attributes such as age and education are treated ethically differently by culture they're definitely not universally weighted but even so um they're actually uh even more important that they're actually different philosophical underpinnings to ethics for example there's virtue based ethics which is stressed as absolute such as thou shalt not steal under any circumstances right there's there's also duty-based the intelligent logical ethics which is that you judge on intent rather than consequences and of course the golden rule basically says doing others as you would have them do unto you this one in particular is actually quite rare among tech leaders interestingly enough there's been some great examples that i'm sure many of you heard for example steve jobs would let his kids near an ipad um google when they launched google glass their virtual reality classes a few years ago would not let attendees into shareholder meetings with that item and bill gates has famously said he keeps his kids off of video games and smartphones because they're addictive and most of those folks who use data most intensely in business demand the most privacy because they know the potential there and as a starting point i have to say i mean look unleashing technologies that you protect yourself from it's pretty questionable i think we can always agree on that but the the the last uh sort of the philosophical school that i really wanted to highlight uh last is the utilitarian view which is focused on taking action for the greater good right the m's justify the means tech firms in particular often run on these utilitarian principles right the term we're changing the world is pretty common um but of course what's used uh you know what defines is a greater good it's a judgment call and uh certainly in in teaching business ethics you see more often than not that it's used to justify poor behavior and outcomes so that's my first point i want to make ethics is not absolute right and since it's not absolute letting technology firms arbitrate with what's ethical is kind of scary their track record just doesn't look great in this book winners take all which some of you may have read a non-gerdardist described tech leaders as rebel kings and worrisome berets and you know basically through disruption they've essentially replaced our democratic mechanisms for responsible business with their own privatized version of ethics and so um that's that you know they have quite a lot of power in determining ai ethics through their actions and of course what joseph's lab is working on and machine learning algorithms algorithms in particular are still pretty opaque forms of decision making right so this is a big reason why there's concern uh for um in ai because uh ai's primary role the primary role of artificial intelligence in business is optimization optimization as i think as we saw tonight there's a lot of really great stuff right so um everything from making uh the photo color balanced as possible and use photoshop the adobe apps ai doing that for you um distributing going to water apply chemicals on a farm uh microsoft has software for that called farmbeat you get the idea right and of course where to send you on uh send you next our website either to keep media you know keep the media users more engaged or to sell more stuff those are all optimization functions i love jordan's optimism earlier about where this could lead but optimization in particular is right with issues and i'm going to touch on them quickly before we finish tonight the first i i actually call these the abcs so the a in the abcs is for addiction right when we use algorithms machine learning to optimize we can easily basically enable addiction by design social media is the most obvious example i think most of us are aware of that ai-based tools for optimizing engagement and stickiness are really fancy terms for just creating addiction which of course has led to a growing divide and depression that's pretty well documented now you're starting to see this also emerge in other areas which is a little bit scary shopping gambling restaurants video gaming right i think in the future as as these tools become more accessible a lot of companies are going to want to optimize behavior using ai and machine learning and inadvertently or intentionally for some they're going to be creating addictive behavior behavior if you want to learn more about this i really recommend the social dilemma on netflix it's a really great documentary that highlights it the b of the abcs is bias right so whether through trained algorithms or machine learning and the pursuit of optimized decision and profit seeking um has the potential for massive bias it just is an easy example for us to think about if we replaced our admissions teams at berkeley with a machine learning driven system you would immediately biased against first generation college students and pell grant recipients because they have historically low graduation rates and so the success rates would be flagged by the machine and they would probably be ranked lower you see this more practically now in terms of like redlining for example with borrowing and insurance and there actually is an algorithmic risk scoring system in place for making bail decisions in courts and it's actually proven that there's a lot of racial and gender bias that gets built in when you try to optimize that way and the counter argument is that judges are equally biased but the risk of machine learning use in this way is that it makes the decision engine much more opaque so the last of the abcs is the c which is for the commons which is from the tragedy of the comments for those who don't know the tragedy the commons is a an economic dilemma that um basically states that everybody in in in many cases everyone acting in their own self-interest can end up creating a worse scenario for everyone in game theory they call it the prisoner's dilemma infill optimization is sub-optimal versus cooperation so in any period of voluntary rashing or the need for shared decision making like jordan highlighted an optimization algorithm that's designed around an individual user is going to take advantage to the detriment of the whole now this may sound a little bit sort of you know science fiction future but google if you think about it already sends commute traffic into neighborhoods with schools um to give advantage to drivers in their commutes see it all over the place right so that in that case you're placing the advantage of the individual driver by optimizing their route over the van over the interest of the community and having safe schools and safe roads near them uber is another example of a firm that's doing this extensively so anyway so yeah i'm going to wrap papers so the industries aware these issues they're working more against the bugs in the system rather than rather to handle features like optimization and you know the reason why is is because it's much harder to confront the inherent conflicts of interest in free market capitalism right optimizing isn't always isn't what's best for all of us but it does make good business so that's pretty much what i wanted to share this is a huge rich topic but um i will send it back to howard dave i you know i think what a great finish to all these really interesting talks around this subject and you know another uh bit of media to around this i don't know if you've listened to the um the rabbit hole the new york times podcast that they did it was uh it's kind of similar to the social dilemma it goes um it goes pretty deep particularly around the youtube algorithm that and that was created and kind of how that the unintended consequences of the kind of reinforcing you know feed um so um i do i have a question here from uh from someone that that seems like it um maybe up your alley so many industries are leveraging ai to reduce head count by streamlining operations and delegating communications is there you know is there anyone at this point anyone in government academia private evaluating the impacts and ethics of ai on workers like that kind of automation um work is that something that's people are out there thinking about yeah i mean they're thinking a lot about it i mean there's two forms you know you're getting it from the top and the bottom right so a lot of you know robotics and factory automation for example there's big concerns uh over that um sort of reducing the entry level ramp jobs uh that you know bring people in the middle class but also um at the higher level there's a concern that sort of routine functions there's there's the mckinsey did a study showing uh how many jobs could be turned over to ai in the next 20 years which is quite um like quite a wake-up call but you know i think um you know the counter i'm not sure i agree with that but the counter argument is that um you know what we're doing is when we create efficiency we're creating more productivity and therefore more jobs and so um there's going to be some shifting as there always is but the idea is that there is going to be more uh different jobs available as those jobs disappear again i'm not so sure that particularly the lower wage jobs are the ones that are going to be difficult to replace and so the more you use ai and automation to relieve that burden the more that you're putting pressure on you know you're basically preventing those on-ramps into you know a good middle-class life it's such a fascinating topic and i could pontificate for a long time about you know going molly back to the movie gung-ho and you know about how people work more efficiently and do things differently in that fear of automation that fear of being kind of classed out i think was interesting this year in the presidential election you know andrew yang and the democratic primaries is really about that basic income because of that exact question you know that you're talking about um any um any parting thoughts for us before we wrap up this evening oh sorry about that [Applause] um no that's i'd be happy to talk about it more i know we're about a time here but um you know i think you know i you know it's difficult because uh going on the ethics side you tend to you know drift a little bit towards what's not working but um you know i there's a lot of exciting things like what you you know in terms of job you know in terms of jobs and efficiency and all that i mean you know if you're in a job where you have better data and better decision making it's not necessarily a bad thing so um you know i think getting rid of a lot of the efficiencies of things that don't work well isn't bad but you have to um really be careful um of the both intended and unintended consequences my colleagues who actually are you know more technical than i say you know machines don't think they just do what humans tell them to do right so you have to be careful about what you ask for um my final that would be like elon musk has said this is super extreme but you know his he's way off on the um sort of on the on the bell curve in terms of thoughts about the dangers of ai and he said what if you had a sufficiently strong system and you told it to eliminate spam you know maybe that maybe that ai would decide to eliminate you know to kill all humans [Laughter] so i i don't think that's going to happen but you know you have to be careful what you asked for because whatever you're optimizing is going to it's going to be much more opaque and much more efficient than it's been yeah well thank you dave i uh really appreciate a really uh interesting perspective on ai and um so glad that you're able to join us this evening um i uh i want to thank all of our speakers once again uh i just feel personally so grateful for the for them to spend some time with us this evening uh take some time on their evening to um you know share uh share their experience in the subject and to help us all kind of think about this more deeply you know uh the the the the hard part about this is that we don't being in the virtual spaces we don't get to to all congregate afterwards and and pick the brains of our faculty but um hopefully they'll stick around for a couple more minutes and answer some questions in the q a um i know that that the other faculty have done that for us this evening dave i'm hoping you can take a second to do that as well um i hope you will all join me with a virtual round of applause for our speakers tonight um they um did just a fantastic job for us and i'm so grateful for that tonight we tried to cover just the small piece of work that our brilliant faculty are doing in the areas of artificial intelligence um you know it's it's it's really just we've only scraped the tip of it um and so i want to once again once again i want to thank all of you um who are on the line tonight and uh incredibly grateful for your generous support of uc berkeley it's because of you we're able to have um great talks like this and we have the successes we have it's because of your ongoing support if you are looking for more content we just wrapped up our first ever virtu ever virtual homecoming this weekend much of that content will be available online um at homecoming.berkeley.edu those those videos are being posted as we speak we will keep adding those over the next week or so and also next week's next month's installment of our virtual discovery cal series will be on november 16th where our theme will be big uh and we'll be discussing some of the big things happening at berkeley like what's happening in big data what are the big ideas and big entrepreneurship um thank you again for your support of generous donors and participating in our our talk tonight once again uh hear it for our great faculty and i hope you all have a great evening and go bears nice job [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] go bears you
