 hi this is dr. Bertalan Mesko the medical futurist and in today's video I want to tackle the most important topic when it comes to the future of Medicine artificial intelligence I guarantee you that after the next ten or so minutes you will have a clear picture of what AI is how it works that it stands today what it's going to be and what it all means for the world of Medicine so buckle up but I asked people what word first comes to mind when I mentioned artificial intelligence they usually say things like death fear or the Terminator for a long time we have thought of artificial intelligence as an abstract idea that belongs to the future and it will lead to something terrible like a war against killer robots basically in the past our idea of the a revolution was something like this but for the same reasons why every single Terminator movie since the original - bombed and melted at the box office we are slowly realizing that AI is a very different beast altogether it's an nuanced subject and if you penetrate every layer our lives almost invisibly today we are less afraid of robots taking our lives and more afraid of them taking our jobs and even though we have not yet reached the state of real AI it has already sneaked into our lives without us even noticing I'm sure you used forms of AI even today for more than an hour if you use Google today the information you found was fine-tuned to your needs and habits based on your previous searches and website visits if you used Facebook or Instagram the ads you've got were chosen based on what you said in front of your smartphone if you used ways or Google Maps your route has been chosen not just to get you to your destination faster but to optimize the entire traffic in your area there is no person sitting behind a computer during all these these things are done by algorithms that continuously learn from us and about us to gradually get better and better moreover from Spotify Netflix and Amazon two devices from Apple inter I am a huge amount of technologies or if used VDI these are all examples of AI in action today these technologies were implemented without any great announcement of fireworks and in most cases I expect that to be the case in the future as well but as you can tell these algorithms are very different from the killer robots or from the future Elon Musk is afraid of but they are still very much AI at work this is why I like to use the broadest possible definition when it comes to a I simply put any machine that shows any intelligence is artificial intelligence and the actual difference between today's AI and the terminator can be found in the levels of AI rather than its definition Nick Bostrom the author of the fantastic book super intelligence has separated three different levels of artificial intelligence first what we have today is a and I or artificial narrow intelligence it refers to computers or algorithms ability to perform a single test extremely well it can play go or just like nobody around the world yet its IQ is zero in medicine a and I can be extremely precious when it comes to recognizing patterns in huge data sets such as radiology images or patient data second what you're working towards is a GI or artificial general intelligence it refers to a machines ability to understand and learn any intellectual task that a single human being can it's basically a machine matching a human beings cognitive capacity an example for AGI is probably Hall 9000 from 2001 a Space Odyssey but it can navigate a spaceship play chess or have human conversations with the crew on board and third what we should be really afraid of is a s AI or artificial superintelligence that as its name implies refers to machine understanding and learning the knowledge of the entire human race plus possibly surpassing its cognitive capacity frankly our goal should be to stop right before we reach AGI to enjoy the benefits of what AI can bring to our lives but not reach a stage from where we don't understand what's going on around us in movies you have plenty of examples for any of these levels from the Terminator to The Matrix but it's not all doom and gloom in real life and in medicine in particular if you can create machines that do certain tasks precisely if you truly be able to do miracles while radiologists can look at over 50 images a day a good algorithm can be trained on millions in hours it can go through more data in the morning than a physician can in their entire life now let's take a deeper look at how these things actually work them probably everyone heard in passing about the two most famous methods of how a AI algorithms advance which are machine learning and deep learning machine learning is the method where an algorithm learns from data identify patterns and make decisions in minimal or zero human intervention it's a narrow and precise way of learning to perform a specific task if you want an algorithm to learn to spot cats on pictures we have to n notate millions of pictures with cats on them and let the algorithm find its own rules for spotting cats the more data we fitted with the better it will become at doing the task but I have to say there is one human element in machine learning that needs to be spoken of leaving medical data archives to machines sounds perfect in theory but practice is much much more complicated as medical data archives were obviously not created with mathematical algorithms in mind it is a gargantuan were to try to standardize existing sampling processes or to have enough algorithm adjusted samples that's why data annotators are the unsung heroes of the AI revolution they take CT or MRI scans and draw lines around tumors or pinpoints cells or designate ECG strips it's a hard and monotonous task but it needs to be done for machines to utilize that data simply data analyzers are the eyes of machine learning however there are really complicated tests which are hard to define think about spotting the tumor on a CT scan radiologists analyze the images take the patient's medical records into consideration and have to keep so many things in mind before making a diagnosis for such tasks we have to turn to deep learning it's a vastly more advanced method a deep learning algorithm can study raw mr images or perhaps it doesn't even need images only the raw data coming straight out of the machine to analyze it while machine learning algorithms are blind without human help deep learning algorithms only need annotated data until they learn to see and then they can handle unlabeled and unstructured data without human intervention these work based on neural networks that try to mimic how our brain processes information and make decisions now what does it all mean for the future of Medicine in only a few years AI will start to revolutionize every area of our life including medicine I'm fully convinced that it will completely redesign healthcare let me give you five quick examples one a I will mine medical records the most obvious application of AI in health care is data management collecting classifying and tracing huge data sets of already available medical information is the first step in revolutionizing the existing healthcare systems number two a I will design treatment plans if you'll be able to analyze those data sets and combine them with attributes from a patient's file to identify potential treatment plans if you take tens of millions of studies and papers in the concentration why doing that number three I will create precision medicine classical medical practice put large groups of people in their focus and tries to develop clinical solutions drugs or treatment plans based on the needs of the statistically average person but with the ability to analyze vast amounts of medical information to achieve genome sequencing health sensors and variables AI will most likely help healthcare move from the one-size-fits-all medical solutions towards targeted treatments per my therapies and uniquely composed drugs and before AI with evolutionized drug creation speaking of drugs pharmaceuticals - clinical trials take sometimes more than a decade and cost billions of dollars a I could immensely speed up this process while making it a lot more cost effective this will have an enormous effect on health care and how innovations reach everyday medicine just imagine how fast it could come up with a cure for the next pandemic if supercomputers and AI algorithms could help us in the process number five health assistance and medication management the AI cure app supported by the National Institutes of Health uses a smartphone's webcam and AI to autonomously confirm of their patients are taking their medications or be better terms supporting them to make sure they know how to manage their condition this is very useful for people with serious medical conditions for patients who tend to go against doctors advise and participants in clinical trials of course although this might sound too good to be true whenever you hear about AI either getting hyped up or people try to scare you to death and even if you don't have to worry about the Terminator it seems a very valid very that if the mighty AI can be even half of what it promises to be our lives and jobs will change significantly but let me reassure you eeeyah is not here to replace positions instead it's going to be the status cope of the 21st century the biggest help and support a position can ask for today we have reached a level of medical knowledge but no doctor can have a grip on all 31 million medical papers out there but AI will assist them it will help them analyze medical data click precision medicine offer information about possible treatment plans and clinical trials and so on but these are going to be just highly advanced tools in the hands of doctors who will use them to treat and cure patients those who fear that with autonomous tools machines and algorithms the art in medicine will disappear can be reassured that it won't be the case when an AI algorithm finds the cure but cannot explain how we did that this test we we waiting for medical professionals ai will bring the real hero of the art of medicine but if you need to be ready eeeyah is going to be here faster and we can prepare for it we need regulations guidance and education as for me I'm trying to do my small part so you can expect a lot more videos on this exciting topic if you want to do your part share this video and if you want to
