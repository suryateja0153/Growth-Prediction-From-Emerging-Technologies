 [Music] what is human-centered artificial intelligence it's ai research inspired by the depth and diversity of human minds concerned at each step with its ethical impact on people and society and intended to augment human capabilities rather than replace them this is the vision that drives the stanford institute for human-centered artificial intelligence it's a hub for education policy and cross-disciplinary research that merges the study of ai with medicine economics robotics ethics the humanities and much more our work begins with the brain itself ai is intersecting with neuroscience blending the study of machine intelligence with the quest to understand our own i work at the intersection of artificial intelligence neuroscience and psychology working on using ideas from artificial intelligence to make neural network models that allow us to understand the brain and behavior and conversely using insights from neuroscience and cognitive science to improve our ability to solve artificial intelligence problems you know you see the world around you and by looking at the world you understand what's in it and you know it may seem totally effortless um and almost like it's nothing special is happening at all but actually almost half of the cortical area of the of the brain is devoted to visual processing that kind of underlying visual technology is an incredibly important part of what the brain is doing and we're really interested in discovering what those algorithms are both so that we can help machines understand the world better and also so that we can understand the visual system of the brain of course there's a big world outside the brain and it's growing more complex all the time ai is intersecting with social science policy and governance as societies across the globe look for new ways to adapt our lab is focused on a number of collaborations with government agencies including one with epa which has faced significant challenges enforcing the nation's environmental laws and what we are doing in this project is to show the potential for ai to really help pinpoint enforcement resources where there are particular hot spots of environmental pollution it's critical that engineers understand what 50 years of anti-discrimination law has to say on the topic and it's critical that our law students understand enough of the engineering choices that are being made and so that is what's most exciting to me about hai in terms of convening these kinds of conversations to provide a path forward for the next generation of ai technology it's important to remember that ai has the potential to dramatically reform government for the better on the other hand it's also possible for ai to bake in problems of the past we have to be quite mindful to make sure that they are fair that we understand them and that they work for the people they're intended to serve but a fair society must be resilient too that's why ai is intersecting with public health helping experts make sense of the choices we make in light of the information we consume i'm an epidemiologist and a public health physician but i'm also a medical journalist and i'm very interested in the intersection of not just contagious disease but contagious misinformation and disinformation about disease so you're bringing to the table of course people with particular expertise in ai but you're also bringing people with backgrounds in psychology social media epidemiology medicine nursing and i think that's what you need in order to have human centered ai that is truly effective and is truly focused on the greater good the future of ai hinges on people trusting and engaging with ai so the people that develop ai systems need to be black need to be women need to be non-binary transgender disabled queer they have to represent the people in the real world who might engage with ai and while ai helps to protect human life it's also elevating our perception of it ai is intersecting with the humanities changing the way artists of all kinds express themselves creative expression is absolutely fundamental to the human experience and you can't simply have a human-centered ai without that creativity so i'm interested in when and where and if ai might just be more than compatible but maybe actively companionable might extend and elevate creativity the way a pen or a paintbrush or musical instrument can i also think it's highly relevant for ai the way arts expand traditional notions of what a human subject is the implicit default having long been white male middle class able-bodied neurotypical and that's sometimes taken for granted in even innovative technological design at the heart of each of these stories is a question one will all play a role in answering as the intelligence of this technology grows how do we want ai to intersect with the way we live i'm a professor of music and computer science on paper but my lab explores ways in which technology like ai can intersect with creative expression i believe the quality of the future that awaits us is directly tied to the amount of agency freedom and autonomy that affords us as human beings that's why it's so important for every researcher engineer every investor every user working on or using artificial intelligence to approach their decisions by asking a simple but challenging question is my work helping to preserve and even extend human autonomy this is what human-centered ai looks like at the stanford institute for human-centered artificial intelligence we are working hard to ensure it reflects and serves everyone [Music] you
