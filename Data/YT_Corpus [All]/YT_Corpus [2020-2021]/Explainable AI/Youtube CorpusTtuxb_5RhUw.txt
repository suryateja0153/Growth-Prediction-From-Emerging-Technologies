 This week all I'm going to talk about is bias, fairness, and how biased data can produce discriminating algorithms and the huge impact this can have on society. The reason why I'm doing this is because after we've all seen what happened in the United States, George Floyd being murdered and the streets being flooded with people protesting, I feel like every one of us needs to take action and do something about this. As a white privileged person living in Europe, I objectively don't know anything about being discriminated. So the only thing I can do to try to contribute to this is to talk about what I know, which is technology and biases in technology. I hope you're going to do your part as well, so study, do your research, read books and watch these videos if they help you and share them with your friends if you think that they can give value to other people. So I'm going to start recording videos now and release them during the whole week. Stay tuned.
