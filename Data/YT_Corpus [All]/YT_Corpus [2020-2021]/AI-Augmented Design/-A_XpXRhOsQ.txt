 we live in a three-dimensional world every point in space can be described using three numbers the x y and z coordinates believe it or not this is actually a three-dimensional video you might not have noticed unless you're wearing a VR headset if you have a device for watching VR videos now would be a good time to use it if not don't worry you can move your phone around or swipe with your finger to look in different directions VR is possible today because we have fast internet speeds and small computers but underneath the tiny circuits and speedy data is the math that describes how it works [Music] if you're going to film a VR 180 video then you need a camera that can record all of the light coming in from the hemisphere in front of the camera how is this done with optics when light enters a glass of a camera lens from an angle it bends the formula that describes how this happens is called Snell's law this formula relates the angle of the incoming light ray to the angle of the refracted beam more specifically the sine of the incoming raided by the sine of the refracted ray is a constant this constant depends on the refractive indices of air and glass empowered with this formula engineers were able to create a lens capable of recording an entire hemisphere this is known as the fisheye lens fisheye lenses been a curved hemisphere of light onto a camera's flat sensor the sensor records the video but unfortunately everything looks weird and distorted this issue isn't new to VR in fact it's a very old problem dating back thousands of years when people began exploring the earth they wanted to create a map of what they found but how can you take the surface of the earth which is curved and draw it faithfully on a flat piece of paper you can't whenever you create a flat map of the earth there will always be parts that are stretched and destroyed it for example a this map of the earth Greenland looks huge it looks similar in size to South America but in reality South America is more than 8 times larger than Greenland also Africa is more than 2 times as large as Antarctica but you would never know it from this map to create a flat map of the earth we use a function called a projection this mathematical device will take every point on the surface of the earth and place it on a flat map one common projection is the equirectangular projection to see this in action imagine you have a globe of the earth and you want to create a map from it you will need a piece of paper that is as tall as the globe and as wide as its circumference so if D is the diameter of the globe then the paper must have dimensions G by pi times D next wrap the paper tightly around the equator of the globe to visualize the equirectangular projection draw a vertical axis through the earth next draw horizontal lines from the axis through the earth all the way to the paper now do this over and over until every point on earth is set to a point on the map if you unroll the paper you now have a familiar map of the spherical earth it distorts the earth especially near the poles but it's still a map the echo rectangular projection isn't perfect this raises a question is it possible that someday someone extremely clever will find a way to create a flat map of the earth that does not have any distortions the answer is no in the early 1800s the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss proved a result called the theorem I agree geom Latin for remarkable theorem one consequence of this theorem is that it's not possible to find a projection from the spherical earth to a flat map that preserves distances angles and all the other key measurements from geometry it's flat out and possible don't blame Gauss he was simply the messenger just as map makers use different projections to record the surface of the earth lens makers use different projections to film their surroundings a fisheye lens can capture an entire hemisphere of its surroundings and projected on a digital sensor as a circle but not all fisheye lenses are the same and different lenses have different projection formulas that describe how the light is bent these projections have names like stereographic orthographic echo solid and others to film a hemispherical video in 3d you need two fisheye lenses one for each eye and these two lenses project to circular images onto the sensor each projected circle can be encased in the square so the 3d Hemisphere is contained in a 2 by 1 rectangle using two cameras of fisheye lenses we now have a video with all of the pixels necessary to look around Hemisphere and see things in 3d a single frame of VR 180 video looks like this to view the video you will need a VR headset these are devices with two small screens one in front of each eye currently the headsets are kinda big and clunky but in the near future will be small uncomfortable now how do these headsets take a video frame with two circular highly distorted images and display them to us in a way that looks normal the answer more projections using sensors softer and lenses your headset determines the direction you're looking and then uses reverse projection to undo all the distortions all for your viewing pleasure another way math is needed to make sense of our three-dimensional world is with parallax here's a demonstration look around and focus on an object across the room now look at it with one eye closed and then switch eyes notice how the object seems to move this effect is called parallax and with trigonometry you can use how much it jumps to compute how far away that object is trigonometry is a study of triangles and the triangle we'll use is made by drawing a line between the two pupils of the eyes and then drawing lines from the pupils to the object the distance between the pupils is on average 63 millimeters this gives us one side of the triangle instictively our brain senses the angles at which our eyes are pointing if we knew the angles exactly we could compute the distances between our eyes and the object but after years of experience our brains are able to make a very good approximation of distances of nearby objects thanks brain from angles of refraction to parallax math is constantly used to recreate the world around us in its full 3d glory but math is not enough there's a lot of science and technology that goes into making this movie magic and Socratic it just happens to have videos on the science and technology of your so be sure to check them out I'm now going to enjoy some time the real world thanks to my VR headset
