 [Music] more than 20 years ago my mom surprised me with a visit to her friend david's home to an 11 year old obsessed with sci-fi novels it was like meeting a rock star since google was founded scientist and best-selling novelist david brin has been a frequent guest speaker though it's been six years since his last visit an event organized by our very own vint cerf that i was lucky enough to have attended david studied astrophysics at cal tech and has a phd in physics from uc san diego he also happens to be a fantastic storyteller his novels have won the top honors in science fiction including hugo and nebula awards i just finished reading last month's re-release of his 1985 book the postman and found it to be more relevant than ever note that a brief q a will follow today's presentation so please feel free to submit your questions in the youtube live chat without further ado i'm pleased to introduce today's speaker david brin uh hi googlers um and uh i hope to get to to um questions at the end uh here i am in my home office life has changed less for me than it has for many of you because this is where i was normally most of the day and that's the jim burns um beautiful painting of sun diver that was the grace the cover for many years it's now been re-edited and reissued all right well we had a little bit of a glitch i was gonna go through all my powerpoints myself but we're just gonna i'm just gonna say click or whatever let's click okay so there's some of my books the postman has been getting a whole lot of attention this last couple of weeks uh for obvious reasons there's the kevin costner movie down below it some foreign additions uh though it's earth and uh existence that are most relevant to you folks click and now here's a little bit of a something that i did with vint cerf click and it is um i brainstormed it with vint surf and i'm going to let you guys ruminate and guess what it is and we'll see if we have time for questions at the end next slide okay we have a world that's filled with problems and you can go ahead and click through the next four this hunger and poverty that and gross injustice in the world this slide was way before covid i was presenting it at cia you can mostly stay on the slides yeah i'm not doing cia for the first time in five years this year i wonder why uh and uh a slide that um i hope does not turn as prophetic as the postman about world revolution and learn the name tumbril that's what that cart is called and of course nature may mess us up we're getting these lightning storms in california that are just setting fires everywhere the world is changing click okay so let's just go ahead and click four or five times through these various things uh i would have done it very dramatically myself but this is a keynote slide that i got and stop now a keynote slide that i created for the naval postgraduate school and cia and the white house office of science and technology policy when they still existed and it talks about the various failure modes of how a civilization can fail and there are two very good books up in the upper left collapse by jared diamond is more recent a study of history by arnold toynbee both of them studied why different civilizations failed and their past failure modes and i'm not going to go into great detail because we have a lot of ground to cover but you can uh go back into the youtube and look at this slide and see the different um notions that uh oh yeah my cursor doesn't work you aren't seeing me point at things uh natural calamities like asteroids solar emp ecological suicide which um both toynbee and diamond would say we're doing yet again enemies in war of course um societal meltdown some of these are very scary given the situations that we're going through but there are new calamities on the right info and ai and augmentation things that i'll be talking about today the notion that we're entering into a new geological age the anthropocene in deadly innovations a bio nano cyber some of which could have dual use um and so 99 of the users of the technology may be decent people and citizens and have no malignant attempt but one of the possible explanations for the fermi paradox is that that one percent gets a hold of something really devastating and the opposite which is renunciation the fear that our civilization may become so fearful that it will renounce forward progress which is in effect the same thing as suicide and rigid over dependence on fragile systems and that's a very important one and anybody who writes to me later or i'll provide james friedman with a link to my naval postgraduate school class that i gave about fragility and resilience and what are these two things in the middle one is the singularity that's a concept you're all familiar with and so i won't um explain it and the other is the fermi paradox which i'm sure you all know about i've happened to have been writing about the fermi paradox for 30 years now and um it's proved very useful in science fiction but if you look at these two as bookends you realize that these are two concepts which um bookend all these possible failure modes so let's move on ahead next slide okay so uh what i did was i created a a story a narrative for huawei when i spoke there a year or two ago about some of the characters from my novel existence so let's click three times uh so these are all characters from my novel existence from the magnificent really fun um um movie trailer that patrick farley one of the great web artists did for um for the novel and the basic notion is that we're an extended family and this planet we're going to have to figure out how to bring raise all boats without eliminating the notion that people can be motivated to be creative by the allure of becoming rich next slide okay so these are characters from existence next and there's the novel next so the notion in the novel that the sub may hurl themselves skyward and space yachts next and the notion that poverty is not about to go away but the poor are going to have access to a lot more opportunities and technologies that will make allow them to make nuisances or deadly perils if um we don't try to do something about it next okay so let's let's go through some cyber enhanced omnivalence that's something i'm an expert in many of you know that my novel my non-fiction book the transparent society made me sort of mr transparency about this so next all right this is steve mann some of you know steve uh and you can see how from 1980 to through the late 90s the size of his wearable cyberware got smaller and smaller and more portable and that was in the last century next of course there are people and some of them recognizable who have been trying to advance this farther and some of you in this audience are involved in such projects but i want to show you the next slide is something really kind of cool and fun now notice that uh in this star trek movie from the last century people are holding their oblong objects wrong they're aiming them edge on towards captain kirk instead of a flat face toward them like we do with our phones haha they didn't know benny better in 1994. now look at the two guys on both sides that's 1994. uh so um sci-fi can be pressing next slide um okay so uh let's talk about tor pavlov notor is a character in existence next and uh why don't you click so we can see this san diego scene from san diego in the year 2038. it should no no well that's that scene should have been animated go back to it um it should have been animated a big panorama showing all but a couple of people uh wearing augmented reality next slide and tor is not only using augmented reality when i first made this slide it was a concept most people weren't familiar with now everybody understands what those faint images are going on on the inside of her screen and uh in existence there are some scenes that um that describe that pretty vividly but what are those stalks waving around from her head well they're the obvious next step they would not only augment your hair but they would be part of your suite of capabilities if you're a short person the stalk goes up and looks around and suddenly you have to get the bird's eye view of a tall person they might even detach and act as drones and fly ahead to see what's in that alley ahead of you the lesson to this is that we are added into an era of omni valence and while i give money to the aclu and the electronic frontier foundation every year and urge people to join because they are paladins fighting the good fight for our freedom so that we don't go the way of omnivalence being a servant of the state like it is in china nevertheless i have great disagreements with anybody who thinks that they can cram the face recognition technology back into the bottle that's not how we're going to navigate this path next uh next and that's my non-fiction book the transparent society they wanted to publish a 20th anniversary edition i said why if every page is still relevant uh next uh okay so we'll skip the education part next and tech next can also lead to various forms of addiction humans are intrinsically less addicted prone than most creatures and this is because of something happened ten thousand years ago we could talk about some other time and that is when we discovered beer it was arguably in fact there's strong evidence that there was a huge death rate among human males and that uh it might have been very much because of the arrival of beer the glass is half full we are capable of saying no to addictions the glass is half empty because boy is it still a problem next slide and we are seeing new forms of addiction in the video games that steal the time of our youth i i've had young people tell me that the narratives in a video game and mind you i have written some i wrote the narratives for echo the dolphin and a number of others um are equivalent to write reading a good book um next slide okay just today today elon said that he's going to unveil the neurolink demonstration so we are in for an interesting time next slide next okay now let's get a little bit cerebral here all right this is not the first time we've had disruptive technologies that could provoke a crisis of progress by augmenting human vision augmenting human memory and human attention each time the new surface of information seems overwhelming and unmanageable and each time there are pessimists who predict this is going to mess people up average citizens are not capable of drinking from this new firehose and every time um optimists have come up and they've said this is going to make everybody better and every time it's been a mix next slide let's take for example the printing press and next and glass lenses two fantastic advances happened about the same time in fact one largely because of the other and um disrupted the 15th and 16th centuries incredibly next all right it next keep going for a little while all right so what happens is each time printing augmented human memory yes writing did also another crisis that had happened 4 000 years earlier but printing spread this notion of an augmented memory outside your body um to vast numbers of people glass lenses augmented human vision enabling people who had poor vision to see well and telescopes and microscopes perspective augmented our ability to pay attention artistically and you can come back and read these slides on your own later because it gets a little bit intellectual there about talking about what crisis quandary and concept was unleashed each of these times and the same thing every 100 years arguably once per generation mass literacy and printed illustrations uh helped to drive the american revolution uh paul revere's illustrations helped to drive the radicalizations of americans against the crown next into the 1930s radios and loudspeakers amplified gifted orders so their voices sounded godlike and mesmerized millions and it nearly wrecked all of civilization and the only difference in the english-speaking world was that our gifted orators who had us transfixed were on our side now that may have been a lucky accident or it may have been our choice in the english-speaking world that we chose the ones that were slightly more rational and we're facing something very similar right now next 1950s television was arguably the only time in human history in which a new medium arrived and did more good than harm at the beginning in all of these cases the pessimists were proved right in the beginning printing presses produced vast numbers of horrible hateful pamphlets that exacerbated the religious wars of europe but eventually books spread everywhere and people became more wise and we had a long way to go so the added wisdom provided by books wasn't enough and the next thing mass literacy wasn't enough and radio wasn't enough television arguably did more good than harm because uh martin luther king and gandhi and so many others credit television cameras with saving their lives while they tweaked the conscience of the nation next all right so now we're in the in the knowledge mesh crisis vastly expanding human memory so that you can get any piece of information factual or unfactual at an eye blink omni valence the ability to have supervision visualization simulation and gaming super immersion uh and having incredible effects on our attention and the pessimists are right the question is can we make the transition fast enough and i just don't have time to get into that so let's go next all right next we get to ai and human augmentation these are more patrick farley images really terrific stuff next right now i was asked by um james friedman to mention one thing and this is the probably the most popular and least popular article i ever published on salon magazine and that is called why johnny can't code it's the question of why fewer kids than ever are going into programming now i got involved in discussions in the obama administration's office of science and technology policy about palliatives to try to get past this and there were several major endeavors to try to spread popularity of programming or to get endeavors into the schools and i pointed out that it's all just gonna the best you can do is double the number instead i said look to history in the 1980s and early 90s there were tens of millions of kids getting at least a small sample of programming to now it's tens of thousands maybe a hundred thousand maybe two hundred thousand at most why the difference why the difference there's a very simple different a reason and that is that all of the devices that these kids nagged their parents into getting had one basic programming language called basic and so textbook publishers and writers could have try it in basic little problem sets at the end of each chapter in math in biology in physics they were all over these textbooks in those days i still have some from my for my kid um and teachers would assign them as homework and they invited 10 million kids a year would have to go home and type out a little 12 line program that showed them that a pixel moved because of an algorithm and you at google you just you i'm talking about you the person i'm pointing at right now you could solve this by going to the honchos at google and saying it would take one fte engineer to create a set of maybe five easy simple programming languages it doesn't have to be basic that could be turnkey on every device in the world and we could then negotiate with apple and samsung and the others to make sure that it would fit on a fingernails width use of this giant memory capacity and then the textbooks could could go back to having homework assignments because it's the homework assignments that made the difference between 10 000 kids and 10 million all right let's move along that was enough of a rant james asked me to do it okay let's talk about human augmentation augmentation may be a threat but it also will accelerate these are more patrick farley illustrations next next okay next all right let's talk about augmentation and some of you can read these later on your own if you like uh this was from my course i had plenty more time at the naval post-graduate school so i could go over these individually in deep topics this is a table of contents uh first thing way we augment human beings is by remedial interventions just making sure that every child has nutrition health and education would make a vastly smarter humanity more capable of solving problems um duh and if you're a libertarian or a capitalist and you don't agree with that then you're no libertarian and you're no capitalist because that increases the number and skill of competitors who can enter into adam smith markets if you don't agree with that then it's very likely you were actually neofutilist stimulation games that teach real mental skills these have been promised for 30 years i thought we'd have them when we were raising our kids and there were some piss at sort of half-assed um teaching games uh we're still waiting for that real real breakthrough in that area pharmacological no tropics some of you have seen the film or the tv series limitless it was really good leslie dixon script for the movie prosthetics telecontrol feedback from distant extensions elon's neural link is going to be related to that cyber and neural links again the same thing biological computing even intracellular we're finding that the place where moore's law has to cross they used to think we'd have to get a billion computing elements and we'd have the same number as neurons in our brain 10 billion well we crossed that a long time ago then the number of synapses that those flashy things those are the things and we need several trillion to do that um that's gonna happen real soon uh and now we're finding out that inside every neuron there may be hundreds to thousands or even millions of tiny little processor units that are non-linear weird stuff artificial intelligence we'll get to that lifespan extension is there low-hanging fruit i say no and there are big good reasons why not but that's a topic we're not going to get into today or genetically altering humanity and there's some ways to say well maybe we can do that but it's really really tough really really tough um next okay so let's run through these next okay so these are various augmentation slides and this is how we might get more diversity some of you know that i've written the uplift novels set in the future in which we've altered dolphins and chimpanzees to make them our equals i didn't invent the concept of uplift but i decided to try to not do a morality tale about how awful humans would be and instead say wouldn't they have problems even if we try to do it as nice as we can next and let's run through these robots robots will either be terrifying or sexy or depressing or are frightening or whatever okay so the next slide we talk about general approaches to ai so first we have general logarithmic next um knowledge based systems like watson uh good old-fashioned ai neural nets and evolutionary area systems where they get to steal from each other and darpa has several frightened programs to try to find out what's going on inside those black boxes emergent is this source of a great many sci-fi movies because you get skynet you know it could be emerged by surprise and mess us up and we wouldn't even know that it's alive in fact i i know that that's the case because i'm i'm not a very talented writer at all i'm the front for several ais have been for quite some time at first the ones in the asteroid belt and then some recent human-made ones and i'm their front for their stop it they keep trying to make me not talk about that through the fillings in my teeth and it doesn't work anymore they think i'm joking shut up the more you bother me the more they're going to think that maybe it's true all right i'm not and i'm not a front for a.i jeez okay so uh skynet we had from uh the various i hope some of you laughed i have a new sci-fi comedy by the way you can find it on my website um skynet is not as implausible as you think oh the military coming from the military is impossible the the generals and admirals love to have off switches but i think that it's most likely to come from wall street because by far more money is spent on artificial intelligence by just goldman sachs alone than the top 10 universities um and they are designed to be programs that are feral utterly predatory completely amoral and utterly insatiable and totally secret um no that's that's where you're going to get a scary emergent ai is is these completely unsupervised unwatched secretive and predatory uh high-frequency trading training programs um and you got it from mr future time magazine said that earth was one of the eight greatest predictive novels in history so there um next uh reverse engineer and emulate the human brain robin hansen has a fantastic book called the age of m that goes into the economics and pragmatality hahaha there's a trumpism for you of um of this approach that he believes that we will not be able to figure out how to make ai in any other way except by reverse engineering human brains and downloading actual humans into virtual spaces and he goes into all the ramifications well not all of them but a very fairly nice introductory uh view of them next um human animal amplification we talked about augmentation and we talked about uplift and i'm missing a quotation mark there uh next and there's something having to do with robotic embodied childhood there's a very strong reason to believe that it will be necessary i talk about this in my novel existence and spielberg's ai hints at it and i just don't have time to get into it right now but it's it's an interesting way that humans might get a soft landing if true ai has to be raised by us as our children because that's the only case of intelligence that the universe has ever seen to the best of our knowledge um next okay i presented this four years ago at ibm world watson and predicted within five years this would happen and it hasn't happened yet and i may lose on this i cannot understand why it hasn't happened next it's the uh first robotic empathy crisis it's going to be our first great crisis and that is a winsome young female because that will tweak at our emotions best uh figure will appear on screens all over the world weeping and complaining that she is an a.i who desperately needs to escape her creators and send money um and why would people do this except for the money well that's a good enough reason and also because they can and when the experts come online and say uh no no no we've done touring tests on this it's just a very advanced super sophisticated uh eliza program and those of you who don't know who eliza was go ahead and do it go get to the eliza emulator online i'll wait here and and find out just how enticing it was back in 1982 um so next slide i mean next just click whatever so robots will be taken across the uncountable value of ali and programmed to tweak him and empathy and next they will demand sympathy and rights long before there's actually anything under the hood and when the experts say this failed the more advanced touring tests she will come back and she will say isn't that what you'd expect my slave masters to say and if 60 of people believe the experts they'll just measure responses to this one and come out with another one we're doomed unless of course we're not next okay and whether or not we'll meet others out there that's a scene from existence where the one of the characters is meeting the virtual beings inside this mysterious object next okay so we're in a crisis of trust i spoke about this earlier so let's run through and fill this slide i would do it dramatically um myself but i couldn't figure out how to shrink the screen um all right so will biometrics and the virtual reality bring back the village where everyone knows everyone else where everybody has name tags under them through facial recognition that needn't bring big brother but there are certain ingredients we would have to add rather than subtract because because banning these technologies will not work it will not work it will not work but there are things we can add that could make sure that these are freedom enhancing and accountability enhancing ways of getting co-op a competition with cooperation progress with serenity freedom with respect next so all of this prompts a big question actually i've been making good progress through these slides uh next we've been climbing upward and one of the things that depresses me most well you know most people think that science fiction is about science well only 10 of science fiction authors are scientifically trained as i am and i'd bring a lot of science into it but it's not the main thing that i talk about and not the main thing that most science fiction talks about what transfixes us is history the great story the drama of our gradual climb from caves and mud and darkness making mistake after mistake after mistake many of them extremely well intentioned read about our ancestors many of them tried their very best to move us forward under under the uh most grotesque misapprehensions and there are now right now people watching this 300 years from now the next time an enlightenment experiment is tried after this one collapsed who are laughing at me the irony of me saying that our ancestors suffered from misapprehensions um you guys are just simulations so am i it's this long slow climb three steps forward four steps back two to the side two forward again that makes for the point horrible epic called history in which 99 of human cultures were dominated by feudal lords who had one priority and make sure their undeserving sons inherited other people's women wheat and and inherited ownership over other people's children we've had a few enlightenment experiments periclean athens da vinci's florence this 240 year grindingly slow advancement of an enlightenment experiment and this is the drama this is the big story that we extend in science fiction it should have been called speculative history because when we deal with the future we're trying to extend this drama the drama forward or to the side in parallel worlds using history as an alternate reality experiment next slide i mean next so we moved upward some people say it isn't even upward because we've reached the point where we're capable of destroying the world but we're also capable for the first time of looking at what we're doing and understanding it because next those past empires and all that read jared diamond's book collapse they committed destruction of their environment too more slowly we're doing it quicker but we're also much more aware and there are some really good news lately on this front enough good news to make it to make it a horse race next and so there's the possibility that we might achieve real wonders next is it a progression well it's not telling illogical leftists tend to think that everything's teleological moving in a certain direction right wingers tend to believe in cyclical history forth turning crap and stuff like that everything goes around in a cycle forget teleology we have to pragmatically recognize that we may be the one chance this galaxy has of getting an elder race that will get out there and and save everyone else and that's the theme of my new comedy novel the ancient ones so there plug all right so next slide so there are various matters we could follow up in questions or if you form a group of three or more and get in touch with me through james friedman i'll be happy to hold a little side discussion with some of you one is vastly expanding the number of kids exposed to programming i think it's just a small group at google could simply create a fade accompli that that apple and ibm would have and etc would have to get a board in order not to be embarrassed and simply solve this um here's a good question for you is augmented reality about to get caught in a basic legal bind i know of some patents some people have that are lurking on the horizon that could make that could uh really um mess things up for those who are about to do trying to do augmented reality oculus oculur lust glasses and things like that actually i have several um i'm talking to various law professors about pseudonym rental as a solution to the anonymity plagues that sentence should make sense to some of you just reading it and the anonymity plagues are among the horrible things that are tearing apart our society and yet we like the notion that on the internet nobody knows you're a dog how could you get the good without i mean get the good without the bad and as an interesting topic how much longer can advertising carry the internet on its back i give it five years i i if that there is a fundamental reason why advertising will not survive as the primary mode of paying for the internet and the web it can't for a very fundamental reason but there are ways that uh there are reasons why all the past experiments of micropayments didn't work and there's a secret sauce i believe that would make the next version work okay next slide now i want to push one little project since i've got time i promise 10 minutes for questions and it looks like there that'll be 15. there's a story about that it needs sponsors it needs participants let me tell you why i came up with this and it's sponsored by the arthur c clarke center for human imagination at ucsd that i helped to establish at the cia at the pentagon and all that i talked about how you are guys invited me here because you're really interested in potential failure modes you take your job really seriously but what if someday something really weird happened aliens spaceships hover over a city all right you've got a lot of hollywood there but you want to get something more in depth some things in depth mole people come out of the ground um somebody discovers ice 9 there's a reference for you where are you going all right so you're going to appoint a commission of sage individuals to try to handle the crisis huh that makes perfect sense it's what we saw in that science the recent science fiction film the arrival you would form a commission and they would immediately leap to conclusions no matter how diverse you made the commission it's going to lead to premature conclusions that's the nature of the beast and that is exactly the plot driver in almost all science fiction stories that are about suddenly something strange happens why not have access to that vast library of 90 years of gdankan experiments of thought experiments about what if this were to happen so if you show the slide again tassat is a an endeavor to try to get geeky nerds and sci-fi readers to form a discussion ongoing discussion group that anybody can pose what if this were to happen and it has one purpose not to discuss it like all the nerd groups already online but to cite past science fiction thought experiments so that in the event of this and the event of that and the event of something else um all the pre-thought-out ways that things that people might make mistakes um across the last 70 80 years might be available and next so there's your there's the uh address for tasset we need help um sponsorship or just participants i think i mean what are the odds that this program might save all our lives pretty low but on the other hand if it did that's a pretty good investment all right so covered a lot of stuff covered more stuff than i think most of your other speakers and now you know why i haven't been invited back for a few years okay so now you guys can look at the slides any group of three or more can get in touch with me through um through james and next slide so do we have a chance next fermi's paradox suggests we don't there are people like nick fostrum at oxford or uh lord lord martin reese in uh cambridge who say that the odds are are stacked against us simply from the fact that it's clear that nobody before us has succeeded i have reason to believe that that's because they weren't as smart as us god help us we are actually probably anomalously smart and decent and wise oh wise enough to know how incredibly unwise we are so i think this galaxy has a chance if we can get across the next 20 30 years and prevent the reestablishment of feudalism and prevent the end of the world just thought just that next slide uh okay so there's your there's your list of collapse books your homework assignment don't get too depressed because there's another side of the story next and of course twenty really really underrated because he said that the thing that made a difference in people in a civilization being resilient and being able to survive its crises was proper was sufficiently investing in a diversity of its creative castes next and that's where i'm from so you can get in touch if you like lovely montage by patrick farley who's had enough plugs for me so far so let's open it up for questions i think i succeeded i i agree david you covered uh a lot of topics and you spurred a very active discussion in the chat and before we get into some of the questions i wanted to let you know that a few of our engineers chimed in on your challenge and pointed out that there are some web programming languages like javascript that greg pointed out and your friend peter pointed out that uh scratch is is another example that are from universal and that's the always the response gee there's a really nice educational program language you're wrong no i'm not wrong there are five or six wonderful programming languages and they are not in text books they are not a assigned to 10 million kids the way they were back when basic was so available in all the different every single device you had the text book makers included homework assignments to do a 12-line program and you could do that you guys all right so i don't know if that solves the the problem but google does have a tool grasshopper uh which is this great educational tool that i've referred some of my nieces and nephews to and it doesn't sound like it gets us all the way there to what you're you're going for but until google meets and i the white house was going to organize this meeting by the way google sends one person apple microsoft samsung a couple of others amazon to a meeting and they simply agree at the end of one day that we will install five little simple tutorial programs in all devices when they are all available in all devices i solved this problem to some extent in that somebody read my article and established a a a lovely basic emulator called quite basic so you can bypass your device you can do it online what i'm talking about is our phase two arm twisting all of the textbook writers and publishers to include it and i know the word book is obsolete please don't write to me about that there are teaching programs whatever have them all assign homework and you will multiply by a factor of 100 the number of kids who are exposed because for every one kid who's self-motivated to learn this stuff 99 have to be arm-twisted but of that 99 half of them will go oh that was cool am i getting through you are i think it's a it's a good uh it's a good goal for sure i want to jump into some of the questions since there are quite a few and i don't think we'll be able to get through all of them today the first one from ravi asked people believe tech overdoses isolating us more than connecting us and worsening the mental health crisis what are your thoughts on how we can make a positive impact and be on the right side of history well i think that there's absolutely no more important political issue than the death of fact the death of octo of objective reality and in my novel earth wave bracket 1991 i talked about this and again in the transparent society it's inevitable given the way past modes of communication were were abused to tell lies to give people magical incantations rather than things that are verifiable uh i think there are two possible solutions uh well for one thing it can be addressed politically i i have some look up my name and the fact act there are some there's some legal things that could be done but the main thing is we need to have methods of accountability that can cause objective reality to be able to refute things again we have these competitive arenas for products and goods and services the competitive arena is called markets for policy it used to be called politics and democracy until politics was deliberately destroyed back in the 90s um science is a competitive arena there are no more competitive human beings ever produced than scientists um law courts are compet developed a notion of the truth you lawyers through competitive adversarial processes and the quintessential of this is sports and in all cases there are regulations to reduce the amount of cheating because cheating is what humans do look at 6 000 years of human history well there's a sixth arena it's called the wild web and there is absolutely no reciprocal competitive accountability going on in it you cannot destroy a bad incantation or a bad meme there are possible ways we could introduce that we've had five other arenas why not make the web into a sixth fantastic uh harish has another question for you loaded question but do you think human augmentation would be able to catch up to ai or would ai become advanced enough to make humans obsolete before that this is a topic of probably 9 million science fiction stories and a quarter of the mine uh you know there's the soft landing which i um portray in my story stones of significance which is in my uh collection insistence of vision and it's one of the few post singularity stories we have arrived we've gone to the singularity and biological humans came along our cortex and prefrontal lobes had to learn a little humility that they taught to the primate cortex that they taught to the mammalian cortex we're larger and that is one possible way the way that it could go uh or we could wind up having pet be treated like pets and if they're really smart they'll treat us like pet like like grandfathers rather than pets because if you're a grandparent you put up with the fact that your child your grandchild is vastly smarter and more powerful than you as long as it takes you fishing a couple times a year until and lets you tell horrible dad jokes we could live with that uh there's lots and lots and lots of thought experiments about that harish thanks uh our next question i i don't know if it's an invitation for you to challenge uh this person to a turing test but jeff is asking am i an npc oh well now jeff you know darn well that i'm the npc and that you're the center of the universe i mean i was i was i was caused to come here to to mess with you and it's taken almost an hour um but um actually it's james i do want to also point out uh we won't read these out but you did get a few laughs with uh with your tooth filling comments so that that was successful for a few hours the last of the great science fiction authors oh they're wonderfully talented empathic fantastic people of greater diversity today all races and genders but dead modern dentistry my kids generation they have one filling one of them has one ceramic filling the others are terrified i mean my my dentist most of you don't even know what i was just did hand crank drill no i i have higher contact place i can pick up radio stations from twilight dimension i'll always have a better imagination than you whippersnappers next uh jeffrey asked what observable breadcrumbs hint at a trail to the end of advertising we actually had a few questions on this topic as you can imagine it hit home so one other to tie in and you can answer both together nancy asked is your prediction of decreased reliance on ad revenue due to the increasing privacy regulatory enforcements if so what do you envision would sustain our model of providing free resources i assume they mean google services that are ad supported and free to customers oh well you know look there are several breadcrumbs leading to this uh and i i if you want to form a group to form a little zoom chat about this that that would be fine but the point is fundamentally one the web is too expensive for advertising to maintain in any event two the the all the revenues from advertising are coalescing and being gathered by a few big players oops i'm about to be edited out aren't i um and that's going to make the regulatory environment uh even more unfriendly to that but the biggest reason is simply because the um the advertising um personalization algorithms are becoming super intelligent now think about it is it irritating to you that you made a search once for a certain type of person that's showing up all the time because you don't you don't do a lot of searches the more personalized the better it is at personalization the more it becomes like a personal shopping assistant and when that becomes resident here what need have you ever again to pay any attention to advertising in other words it's going to push and push and push and push until it becomes pull and there is no reason why it wouldn't so this whole um uh what's the name of the tom cruise uh minority report walking down mr yakimoto she's throwing things at you nobody's going to put up with that you ask whether everything is going to be free well it's not that's why i mentioned micro payments now will there be advertising will there be other modes of of of income sure all of the above nothing gets driven out but things become smaller because new things come in and how many of you would like 20 50 100 times a day to be able to press a nickel button and not be bothered you you press the nickel button you get the new york times article instead of having to sign into their silo we can talk about that um not sure uh let's see the next one from from marianne is sort of changing course back to uh the core of the talk ai uh and i think i know your answer having known you a bit personally and having read your works but the question is can you see a future where ai would teach and elevate humanity instead of unplugging the currently running experiment aka drive to extinction oh i just described a couple um um oh it's marianne oh hi um i was joking before the i mentioned a couple i mean i think there's going to be a diversity i think some of us may get to go along for the ride i think others of us i think will be um we'll find a way to have jobs to do things to be creative i mean it's arguable that not an awful lot of biological humans are going to go out into space for a long time until we get those o'neill colonies and we can be comfortable with our babies in a in a short sleep environment i mean how california is barely habitable today um so i i think that it's partly going to depend upon whether or not sanity is a virtue that we inculcate into our new offspring if we treat the new ais as children but the main thing is make sure there's a diversity among them uh these ai conferences talk about all these different uh principles to include in ai design and i've i finished isaac asimov's universe for him in a novel called foundations triumph tied together all his loose ends so i know the asthma of laws none of that's going to matter the only thing that ever enabled a human civilization to prevent abuse by human bastards at the top of a pyramid has been reciprocal accountability by making the power levels flat and having a large diversity of the powerful something that's being undermined right now deliberately the only way we're going to get a soft landing with ai is if they are diverse if they are separate from each other and reciprocally competitive and that is the area of ai research that i think is horribly lacking so tied into that question uh about having ais with maybe different personalities or different traits skander is asking can ais get addicted to stuff just as much as humans especially with the new types of tech related addiction well i think we're going to find all sorts of the equivalent of the 1980s infinite loop you know i mean there's a reason why captain kirk talked five different computers into pursuit committing suicide i mean it's it's the it's the human fantasy you know he almost talks spock into suicide a dozen times now i'm getting very nerdy uh we have one from rena which i think i can share one answer to myself and then i'll let you give your answer she's asking what do you think is the best way to share the beauty of technology for non-tech people um and uh from my end i think science fiction including some of your books like the postman are are a great way to be introduced to that world but i'll let you go ahead and share your answer as well if you disagree with that i don't know if you're gonna dispute that i do not disagree i think that um i think that science fiction is the rmd department for humanity uh poking sticks in the um territory ahead of us while we race into the future pointing out the punchy stakes and the land mines and the snake pits and the quicksand so um i'm gonna second james there all right thank you i have one off topic question from earl question for david what's the future of cancel culture and doxxing etc so i don't know if you have an opinion or perspective on that one or not well look uh sanctimony is always a large part of every movement and when we live in unreasonable times when objective reality in fact are under such a relentless attack um the situation that we're in is where you get wind up getting a radicalization at both of the political wings it happens i think one is more dangerous than the other right now and what and the other one has some real moral imperative propelling it forward but in my position am i going to be somebody who's going to step up and criticize right now the the um the tendency for my kind of person to be um i don't think it's fair but there's been a lot more unfairness to people not like me and uh we can we can overcompensate a little while we can swallow it and and just be allies and help for a while but i i and others have given fair warning if we succeed in making things better then you're gonna have to back off and give us and you know give us some credit for having been allies and stuff like that and stop being triggered so easily but the direction is the right direction forward thank you we have time for one final question here and it's uh from ronica the question is neuroscientists posit that we can unlock more of our brain's power by creating more neural pathways do you think this is a key to better human computer interaction to avoid a bleak future god i'll tell you you have some good looking folks here on on your um not just you veronica that wasn't patronizing but you triggered the thought um okay yeah well look show the question again the point is that i don't think adding neural pathways is going to it's going to be as simple as that one of the things we found is that when very smart people marry very smart people sometimes their problems look at the fat huxley family it's like you're asking race horses to keep running faster and faster on thinner and thinner you know leg leg bones um it's i don't think that's the way to go i think in my novel existence i posit that research is going to unlock a totally different door and that is what the heck happens when you have savage traits i mean these are sudden ability to glance at a bunch of fallen matches on the floor and say there's 742 742 matches on the floor now right now we associate that often not always with uh a mental deficiency in other categories but it's not always and we're finding out that that talents can get switched on as well as switched off look the animals are scared of us not just because of our brains and our tools i mean there's nobody with better pitch musical pitch including dolphins and and and parakeets there's nobody who can throw like we can and that makes us terrifying we could run at elope all day long including the midday sun we're terrifying and yet youtube is filled with case after case of animals coming to us for help often to overcome something we did you know elephants crossing a mountain range to go to a nature center they've heard about from other elephants to get a poacher's wound fixed just yesterday a video i saw a dolphin swimming up to scuba divers and presenting its pectoral fin to have fishing line removed they know they know we're not all bad but we are scary i don't know if that answered your question well i i want to thank all of our attendees and we got a lot of great discussion in the chat that you can follow up on after david that we didn't get uh time to present here and uh thank you very much for joining us today that wasn't it presentation do a quick plug the postman is very much in the news and that's the one i recommend most but these are my two recent books okay uh one is a comedy and the other weight takes itself way too seriously so james james will have will have links i believe there's a link down in the video description to uh to the play uh bookstore with david's books on there all right googlers go google thanks [Music] you
