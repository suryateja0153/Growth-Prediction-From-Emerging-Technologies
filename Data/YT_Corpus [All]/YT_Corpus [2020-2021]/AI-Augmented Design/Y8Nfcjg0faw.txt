is our English yeah and yams and we also have provided many services and the own device abilities to our partners we have provided over we have served over forty thousand developers in our yota AI platform we provide many useful abilities based on our own developed the neuro machine translation the OCR the aru and SRT tiens such many so many fundamental abilities all surrounded all surrounded by with language scenarios and also provide many solutions related to the language learning and education we have served many partners in China and we are working with our partners to optimize our abilities to provide more more provide better better services to the end users and Anza and I have mentioned yesterday we also have built several applications and useful functions with a flight for example we have built the word scanning and lookup functions with a flight in the dictionaries application and we also have created some photos translation and air translation solutions with chef light and here there's a video then I can show you how we do the air translation you can scan the word the text around you with with your camera and it will translate the word in real-time with your camera and by the OCR and translation so this is the first AR translation in China and beyond applications we also have created some hardware's for example we have we have created the Udall translate King which is the translate machine it is pose Chinese to English Korean and Japanese offline speech translation translation and in verse of course and also provide over thoughts over 40 languages online speech translation and it also spose online and offline photo translation and we have done the offline translation the beach translation and the photo translation with jeff light and also
