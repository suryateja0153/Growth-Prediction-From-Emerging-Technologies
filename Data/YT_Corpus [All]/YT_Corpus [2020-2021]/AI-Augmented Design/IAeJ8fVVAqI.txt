 So, shopping has been done in the same way for many, many years. If you're shopping online, for example, you always have to translate what's in your head into using some keywords to try to find what you're looking for. So we developed an artificial intelligence software that allows online stores to enable their users to do visual search. That means that users can upload a picture of something they like, and with our search engine we match the picture that they uploaded to the products of the store. Our website is really the entry point to all our customers. Our domain is Macty.eu We had the choice of doing, for example, a dot be. Meaning, ok, we're a Belgian company. But we wanted to be more international than that. So having the .eu really reflects the fact that we span across all the European countries. And it gives us that international visibility that is important for us. There has been a huge progress in A.I. About what machines can do in terms of understanding what is in an image, what is in a video, and understanding what is being said in language. This is what excites us about having a start-up in A.I., is that we can bring this technology to the world. And make something a little bit different from what it was. Create things that didn't exist before.
