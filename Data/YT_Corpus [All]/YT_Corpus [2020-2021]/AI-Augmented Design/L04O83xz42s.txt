 let's ask a question s devlin according to Wikipedia Esmerelda Devlin is a london-based artist and stage designer who works in a range of media poem portraits invites everyone to contribute to donate a word to a collective poem chaos unequal complex ascending the poem is generated by means of an algorithm that's trained on 20 million words of 19th century poetry so each word that you add to it will combine with words that have been added by others and with the words of those who are writing few centuries ago recollections of the binding sky art thou alone AI is basically another part of the team it's another thing with collaborating with I work closely with Google arts and culture and with their creative technologist possibly the algorithm is pretty simple to explain actually it's a machine that has learned it's an algorithm for writing it learned what words are by looking at the patterns of characters over and over again until I could predict the statistical probabilities that a word like her in 2016 I was at the serpentine galleries and I was invited to talk with Hans Ulrich Obrist and about something we could do for their serpentine gala everybody who came actually was invited to donate the bar and then got actually a image back we talked for a long time about how could we get online so that everybody could take that unequally descending at the full cloud the freshness of the tide that's kind of got like a 1970s hippie kind of vibe going I feel quite psychedelic it's almost like fortune cookies you try with one word you get one poem and then you want to roll the dice again in the last conversation very happy fellows as I said there should be no end to experimentation and that is a wonderful motor we think of everyday and it's also a wonderful motto she fell upon Potter have a play with it because what you'll find is that it's in your interaction with this algorithm that the fun and actually the poetry starts to happen [Music]
