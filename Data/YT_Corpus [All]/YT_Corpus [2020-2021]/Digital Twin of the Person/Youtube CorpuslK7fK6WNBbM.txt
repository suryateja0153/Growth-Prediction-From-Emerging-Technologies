 Hey everyone it's Lucie Fink! Welcome back to my youtube channel. It is September which means back to school for people who have businesses it's time to get organized. I know the feeling of wanting to kind of refresh and reset at the start of a new month so September is your month to declutter. Today's video is going to be all about helping you declutter those digital spaces of yours. If you're not yet subscribed to my youtube channel, be sure to click on the subscribe button down below and give this video a thumbs up to let me know that you want more videos like this one. First and foremost the reason that I was so inspired to do a digital decluttering video is because as part of my membership community where I host a five-day challenge every month. This past month's challenge was five days of minimalism so my online community was given a very organized document to help them go through five days of minimalism. I gave them things like checklists, prompts, ideas and basically just walk them through everything they needed in order to do five days of minimalism on their own and to really start incorporating various aspects of minimalism into their lives. I want to be sure to mention two things in this video so number one if you want to join that online community and you want to be part of a group of like-minded people who are trying five-day challenges every month doing live q&a sessions with me, getting custom Lucie merch, having your name listed in my youtube description box and so much more click on the link down below if you join my patreon community for $25 a month which is my top tier the twin sis and bff tier you will get all those things I listed and so much more so by joining that you're gaining access to a like-minded community of people who so far are all amazing and actually that's the second thing I wanted to say is that at the end of this video  I promised that I would call out by name the people who signed up first and got into my community before anyone else did so stay tuned until the end of the video for that but now on to decluttering our digital spaces. I think that some of our digital spaces like our cell phones and our laptops are places that we often tend to overlook when we're trying to clean out and get our lives in order but in reality we actually spend so much more time on our devices a lot more time than we spend in our closets or on our bookshelves and even just having something like a messy desktop background or a messy home screen on your phone can add totally unnecessary stress to your day. So the first space that I'm gonna focus on is my cell phone. Tip number one is to choose a calming and clean background image for your phone. I don't know what you have going on there now but I know you're going to be a lot happier if the image is something that brings you a sense of peace and joy and even if it's something simple like a quote. Make sure you think about how it's going to look when there are apps and icons in front of it and make sure you just keep it simple. I currently have a drone photo from our honeymoon it's a photo of me and Michael looking like two tiny specks on this island in the Maldives and it's just turquoise very calming in terms of colors and it's very far back so it's not very cluttered. Tip number two is organizing your apps. If you're anything like me you probably have loads of apps on your phone maybe you download free apps all the time and then use them once and forget to delete them so step one of app organization is gonna be going through all of your apps and first deleting what you don't need. Don't try to organize them and then delete them because then you're gonna make unnecessary folders and it's really difficult to move them around so delete them first and remember don't get too hung up on deleting apps it's really easy to re-download an app and pick up where you left off. So if you ever do decide you want that app again in the future you can just re-download it and then once you've done the clearing out and you're only left with the apps that you really want to keep. Now it's time to create folders. So I'm the type of person who leaves a small select number of apps on my front home screen. I actually don't like it to be filled with apps so I only have a few apps on the home screen that I open every single day and then when you swipe to the second page that's where the rest of my apps are but once again I don't have them all spread out on the second page. They're organized neatly into folders. Your folders will likely have different labels based on whatever type of person you are and what apps you use often but mine are things like social media, travel, finance. I have a content folder for all of my photo and video editing apps and so on. If you want a little bit more inspiration for how to best organize your apps go on Pinterest and just search iPhone app organization inspiration they have some color-coded ones things that will really just inspire you. Tip number three is turning off your cell phone notifications if you want to immediately decrease the amount of stress that your device brings you turn off the notifications. We unfortunately live in this age where everyone just feels like they need to be accessible to everyone else at all times but I've realized that how accessible you are is actually in your own hands and in your control, I feel like I don't even need to be notified if I get a text message from someone the truth is if something is urgent I trust I'm going to get a phone call so I don't even have notifications on to tell me that I got a text let alone to tell me that someone sent me a Snapchat message or that there's a new feature available in an app so when it comes to notifications if you go to your settings and your notifications tab you'll see that there are a few types of notifications that you can turn on and off for every app there are lock screen notifications, notification center alerts and then banner notifications that pop down at the top of your phone you can also turn off sounds and badges which are those little notifications that appear on the corner of your app with a red number but I feel like the easiest way to turn off notifications is to just toggle the allow notifications button to off. I have all notifications off for almost every app I have and I find that this really helps me keep my space clear if I want to use a specific app I'll open it and keep in mind I turn these notifications on and off at certain times whenever it's necessary so for instance, if I'm waiting for an urgent email from someone I can turn on email notifications for that day or if I'm waiting for a special payment to process, I can turn on my banking notifications but most of the time I just click into these apps on my own time whenever I feel like I want to see what's going on and I just catch up on whatever I've missed. Number four. Let's move on to your camera roll personally I have thousands and thousands of photos in my camera roll at any given time often there are sometimes 30 photos from the same photoshoot and I only really like one but I just have all of them saved on my device a lot of times I have tons of clutter like screenshots things that I needed at one point but i don't need anymore. I'm the kind of person who hoards memes and screenshots of everything I like. Just know that if you have thousands of photos going through your camera roll is going to be quite the task so you can either dedicate a few hours to this all in one day and tackle it all at once or you can split up this task to fill a week but definitely just create a plan for yourself to go through and delete those old photos that you don't need. Also, make sure after you delete the photos that you delete the recently deleted folder to save space on your phone there are tons of apps you can try to help speed up this process there are things like remove master which lets you go through your own camera roll almost like you're on a dating app and swipe left if you want to delete it swipe right if you want to keep it and also gemini photo helps you find photos that look similar it presents them to you and it lets you uncheck the ones that you don't want to keep. It also will help you find those screenshots and photos that are blurry or general duplicates which is a really great way to batch delete. In general when it comes to your cell phone there's going to be loads more that you can do depending on how you typically use your phone. For instance, you might want to look into clearing out old text messages and voicemails which can take up a lot of space. At the end of every day you should make sure to close out all apps that are running in the background make sure you go to the app store at least once a month and update all of your apps so that you're using the latest apps try cleaning up your notes app if you just write down random things like I do throughout the day make sure you clear that out regularly and also be sure you're checking for general updates on your device also if you are a youtube lover and you're one of those people who builds up a massive watch later list on youtube be sure to go in every so often and clear it out to make sure that you actually still want to watch later now we're going to move on to your computer so this will be relevant if you have a desktop computer a laptop or even something like an ipad step one let's start exactly how we started with the phone and just immediately change your desktop background you wanna choose something clean that's going to make you smile I had a photo from my wedding on here that i thought looked nice I experimented with testing out one of the standard desktop backgrounds but I feel like the wedding one just really calls my name and makes me feel calm so I stuck to that you're gonna be seeing this image multiple times a day so try to remember that when choosing tip number two believe it or not I do not have any folders or icons on my desktop my desktop actually has zero items on it at all times the only time you'll see something on my desktop is when I'm in the middle of downloading something and I initially save it there but then I always put it neatly in a folder and my desktop stays clean so you might be asking yourself where are all of my documents everything and I mean my entire digital life is saved on dropbox I've just found dropbox to be the best and most reliable space for storing my files being able to access them at all times and being able to share them and my dropbox is synced to my computer so I can access my files at any time but if my computer were to crash tomorrow nothing would be lost because everything is saved on the internet on dropbox so to access my files I click on the finder button and I navigate to my dropbox folder and then you can see in there all of my folders are neatly organized so there's everything from all of my youtube video content to my partnership content photos and so much more I pay for a dropbox business account I think it's around 12.50 a month for five terabytes of space you can collaborate with up to three users and basically i can choose if i want any individual file to be smart synced to my computer or not which would mean that i can access it off of wi-fi at any time if a file is unsynced it means that it's safe to dropbox on the internet but if I wanted to get it onto my computer I'd have to download it the only time dropbox gives me issues is if I'm having wi-fi issues wherever I'm working but otherwise it's perfect it's the best way for me to not have files cluttered on my computer if you need to have things saved to your desktop at all times i would recommend just creating one folder for everything and then organizing your folders from there inside of that folder that way when you look at your desktop it doesn't look all cluttered but you really do have everything on your desktop I even have a really fun hack when it comes to changing the folder icon so it doesn't even look like a folder you basically just pull a png file onto your computer desktop from the internet and when I say png I mean a file that doesn't have a background so it's just an icon you open that icon in preview select it and do command c to copy it and then you go to the folder on your desktop you right click it and click on get info and when it opens you just tap on the actual folder in the top left and do command v to paste the icon there and then you can move it anywhere on your desktop and when you look at it or when other people look at it it just looks like an icon but it's actually a folder storing your files my next tip is going to be around how you organize your files i'm telling you having neatly organized folders will change your life i'm just going to give you a quick glimpse into my dropbox folders here so you can see that if i click on 2020 youtube all of my youtube content for this year pops up in order by folder and I put a little number before it to designate what month it was in that way it stays in order if I click on a specific videos folder you can see that there are more folders inside where it's all completely organized so each of these folders has more folders that help me organize the footage the audio the adobe premiere project file the youtube video thumbnail and the final video export I cannot emphasize how important structuring your folders is like this for aspiring content creators who maybe want to repurpose their content across multiple platforms so now I can send this folder to any editor in the world and they would have all the assets that they need in order to recut a specific video for me into another platform or to make edits to it and so much more. My next tip for decluttering your computer is if you have a mac or a computer where your icons are visible you might want to remove all icons from the dock that you just don't use all the time some people have their dock on the side I personally like it on the bottom but I find that I definitely do not close out of apps when I'm done using them so they stay on that bar and also sometimes it's good to just remove things from the dock that you don't need at all you can always still find these icons by searching in the search bar but they just don't need to be in your face all day every day better yet if you go into your desktop settings you can automatically hide the dock and only have it appear when you toggle over it or if you want it to be there all the time but you just don't want it to be in your face you can make the icons really small so that they're more inconsequential. Tip five is downloads if you're anything like me you are constantly getting emails where you're downloading photos or videos you're airdropping files to yourself and that downloads folder can actually start to get really large take up a lot of computer storage and just stress you out so every so often i try to remember to go through and delete everything in the downloads folder usually if I need the file I will have saved it in another folder immediately after downloading it so the downloads folder is often just duplicate my next tip is to make sure you look at your computer's applications just like your phone, there are likely tons of applications that you never use so make sure to go in and uninstall or delete apps that are no longer serving you I don't even think I'm going to get into organizing email in this video because that's such a huge topic I honestly think I could make a whole separate video about how I organize my email inbox but one tip I will give you is to immediately unsubscribe to mailing lists that you don't want to be on. For me marketing emails are the most annoying. Somehow my email seems to be on every email list in the universe especially because I was working at a media company my work email was just pulled into like every pr blast in the world so sometimes what I do is I go into my email inbox and I search for the word unsubscribe in my search bar because then it will show me all of the emails that have an unsubscribe option on it and that likely means it's marketing or a newsletter so then I can just click into the companies that I no longer want to get mail from and i can sometimes just unsubscribe right there. Similar to what we did on the phone with removing photos that we don't want you're going to want to go into icloud on your computer and clear out photos you don't want i also find that organizing icloud and organizing your photos into folders is sometimes a little easier on the computer so you might want to do it here a couple of other things make sure you're doing software update regularly and empty your trash bin every week. As I said previously if you're going to be doing this all at once just keep in mind this is a very daunting undertaking this is not going to take you 20 minutes to declutter your digital spaces it's sometimes a full day project or more but the best news is you really only have to do this huge lift one time and then from there on out you just do a little bit each week to keep it all under control there are also software's out there like clean my mac or clean my drive to help you get things under control if you want a little help they help you uninstall things quickly and just generally optimize your space.
