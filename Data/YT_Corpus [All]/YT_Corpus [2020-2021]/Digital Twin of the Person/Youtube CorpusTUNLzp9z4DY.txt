with that please take it away Jay Raj good morning and the good afternoon Thank You Naomi for organizing this session and my apologies for not making it person and the at the MIT campus because of coronavirus constraints travel constraints but thank you again and welcome everyone what I will try to do in this session is basically talk about how to approach industrial IOT programs talk about the technology elements talk about the strategy and design aspects as well as get into a little bit of detail about things to do from a systems thinking perspective let me get into it and start with what are some of the things we should consider when initiating any kind of industrial IOT program in terms of the definition of industrial IOT you can see a plethora of smart connected endpoints coming into operation it is generating high volume high velocity data that you can analyze and get some business impact and business outcomes out of it so typically as technologists most of us who are either in engineering programs or have been in the industry for a while really jump into it start building solutions across any kind of technology ingredient we can lay our hands on ideally a better approach to take is to step back think about what is the underlying business problem that we are trying to solve design it in a very iterative better way of building solution that meets and then uses expectations be it strategy expectations I'll get into a specifics of what kind of strategies are playing out in this space what I put what type of design technologies you can implement and the plethora of technology options we got so operating at the intersection of these three elements which is strategy design and technology is imperative for success what does a step back into the strategy zone mean frankly most of the technology programs where I have been involved in the easiest part seems to be building a technology stack the tougher part is about articulating the use cases understanding the business impact that one can make all of this talk about digital transformation only gets meaningful if it generates certain sort of an ROI or a customer experience enhancement for the end user so most of the strategy elements one should consider in terms of doing an industrial IOT program is the top line changes top line impact can be in terms of creating net new product to service transformation implying you could actually now sell new services you can start to fit monetize net new capabilities that you were not able to do before because now you have a plethora of operational data available to you in terms of the bottom line impact which is where the bulk of the programs gets initiated most of the CFO CXOs want to improve 10 20 30 % efficiencies into their operating environments when you have a better view and visibility on how the equipment or the asset that you have is operating you can definitely figure out ways to improve so that operational efficiency dial helps you with the bottom line impact so financially most of these large-scale programs that are being deployed have made significant efficiency gains for the end-user in terms of the user experience itself if you look at the ways in which the employees the customer the supplier interact with their operating environment there is a significant new way of touching experiencing take the example of a service life cycle in the case of a service lifecycle scenario now your technician who's going to do the maintenance on a particular end point be it a moving asset of some kind be the truck or a or a jet engine for example the ability to to get information ahead of time figure out what parts need to be replaced how these service steps need to be conducted all of that is now helping enhance and find better ways of working so if I take a few example let me kind of talk about operational efficiency use cases if you have I'll give you a few examples one where there's a lot of medical diagnostic equipment scattered in a lot of hospitals around the world and the operator and the owner of these equipment used to be these hospitals but nowadays when a remote services capability has been enabled through industrial IOT so you can actually tunnel in into the equipment you can manage the equipment you have a better view on how the main machine is operating you can predict failures you can send a technician and take corrective before actually unplanned downtime happens you can get some maintenance work done on it those kind of capabilities bottom line impact your efficiencies of operating that environment there's another example where you have large industrial firms operating in in several utilities especially around the distribution and consumption of energy now those pumps if they are exceeding their operating parameters they're vibrating a lot they're consuming a lot more energy those metrics are significant metrics on a timely basis if they are received by the maintenance crew the maintenance technician your operating parameters are completely different you interrupt you take care of problems before they actually happen so those kinds of approaches to improving operational efficiencies has got a long way back let me get a little bit into the design aspects when you look at the way these system our design first of all design is not just about human factors engineering and having a cool-looking UI that makes us interact with the system more efficiently but mean a much more satisfying manner it is also about the design thinking approach it's also about how do you iterate and do discovery let processes how do you interact in a very thought true manner which impacts the human experiences typically technologists tend to modularize build stacks together me being one of them in a very what we call engineered performance optimized the speeds and feeds kind of method if you step back a little bit and look at how is this technology and this use case going to come together and how are these experiences going to be consumed if you have the focus on the human being on the other side of the technology it actually enhances desirability when people like something they they mess with it they use it consumption is more I will give you a very simple example on this let's take the example of connected insurance use case in that case while a ton of feed from the vehicle is being collected and shared to the insurance provider and from the provider to the customer some sort of a gamification engine when it was added to the front end of it enabled parents with the kids who are driving 16 year-olds driving around to enhance and kind of augment and behavior and kind of modulate the behavior of the kids in terms of driving you get more points as you better better ways of interacting with the system so the data collection the exercise of actually monitoring and management of that experience changes significantly in terms of simplification it's very important that complexity of any kind be it at a systemic level or even the sheer way layout on a UI UX is done makes a significant impact in terms of its adoption of the technology if it is simple easy to use people use it more from a technology standpoint this is of course something that I tend to lean on a lot more as a technologist but in the industrial IOT space you have a plethora of technology ingredients that come into the mix you probably have looked at all the three-tiered architecture that was published by the industrial internet consortium you have the HTR the platform here and the enterprise tier very simplistic approach but you have multiple types of edge I mean if you look at three major technology ingredients you have compute network and storage a different combination of these capabilities appear at different tiers so from an HDL all the software that can write a table different capabilities that are compute intensive there is some degree of inference that can be done some degree of training that can be done on the edge some processing can be done up the edge it all depends on what the edge is constituting it can have microcontroller based architectures it can have more complex data center itself can be an edge if you look at today's telco edges enabled at the aggregation points they are nothing but small micro tight data centers in one way in terms of connectivity there's so many options in terms of the changes the dramatic improvement in throughput as well as lower latency that is coming up with 5g it is going to transform the way compute is enabled and the communication capabilities with 5g all in terms of network slicing and and software-defined networks all of these capabilities are enhancing the way the edge connects to the platform here now in terms of the platform clear capabilities you have a plethora of options as well you have the private cloud you have the hybrid cloud you of the public cloud the telco cloud your the edge cloud in all of these cloud-based infrastructures you have now a high volume high velocity data coming through and you can conduct analytics of various kinds criminality x time series analysis you can store you know hot data warm data cold data in different places contextualize them correlate them but at the end of the day what you're trying to do is do some good insights with the data that you're collecting and then operationalize that into some sort of an enterprise system that the service lifecycle management inventory management offer management sales management the cluster of the traditional enterprise applications which are also transforming by the way has more cloud native apps those apps would ingest this high volume data and do something meaningful with it so from from a tearing of these technology elements you have the H tier where you have various degrees of compute network and storage available bulk of the analytics inside application of cloud services on AI ml all of that is happening in the platform tier and then of course on the enterprise tier you have the traditional enterprise apps doing completing the life cycle of the exercise that that data can enable so an end-to-end technology stack is relevant and frankly it is not just provided by one technology company it is a heterogeneous mix of ingredients and get into an ecosystem a little bit later and you can see many people have to come together to make a solution successful before I get into the reference architecture of a stack a long time ago I think it's kind of reminiscence of the time that I spent on campus we had to submit a thesis and it was on user driven product innovation that I had submitted and very simple approach you have to focus on use cases define the use cases use cases can be articulated in one way as the interaction between different stakeholders and the workflow of an handoffs between different stakeholders in the process the reference architecture can be thought of more about building block and how modular systems components can be stitched together and the interfaces between them the types of event and data processing that is happening between them and a stack is nothing but actual hardware and software stack that you stand up most often most often in these industrial IOT programs or any kind of software and systems engineering programs you really don't have a full handle on any one of these three elements they want when you start you pin down put a stake in the ground come up with a use case based on what the end user is expecting work with them create a reference architecture and then stand up a prototype and kind of create an initial iteration of it and then you keep going around in a very fast agile iterative responsive way to stand up the ultimate end point result but this whole traditional ways of working in terms of waterfall methodologies I capture all the requirements pin it all down create an architecture and be done with it and the stack we done with it that approach never works there used to work in a very different world about three decades ago two decades ago when I was programming we used to have complex requirements capture methods but a significant shift in terms of CI CD dev ops methods of developing the agile ways of working and trial ways of developing software and systems has come to bear in this era so typically in all of these programs you would go about doing an assets assessment in terms of pinning down with what you won't be in solution to be you do create a sense of direction and a vision of what you want to build and then others you know transformation from analysis to to be has to have a roadmap for the software and roadmap a systems roadmap and a sense of time on when certain milestones and deliverables will be achieved so and as this assessment a to be plan and the transformation plan has to accompany and then you go into this continuous delivery rapid prototyping method about creating ingredients in examples that can actually meet the expectations of the use case so a very diff anyway of working now in terms of doing this work with customers with partners there's a lot of very interesting ways of going about it I think you can you look at some of the new ways of working with these design shops the workspace the environment the lighthouse the beach house kind of projects or the beach head kind of projects the framing of those programs and projects have evolved quite a bit I think in a very simplistic way the best method that works is where the right stakeholders are involved they are together with you working on building and developing a solution so getting the right stakeholders and iterating and Co innovating together with the customer is the right approach to take this is very different than the traditional ways that we were used to but nowadays agile ways of working produces better results on a faster time to market as well let me kind of step back a little before I get into certain technology stacks and reference architectures I think if you start looking at us from a systems engineering perspective I think in the MIT SDM two of my favorite courses where around systems architecture and there was actually a very interesting course around systems dynamics where you kind of look at dependencies and how things causal linkages between systems you have you have different modules and components within a system and then you have systems that reside within systems so you create design ontology or a hierarchy of systems as a system of systems most systems have interconnects and interplay with its subsystems take let's take an example I think I can explain that it's always a mix of ingredients today if you look at large complex industrial assets that are out in the field you'll definitely find that there's a significant number of vendors or suppliers that contributed components to it if you take the example of an aircraft a Boeing aircraft or an Airbus aircraft your jet engine probably is coming from rolls-royce or Pratt & Whitney or GE your frame and the body of the aircraft like the a380 is coming is built by Airbus but with multiple suppliers contributing subsystems to it so when you look at the efficacy or the operating model of the aircraft itself and its subsystems I think the type of data that is collected it is a classic integration problem and the type of data that you will collect when you're operating the asset would be coming from multiple sources and the idea is that it is basically a system of systems and you have to look at it more holistically and then and then optimize and have these value dials that help you not just optimize at the subsystem level but at an aggregated system of systems level in the case of this aircraft example I was talking about the a350 was the new aircraft I still remember spending a lot of time in Toulouse and the a350 while the engines were coming from GE in some cases if you look at the speeds and feeds and the data that you get out of the jet engines use and if the if the aircraft happens to be flying in a warm climate of the Middle East and and you have wear and tear on the blades of the jet engine now the data about the wear and tear which is the operational data of the jet engine is available to the manufacturer of the jet engines in this case it happens to be GE and they can figure out any unusual issues with the blade and then they can optimize the manufacturing process upstream in their factories to make sure that the next batch of blades are taking corrective action for example now that same data feed which is going to GE as a as a subsystem is probably not integrated has to be but not integrated well with the overall a350 data feeds that are coming in to Airbus so if you look at from from a operator and the service provider standpoint if you have a company like Emirates flying that aircraft they happen to be the user of the aircraft and the operator of it how would they interact with G at the same time interact with Airbus to make sure that the data is all very contextualized and correlated and there is bottom-line better operational condition for the aircraft so it is always beneficial to look at a system from a more holistic standpoint we talked about the HTR the platform tier the enterprise here in a typical stack if you look at the modularity of them you have to start building these things in certain component componentized way abstracted from some of the infrastructure elements so that they can move around be it a you know kubernetes cloth container or a docker container depending on what apps you're moving where and running it you need to have that architecture in a manner of that it is more modular and then you have very well-defined interfaces from a security standpoint from a analytic standpoint from a data handling standpoint from a storage standpoint all of that API set of definitions have to be done properly the third element about keeping it simple I think complexity definitely drives costs it's not just cost it's about things start to unravel at various levels I still remember one of my first programs that I wrote when I was Infosys in the 90s it was a it was a software application called finical a banking software and I had to write the general-purpose report writer module so that it spits out all these massive reports in the bank on a daily basis for total branch automation I still remember the codebase was so complex and did that today it became a significant black box and nobody would go in to try and kind of undo or unwind the noodles or the spaghetti that was inside the box so making sure that the artifacts in both system software in an application-level software that is built it's well documented and is simplistic take I mean simplification actually has many advantages but the same ki SS philosophy applies interoperability I think that is the key in today's generation of technologies you will find a lot of innovators a lot of innovators coming up with technology solutions at various layers of the stack if they are not interoperable and they don't work well with each other then it makes the job of the end user more difficult I think from many many years ago I think if you look at the enterprise applications well the ERP world a lot of challenges were there in terms of making things talk to each other even today if you go to the medical hospital and you look at the ICU and you look at all of these diagnostic machines around the patient the connectors that are connecting one set of machines to the other are very proprietary and are difficult to keep a data flow going between subsystems those have become quite a lot of impediments so the industry itself overall has realized that interoperability is key and a customer satisfaction cannot be achieved if you have very contained constrained systems another example would be lets say any energy efficient plant that is manufacturing an industrial product I let's take Johnson and Johnson or any of these customers they have Schneider equipment for power management they have ABB equipment they have GE equipment now all three of these series of products communicate to their respective industrial iot platform in tasting in terms of ABB it goes to ability platform in terms of eco structure it goes to eco structure it's nidus platform and then you have predates from GE now as a customer if you're running the efficacy of the plant your goal would be to make sure that these systems talk to each other and whenever you're looking at the operational metrics the interoperability between these systems will come to bear in terms of information flow so there's no clearinghouse mechanisms today but as more and more these cloud native systems are coming to play I think people are figuring out ways to exchange information more seamlessly and making it easier for enterprises to get value the next point is about end-user experience and the adoption of technology if we we're to build systems that are not user friendly not easy to use I think if you look at the enterprise system versus the consumer oriented systems the consumer oriented systems get large-scale adoptions because they're very easy to use more friendly compared to the enterprise class systems it is not necessary that enterprise class systems that are most secure more robust need to be more unfriendly to the end-user world so I think a direct correlation is there to use an adoption and if you realize business value and if it's easy to use then the adoption will scale so we have to focus on that in terms of the discovery led iterative I talked about the agile ways of working I think most often when these systems are designed and built it is not necessary that you know the end state before you know day one of starting the project you have a sense of direction you know where you need to get to but at the same time the 10 steps that you need to take to get to that goal it's not something which is very well prescribed and laid out in its magnificent glory and details so you kind of step back and you approve and approach this as a discovery let process you take step at a time and then you kind of build capabilities I think the challenge in the industrial IOT world is because these two things the OT world the operational technology world and the IT world they seem to operate at different velocities I mean systems large industrial systems that have a multi-year long life cycle right in terms of building it deploying it and then maintaining and supporting it the end of life in most cases of large industrial machines that I can still see turbines and large rotor based equipment sitting for years and decades and decades right versus on the IT side the software has a different velocity of execution so bringing the OT IT world together in terms of figuring out the right combination the right blend and actually creating abstraction levels so that if you have an industrial acid which operates at a different frequency and velocity of change and then you have a software module that sits on a separate gateway in front of the device so that you can iterate more frequently those kinds of models have to be put in place let's not forget about people and process I think at the end of the day there is a technician who's gonna do as an example do service lifecycle management do maintenance work on an asset that is now smart connected so making sure that the way all of this operational and maintenance efficiency use cases that have been deployed impact the service technician and how it changes the workflow and the way a technician will service the equipment is very important I think the the people part is something that usually comes as an afterthought but if you start following the design thinking approach you bake in some of the the impact to the workflow of the people involved and the process is involved it results in a better outcome from a lifecycle aspect I think most often standing up stacks designing cool technology solutions is easy but I think operating running and managing that environment is is where a bulk of the cost as well as the adoption of the technology sits so it's very important that you know the designing of the solution has to take into account the operations of the systems if you look at the the various ways of building and the high velocity innovative ideas of building new applications and technologies I think one has to consider how do you maintain it what are the tools for operationalizing it out what is the management and operating environment behind it and and how do you enable that aspect of it so always look at the comprehensive life cycle of a system or a solution so we'll cover these these aspects one more time as a wrapper towards the end after we go through some more specifics so let's get into some specific use cases in my mind asset management is the most popular use case for the very reason that you can get into operational efficacy use cases maintenance efficiency use cases but asset management of anything that is a little bit more valuable than hundred dollars in terms of being smart and connected is one of the most popular use cases that have been deployed in terms of manufacturing manufacturing is going through a radical transformation these days and primarily because of the way mass customization is happening the demand and expectations of the customer and the product that they purchase is also changing so the manufacturing environment there's a lot of application of a little detail on the rammy architecture and industry folder to how it's getting deployed but the manufacturing world is the ripe for transformation in terms of supply chain I think with all this high volume data that is coming together there is a lot of visibility into how things are doing just take the example of Cole chain management in that case you have vaccines getting shipped from the pharmaceutical manufacturers all the way to the consumers in that there is a certain set of environmental parameters that need to be monitored and managed as this product is getting shipped across multi-modal ways of transport you have to you have immense amount of visibility and availability of information so enhancing supply chains doing things better is a very popular use case Fleet Management is one of the early ones that have been adopted it's because you need to put smart connected sensor technology and over cellular or any kind of comms transport layer you can get the data into the cloud figure out where your assets are how they are moving how well they're moving I mean classic use case around uber and many other fleet management solutions are there security and surveillance has to do with mostly image processing video processing solutions because the compute at the end compute and storage at the endpoint which happens to be a camera and also the binary blob kind of storage technologies on the back end on how you retain these images how do you process them how fast you process them take corrective action there's a lot of lot of innovation happening in the video processing domain welker health and safety has to do with any asset intensive businesses you have a technician or a worker in an environment that can be classified hazard is anything to do with biometrics anything to do with geofencing figuring out people don't walk into certain area the multiple sensor technologies can enable a better view and visibility on how the workers do it so very popular in resources industry in the mining sector in the oil and gas sector very advanced series of solutions are there connected care has to do with how care is provided I think if you look at all the widgets that you wear on your body itself you today can collect a kind of data about your health in fact once you collect that how do you contextualize it correlate it if you have a hospital visit in the clinical setting there's a bunch of medical devices that are collecting data about you how do you bring all these piece of information together to give you a dashboard about you as a patient the significant amount of good work being done in that space connected vehicle of course you autonomous vehicle technology simple capabilities around active driver assistance systems they're pretty popular I mean your car is in terms of the amount of capability retail of course there's a lot of customer experience it must have gone to an Amazon go store to pick up groceries without actually and having a completely different set of experience in terms of inventory management in terms of their supply chain management also with a lot of innovation happening in the retail sector retail sector actually has transformed quite a bit over the last few years we expect to see a lot more changes happening there in terms of the infrastructure if you look at airport buildings any kind of infrastructure that has significant energy consumption significant people flowing through it there many sub use cases in terms of how you could optimize that experience I still remember going to a building in in Tokyo which had like 35,000 senses and the high volume high velocity data that it was pumping in was and there was a I D planning model created so that it could actually figure out outliers and issues and then predict failures so that a corrective action can be taken ahead of time now if you look at it in terms of both green buildings energy efficient buildings this the the deployment of this specific smart infrastructure use cases is huge it actually has a big sustainability aspect to it and cities as well as operators are putting that into play and there are many other sub use cases and so in the Q&A period if you have a specific question on a specific use case to do reach out to me let's go a little bit more deeper into the asset management use case now you have just a bunch of examples here in terms of the moving assets moving assets actually bring in a little bit more complexity in terms of how your edge is defined and now there's been a lot of terms used about for computing and the edge itself is pretty wraps abstract is not really the edge because the edge is getting closer ideally the three types of what would you want to do at the edge are collecting data you have a bunch of sensor technologies you have some transducers you convert and you get this high quality data at the edge now if you want to process something and take some decision with it you may need some compute at the edge or you may send it to the cloud provided your latency window is some 200 milliseconds if that is okay if you are trying to do anything in the 30 millisecond kind of range of the loop you or RTT you may want to get it to a telco edge where you have certain compute storage and networking capabilities and you have a mini DC there and then you actually process it there so depending on what is your latency requirements and your throughput requirements it depends on the payload so payload and frequency will determine what you have the edge so in most of these cases if the simple use case is about tracking and tracing the asset you just want to know where your asset is like if it's a big large earth moving equipment and you just want to make sure that it doesn't leave a certain defined area and you also want to see when the engine is started when it's shut down how the engine is performing some basic parameters that you get out of the engine from the from the can Network that processing is reasonably minimal so to do that you may have to create an edge which is not very complex and can communicate with the back-end infrastructure on the platform here in terms of the fixed assets now connectivity is not an issue in that case you may have a traditional MPLS kind of network or you may have more complex more high throughput Wi-Fi environments or any other ways of connecting your asset where the payload doesn't really matter you can collect a lot of data so your edge topology and technologies depends on what type of end point you are talking about in terms of asset management use cases if you if you look at the types of use cases you can deploy the focus as I said earlier the strategy is about has to be about making a material impact for the business so if you're trying to improve operational efficiencies which is either some sort of good ohyeah value or if you were just trying to make sure that the equipment doesn't fail I need to know how it's doing so condition monitoring of it and doing some predictive maintenance that is top of being foremost CXOs is to make sure that your operational environment saves you significant effort and time and your your asset is always up and running so one of the popular use cases around maintenance efficiency and operational efficiency there are definitely more value in terms of energy efficiency the the pump example in terms of the utility sector there is a lot of asset intensive aspects in terms of the production distribution consumption of energy so most of this visibility aspect is key there is a saying what you monitor is what you can manage so the moment you start seeing data and metrics that show you how things are being consumed I think that helps you manage and control in networks in application of these use case I think the only aspect is a little bit more complex is when you talk about command aspects so it's in terms of remote management if it is just monitoring all the feeds and all the data about how things are doing that is one aspect but now if you're taking control and turning some things on or off at the edge or taking some corrective action or operationalizing it then the complete technical architecture around security around framework of operations all of that changes it becomes a little bit more complex monitoring is easier compared to monitoring and command and control these are some of the use cases I think adoption of these use cases is focused on business value that you can return to the customer and so operational efficiency is really top of mind for many cxos you know before before I get over this use case let me also mention one more point is that what what asset management has enabled it's not the traditional asset management but sometimes it has enabled the product or service transformation aspects in a different way I mean unintended consequences suddenly now that you have visibility to all the consumables that are sitting inside this cleaning machine and then you can start forecasting demand on the consumables that will be needed in the next month so I can see many models being built on the customer 360 and the forecasting aspects of business improvement so net new value add we started with operations efficiency use case but slowly drifted into selling more consumables to the customer because you have a better line of sight you are selling them new offerings new business solutions because now you have insight into what you think is going to happen this is a very simplistic in the interest of time and making sure that I don't go too deep into technology I just I'm going to cover at a very high level a reference architecture for asset management so as you have the Aged here you have different management aspects of making sure you're collecting the right data you have an upload download handler technologies so the edge and the capabilities at the edge can vary from very small to very large capabilities ideally the compute storage and networking capabilities are getting very effective in terms of price performance value so more and more of the edge is getting more smarter more the ability to small most or more information let me give you an example if you even have a graphics card on one of the edges small edge nodes you can virtualize it you can start creating multiple VMs with graphics in them and then you can do so simply type of workloads you can do a lot more training of the models if you have ear models and not just do the inference so what you put in the edge and how much money and cost is involved in crafting the edge will also determine what capabilities you have I think the the key aspect is the edge is the entry point and the collection point to all the high-volume data that is coming in that you can generate but eventually you will have to do good analysis on it so stream analytics different types of women processing the logic associated with it that is all sitting in a platform here now you can have it also or componentize it and have it sit in multiple elements Lee log analytics management the security aspect the automation aspects but there are many platforms that like now again you can separate the platforms also as an infrastructure as a service tier of services or you can add the the software as a service tier on top platform as a service if you look at many of these platform as a service capabilities the more you intrinsically start using them you get tethered to one cloud major or in the cloud major so multi cloud is the world that we are living in so the more you start constructing applications and solutions that are end-to-end resident in one platform versus another you lose the ability to do more heterogeneous heterogeneous answers to this solution the enterprise side is reasonably clear it's been existing for a long time I think you can see the number of enterprise solutions have to have to realize the value and the service lifecycle management is a good example of it but most of the ERP systems is where some of the gravity of the business operations is so a simplistic video three tiers more details on many of these use cases are available on the industrial internet consortiums website I'll give you an example these are just services available from AWS and a drawer so the any device concept is true the endpoints can be many but there are very specific services that AWS offers as well as the shore offers that help you collect all this data there is there are agents that you can put on the edge device you can once you get the idea is to get all this data into the cloud where you can run either a short time series insights in terms of Microsoft cloud or if it is AWS IOT analytics in terms of AWS the idea is the multi cloud world is here now if you start using services very complex more modern services available in the cloud world and kind of integrate your app both of the HTR and the platform tier to use these services then you're kind of creating some sort of dependency between the platform offering and the stack that you have built so ideally in a multi cloud world you want to build solutions that can operate across multiple clouds this is just an example so the options are many private cloud public cloud hybrid scenarios each cloud telco cloud so it's the number of offerings and the number of options we have is many that is where the world is headed to is the multi cloud world in terms of the virtualization technologies I just want to do I love this vision that VMware has painted it's an old it's not it's a very well defined old technology element and the strategy the vision has been in play for many years any cloud any application any device I think if you look at as I mentioned earlier you have the private cloud you have the public cloud the edge cloud as well as the telco cloud depending on the latency that you need depending on the throughput that you need and the type of computing network and storage capabilities you have a wide variety of infrastructure options and at the same time with this wide variety of options comes the wide variety of tools that you need to manage and operate these environments in terms of the app again you can build cloud native apps traditional apps again there's old our cake apps as well but these apps can be deployed in any devices and so the the any device to any app to any cloud that approach is real that is where the world is headed to so ideally operating and becoming a master of multi cloud environment is where you would get the most success so if you are getting into technology areas learn and read and become the master of the multi cloud in terms of the data again we talked about high volume high velocity data coming from the edge there is significant amount of work involved I have seen that with many customers where once a remote services platform is put into play and has been built and now you have this spigot from where you have data coming through would you do with it to build models to create the analytics and the insights you have to go through contextualization and correlation of data if its asset data about operational data how do you bring it together to bring it together you have to have some idea that you will have to do your to create these data pipelines all of this is very tedious time-consuming data science work and then you visualize it using car B I or quick side of any of these tools but to do that this I do to kind of enterprise data operations kind of technologies data foundries that are coming together a good example is one of in four words those can help automate and help you design once and deploy everywhere kind of solutions so if you look at it any data any application available to you anytime is also the next mantra in terms of the ecosystem play you need interoperable on-demand kind of solutions so what that means is there is a lot of consortium work or a lot of industry work that needs to happen in terms of making things come together IIC has done a great job dr. soleus also by the way an MIT alumni I won't tell you which part of the 70s he graduated but the IIC reference after sure helps you bring these multiple solutions together same thing is happening with dr. Henning that pine and his team and platform industry further to the ref team also were here in procedure have a c4 IR Center which is trying to do the same thing this will twin is a new consortium around modeling so all of these industry bodies or forums and organizations are trying to get people to work well collaboratively together to create these interoperable systems because as I mentioned earlier there is no one vertically integrated stack it has to be multiple components coming together to make a solution so top of mind for an end user support for multi cloud hybrid infrastructure so basic levels of abstraction automation and cost of course you don't want to go into the cloud and have a significant amount of cost and I've seen many customers getting surprised and getting sticker shock saying I collected all this data in the end of the month you get X amount of dollars to appear so you try to optimize what you collect how you process where you store what type of storage you use so in this entire journey I think the support form of that cloud is very important pervasive security end-to-end very important a single pane of glass in terms of operations very very important because you as you have these multi cloud heterogeneous mix of ingredients you cannot have multiple tools to manage and operate them and also of course you also think about deploy and operate not just the design and build aspects one more time the summary systems of systems keep it modular have very well-defined abstract abstract them have well-defined interfaces interoperability is the key focus on end-user experience and of course people and processes are as important as technology before I get into the Q&A space I want to make sure no me we have enough time for the Q&A I would make one more comment is at the end of the day if you focus on good end user experience and realizing a solid business outcome the top line or bottom line for the customer then these projects can be very successful with that know me the floor is yours thank you and thank you so much for this excellent talk it's been really fascinating one thing I wanted to mention really briefly first of all if any of our viewers have questions again you can enter them on the right side of the YouTube window to the right of the video I did want to mention you spoke quite a bit about agility we did actually have steven epp enger' who's a professor at MIT Sloan and one of the faculty co directors of the SDM program he delivered a webinar last year called ten agile ideas worth sharing which is about how people can apply agile principles in any industry so if any of our viewers found that interesting I recommend they check that out I also it looks like we already have a question so let's start with that from Mercedes Delgado asking what type of occupational skills are needed for scaling up IOT services so occupational skills is if you are so so the people side if you look at everything is trying to solve a business problem so if it has to do with service lifecycle management if you are an Operations guru if you want to understand you know kind of approaches statistical and overall kind of approaches that kind of skill set is very valuable from a business standpoint from a technology standpoint of course you know compute Network serration the entire multi-cloud kind of technologies are very relevant you can apply them in terms of an IT and an engineer trying to solve and build reference architecture in the stack so both from a computer science expertise in terms of building out the solution set is valuable but you know the interesting part is it also brings in a lot of knowledge of the physics and the OT which is not something that we think about too much saying oh teaser is a is a computer technology kind of oriented learning but if you look at the OT skills the skills about the physics the domain knowledge it's if it's about an industry last set you have to maintain it the algorithm is not something that happens by magic and somebody programs in a computer I mean there is there is domain knowledge there is physics that needs to be incorporated into it so that knowledge is also very valuable so broad set of capabilities if you if you want to make and transformative impact this is not constraining you don't have to be a computer engineer you don't have to be mechanical engineer you don't have to if you hope you if you have those skills you can play an effective role in any one of these areas at the same time there's also people transformation process so if you can help transform an organization on how people work and how they apply their skills that is also very useful great we have another question from Bengali ofor who says I work for an industrial manufacturer we're interested in connecting directly to shop full shop floor equipment via PLC etc what method would you recommend so in terms of the plc scada world of yesterday I don't think there is any kind of challenge because there are many protocol conversion methods available if you have a lot let's take an automation plant and if you have a lot of machines that have to be now connected multiple adapters and converters are available to enable this integration so it depends on the types of machines though but that is not a significant problem protocol conversion is commonplace at the edge from OPC UA to qtt you can do from a software standpoint you can do anything that you want conversion it's mostly about if there are physical interconnects that need to be converted there is a certain set of specs that are out there if you visit industrial internet consortium and look at some of the smart manufacturing solutions and factory automation solutions you can see some of them it's in the testbed section of the IIC hopefully that answers your question thanks for that answer I had a question while I was listening to the lecture you talked quite a bit about interoperability and the importance of having various technologies that can interface well because every single connection point can be a place where things get more complicated but I was curious about the tension between that need for interoperability and the need for privacy and security of information so for instance you talked about connected care in the healthcare industry and the importance in tension with that of patient privacy do you have any thoughts about that or any experiences that relate to that yeah absolutely I'm in fact and I'm demising information is reasonably easy but the what what here so especially in healthcare I mean there are many regulatory people kind of regulations that prevent access to private information and it is well organized I mean the only people who have the right and to see that information can see it so an animai zation is one way but in terms of some of these hazard management scenarios that we've deployed in many hospitals those are anyway encrypted containers the the information itself the payload is not something that reveals the privacy aspects it's more about the asset information it's not about the patient but whenever you contextualize and correlate all these piece of information in the cloud and you have usernames and all that there are certain control mechanisms in place by most hospitals to make sure private information doesn't go public so you you can analyze it at the same time your storage your processing and who has access this whole authorization and access approaches itself takes on a different level and meaning it is not the same as monitoring how an industrial machine is working patient information is private and there are many ways of protecting it in terms of security of course there are many methods that are applied in terms of how information is stored and processed how people can gain access to it and they are varying levels of it that people have deployed depending on the use case it's a broad topic or day long conversation we can have on security even privacy of course on healthcare is paramount and people have been cognizant from day one thank you so much I think we have just about hit time so once again thank you Jai Rajesh for your wonderful lecture it looks like you do have your email address up in that last slide if people would like to contact you with further questions and thanks to all of our viewers online for attending the webinar the presentation recording will be available permanently on YouTube after this session and we welcome everybody to join us in April for our next webinar with douglas haig the executive director of the school of data science at the University of North Carolina Charlotte thanks man have a good spring break guys thank you very much yes thank you on behalf of
