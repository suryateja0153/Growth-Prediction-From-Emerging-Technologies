 Good morning Good afternoon for me yeah welcome to this session. I assume I can Good morning Good afternoon for me yeah start. it's ok. Good afternoon Ohh good welcome to this session. I assume I can morning. Welcome to this session about start. it's ok. Good afternoon Ohh good ContextCapture so we cannot do an morning. Welcome to this session about hour webinar about reality modeling in ContextCapture so we cannot do an simple processing and how you can use hour webinar about reality modeling in the data and I will share some existing simple processing and how you can use examples so first of all I want to start the data and I will share some existing with we have Bentley and we have a lot examples so first of all I want to start of software I'm gonna go in all the with we have Bentley and we have a lot details but we have something like a of software I'm gonna go in all the 'PlayBook' where you can see for example details but we have something like a with the mining what software we suggest to 'PlayBook' where you can see for example use 'Wastewater', 'Cities', 'City modeling' with the mining what software we suggest to 'Building', 'Plants', 'Offshore' and you see use 'Wastewater', 'Cities', 'City modeling' that in a lot of these ahhhh this 'Building', 'Plants', 'Offshore' and you see 'PlayBook' ContextsCapture Reality that in a lot of these ahhhh this modeling' can be used some of them are 'PlayBook' ContextsCapture Reality really obvious of course I am mining and modeling' can be used some of them are in for example for buildings but also really obvious of course I am mining and some of them are not so obvious so what in for example for buildings but also I want to go through this session I also some of them are not so obvious so what show some examples how other users are I want to go through this session I also using their reality modeling context show some examples how other users are capture so I first I want to start watch using their reality modeling context reality modeling gonna show some capture so I first I want to start watch examples just I cut some models from reality modeling gonna show some users and how to acquire the data that's examples just I cut some models from really important one is capture and users and how to acquire the data that's acquire the data really important one is capture and what's the workflow and what type of acquire the data outputs we can have so what is reality what's the workflow and what type of modeling reality modeling is internal outputs we can have so what is reality adji we where we can use to really modeling reality modeling is internal quickly produce a 3d model from for adji we where we can use to really example for using digital thin and quickly produce a 3d model from for there's normally example for using digital thin and capturing photos or point clouds or a there's normally combination of them and even of video capturing photos or point clouds or a and a little bit to give you an idea combination of them and even of video what what we can use for capturing data and a little bit to give you an idea you have devices a drone of course what what we can use for capturing data different type of drones fixed-wing you have devices a drone of course rotor drones handheld cameras mobile different type of drones fixed-wing scanners handheld scanners for indoor rotor drones handheld cameras mobile for example to Jerusalem no more cameras scanners handheld scanners for indoor on the phone till like a special drone for example to Jerusalem no more cameras cameras on also data from a plane so an on the phone till like a special drone example here what you can do you can do cameras on also data from a plane so an monuments statues walk around with a example here what you can do you can do certain pattern and we're gonna go a monuments statues walk around with a little bit more in detail later how you certain pattern and we're gonna go a capture data so that's one of the main little bit more in detail later how you important things that the data capture capture data so that's one of the main is really important to create kind of important things that the data capture output you want so you can imagine if is really important to create kind of you have another high-resolution camera output you want so you can imagine if and keep quite far away you get a you have another high-resolution camera completely different result if you have and keep quite far away you get a a higher resolution come comes my way completely different result if you have closer to the object of course we can do a higher resolution come comes my way things from a drone different pattern so closer to the object of course we can do what I said before things from a drone different pattern so that the cheaper Mavic Pro for example what I said before drones still the higher the high-end that the cheaper Mavic Pro for example drones with hundred or sixty megapixel drones still the higher the high-end cameras and also for my plane so we are drones with hundred or sixty megapixel late gonna show some models that the cameras and also for my plane so we are users are captured with by using a plane late gonna show some models that the they fly certain pattern in averages users are captured with by using a plane that in special cameras and get special they fly certain pattern in averages models really high big areas of city that in special cameras and get special modeling and models really high big areas of city where users can use it for in the modeling and infrastructure side what we have from where users can use it for in the Bentley of course infrastructure infrastructure side what we have from software you can further design so you Bentley of course infrastructure can quickly capture what you already software you can further design so you have and put your design in there so you can quickly capture what you already can avoid all kind of mistakes what can have and put your design in there so you happen risk management so you can put can avoid all kind of mistakes what can your design in there and see if it fits happen risk management so you can put and how it looks like but we also do your design in there and see if it fits during the construction phase we can do and how it looks like but we also do change detection so we have uses for during the construction phase we can do capturing they doing this kind of stuff change detection so we have uses for bridges or a large infrastructure capturing they doing this kind of stuff objects or plant sites during the bridges or a large infrastructure reconstruction they capture data alike objects or plant sites during the every week or every month depends on the reconstruction they capture data alike frequency you want to have and so you every week or every month depends on the can then overlay your design you can see frequency you want to have and so you if during the construction phase there can then overlay your design you can see are changes on also for payment so if if during the construction phase there you have contractors will get paid on are changes on also for payment so if the part of the job when they finish you you have contractors will get paid on can also monitor all that and also do the part of the job when they finish you because you build up an history of the can also monitor all that and also do project you can define their changes and because you build up an history of the also volume calculations this during project you can define their changes and construction phase and then we of course also volume calculations this during in operation phase you can do asset construction phase and then we of course management inspections through further in operation phase you can do asset inspections on it so if you use for management inspections through further example real side or cell towers you inspections on it so if you use for don't have to climb up or go in there in example real side or cell towers you the corridor you can do it with an drone don't have to climb up or go in there in on on distance and then you can do the corridor you can do it with an drone inspections in for training simulations on on distance and then you can do so there's a little bit in the inspections in for training simulations infrastructure side and later we're so there's a little bit in the gonna show you some other examples how infrastructure side and later we're other users are using it when I said our gonna show you some other examples how solution is contacts capture but we have other users are using it when I said our a whole portfolio of software around it solution is contacts capture but we have so we call a reality modeling portfolio a whole portfolio of software around it so the beginning is within a context so we call a reality modeling portfolio capture mobile apps so we have it on the so the beginning is within a context phone so you can capture on the phone capture mobile apps so we have it on the small objects upload it we process it phone so you can capture on the phone for you and get a model back there is an small objects upload it we process it processing service in the cloud for for you and get a model back there is an processing itself we have contacts processing service in the cloud for capture that is the the basic version processing itself we have contacts and the contacts capture center is the capture that is the the basic version same version but you can handle larger and the contacts capture center is the data set and you can build up a cluster same version but you can handle larger far more processing farm and then we data set and you can build up a cluster have also on cloud processing service far more processing farm and then we where you basically have a cloud app on have also on cloud processing service your desktop you import images and you where you basically have a cloud app on upload to the cloud and we do everything your desktop you import images and you for you and you get a model back then we upload to the cloud and we do everything have tools for working with the data so for you and you get a model back then we editing context capture editor is in have tools for working with the data so desktop application MicroStation base editing context capture editor is in image the card point tools is for desktop application MicroStation base working with point clouds and then image the card point tools is for recently we acquiring company company working with point clouds and then and Belgium orbits they have a really recently we acquiring company company nice feature extraction we can work with and Belgium orbits they have a really point clouds for extraction of the the nice feature extraction we can work with features mainly point clouds and then we point clouds for extraction of the the have options for storing and managing features mainly point clouds and then we sharing a context rapture project wise have options for storing and managing sorry context share is an platform cloud sharing a context rapture project wise platform for sharing data and we have sorry context share is an platform cloud opacity planner and then at the end we platform for sharing data and we have have our workflows for Rose design for opacity planner and then at the end we example construction open building have our workflows for Rose design for designer and so there are just all the example construction open building other applications we have but the main designer and so there are just all the thing is context capture of course and other applications we have but the main I'm gonna go more in detail later when thing is context capture of course and we start processing a small data set now I'm gonna go more in detail later when show you some real-world examples so we start processing a small data set now here's example what what how users show you some real-world examples so worldwide and mainly because I mean here's example what what how users based in Australia in Australia and New worldwide and mainly because I mean Zealand how to use the data what I'm based in Australia in Australia and New gonna do is I'm gonna show everything in Zealand how to use the data what I'm an application as context capture viewer gonna do is I'm gonna show everything in so there's a free application is a free an application as context capture viewer viewer and what you can do you can so there's a free application is a free download it from the Bentley that come viewer and what you can do you can /i where you can download it and use it download it from the Bentley that come as a free application code also comes if /i where you can download it and use it you install context steps it comes with as a free application code also comes if it so I'm gonna go out of my you install context steps it comes with presentation and I go back to my viewer it so I'm gonna go out of my so the context capture viewer itself so presentation and I go back to my viewer this is a view where you can not only so the context capture viewer itself so open meshes but also other formats not this is a view where you can not only only the context capture output but also open meshes but also other formats not obj FBX files and what we can do in this only the context capture output but also fewer we can do measurements so we can obj FBX files and what we can do in this do coordinate so if you know the fewer we can do measurements so we can coordinate system and this is in do coordinate so if you know the Australia so I can set UTM zone I can coordinate system and this is in select the coordinates I can do distance Australia so I can set UTM zone I can so if I know Sedona objects I can do select the coordinates I can do distance measure distances and also I can do so if I know Sedona objects I can do services so if I want to know how big measure distances and also I can do this is I can do something like this and services so if I want to know how big we can do volumes and this I don't have this is I can do something like this and the best example here I guess but if you we can do volumes and this I don't have want to do volume you can set a plane the best example here I guess but if you and you can do something like this so I know the volume of these objects of this and you can do something like this so I tower to this to this plane and you can know the volume of these objects of this also set in custom plane if you want to tower to this to this plane and you can say certain let's say I want to do 50 also set in custom plane if you want to meters it gets as a plane fit so this is say certain let's say I want to do 50 of course we have also applications meters it gets as a plane fit so this is where we can really do comparing volumes of course we have also applications with each other where we can really do comparing volumes but there's more desktop application with each other you you can already do quite a lot and but there's more desktop application also what you can do is in here changing you you can already do quite a lot and displaced aus so if I so I this is my also what you can do is in here changing full model I can put it in wireframe displaced aus so if I so I this is my within W texture in T so I can do with full model I can put it in wireframe the shortcuts so basically if I go to my within W texture in T so I can do with mesh so this is what we captured so this the shortcuts so basically if I go to my is an Matic pro - so this isn't a really mesh so this is what we captured so this small drone an entry-level drone and is an Matic pro - so this isn't a really this is the result of the data so this small drone an entry-level drone and is a University and this is basically this is the result of the data so this the first flight out of this user so we is a University and this is basically captured something like this so this is the first flight out of this user so we all about which person you captured with captured something like this so this is an overlap distance to the object and all about which person you captured with what camera you're using so you're an overlap distance to the object and concentrating you see there are some what camera you're using so you're issues of course ID that we didn't concentrating you see there are some capture everything but in general he issues of course ID that we didn't went quite low you can see over here but capture everything but in general he yeah things like this for example if you went quite low you can see over here but see holes in here this because you don't yeah things like this for example if you capture data so it's important that you see holes in here this because you don't capture the right data is you can only capture data so it's important that you model what you see and that's sometimes capture the right data is you can only where users are keep forgetting that if model what you see and that's sometimes you get holes for example this because where users are keep forgetting that if you can't see and the same for example you get holes for example this because yeah later we're gonna go in a little you can't see and the same for example bit about the challenges of working with yeah later we're gonna go in a little photogrammetry example glass is an issue bit about the challenges of working with you see here and the issues of the glass photogrammetry example glass is an issue so this isn't 20 megapixel camera couple you see here and the issues of the glass hundred images I think was two or three so this isn't 20 megapixel camera couple bath real-life softened wrong get hundred images I think was two or three something like this let me close this bath real-life softened wrong get one and I go to some other types of something like this let me close this datasets so this wasn't a cheaper one and I go to some other types of entry-level drone if this is more than a datasets so this wasn't a cheaper forty to make a pixel camera so this is entry-level drone if this is more than a an government forty to make a pixel camera so this is agency in near Sydney missable so they an government this is an easel they do break detection agency in near Sydney missable so they so they break replacement so what I need this is an easel they do break detection to do they did really in an hi accurate so they break replacement so what I need model where they can do inspections of to do they did really in an hi accurate sites on bricks needs replacement and model where they can do inspections of also for the scaling is really important sites on bricks needs replacement and so they use one forty two megapixel also for the scaling is really important camera and yeah they do a really good so they use one forty two megapixel capture so you see here a little bit for camera and yeah they do a really good what they even underneath what they capture so you see here a little bit for capture and you can do inspection then what they even underneath what they even replace and rocks break you can capture and you can do inspection then already measure in here and prepare it even replace and rocks break you can before you go on site so they you are already measure in here and prepare it using a lot of ground control points to before you go on site so they you are really reference and scaling it's really using a lot of ground control points to perfect so this is like foam and cheap really reference and scaling it's really drone tone high-end drone for everything perfect so this is like foam and cheap is possible as long as you I just you drone tone high-end drone for everything capture the Nick and and the cameras you is possible as long as you I just you can use you can also doing stuff with capture the Nick and and the cameras you and just with a handheld camera so for can use you can also doing stuff with example this is an object we just walked and just with a handheld camera so for around with a handheld camera and example this is an object we just walked shooting this isn't raining towel from around with a handheld camera and the Fire Rescue Department we just shooting this isn't raining towel from walked around and you shoot just images the Fire Rescue Department we just with a handheld camera so there's no walked around and you shoot just images drone so you see and big hole in a model with a handheld camera so there's no year this is near the airport so we drone so you see and big hole in a model can't fly within drones here so and year this is near the airport so we there are different techniques to do can't fly within drones here so and handheld stuff but yeah this is a nice there are different techniques to do example so this is a little bit on the handheld stuff but yeah this is a nice buildings we can do bridges so for example so this is a little bit on the example check which one this is also buildings we can do bridges so for automatic proto so the user on bridge example check which one this is also and we capture yeah for inspection automatic proto so the user on bridge purposes and we capture yeah for inspection so it's loading so you get something so he wants to inspect parts of the so it's loading so you get something so breaking also part under the bridge she he wants to inspect parts of the so yeah quite good model I guess for just a medic pro lat so breaches and so yeah quite good model I guess for then is a special way of caption later just a medic pro lat so breaches and when we go in and the CAPTCHA technique then is a special way of caption later we're gonna explain a little bit how when we go in and the CAPTCHA technique difficult basically capturing breaches we're gonna explain a little bit how is but yeah this is quite good model difficult basically capturing breaches came out really well cell towers so is but yeah this is quite good model there's something that a lot of users came out really well cell towers so are using it for so this is a simple there's something that a lot of users example this is with a phantom 4 and are using it for so this is a simple again this isn't different capture example this is with a phantom 4 and technique again so doing cell towers is again this isn't different capture quite challenging because we have a lot technique again so doing cell towers is of tiny shiny objects here but you see quite challenging because we have a lot within phantom with a special capture of tiny shiny objects here but you see technique we can get the results like within phantom with a special capture this so things like this for inspection technique we can get the results like bird nest rust detection is this and the this so things like this for inspection big advantage is that they don't have to bird nest rust detection is this and the shut down the tower nobody has to climb big advantage is that they don't have to up so get something like this shut down the tower nobody has to climb tell cell towers but we also doing towers like this and this is much tell cell towers but we also doing because these are they are guided towers like this and this is much there's a lot of lines here so you can't because these are they are guided fly as like I feel like so yes I just there's a lot of lines here so you can't shall capture technique we can't get fly as like I feel like so yes I just something like this so shall capture technique we can't get some of the examples are you uses in something like this so this industry I using it but we can also some of the examples are you uses in do a whole cities so for example this is this industry I using it but we can also all this isn't helicopter model you see do a whole cities so for example this is this is an model user just sit in a all this isn't helicopter model you see helicopter hangs out of the window and this is an model user just sit in a shoot within I think it is and this one helicopter hangs out of the window and is done with thirty five megapixel shoot within I think it is and this one camera so you get an reasonable good is done with thirty five megapixel quality they can do better now they know camera so you get an reasonable good there nowadays they using a 80 megapixel quality they can do better now they know cameras and I'm adding a little bit more there nowadays they using a 80 megapixel overlap than here but yeah reasonable so cameras and I'm adding a little bit more this is a cleaned-up model so the overlap than here but yeah reasonable so original model has a lot of cars in here this is a cleaned-up model so the and other objects this is all cleaned so original model has a lot of cars in here if this is the Adelaide Hospital so you and other objects this is all cleaned so see the quality what they get from the if this is the Adelaide Hospital so you helicopter something like this see the quality what they get from the so there that they use in helicopter mainly in so there Australia is because they get easy that they use in helicopter mainly in access to flying so drones can be an Australia is because they get easy issue especially if it's out of sight access to flying so drones can be an and that's why they using for example issue especially if it's out of sight helicopters if you want to can fly and that's why they using for example within drones you can have things like helicopters if you want to can fly with a camera so this is an multi-camera within drones you can have things like system so this is five cameras on and with a camera so this is an multi-camera drone so when they fly they system so this is five cameras on and automatically should also not only drone so when they fly they straight down but left right forward automatically should also not only backward and where you can get something straight down but left right forward like this so this is five 24 megapixel backward and where you can get something cameras and they're flying around like this so this is five 24 megapixel hundred metres high and yeah if you cameras and they're flying around don't see the results the big advantage hundred metres high and yeah if you of using camera rigs in the four city don't see the results the big advantage modeling is that you don't have issues of using camera rigs in the four city with colors with shading if you do fly modeling is that you don't have issues with a normal drone you fly up and down with colors with shading if you do fly on different angles gonna take you hours with a normal drone you fly up and down to captured it and then yeah you can on different angles gonna take you hours have low issues with shading but this is to captured it and then yeah you can an model in China that I get from one of have low issues with shading but this is our partners he gives this dataset and I an model in China that I get from one of look reasonable okay I guess so this is our partners he gives this dataset and I an normal drone DJI m600 I think button look reasonable okay I guess so this is with the camera kinda needed so yeah to an normal drone DJI m600 I think button give you idea I think the processing on with the camera kinda needed so yeah to my laptop was like three days to day two give you idea I think the processing on and a half days processing so the cost my laptop was like three days to day two reasonable quick I got more of these and a half days processing so the cost examples but for example and it's all reasonable quick I got more of these about what quality are you after so this examples but for example and it's all is we worked on projects with the user about what quality are you after so this here in Oman but they fly much higher is we worked on projects with the user and they have a fixed-wing drone for the here in Oman but they fly much higher cover way larger areas but they're and they have a fixed-wing drone for the flying around 380 meters 400 meters high cover way larger areas but they're and with a fixed-wing drone so they fly flying around 380 meters 400 meters high faster so that's why they had otherwise and with a fixed-wing drone so they fly camera can't keep up with the speed so faster so that's why they had otherwise it's it's also reasonable okay I guess camera can't keep up with the speed so considering they're flying so high so it's it's also reasonable okay I guess everybody wants the other quality of the considering they're flying so high so model but yeah considering time caption everybody wants the other quality of the and you know it's also just more model but yeah considering time caption expensive because if you process longer and you know it's also just more it's more data to capture yeah so this expensive because if you process longer is something like this so this is City it's more data to capture yeah so this modeling just from drone if you go here is something like this so this is City this is a user in Australia and they fly modeling just from drone if you go here a models in Australia but also in in the this is a user in Australia and they fly US so I'll let me pick up New York so a models in Australia but also in in the this is number and plane so they fly US so I'll let me pick up New York so 8,000 feet high in a fuckin special this is number and plane so they fly sweeping camera the own camera so this 8,000 feet high in a fuckin special is New York the proof that I'm in New sweeping camera the own camera so this York I can go here New York and they is New York the proof that I'm in New because they fly really high they can do York I can go here New York and they I think they capture and process 1000 because they fly really high they can do square kilometer per day so you can't I think they capture and process 1000 and the quality the model is yeah it's square kilometer per day so you can't okay but you can't compare it to and and the quality the model is yeah it's role model so that's important to okay but you can't compare it to and understand that basically everything is role model so that's important to possible as long as you put the time and understand that basically everything is effort in it and it's yeah probably the possible as long as you put the time and use case for this type of models is not effort in it and it's yeah probably the inspection so you don't need to go yeah use case for this type of models is not on the centimeter level and of course we inspection so you don't need to go yeah can merge data set so we can fly with a on the centimeter level and of course we plane come back with an drone get a more can merge data set so we can fly with a detail and even with a handheld camera plane come back with an drone get a more and then merge the data sets together so detail and even with a handheld camera you get something like this but this is and then merge the data sets together so yeah this is plane one of the big use you get something like this but this is case of course is mining so it not only yeah this is plane one of the big use for doing volume stockpile volumes but case of course is mining so it not only also for inspections for example when for doing volume stockpile volumes but they have accidents right model year so also for inspections for example when this is an example from in Australia was they have accidents right model year so something happening here with a rock this is an example from in Australia was hanging down where they doing stuff like something happening here with a rock this so then with other software from hanging down where they doing stuff like whenever plexus or so vision they can this so then with other software from calculate angles of objects and see how whenever plexus or so vision they can stable with this and in this case calculate angles of objects and see how something happens so they capture a stable with this and in this case model and start recalculating it to something happens so they capture a avoid that it happens also another path model and start recalculating it to of their off the mine and something like avoid that it happens also another path this this one that you take over stuff of their off the mine and something like and of course we can do we do this for this this one that you take over stuff volumetrics also an overlay mine design and of course we can do we do this for for example on your my model but let's volumetrics also an overlay mine design see this for example on your my model but let's but we can also just this is like drawn see this datasets and a plain dataset we can also but we can also just this is like drawn do with the end up camera so this for datasets and a plain dataset we can also example with the iPhone what I did so if do with the end up camera so this for I go to this model this is just with a example with the iPhone what I did so if bit of phone 50 of 60 images where you I go to this model this is just with a can great models like this the reason bit of phone 50 of 60 images where you that is really good because you the can great models like this the reason distance to the object is really like that is really good because you the maybe 2 meters or something like they're distance to the object is really like really close and you get an higher maybe 2 meters or something like they're resolution model even from things like a really close and you get an higher phone so you don't have to have always resolution model even from things like a high equipment of course that is phone so you don't have to have always sometimes better you can do stuff like high equipment of course that is this if I sometimes better you can do stuff like let me check so another industry but we this if I see a lot of usage for this reality let me check so another industry but we modeling is on industry on plant sites see a lot of usage for this reality what users doing yeah more for the asset modeling is on industry on plant sites inspection and click build up a map of what users doing yeah more for the asset your plant site so this is for example inspection and click build up a map of on something this is a plant site in your plant site so this is for example Australia rhenium plant what we used on something this is a plant site in drone data set so this is the wrong cap Australia rhenium plant what we used so if I go here this is all from the drone data set so this is the wrong cap drone so in most cases this is this so if I go here this is all from the quality is good enough but in some cases drone so in most cases this is this he wants to see billable Digital twin so quality is good enough but in some cases this is I think three days driving with he wants to see billable Digital twin so an truck from Adelaide so what they want this is I think three days driving with to do if you go on site they want to an truck from Adelaide so what they want bring the right equipment if there are to do if you go on site they want to issues so what they want to do they want bring the right equipment if there are to in the office zoom in and something issues so what they want to do they want like this on the pump and see more to in the office zoom in and something details so see this number so this is a like this on the pump and see more combination of an drone data set with a details so see this number so this is a handheld data set so where took end up combination of an drone data set with a camera we should image it around here handheld data set so where took end up you merge the data sets together and camera we should image it around here start processing so you get something you merge the data sets together and like yeah where you can read these start processing so you get something numbers there's a little bit difficult like yeah where you can read these so this is something what we see more numbers there's a little bit difficult and more users are doing in this in oil so this is something what we see more oil and gas areas yeah it's quite common and more users are doing in this in oil that users are studying this this type oil and gas areas yeah it's quite common of models show one hotter one so this is that users are studying this this type normal plant site where we use something like this or a user I capture this normal plant site where we use something forty-two megapixel camera just hand out like this or a user I capture this camera just walking around shooting in forty-two megapixel camera just hand out certain order certain angles and you can camera just walking around shooting in get something like this one of the certain order certain angles and you can things they do this for because they get something like this one of the write down a lot of with all the pipes things they do this for because they and that's something they like for write down a lot of with all the pipes example point to our scanner doesn't and that's something they like for pick up this is writing so they do this example point to our scanner doesn't with this kind of handheld cameras and pick up this is writing so they do this another example this one isn't 61 with this kind of handheld cameras and megapixel camera you can do this with another example this one isn't 61 lower cameras but lower resolution but megapixel camera you can do this with the advantages you see so much data that lower cameras but lower resolution but if you walk around one time you can the advantages you see so much data that probably capture everything instead of if you walk around one time you can doing a lot of images well it's my good probably capture everything instead of data set so this is something like this doing a lot of images well it's my good and any GPS on the image is quite important and that you do of course and good geo any GPS on the image is quite important referencing so you need control points that you do of course and good geo over this area to georeference to model referencing so you need control points to these coordinates tada geo reference over this area to georeference to model model and other what this model is not to these coordinates tada geo reference even skills it's just captured and model and other what this model is not that's it yeah this is some use cases even skills it's just captured and from the plant side another big user for that's it yeah this is some use cases mass is the police so where they use from the plant side another big user for contacts captcha voice for example for mass is the police so where they use Christine's so if there is an accident contacts captcha voice for example for they fly with a drone for example this Christine's so if there is an accident isn't a fake this is training the pilots they fly with a drone for example this so you get something like this we kept isn't a fake this is training the pilots here so you get something like this we kept I don't know was one less than one here battery life and you get something like I don't know was one less than one this and because we use the GPS of the battery life and you get something like drone its model is really skilled well this and because we use the GPS of the and also geo-reference correctly so one drone its model is really skilled well of the things that we're gonna discuss and also geo-reference correctly so one in a minute is the captcha technique so of the things that we're gonna discuss one of the issues we have it capture is in a minute is the captcha technique so opx who are moving so if an object is in one of the issues we have it capture is capturing three images the net will be opx who are moving so if an object is in modeled so you see here the two drone capturing three images the net will be pilots standing here and they are not modeled so you see here the two drone moving right so they are looking at the pilots standing here and they are not device this model's really reasonable moving right so they are looking at the okay but then you see the supervisor is device this model's really reasonable moving and me and I'm walking up and okay but then you see the supervisor is down and my colleague with the red moving and me and I'm walking up and trousers is standing here because we're down and my colleague with the red not in we are moving too much we're not trousers is standing here because we're in the model at all so there are things not in we are moving too much we're not that we can remove from the model if you in the model at all so there are things really want that you can do a little bit that we can remove from the model if you before we start processing and also really want that you can do a little bit after the processing another thing is before we start processing and also when we captured this car we have this after the processing another thing is to cast when we captured this car we have this we shoot a lot of images a little bit to cast lower under an angle so we're shooting we shoot a lot of images a little bit like this and even some of them if you lower under an angle so we're shooting see how low it is something like this like this and even some of them if you but and we did one big fly it's really see how low it is something like this high on the top so this card is captured but and we did one big fly it's really from this side so this looks okay you high on the top so this card is captured see here from this side so this looks okay you reasonable okay but the other side of see here the car this side is only captured from reasonable okay but the other side of the top and then you see something like the car this side is only captured from this so it's all about which capture the top and then you see something like technique is using and and what your this so it's all about which capture focus areas is we did in this case we technique is using and and what your didn't really care about this guy's more focus areas is we did in this case we these two casts yeah so the priest is didn't really care about this guy's more using it also for forensics for other these two casts yeah so the priest is crime scenes and counterterrorism and using it also for forensics for other that kind of stuff that's something I crime scenes and counterterrorism and can't show of course and another use that kind of stuff that's something I case is for real uses so we have a lot can't show of course and another use of real users are using this so one of case is for real uses so we have a lot the things is for real crossings remover of real users are using this so one of so this is an are not safe crossing so the things is for real crossings remover they are removing this kind of objects so this is an are not safe crossing so kept shifts adding with a phantom 4 and this uses is shooting down but also a kept shifts adding with a phantom 4 and little bit under an angle so you seeing this uses is shooting down but also a a model like this it's all about if you little bit under an angle so you seeing are allowed to fly on top of the real so a model like this it's all about if you this is the real who's a user their own are allowed to fly on top of the real so out of the real and so they can if there this is the real who's a user their own is no train they can fly on top of it so out of the real and so they can if there you can get something like this is no train they can fly on top of it so [Music] you can get something like this reasonable good quality but if you're [Music] not allowed to fly on top of the rail reasonable good quality but if you're so this is for example for on not allowed to fly on top of the rail construction so this is for example for on we have to check which one is this one I construction think so this or this case we're not we have to check which one is this one I allowed to fly on top of the rail so we think so this or this case we're not have to adjust the captcha technique and allowed to fly on top of the rail so we yeah you get a little bit different type have to adjust the captcha technique and of quality but yeah it's it's still yeah you get a little bit different type sufficient enough for a new design for of quality but yeah it's it's still real crossing removing take the time so sufficient enough for a new design for this is a little bit examples that are real crossing removing take the time so on the show and we can also process and this is a little bit examples that are there's an important also point cloud on the show and we can also process and that's I almost forgot to show with the there's an important also point cloud sometimes we do it for geometry you can that's I almost forgot to show with the have issues for example inside so this sometimes we do it for geometry you can is a storage room what I did for a user have issues for example inside so this so this is the photogrammetry model only is a storage room what I did for a user and then you see right away there are so this is the photogrammetry model only some holes in the model so here on the and then you see right away there are right side this is a plain white area some holes in the model so here on the it's really hard for the software to right side this is a plain white area stitch images together and produce a it's really hard for the software to model but in general it's quite complete stitch images together and produce a model looks okay but you see also the model but in general it's quite complete geometry is not that great a little bit model looks okay but you see also the bubbly and over here also so what we did geometry is not that great a little bit here we also capture this data within bubbly and over here also so what we did point cloud so if I go I'll leave this here we also capture this data within one open I can go to a model point cloud point cloud so if I go I'll leave this only so I process the just import to one open I can go to a model point cloud point out and start processing is only so I process the just import to nothing else you need to do is quite point out and start processing is easy so what you see is a really good nothing else you need to do is quite geometry so the wall is quite good this easy so what you see is a really good is also really good but you see that the geometry so the wall is quite good this door not didn't pick up tomorrow is not is also really good but you see that the so complete door not didn't pick up tomorrow is not are you missing all kind of CAP so there so complete isn't black thing here you miss and on are you missing all kind of CAP so there this side isn't black thing here you miss and on yeah it's a had it looks okay the geometry but you miss a lot of areas yeah it's a had it looks okay the well this area's was in the inner geometry but you miss a lot of areas photogrammetry model it's more complete well this area's was in the inner but you miss some stuff here so the photogrammetry model it's more complete railing here he didn't pick up but you miss some stuff here so the everything but what if you then can railing here he didn't pick up combine them so we merge them together everything but what if you then can and then what the software does if there combine them so we merge them together is no geometry from the for usage and then what the software does if there imagery from the point cloud and the is no geometry from the for usage texture from photogrammetry so you get a imagery from the point cloud and the complete model with a good geometry but texture from photogrammetry so you get a then you see the door not is there the complete model with a good geometry but black thing is there and if I go to this then you see the door not is there the side yeah it's more complete now and black thing is there and if I go to this that's something what we see that often side yeah it's more complete now and I users are using this inside buildings that's something what we see that often if you wanna copy I users are using this inside buildings captures something like this already if you wanna copy difficult objects then you can shine the captures something like this already objects and then again use point route difficult objects then you can shine the and photogrammetry and combine it of objects and then again use point route course we can also process Poincare and photogrammetry and combine it of themselves or I already show one on the course we can also process Poincare model but one on we can also do stuff themselves or I already show one on the like for my mobile scanner for example model but one on we can also do stuff so this is a mobile scanner on top of a car and they can they drive and kept so this is a mobile scanner on top of a here objects like this so this is point car and they can they drive and kept cloud only is no photogrammetry you see here objects like this so this is point a lot of these cars that should be cloud only is no photogrammetry you see removed from the point out before you a lot of these cars that should be start processing if you want to have a removed from the point out before you really nice model but we can also do start processing if you want to have a home video so sometimes your users are really nice model but we can also do doing this isn't good example this home video so sometimes your users are ground penetration radar so the user you doing this isn't good example this see here they do using ground penetration radar so the user you ground-penetrating radar and they mark see here they do using on the roads where the the pipes are you ground-penetrating radar and they mark see here's some objects and on the roads where the the pipes are you traditional what they used to do after see here's some objects and they did this they going within total traditional what they used to do after station and capture all these points so they did this they going within total the geo referencing its and then they station and capture all these points so capture the lines and then they put it the geo referencing its and then they on the map capture the lines and then they put it so what they do now they give the the on the map people to the compensation radar they so what they do now they give the the use in a video you can have a GoPro or people to the compensation radar they you can have an of just on the phone or use in a video you can have a GoPro or iPad the the main thing that you think you can have an of just on the phone or about that you have some of them yeah iPad the the main thing that you think points the geo reference you need some about that you have some of them yeah common points where you can geo points the geo reference you need some reference tomorrow but then you can put common points where you can geo it in context capture and you I hope reference tomorrow but then you can put this is the right one you can get it in context capture and you I hope something like this so if this is the right one you can get references they can just put it on the something like this so if map and they have this is a way cheap references they can just put it on the and easier to process they get a survey map and they have this is a way cheap team in between total station and and easier to process they get a survey measure it so team in between total station and and depends of course on a quality of measure it so the video that you want to use yeah this and depends of course on a quality of is nothing considering the time this is the video that you want to use yeah this what we I can show if there are specific is nothing considering the time this is questions just put it in type of models what we I can show if there are specific put it in the chat box and then I can questions just put it in type of models see if I have a model like this I go put it in the chat box and then I can back to my presentation and I go a see if I have a model like this I go little bit about the was my the CAPTCHA back to my presentation and I go a side of things so what I show that I little bit about the was my the CAPTCHA showed if kind of course good quality side of things so what I show that I models it's all about which CAPTCHA showed if kind of course good quality technique you are using so the way the models it's all about which CAPTCHA software works we have a check pixel to technique you are using so the way the pixel we compare so we import images we software works we have a check pixel to run on process we call area translation pixel we compare so we import images we but we compare each image video a bit run on process we call area translation with another image and see based on but we compare each image video a bit pixels and group of pixels if you can with another image and see based on match the images together its point you pixels and group of pixels if you can want the model needs to be in three match the images together its point you photos so that's important so you see want the model needs to be in three here and point one point to the three photos so that's important so you see different cameras and you see points here and point one point to the three every points in three photos and then different cameras and you see points get modeled but it's also of course every points in three photos and then important what's quality all of the get modeled but it's also of course CAPTCHA so if you see three images next important what's quality all of the to each other and you should far away CAPTCHA so if you see three images next the point is not that strong can go a to each other and you should far away little bit up and down so if you shoot the point is not that strong can go a it from different angles and even little bit up and down so if you shoot different heights the point is much it from different angles and even stronger stronger Elliott regulation so different heights the point is much this is an important thing off of the stronger stronger Elliott regulation so CAPTCHA so normally if we train users we this is an important thing off of the we just we start the other way around we CAPTCHA so normally if we train users we start with what output do you want to we just we start the other way around we have so what type of what quality do you start with what output do you want to really want to have a couple mill have so what type of what quality do you resolution and when you can see really want to have a couple mill everything to your reference perfect or resolution and when you can see you just want to have a model for road everything to your reference perfect or design with three or five centimeters you just want to have a model for road is enough and then we can calculate back design with three or five centimeters to or camera with distance to the object is enough and then we can calculate back you need to use and go back to the to or camera with distance to the object captioning after we capture the data you need to use and go back to the either three steps we do aerial captioning after we capture the data triangulation that we mention all the either three steps we do aerial images together and then we stop triangulation that we mention all the comparing it the images and then images together and then we stop building up tomorrow and then we comparing it the images and then afterwards we do meshing and texturing building up tomorrow and then we so there's some process steps and this afterwards we do meshing and texturing is just an important again the output so there's some process steps and this really requires on the input so if you is just an important again the output put bad data in you can embed model out really requires on the input so if you so that's important to understand the put bad data in you can embed model out camera recommendations so yeah every so that's important to understand the camera basically can be used if you camera recommendations so yeah every could camera but of course the quality camera basically can be used if you depends on the sensor size and the could camera but of course the quality optics keeping constant focal length is depends on the sensor size and the an important one and you have to fly optics keeping constant focal length is avoid blurry photos and you don't do an important one and you have to fly really geometry editing on the avoid blurry photos and you don't do retouching on the photos which you can really geometry editing on the do is color balancing before you start retouching on the photos which you can processing and these are a common data do is color balancing before you start format so we can handle also we can do processing and these are a common data apex is the most common one but we can format so we can handle also we can do also work with all the raw images form apex is the most common one but we can on depends on what to camera so the also work with all the raw images form advantage of using the raw they are on depends on what to camera so the bigger but you also can do a little bit advantage of using the raw they are better color balancing on these but for bigger but you also can do a little bit a quality is epic is I think the most better color balancing on these but for common one a quality is epic is I think the most shit data we need to have at least 70% 60% overlap is really the minimum but we shit data we need to have at least 70% said go Hayek or 70 or 80% so you 60% overlap is really the minimum but we capture data and this is the example said go Hayek or 70 or 80% so you that at least 70% of overlap another capture data and this is the example important one is the angle difference that at least 70% of overlap another between photos it's for us important important one is the angle difference because we compare pixel to pixel and between photos it's for us important group of a group of pixels to each other because we compare pixel to pixel and that this angle is not too big if you group of a group of pixels to each other flywheel and draw me fry really high that this angle is not too big if you then you fry a really low on an angle flywheel and draw me fry really high like the side the side of the building then you fry a really low on an angle even if you can see them both data sets like the side the side of the building in the top data set in the side data set even if you can see them both data sets the software yeah it's struggling to to in the top data set in the side data set pick that up to match this because of the software yeah it's struggling to to the angle difference so I'm pixel with a pick that up to match this because of not on point with pics with a flat area the angle difference so I'm pixel with a so if you see in pixel from the top or not on point with pics with a flat area from the side can be completely so if you see in pixel from the top or different yeah you have a smooth from the side can be completely transition between and the photos as you different yeah you have a smooth see for example if you capture in car transition between and the photos as you you need a lot of overlap ever said see for example if you capture in car every point in three images you won't you need a lot of overlap ever said get this with this on the left side on every point in three images you won't the right side you see here this is a get this with this on the left side on lot of nice overlap and small transition the right side you see here this is a around and objects and the same if you lot of nice overlap and small transition go around on building you have to make around and objects and the same if you sure that you do a lot of images if you go around on building you have to make go around the corner for example yeah sure that you do a lot of images if you and this side a lot of images to make go around the corner for example yeah sure that they can stitch recognize each and this side a lot of images to make other stitch together sure that they can stitch recognize each if you wanna because we can't zoom what we do is if you want more detail you go if you wanna because we can't zoom what closer to the object so you zoom with we do is if you want more detail you go your feet and then you see here for closer to the object so you zoom with example that yeah if you want to have your feet and then you see here for more details from the headlight of the example that yeah if you want to have car you go from outside to inside and more details from the headlight of the capture something closer because we car you go from outside to inside and recognized pixel to pixel you can capture something closer because we imagine if you stand let's say you stand recognized pixel to pixel you can here and you capture an object here this imagine if you stand let's say you stand is a five centimeter pixel wall this is here and you capture an object here this maybe one centimeter pixel the software is a five centimeter pixel wall this is counts really matched it so we need to maybe one centimeter pixel the software have in transition capture between here counts really matched it so we need to and second one yeah the best capture is have in transition capture between here still doing orbits around objects going and second one yeah the best capture is around from but that is of course not still doing orbits around objects going always possible it's also quite around from but that is of course not time-consuming and I will show you some always possible it's also quite different capture techniques what we use time-consuming and I will show you some for example nadir only just shooting different capture techniques what we use down it works okay but not really for example nadir only just shooting suitable for buildings because you don't down it works okay but not really see the side of the building really well suitable for buildings because you don't like I remember the example from the car see the side of the building really well that I showed in that case we do often like I remember the example from the car and in great pathalam but also sit down that I showed in that case we do often on an angle so not straight down but on and in great pathalam but also sit down an angle so you get the side of the on an angle so not straight down but on building and the overlapping circles an angle so you get the side of the this is really this is a really nice building and the overlapping circles technique because if you use this you this is really this is a really nice see a lot of images going around all the technique because if you use this you points you see in a lot of images it's see a lot of images going around all the really strong because you do circles but points you see in a lot of images it's on the other side it's quite really strong because you do circles but time-consuming and you get a lot of on the other side it's quite images and also yeah you have to fly on time-consuming and you get a lot of top of an object so sometimes it's not images and also yeah you have to fly on possible fly on top of people same with top of an object so sometimes it's not this one but yeah so this has some possible fly on top of people same with CAPTCHA so this is for example in plain this one but yeah so this has some sight you see here flying around CAPTCHA so this is for example in plain different orbits different angles sight you see here flying around different sizes so you see all the different orbits different angles points from all the sides different sizes so you see all the bridge this is a good example from rich points from all the sides where we shooting the sides under an bridge this is a good example from rich angle and we do a lot of orbits around where we shooting the sides under an it on top of it this is a city modeling angle and we do a lot of orbits around but this isn't it on top of it this is a city modeling yeah looks like one camera but it's but this isn't probably five cameras on top of each yeah looks like one camera but it's other so if they shoot down it should probably five cameras on top of each every time we shoot five camp five other so if they shoot down it should images and then you get in a city model every time we shoot five camp five where you could sit in model house these images and then you get in a city model are some examples that I I just created where you could sit in model house these so this is that model water we show the are some examples that I I just created hand-held camera you see here how we so this is that model water we show the walked around and the overlap is not hand-held camera you see here how we only horizontal but also vertical so you walked around and the overlap is not see that we should here multiple camera only horizontal but also vertical so you multiple images from the same location see that we should here multiple camera so going up this if you want to do for multiple images from the same location example in person let's say for 3d so going up this if you want to do for printing because you're the moving example in person let's say for 3d objects here people blinking with the printing because you're the moving ice can be an issue for example so and objects here people blinking with the this is like in camera rig system but ice can be an issue for example so and the user build up with 70 images and this is like in camera rig system but they should at once with an trigger and the user build up with 70 images and then you can model in person this one on they should at once with an trigger and the right of this is a plantside from then you can model in person this one on oil user buddy the buildin camera rig so the right of this is a plantside from with eight cameras on top of each other oil user buddy the buildin camera rig so and then they walk around you see how with eight cameras on top of each other many images you get here and then we can and then they walk around you see how process it and get a good model house many images you get here and then we can this is a really good example and these process it and get a good model house are some overlapping orbits phone and this is a really good example and these handheld camera yeah so we can't go too are some overlapping orbits phone and much in detail and we have different handheld camera yeah so we can't go too kind of capture guys so from the cell much in detail and we have different tower we have a different guys we can kind of capture guys so from the cell explain you how to capture that compared tower we have a different guys we can to a city or in person so yeah if you explain you how to capture that compared want to add a detail just contact us to a city or in person so yeah if you after this we can give you more detailed want to add a detail just contact us guides with a time considering we can't after this we can give you more detailed really show it what I want to show is in guides with a time considering we can't a simple processing workflow so you get really show it what I want to show is in an idea how the software works a simple processing workflow so you get what the steps are so the workflow is an idea how the software works and I'm gonna explain it here and then what the steps are so the workflow is I'm gonna do it life I should create a and I'm gonna explain it here and then new project in context captures master I'm gonna do it life I should create a you import the images then my random new project in context captures master process we call the area tribulation you import the images then my random instead why we match the images together process we call the area tribulation then we go in reconstruction and instead why we match the images together production producing of the model then we go in reconstruction and I created this but I gonna show their live we just see an idea create a new I created this but I gonna show their project import the images run the Ariat live we just see an idea create a new regulation did this take a couple project import the images run the Ariat minutes and then once you have that you regulation did this take a couple can go in what we call 3d reconstruction minutes and then once you have that you you set the boundary what area I want can go in what we call 3d reconstruction the process and then we go production you set the boundary what area I want and we can produce the model of multiple the process and then we go production models so let me show the software so and we can produce the model of multiple I'm not sure familiar with the software models so let me show the software so ready but this is the switch you get so I'm not sure familiar with the software you get what we call context capture ready but this is the switch you get so master the viewer the what I explained you get what we call context capture what you already have access to as a master the viewer the what I explained free version and then we have contacts what you already have access to as a captures engine that someone who does free version and then we have contacts the work I will show later out of works captures engine that someone who does and then we haven't desktop application the work I will show later out of works context capture editor that comes with and then we haven't desktop application context capture is like a micro station context capture editor that comes with and then as last we have also on trout context capture is like a micro station processing console so what I'm going to and then as last we have also on trout do is I start up my context capture processing console so what I'm going to master and the way the software works is do is I start up my context capture we work with in job queue so we have an master and the way the software works is unfolded structure and where you set it we work with in job queue so we have an up before you start where jobs are going unfolded structure and where you set it to write you creating a new job for up before you start where jobs are going let's say an area tribulation goes to to write you creating a new job for the job queue and then you start the let's say an area tribulation goes to engine and the engine picks it up so in the job queue and then you start the compact engine and the engine picks it up so in SCAP sure master i select create new compact project and i can create an folder of a SCAP sure master i select create new project and already exist a new one okay project and i can create an folder of a so this is my empty project in the context caption master and yeah we have so this is my empty project in the some tools we create things like QR context caption master and yeah we have codes where we can stick on objects some tools we create things like QR without software automatically recognize codes where we can stick on objects it we have a camera databases of course without software automatically recognize are really important for us but you can it we have a camera databases of course also do much some machine learning stuff are really important for us but you can and yeah but then i'm we having job also do much some machine learning stuff queue monitor so we can see if there's a and yeah but then i'm we having job job waiting to be process of how many queue monitor so we can see if there's a jobs are waiting i cannot block here so job waiting to be process of how many block is we can rename it everyone so jobs are waiting i cannot block here so this is the area the the part where you block is we can rename it everyone so import the images so I go here to photo this is the area the the part where you so I can import my photos I can do whole import the images so I go here to photo directory I can select some of the so I can import my photos I can do whole images I can import video and over here directory I can select some of the I can do point cloud static scanner images I can import video and over here mobile scanner add photo and I select I can do point cloud static scanner couple photo so you see this is the DGI camera I couple photo think is an inspired one so the software so you see this is the DGI camera I picks up automatically the sensor size think is an inspired one so the software and the focal length is also in the picks up automatically the sensor size metadata of the image so if I see open and the focal length is also in the one of the images you can see these metadata of the image so if I see open images have a coordinate so if I go to one of the images you can see these file info you see these are the images have a coordinate so if I go to coordinates story in this image file info you see these are the so after imports the software knows are coordinates story in this image based on these coordinates where it is so after imports the software knows are so you can see this is yeah the pattern based on these coordinates where it is will be captures over just shooting down so you can see this is yeah the pattern the images I can also export it in KML will be captures over just shooting down file so export a block don't KML file so the images I can also export it in KML I can check where it is so it opens in file so export a block don't KML file so Google Earth in my case I'm not doing I can check where it is so it opens in this now but if it's not gia reference Google Earth in my case I'm not doing if you have photos for my end of camera this now but if it's not gia reference for example there's no problem we can if you have photos for my end of camera still work with it so this for example there's no problem we can this I create a new block and what I do is I I this I create a new block and what I do registration so I used a photo positioning metadata registration so I used a photo of the settings I think goes a little bit too far to explain all of them but of the settings I think goes a little what I do is I submit and now the job is bit too far to explain all of them but going to the job queue so it's waiting what I do is I submit and now the job is to be processed if I go here you see one going to the job queue so it's waiting pending job and what I now need to do is to be processed if I go here you see one I start the engine and it comes up on pending job and what I now need to do is this screen and now it starts processing I start the engine and it comes up on areas Fingal ation so what it does it this screen and now it starts processing extract the images here so to extract areas Fingal ation so what it does it this is the first 40 percent of the extract the images here so to extract process hello to every image extract this is the first 40 percent of the what we call the key points app points process hello to every image extract where I start comparing it on and when what we call the key points app points that is finished it start matching these where I start comparing it on and when image together so this will take a that is finished it start matching these couple minutes so let this mall run and image together so this will take a then we come back when when this is couple minutes so let this mall run and finished and let me go back to my then we come back when when this is presentation so in presentation finished and let me go back to my style presentation so in presentation so I'm sure we now isn't the same and simple workflow imports images Ranieri I'm sure we now isn't the same and relation going to basically we shown simple workflow imports images Ranieri this one a reconstruction production if relation going to basically we shown you have things like ground control this one a reconstruction production if points or merging data sets together you have things like ground control then the workflow is somewhere in the points or merging data sets together area tribulation then you import the then the workflow is somewhere in the ground control points run the new area area tribulation then you import the translation and maybe you adding tie ground control points run the new area points merging data sets and then go to translation and maybe you adding tie a reconstruction production so it's points merging data sets and then go to quite often that we have a run multiple a reconstruction production so it's Ariat regulations together and data set quite often that we have a run multiple together so it's not like in one go this Ariat regulations together and data set is I'm going to show you a really simple together so it's not like in one go this drone data set but quite often they are is I'm going to show you a really simple really complex the output format so what drone data set but quite often they are we can produce from context capture so really complex the output format so what once you have the Alliant regulation go we can produce from context capture so reconstruction production and then you once you have the Alliant regulation go can produce different kind of models so reconstruction production and then you we can prove produce 3d meshes point can produce different kind of models so clouds and auto photos as output for the we can prove produce 3d meshes point 3d meshes three mixes Bentley format and clouds and auto photos as output for the also three ISM and you can also have it 3d meshes three mixes Bentley format and as a simple website so we can produce a also three ISM and you can also have it model we uploaded to your own internet as a simple website so we can produce a space and then you can share the model model we uploaded to your own internet with our users cesium you have season space and then you can share the model platform there's a caesium is an open with our users cesium you have season source 3d a publishing platform you can platform there's a caesium is an open export to SV i3s so if you use our GS source 3d a publishing platform you can you can use this 1 by 3s FBX for outer export to SV i3s so if you use our GS des uses d GN is you producing a noble you can use this 1 by 3s FBX for outer MicroStation file in my accession can des uses d GN is you producing a noble also load 3 mix but this is just the MicroStation file in my accession can file itself a lot 3 is a format that is also load 3 mix but this is just the quite often used for GS applications of file itself a lot 3 is a format that is course obj colera quite often used for GS applications of always chibi is and formats of the users course obj colera STL for 3d printing OS GB is a lot more always chibi is and formats of the users common J's for mass or most STL for 3d printing OS GB is a lot more probably the three makes easy mastery common J's for mass or most FBX and obj colada so this is all output probably the three makes easy mastery formats on the mesh site on the point FBX and obj colada so this is all output outside we can export a less file so the formats on the mesh site on the point simplest so in a normal last file and we outside we can export a less file so the can important port isn't Bentley format simplest so in a normal last file and we for auto photos we can do G Otis JPEGs can important port isn't Bentley format it's not even make a mistake JPEGs and for auto photos we can do G Otis JPEGs do teef SV ASCII raster expose it and it's not even make a mistake JPEGs and KML files so this is the output formats do teef SV ASCII raster expose it and at this moment so Bennie has also some KML files so this is the output formats other applications where we can use for at this moment so Bennie has also some example this is over city planner but we other applications where we can use for can do for city panning this is also example this is over city planner but we output formats what we can do now can do for city panning this is also automatically in a pass we have to go to output formats what we can do now a lottery lottery loaded in this automatically in a pass we have to go to application and so this is for mesh yeah a lottery lottery loaded in this for city planners so in this case we application and so this is for mesh yeah also linked orbit to it so the 3d mobile for city planners so in this case we scanning data so this is a cloud-based also linked orbit to it so the 3d mobile platform where we can use all this kind scanning data so this is a cloud-based of information overlaid on a mesh bottom platform where we can use all this kind mesh so this formats this export format of information overlaid on a mesh bottom will be in the next release directly so mesh so this formats this export format you don't have to convert it yourself will be in the next release directly so anymore this is more we can link for the you don't have to convert it yourself I train services so if you want to do anymore this is more we can link for the digital twins where we can link new I train services so if you want to do design so this is for example I think digital twins where we can link new it's even a Revit model or we can link design so this is for example I think to where you can go in and see the Revit it's even a Revit model or we can link model in there in the use application so to where you can go in and see the Revit this is opacity planner is a year model in there in the use application so linking documentation for example so you reopen and we have an application design review where you can link all the so you reopen and we have an application objects to each other so you can see design review where you can link all the something like this so that's one thing objects to each other so you can see and another application what we have is something like this so that's one thing orbiters for a point out streaming and and another application what we have is feature extraction and this is also of orbiters for a point out streaming and you and kind of you where we can convert feature extraction and this is also of data a published data so you see for you and kind of you where we can convert example on the right top is the mesh on data a published data so you see for the left is the images for the from the example on the right top is the mesh on mobile scanner in the point cloud so you the left is the images for the from the can combine it all together in one mobile scanner in the point cloud so you viewer this is one of our recent can combine it all together in one applications of example Singapore viewer this is one of our recent government is using this application for applications of example Singapore viewing all the measures and a point government is using this application for cloud data viewing all the measures and a point do is I'm gonna go back see to my contacts caption model considering time do is I'm gonna go back see to my it's a little bit going up and down so contacts caption model considering time I'm in breaking my contacts caption it's a little bit going up and down so master and you will see my project is I'm in breaking my contacts caption now finished the Ariat regulation is master and you will see my project is finished and that what well says five now finished the Ariat regulation is images can be used finished and that what well says five I can check why so if I go here I can images can be used check why this image is not in you so if I can check why so if I go here I can I open this one it makes sense because check why this image is not in you so if this image is your shooting faraway is I open this one it makes sense because not facing facing down so it makes sense this image is your shooting faraway is that they can't be using probably also not facing facing down so it makes sense for that and the other ones or the other that they can't be using probably also ones are just facing down so if we go to for that and the other ones or the other my 3d view here I can see here this is ones are just facing down so if we go to not the model yet so this is the area my 3d view here I can see here this is tringle ation all the images are not the model yet so this is the area stitched together and this is my object tringle ation all the images are so after my area triangulation that's stitched together and this is my object what I can do now is so after my area triangulation that's adding ground control points for example user user type won't mix with other data adding ground control points for example set but in this case I'm happy with it I user user type won't mix with other data go to my 3d reconstruction that is in set but in this case I'm happy with it I this phase I select 3d reconstruction go to my 3d reconstruction that is in and then go to spatial framework and this phase I select 3d reconstruction then in this spatial framework and then go to spatial framework and I can sit well as my extent so what do I then in this spatial framework want to process I said now I want to I can sit well as my extent so what do I process something like this if the data want to process I said now I want to set is quite big we can split it up my process something like this if the data smaller pieces so I can do one grid and set is quite big we can split it up my I want to do a 75 meeting right so it smaller pieces so I can do one grid and produces 12 jobs instead of one big job I want to do a 75 meeting right so it I can things like quality if I turn my produces 12 jobs instead of one big job imagery I can use that also the quality I can things like quality if I turn my filling holes some of the settings have imagery I can use that also the quality what you want to use if you don't have filling holes some of the settings have data which color you want to have for what you want to use if you don't have example we can also if you have water in data which color you want to have for the object we can automatically detect example we can also if you have water in what is water and we can add as in the object we can automatically detect geometry constraint so there's a fully what is water and we can add as in automatically there not to do anything geometry constraint so there's a fully in this case let's say I'm happy with my own my settings and then I can go under in this case let's say I'm happy with my my reconstruction I go to production is own my settings and then I can go under producing on the model so I select my reconstruction I go to production is submit new production and I can give it producing on the model so I select a name so this is case it's a resource I submit new production and I can give it select what type of output to our wants a name so this is case it's a resource I I want to do in 3d mesh photo of and select what type of output to our wants point out auto photo and this is for I want to do in 3d mesh photo of and cleaning up and this is for detecting point out auto photo and this is for what is water display I so in this case cleaning up and this is for detecting I just want to produce and 3d mesh and what is water display I so in this case go here and then I can select which I just want to produce and 3d mesh and format some one-on-three mix scalable go here and then I can select which mesh cesium tiles began so this is all format some one-on-three mix scalable the output formats where I already mesh cesium tiles began so this is all discussed what is possible in this case the output formats where I already I just don't remix I can sit if I do one discussed what is possible in this case on websites no I don't want to website I I just don't remix I can sit if I do one just want to on websites no I don't want to website I this quality yeah we have a lot of just want to settings here but I just keep it like this quality yeah we have a lot of this and then the output coordinate settings here but I just keep it like system so I just want to use this one this and then the output coordinate being having a camera of a known system so I just want to use this one database with coordinate systems even if being having a camera of a known your coordinate system is not in there database with coordinate systems even if we can add it extent I want to process your coordinate system is not in there everything this is the output folder I we can add it extent I want to process submit and I will see it writes all this everything this is the output folder I job to the job queue so it's that submit and I will see it writes all this processing with one job and I got one is job to the job queue so it's that running and eleven are waiting and at processing with one job and I got one is the moment that a job is finished it running and eleven are waiting and at will pop up here in the view you can the moment that a job is finished it already see it a bunch hours finished will pop up here in the view you can and one of the the good things with the already see it a bunch hours finished job queue is that you don't have the way and one of the the good things with the to its finish you can in the meantime job queue is that you don't have the way you can select another output so I said to its finish you can in the meantime hey I want to do a point cloud now I won you can select another output so I said the last file but I want to have it like hey I want to do a point cloud now I won a five centimeter punch sampling next the last file but I want to have it like set coordinate system extent next and a five centimeter punch sampling next submit and now when the first model is set coordinate system extent next and finished the second one goes much faster submit and now when the first model is so this is the the simple workflow creating models and now the job queue is so this is the the simple workflow filled and our the models I just creating models and now the job queue is processing and that is really Hardware filled and our the models I just dependent how quick it goes processing and that is really Hardware was in one hour the convex KPI open makes sense so this is like an first was in one hour the convex KPI open session if you have special interest in makes sense so this is like an first certain objects we can go more in detail session if you have special interest in with another session if you want to do certain objects we can go more in detail certain type of processing let say cell with another session if you want to do towers or plant sites so city modeling certain type of processing let say cell but then yeah just contact somebody from towers or plant sites so city modeling rice off and they can set up another but then yeah just contact somebody from session rice off and they can set up another
