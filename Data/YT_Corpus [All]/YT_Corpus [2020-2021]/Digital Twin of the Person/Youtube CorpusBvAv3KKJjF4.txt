 - So I'm going to put this audio up some and we're going to listen, right? - Yes. - That's all we're here for. IYANLA VANZANT: Mr. Jordan? Wait, did you have homework? MR. JORDAN: I had homework. You did? MR. JORDAN: Yeah. OK, let me see your homework. What I need you to know is I don't care. [MUSIC PLAYING] There's something worse than hate. It's ambivalence. That's not caring. I don't believe you don't care. OK. It's possible that it still hurts you. Possible. I don't know. But I know one thing. Growing into a man, the one thing you don't want to do is not care. It sounds like me when I was his age or a little bit younger. I got to the point where I didn't think people really cared, so I would say I didn't care. I did care, but I wouldn't show any. - Too expensive to care, right? - Yes. I could do something different. Could be my own man. I don't really care about the family issues. I'm over it. I've been over it. So, like, coming here, trying to fix-- no, I've been over it, so. Can you talk to me about before you got over it? Me and my dad been having issues since I was young. So like at a certain point, I was like, "Why do I care about what this man is doing?" I was like, "He ain't going to change." IYANLA VANZANT: From what to what? From being a [BLEEP] to a regular person. IYANLA VANZANT: So who are you modeling your manhood after? Myself. I just grow. (LAUGHING) You're modeling your manhood after yourself? I just grow into it. It's just something, like-- something you learn. IYANLA VANZANT: Why wouldn't you model your self, your manhood after your father? Why would I? Because he's your father. And? By not doing that, it puts you in great jeopardy. No. So what makes you think that modeling yourself after him wouldn't be good? When I seen who he grew into. When I see that model, I'm not trying to be that model. What did he-- MR. JORDAN: So I'm-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] - --grow into? Let's talk about that. A bad father. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TRIPLE CLAP]
