 - I remember saying, "Okay, let's record this." And then, I just switched off the video, and he said, "No, please do it again." And I was like, "Why?" And I think he already had the idea. Usually it affects more in your mental health because it is all about the image. And it's all about control and not being able to control your body. I had many exams because I was in my last year of law school, so, very stressful. Beginning of May, I was waking up in the morning, hair all over my pillow, my clothes, in the shower, everywhere. It was so surprising for me. I was full of emotion. He says, "Just like you now." I didn't know what to think. And at nighttime, I came back to him, and I looked at him in the eyes, and I said, "You know, you could have proposed to me. You could have make me babies, but that was literally the best proof of love you could ever made to me because no one ever did this to me." Seeing how people were feeling encouraged and supported, that really, I saw that there was something to do here. And we are such a huge community. We tend to forget that we are so many, and we shouldn't feel alone. You can live it however you want to live it. It just, it has to make you comfortable. And it has to be the best version of yourself. I mean, however you go out, whatever you wear, if you're bald, if you wear a wig, if you wear a scarf, whatever you do, when you have alopecia, the most important thing is how you feel with what you're doing; it's not what you wear. Even without your hair, you can be the most beautiful person, because this is not what makes you beautiful.
