 so my name is Ronan Collins.  I'm originally from Ireland and i left Ireland some 20 years ago   to move to of all places, Hong Kong and i ran a  company in Hong Kong called Intelibuild where we ran  building information modeling management services  for engineering firms architectural practices and   major contracting organizations  12 years ago I met my beloved wife who's actually from Malaysia   and we returned to Malaysia about five years  ago and since then i've been working with   the MRT, Aecom and most recently with Gamuda construction  and i'm going to show you   some of the innovations that we put brought  to bear on the MRT project in Kuala Lumpur   so this is a a very overused image  by now these are two of our surveyors   and the important thing to note here is we've  actually trained the surveying team to operate   the drones so that we don't have a special  drone team by any stretch of imagination   these are competent experienced surveyors and you  can see here mr faiz actually operating the drone   and you can see we have a spotter and i'm  going to explain the roles of these two   different people in the operation of the  drones and obviously most of you recognize   the landmark in the background as being the  petronas towers or as we call it in malaysia klcc   The project that this was started on and was  the kind of instigator for using drones for Gamuda   was the MRT project in kuala lumpur so we call it  mrt2 or the ssp line depending who you speak to   and i was specifically responsible for the  bim management for the underground section   This is a 3d photogrammic model  The first term to be understood is this notion   of photogrammetry of photogrammic photogrammetry  is a process where you take a standard  photograph and preferably high resolution the  photograph can be captured either by drone it   can be captured by a fixed-wing aircraft so a  normal flight and it can actually be captured   by handheld cameras so there's a number of ways of  capturing the photograph so long as the photograph   has got a location key, as long as we know  where the photograph was taken we can then use all   of the photographs to create these 3d surfaces so  what you're looking at here is actually a 3d mesh   of the entire kl urban environment where  we're actually doing the tunnel construction   so this little video shows you a very  good example of how you can build a 3d   model of a city or an environment using a  combination in our case of drone footage   and aerial photography so there you can see the  Petronas Towers in the foreground and the purpose   of this little video is to show you the locations  of all the stations in the built-up environment in   kuala lumpur so we have been flying around and  above the stations and the surrounding areas   over the period of two or three years collecting  all the photographs collecting all the information   and building this reference model and and we also  got help from one of our service providers   who had done broader surveys  and had the fixed-wing aircraft   photography as well which we combined together  so this is a very good way of explaining to   the public to the contractors to the engineers the  client where their project is in a 3d environment   so that's the whole of kl so let me give you  some examples of how we actually generate   these 3d surface models and in our case  we're using a software called context capture   which is a tool available from bentley and the  context capture software can absorb and use   photographs it can absorb LIDAR information  it can take in terrestrial laser scanners it can   take in handheld photographs and it then runs  the photogrammetry algorithms to generate the   3d meshes. When we talk about photo capture  or photogrammetry essentially we fly the   drone over the construction site typically 80  to 100 meters above the construction site level   and we take overlapping photographs now  the overlapping photographs is critical   so you need to make sure that each image is 70 percent of the previous image so you can see here as i   progress through this sequence images it's  continuously overlapping the images and the   reason for this is that the software is looking  for particular pixels or particular aspects   and it needs them in three or four or five  positions to create an accurate 3d position   of where it is. This is why we do these  overlapping photographs you can see from the   image data that these are very large files and  these examples are actually from 2017 so this   shows you how long we've been doing this so you  can see there there are 5000 pixels by 3500 pixels so very high resolution  and to give you an example of how high resolution   if i zoom into one if you see a little yellow  box that's myself and my colleague Nick Morecock   and and this is the actually a set of images that  we took i think this was the second or third third   trial run that we did so this is a a good example  of how we actually operate we're standing in the   shade of the excavator because in malaysia it's 35  degrees but one of us is operating the software to   operate the drone and the other person is actually  operating or monitoring the drone in flight   so if you do this on your own it's very difficult  to keep an eye on the software keep an eye on the   drone keep an eye on the construction site keep  an eye out for activities around you so we have   a policy that every operation that we do with the  drones involves two people one person operating   the software and the other person is a spotter  to make sure everything is safe and under control   this little video if I get this to work  shows you what the software looks like on a   mobile device. We use ipads typically  for this operation so we actually pre-plan every   flight so here you can see a simulation of a drone  following a pre-planned path so the planning of   the path makes sure that we achieve the 70% overlap  of the images so basically we make sure that we   can actually fly the path and then we capture  enough images for the area that we actually   want to survey and create a 3d surface model from  so this would take typically 15 to 20 minutes on   one battery and we can cover quite a large area  of the site so once we've worked out for each   individual site the flight paths they're saved and  they can be reused over and over and over again   just for a bit of fun this is actually a drone taking a video of a drone   following a path so we've been doing these kind  of presentations to teach people how to do the   drone so we've been using one drone to video  another drone so here you can see a survey   taking place and if you know how to do  it you can actually set the drones up to fly it   close to excavation so you can get  better information about what's   beneath the ground level and this is not a radar  so it only works on visuals but when you have   these kind of open excavations very often you need  to get a bit closer to the actual excavation wall   to get a bit more detail from the photographs  to be able to build a more accurate 3d model   of the excavation so it takes a bit of practice  in terms of getting the right information from   the photographs but once you've got it figured  out you can create some very detailed models now one thing that people don't understand or  are not familiar with is this concept of ground   control points in order for the surveyors to  be able to create a 3d surface model which is   actually based on the national coordinate system  which in our case is the cassini grid in kuala   lumpur you have to make sure that you can take  accurate ground control points (GCP) so here you can   see the surveyor is setting up a ground control  point and he's measuring the gps coordinates of   that ground control point and if i play the video  again you'll notice that we've got a red and white   mat so basically that red and white mat will turn  up in the photographs in the context capture mesh   and then we will set that ground control  point (GCP) as per the coordinates of this particular   survey station so what we've learned in doing  this is that for a site typical site area here   you may need you might need five or six ground control points in the photographic survey to   get an accurate position of the mesh in terms  of real-world coordinates if you don't use   ground control points you can position the  mesh by eye but it's not very accurate so   again we recommend that as you're doing if  you're doing surveys with drones to create   these meshes to be able to use them for other  purposes you need to have ground control points so the key issue working in malaysia and  i think this is true for most countries   is that you actually have to put a lot of effort  into the planning and operation of the drones   it's not simply a case of charging it getting out  getting in your car and going to site and flying   the thing and that's actually not a very clever  way of doing it so the more planning and the more   preparation you put in the more successful your  drone operations are going to be so before we do   any flights we have a pre-flight discussion  or meeting and we say why are we flying the   drone what's the purpose are we doing it to survey  something are we doing it to record something are   we doing it to create a mesh we have an objective  in mind as to why we're operating the drone   and then once we understand what we're doing and  once we understand where we're going to be flying   in malaysia we then have to get two permits  one is from jupem and one is from caam jupem   is a survey permit there's a law in malaysia  that prohibits the use of aerial aerial drones   helicopters and planes for photography without  permission so we have to get permission to fly   the drone and capture photographs and caam is the  airport authority so we basically have to notify   the air traffic control team that we're operating  a drone in the airspace in and around kuala lumpur   or wherever we're operating so we have to notify  two authorities and and we need to make sure we've   got the right certificates in place to do them  and we then make sure that every flight operation   involves two people a pilot and a spotter so we  then have a system for logging all those flights   so it's worth remembering that the photographs  may be taking for one purpose on one day   but by keeping a record of those photographs  and by keeping a record of the model we can   actually use those photographs in the future for  potentially other uses so future projects future   developments are going back and doing comparisons  and the other important thing is by keeping a log   we actually maintain a diary for the drone so we  need to make sure we know how many hours have been   logged for each drone we need to make sure that if  there's any issues with the drone they get tracked   and in a very similar way to maintaining any asset  so we make sure that the there's a pre-flight   check on the drone to make sure there's nothing  wrong with the batteries with the propellers with   the motors with the camera and if the after the  flight if there's any issues that they get logged   and then they get resolved so the maintenance  of the drones is critical we don't want one   of these things falling out of the sky in the  middle of an operation so these are the kind of   pre-planning and checklists that we go through so  this is a good example of some of the planning so   in this example we're planning out a flight path for a future project this is for a rail alignment   in actually in penang so you can see here that  we've mapped out where we want to survey you   can see the alignment that we're looking at as a  potential alignment and then we've provided all   the coordinate points of the actual boundary that  we're going to fly so that information is provided   to the authorities and we say we're going to fly  this path on the 6th of november please grant us   permission to do so and more often than not we get  permission one of the things you'll notice here is   we actually identify the local police station  so very often we will actually go to the police   station locally and tell them what we're doing  we'll give them a copy of their permits and we'll   say look today we're going to be out flying the  drones just in case anybody sees it or somebody   reports it you need to know that we're out there  flying the drones and what we're doing and it's   just a courtesy to the police that we don't with  that we actually tell them what's happening so   the first thing is safety so safety is a priority  for all of commuter engineering operations whether   it's flight and drones or construction and and  in this example it's not just about making sure   you've got a fancy red and white barrier safety  also involves checking the device before you   fly it so make sure that all the propellers are  properly attached make sure they're not cracked   or scratched make sure that the legs of the drone  are properly built there's no cracks and then we   operate the drone from a safe designated area away  from normal construction operations so you'll see   here where they're operating the drone there's  no active operations in that position there's   no nearby cranes there's no nearby excavators  there's nothing happening in that area and it   provides a safe area for the drone to take off and  it provides a safe area for the drone to return to so again re-emphasizing the point so we actually  got vests made for the survey team so we identify   who was who so this is a drone pilot he's  responsible for the operation of the drone at all   times and the actual more important guy is a drone  spotter and the drone spotter is under you'll see   him here in a second turning around he's got  a radio he is in contact with the site safety   manager the site safety supervisor he's standing  local to the drone operator and he's keeping an   eye on the position of the drone he's keeping an  eye on surrounding activities he's making sure   that the drone's not going to crash into a crane  or anything else and and if there is any incidents   he will instruct the pilot to bring the drone  back to the safe landing spot immediately so again   all part of a safe policy that we operate these  drones as safely and as smartly as we possibly can   so now i'm going to show you what we use the  data for once we've done the drone surveys   so in this example i'm going to show  you an example an ortho photographic map   so you can see in the bottom right corner one  of the stations bander malaysia and in the top   left corner you're going to see Chan Sow Lin  so these are two stations along the alignment   and there's a very simple s-curve in  the tbm drive between the two locations   this tbm drive is crossing under a major  highway interchange on the outskirts of   kl city so this is a very sensitive area  and had to be monitored very carefully   so an ortho photo is generated automatically  by the software based on the 3d model and the   photographs are taken so you can generate a true  orthographic image of any site by flying the   drones and using the context capture software to  create the orthographic photo it is dimensionally   accurate and it is a true orthogonal image so  you will not see the slope in the walls you will   see basically the vertical verticality of the  elements and it is a true two-dimensional   image so you can bring this into cad you can bring  this into revit you can bring this into navisworks   you can use it for backgrounds it's a very useful  2d information and this is the Chan Sow Lin image   and what we've been doing is we've actually been  taking these images and using them in gis these   are more accurate than the available information  on most gis platforms so this gives us a much more   accurate representation of the construction site  at a given point in time so we prefer to use these   auto photographs in the gis and just to give an  example why this is important this is an image   from google maps or google earth and you can see  the tilt of the buildings this image was taken   by a satellite so it's obviously going to have a  very high resolution in terms of its distance if i   overlay a typical ortho photographic image or ortho image you'll see there's a lot more information a   lot more detail but more importantly the buildings  are actually vertical so they can actually be   correlated with cadastral maps they can be  correlated with proper street maps survey maps   and we can map out the tbm with great accuracy in  terms of its projected path and actually its final   path as it passes underneath particular properties  or particular road crossings et cetera et cetera   so using these ortho photographs is a very good  way of being able to combine different sets of   information now i'm going to show you something  a little bit unique in terms of what we've been   doing with some of these meshes so this is a  traditional time lapse of a construction project   so this is the tbm launches for that same section  of tunnels from bandar malaysia to Chan Sow Lin   that's from a fixed camera position so we cannot  use those images to build 3d models it's not just   physically impossible we would need  hundreds of cameras to be able to do that   so what we've done instead is we've flown over the  site on a two week or three week interval and then   we've created a 3d mesh for each period of time so  every time we've done a survey we created a mesh   of that point in time and what's happening here  is that using the actual photogrammetry software   i've created this kind of orbiting time lapse  but it's actually a 3d mesh so i can actually   look at the sequence of construction across the  site in 3d so i can compare this month's progress   to the previous month's progress i can compare  the amount of material on site this time to the   amount of material inside last time and and in  terms of a wow factor for presenting to clients   because this is a 3d mesh we can zoom into certain  areas we can look at them different angles and we   can go through the cycle so this is basically  a time-lapse 3d survey of the construction site   and as you get to the end you can see that  the tbms are actually in position for the   second launch to go south into Bandar malaysia south and onto the actual portal   so i'm going to spend a bit more time looking at  chance island and give you some good examples of   how we use these models so this is basically  the the level of detail that you can see in   these photogrammic models so you can see the tbm  after the breakthrough you can see the shuttering   for the formwork you can see there's a  couple of waves and a couple of kind of   blemishes in the model but for all  intents and purposes it's pretty accurate   and if i show you the actual mesh this is the mesh  that's created from the photogrammetry process   so it's not perfect, it's not ideal  but it is reasonably accurate for our purposes   and it's reasonably accurate to within 50  millimeters so here you can make out the   position of the permanent wall you can make out  the tbm you can make out the the kind of surface   mesh for the formwork and you can kind  of make out the position of the permanent wall on   the other side so we can take these meshes and  because we've used ground control points because   we've done this accurately we can then link  this in using the actual project coordinates   to the bim system so in this example we've taken  the surface mesh into Navisworks and we've been   able to overlay that with the actual designed  permanent works so you can see the base slab   you can see the vertical slabs of the station  and you can tell that it's not 100% perfect   but it's pretty close and it's certainly with  intolerance that we've built the permanent works   in the right position which is always a it's  always a good sign so it is possible to link   the building information models with the survey  meshes and make use of them so just to show you   another example of this and this is a 4d sequence  that was done in navisworks timeliner to show   the construction sequence for the same station so  this is the slab pour sequence for Chan Sow Lin station and just to show an example we do  all these stations with 4d. we model all   the stations in 4d but what we also discover is  we can actually use the same time-lapse basic   concept with these models so again this  is a fixed time-lapse position camera   from that same site so here you can see the  excavation sequence this is an open excavation   there's a rock face here which has been retained  so it's a very safe way of construction and here   you can see the construction the base slab and then  upon completion of the base slab you'll see the wall   forms going up and eventually you'll see the  tbm arriving here's what it looks like when you   do this using a combination of photogrammetry and  bim so we have a 3d mesh of that site excavation   we can cut a section through it so here  you can see a long section through the station   we've got a reference in terms of what we're  building ultimately so that's the base slab so i've   talked about the positioning of the mesh the other  thing about the mesh is that they're very accurate   so we can use the mesh for measuring distance so  you can take linear information off the mesh   and you can also use it more importantly  for volume calculations so in this example   what we're doing here  this is me just basically doing a demonstration   but essentially we're using the context  capture tools and you can map out a boundary   that you want to measure the volume for the mesh  so what we're doing here is basically tagging the   corners of the excavation and and what we're  trying to do is work out in theory if we wanted   to build a platform at a certain level how much  material would we need to excavate and how much   material would we need to fill to create that  platform so i've created the boundary and then   i use the mesh and i set it to a certain sampling  distance in this case three quarters of a meter   and it then tells me the from the mesh how many  meters are above and below and it tells me that i   need a certain amount of fill and a certain amount  of cut so the cut is in yellow and the fill is in   green so we've only spent an hour on site with  the drones but now we can actually do a very   detailed volume calculation and and while it's  not millimeter accurate it is accurate to within   a couple of within certainly when half a meter  in terms of the density or the volume so it's   accurate enough for the purpose of us doing  certain quick surveys and quick measurements   so we can use the mesh to quantify material on  site we can use the mesh to quantify spoil we   can use the mesh to quantify excavation complete  and we can even use the mesh to generate drawings   so i'm going to show you another example where and  this is a highway project so we're constructing a   highway so we've flown along the alignment of  the highway and and we've in this case taken   the ortho photograph overlaid it on the actual cad  file showing where the actual plan is for the   construction of the highway and we've been using  the drones to monitor the site fill and the site   excavation so typically you will get these kind  of record drawings which the surveyors produce   but they do that by going out with total stations  and staffs and spending hours and hours and hours   over days and days and days collecting the same  information we're able to do this directly from   the mesh so we can actually go out and survey  the site over a matter of hours convert the   photographs into a mesh and then convert that mesh  into a cad file and then we can cut that cad file   so we can actually measure out with great  accuracy the cut volumes the fill volumes   the cumulative volumes and ultimately the  net volumes and we can do that very quickly   the other use that we've got for the drones is in  terms of safety and we've used drones in a number   of examples but this one i'm going to show you  is a a good example so we had a shotcrete wall failure due to water ingress and you can  see there are some large chunks of concrete so   we instead of sending in staff and surveyors to see what's going on we send in the drones   and again you're looking at a 3d mesh from the photography taken by the drone so this mesh   we can measure we can measure the size of these  rocks we can estimate the weight of these elements   we can check for where this potentially unstable  and we can work out a plan for resolving this   issue on site so the drones are a very good tool from a safety perspective by using them   another example is surveying for the purpose of  confirming as-built information or in this case   confirming that the as-built information is not correct  here you can see an excavation at one   of the stations in the middle of the city and you  can see in the middle of the image a concrete wall   and this is actually a tbm launch location  so we're going to set up a tbm we're going   to drive it out through that wall and we're  going to drive underneath this old building   and and we were given a set of plans but the  plans didn't tally with what we were seeing on site   so we wanted to survey this building so we use  the drones to serve the building we had a set of   as-built drawings but we knew they weren't correct  and we were particularly concerned about one area   where on the drawings there was no major structure  but the building was obviously much bigger and   much more substantial so we took the drones we  surveyed the site you can see the site is in the   bottom corner you can see the building of interest  is in the top and then what we did was basically   zoomed into the area of concern and we identified  that this structure was not on the record plans   and then we were able to use the drone survey  model and these images to actually build out   a structural model that we were able to use  for settlement analysis and risk assessments   so we were able to mock up basically what we  thought the structure was and this structure is   actually over the top of the tunnel excavation so  this is part of our risk assessment risk modeling   exercise so we use the drones as a survey tool  rather than clambering around the building and   trying to get access to roofs and everything  else so it allows us to do this kind of surveys   so that's how we're using the drones to create  tools for bim and for 3d modeling what we also   wanted to do was make this information  available to the entire project team   so on the project we're using arcgis as a platform  for delivering geographical information so that   could be map information tunneling information  borehole logs etc etc and one of our team   Tony Joseph is a GIS specialist and he was able  to work out a process where we could convert   the mesh that comes from the drone  into a web-based delivery across the   gis platform so you could use gis to access the  information so let me show you how that works so this is the gis arcgis platform this is  a web-based platform so you just access this   through a browser you don't need any particular  software and this is the 3d mesh this is again   Chan Sow Lin station and this is the mesh you can  see it loading up the background and we also have   input the revit mesh so we've got a mesh from  revit for the structure and we've got the   photogrammetry mesh so if you have access to the  gis platform you can go to any of the construction   sites you can open up and look at the current  or the latest survey information and the latest   bim or digital engineering information and  you can overlay the two together in this gis   environment so you can actually start to study  what progress has been made on site and what   what work has that to be left to be complete and  this has been a very powerful tool because this   project is so large it's physically impossible  to visit all the sites on a regular basis   but it is actually very beneficial for  people to be able to look at these models   and the other thing that's important to recognize  is that a lot of the design teams are not all   based in malaysia so we have designers that  are operating in singapore they're operating   in hong kong they've got staff working in  the philippines in india in taiwan by giving   them these surface models it gives them the  chance to review what's happening on site and   identify any particular issues or particular  concerns and make sure that the team are all   aligned so making this information available  online is actually very very beneficial and then just for a bit of fun when we were doing  the tunneling activities this is actually a video   that i captured from our facebook feed and so  we used a drone and we actually ran a video   and this is the tbm this is the first tbm  breakthrough so this is the actual first tbm   drive breakthrough we've been working this project  for four years and while this goes back to kind of   late 2018 it was a great successful milestone  for the company to actually make sure that we   deliver the first tunnel successfully  but to see that image captured by drone   and to see the drone feeding the video directly  to social media channels that the public can watch   was unique so for those of you don't know if you  have a dji drone you can make them web enabled   and you can live stream the video from them and  we don't recommend it on a regular basis but   in terms of showing unique opportunities or showcasing unique stages in a construction   project it is something that's good fun to do so  as we get towards the end and hopefully there's   going to be a few questions about this process  i just want to give   you a couple examples of how we see this going  forward so we've learned how to use the drones   to capture the meshes we've learned how to use  them to interact with models how to put it on gis   and we've used them for things like safety reviews  quantification etc we're still understanding   what we can do so now we've set out to do we've  mapped out what we can do with future projects   so we understand that the drones give us a  much better level of inspection so in theory   if we if we flew the drone on a daily basis  we'd have probably very very powerful records   of the site at every at every stage and we  don't think that's necessary but if we do  fly every week we'll have a very good record of  the progress of site over a long period of time   and if the drones become more efficient in terms  of their battery life we could actually use them   for key traffic analysis so particularly for major  operations in and around key areas so we may use   the models to plan out traffic activities we may  use the models to plan out traffic diversions and   we may even use the drones to monitor traffic at  certain times so we see there's an opportunity   around traffic management and then obviously  for updating communication to the clients   to the public this notion of being able to  take the meshes make them available in a gis   platform make them available to the web it's  a good way for people to see what's happening   in the site and make the client at least aware  and potentially the public of what's happening   in terms of construction projects so these are  some of the uses that we see going forward and   the important thing is that we're committed to  training people and and particularly our surveying   team and our engineering team so we've trained now  over 30 people they're now certified drone pilots   and spotters and you can see how accurate the  information is and how quickly it's done in terms   of surveying we're seeing productivity gains of  the magnitude of 30 to 50 x and the reason we're   seeing that is that the amount of data that  can be derived from an image and the amount   of information in terms of the distances volumes  and the ability to overlay with other information   the ability to incorporate it with cadastral  information to be able to capture that much of   information with a survey team would take 30 times  the amount of effort so drones have completely   transformed our ability to capture information  they don't completely replace surveyors because we   can't use them for setting out we can't use them  for specific tasks when it comes to construction   but in terms of recording and actually doing  general survey they're very very powerful and as   i say we're continuing to find innovative ways  to use drones and obviously hopefully the q&a   will find out how other people have used drones  or in their business if they've been using so   far so that's the end of the presentation  and i think we'll hand over and do a q&a
