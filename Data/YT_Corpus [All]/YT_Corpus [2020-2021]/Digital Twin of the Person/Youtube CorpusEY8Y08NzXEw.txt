 I from San Francisco it's the queue covering RSA Conference 2020 San Francisco brought to you by silicon angle medias welcome back everyone this the cubes coverage from RSA Conference on Moscone South I'm John four hosts of the cube cybersecurity is changing in the next technology is right around the corner and it's got to be invented somewhere and of course essential Labs is part of our next guest is Lisa O'Connor global security R&D Li for Accenture labs at least is working on some of those hard problems all around the world thank you for joining me today thanks for coming on thank you for having me so we always get the good scoop from Accenture because there's a lot of smart people in that company you know they know they got they know their stuff I know you got a huge analytics team I talked to Jean Luc's chatelaine before and I know we've got a massive amount of deep bench of talent but as you have to go do the applied R&D and maybe some of the the crazy ideas you got to start thinking about where the puck is going to be you got to kind of understand that well it's pretty clear to us that cloud is certainly there Palo Alto Networks had a disappointing earnings yesterday because their on-premises business is shipping to the cloud he's seeing hybrid operating model and multi cloud for the enterprise but now you got global challenges so what's the what's the what are you guys working on that's coming tell us so we're working on lots of exciting things and cloud is one of them but some of the things I'm so passionate about and in labs and I have the best job at Accenture don't tell anyone so we are working on like John Luke is working on a flight intelligence we are work robust AI so when we think about AI in the future how do we filled it and know that it's okay how do we put it out there and know it's safe in production we've done the right training we've made our model resilient till it's out there one of the things we see happening and I love AI love it it has great potential and we get great insights out of it but a lot of times we stop we get the insights and we say okay it's in the box we got a couple hits there we're good it's good no maybe not and so really it's it's learning in creating the actually applied attacks on AI and then figuring out what the right defenses are and depending on what type of machine learning you're using those defenses change and so we're having a great time in our lab in Washington DC and working on basically defending AI and building those techniques so that what we put out as Accenture is robust you know it's interesting a I you watch all than some of the hard core you know social justice warriors out there going after Amazon Google because they're doing some pretty progressive things Oh facial recognition Alexa you know a lot of people though I'm scared but if the end of the day they also have some challenges at network security so you have all this AI up and down the stack and one thing I like about what's being talked about in the industry is the shared responsibility model yes so I gotta ask you as AI becomes exciting but also balancing frightening just to people how do you get that shared responsibility model so we get it right do the experimentation without people freaking out so it's kind of like this weird mode we're in now where I want to do more AI because I think it's benefit society but everyone's freaking out yeah so in our tech vision that we just launched the tech vision 2020 there's a lot of talk about value and values which is really important when we think about AI because we can get great value out of it but there's some values piece of it and it's how we're using it how we're getting those insights because the one thing we have this circle and it's between customer experience because the companies that do a customer experience role are going to Excel they're going to keep their clients they're going to do amazing things they're going to become sticky but to do that well you have to be a good custodian of their data and their information and curate experiences that they want and not the creepy ones not the ones they don't want and so we really look at that trust is necessary in that ecosystem and building that and keeping that with clients so that's something that came out of our technology vision and in fact we're going to be talking at the executive Women's Forum this is tomorrow and we're going to be having a panel on AI and defending it which will be very interesting make sure your people film that offers we'd like to get it had a view of it on YouTube after we love those conferences really insightful but I want to get back to what you were too about the fun side you got a lot of new things on your you guys are kicking the tires on scratching the surface on you have two operating labs one in Washington DC and one in Israel what City at Israel's in Tel Aviv slea yeah just north of Tel Aviv it's the hot spot so Silicon Valley DC and Israel hotbeds of Technology now yes what's coming out of those labs what's hot there's so much exciting stuff coming out of our lab in Hertz Leah one of the things that we have and it's it's something that's been long and coming it's been brewing for a while but it's really looking at creating a model of the enterprise security posture and when I say a model of it I'm talking about a cyber digital twin because so much we can't do in our production networks we don't have the capabilities we can look around the room we don't have the capabilities on the stock seam side to ingest all this stuff we need a playground where we can ask the what-ifs where we can run high performance analytics and we do that through a temporal knowledge graph and that's a hard thing to achieve and it's a hard thing to do analytics at scale so that's one of the big projects that we're doing out of our you see digital twins as a framework for that yeah so the knowledge graph we could create digital twins around many things because a digital twin is a model of processes people technologies the statefulness of things and configurations whatever you want to pull in there so when we start thinking about what would we take in to create the perfect enterprise security posture but would give us all the insights and then we can ask the questions about okay how would an adversary do lateral movement through this I can't fix everything that's a ten but I could fix the right ones to reduce the risk impactfully and those are the kind of little sci-fi stuff that's right around the corner the simulation environment what-ifs oh my god the company just got hacked right a business that's just simulation you could get to that's the goal right it absolutely is to ask those good business questions about the data and then to report on the risk of it and the other thing as we move to 5g this problem is getting bigger and bigger and we're now bringing in very disparate kinds of compute platforms computing at the edge and what does that do to our nice little network model that we had that our traditional systems are used to differently just a segmentation of the network and the edge opens up so much more aperture digital twittering knowledge graph in red up knowledge graph I want to get get your thoughts on this I was just having dinner last night with an amazing woman out of New York she's a PhD in computer so I talked about the graphs and what I love riffing on graph databases and the topic came up about databases in general because with the cloud is horizontally scalable you've got all kinds of simulates a lot of elasticity going on it's on a software being written on this you got time series data is you got relational database you got unstructured anything at craps you got to make them all work together this is kind of the unique challenge and with security leveraging the right database and the right construct is a super important thing how do you guys look at that in the lab because is it something that you guys think about or is it gonna be invisible someday oh well you think about it a lot in fact we've had a number of research projects over the last five years now actually six years where we've really pivoted hard in cybersecurity to graph databases and the reason for that is the many-to-many relationships and what we can do in terms of navigating asking the questions pulling on a thread because it's overhunting that's what we're doing in many of these use cases that we're trying to defend an enterprise we're following the next move path based on the newest information of now what the challenges are what the current configuration is so that's really important so graph databases enable that so well now there's still the architecture challenge of ok when I ask a query what am what am i doing am i disrupting the whole apple cart do I have to process everything over or is there a way to do that hell where I can ask my query and because of how I've structured it in storage I can do it much better and I could do it much more efficiently and that I think is where the opportunities are I got it say get excited now on this whole database budget because you think about the logic around what you just said a graph database with that kind of complexity when you factor in contextually different things happening at any given time yes the database needs to be parsed and managed differently yes that's a huge challenge it is a great research challenge which is why we're doing it what are we gonna be able to be have this dynamic self evolving self-governing self-healing data modelling is that coming soon or yeah I hope so we wrote it about it a couple of years ago the self-healing enterprise aspirational but I think I mean we try to get to real time right and we try to get to real time and again refactoring is we talk about what an adversary is going to do or lateral movement to a business process we're talking about a lot of computational horsepower to recalculate all that process it again update it and then again present that back so the number of things we're asking how we're asking it becomes also very good zooming up a little bit high level what we're really talking about here is value of this ADA and when you get into the valuation of the nodes and the arcs and all that graph side anything other databases you got to know what to pay attention to it's kind of like going into the hospital and hearing all these alarms going off at some point you don't know what's until to hear flatline or whatever that's a bathroom I mean this is one that's obvious but now sometimes there's so many alerts there's so many alarms how do you understand at any given time what to pay attention to because absolutely someone's having a problem you want to pay attention to if it's a security alert that's you know prioritized and the devil is in the analytics right what's the question we're asking and the analytics that give us that prioritization and that's non-trivial because there are a lot of there are a lot of other folks that are doing prioritization in a different manner to do it at scale and to do it not just one hop out but I want to go all the way to the crown jewels and I want that whole path navigated and I want to know where to cut along that path that's a hard thing to do and so we've actually developed and we've submitted patents for them but we've developed new analytics that will support that awesome at least I want to ask you kind of a well give you a plug here it's going to get it out because I think it's important skills gaps a big thing so I want it to give you a minute to explain or share what you're looking for and you're hiring who are you looking for proponents the makeup of individuality maybe do stray more academic paper kind of people or practitioners and when you look to hire what are some of the priorities that you look for and who would thrive in an Accenture labs environment take a minute to share what you're looking for yeah so we we love people that think out of the box and those kinds of people come from very different backgrounds and so part of that is some of them we look for you know PhDs that have wonderful applied skills and apply it as a keyword their white papers are great I need to be able to prove something I need to be able to demo something that has value so having the applied skills to a business challenge is really important so that's sort of around understanding the business very important too but our our talent comes from many different areas I mean I kind of joke my lab looks like the UN it's wonderful I have people from across the globe that are in our cybersecurity lab I have a nourishing tanishi lab for 50% women which is also exciting because we want different experiences and we shoot for cognitive diversity right so we're looking for people that think differently about solving problems and are not encumbered by what they've seen in the past because we're trying to be tip of spear and I'm sure you know that from polity we are we are trying to be three to five years over the horizon you guys got a good narrow I always love talking to a century or they have a good vision so I got to ask you the next logical question is I've seen the news you see everyone talking about breaches and this yeah breathe it's not a breach of the doors open there's one there really walking in nothing was really breached come on in you've been error is a big part of it but then breaches I see targeted phishing and all that good stuff but as those stories get told there's a whole nother set of stories that aren't being told that are super important so I'd love to get your thoughts on what are the most important stories that we should be talking about that aren't being talked about yeah so I have two that are friend of mine for me when one thing we come back to and it's it's not sexy it's hygiene it is IT hygiene and so many the large companies and even medium small companies we have legacy technology and keeping that adds complexity it adds to whole breadth and depth of what we have to manage and defend keeping that attack surface simple and small cloud enabled all those good things is a real asset and it makes it much easier to defend so that's kind of the first non-sexy one hygiene the other one I'll say that I think is a challenge that we are not dealing with yet quantum computing right and so we're on the way to getting our post quantum cryptography in place but there's another dimension to it and it's our histories so all of the things that have passed on the wire all the communications with the key exchanges all that brilliant stuff is sitting somewhere once we get to that point where this becomes very routine and it's coming fast we predicted eight years so all that exhaust is somewhere pent up it's somewhere that we have to think about how much data we're keeping as custodians how we're managing it and then we have to think about the exposure from our past and say okay what does that mean but that was out there is it aged enough that it doesn't have value and I think there's a real triage that needs to be done and certainly the hygiene recent good point reminds me the story in each ass he was telling about the the mainframe customer that they couldn't find who had the password they have to find their person was retired ten years earlier can't the password you don't forget things but also there's a human component in all this humans and machines are working together absolutely and that's a huge part of it it's not just machines dominating at all it's going to be a human component it's a societal impact that we're seeing with information and whether that's out in the open or behind closed doors there's all kinds of things looming there are and I think one of the things and the companies that we are seeing who are embracing innovation well are doing a lot of retraining because the things that people are excellent at a is not good at and the things that they are is good that what people are good at so the good news is there is a beautiful teaming there if we retool the skills or if we leave we envision those roles so that people can get into those roles we think that's really important because I'd rather see and I do all the heavy lifting well and be trustworthy and robust and all those great things and the people be doing the much smarter things that require a human does the process serve the purpose is the purpose serve the process the same kind of question right hey I gave great AI that does nothing so it has to be relevant relevance is kind of a big thing and we own that context right humans on that context well thanks for coming in and sharing the insight really appreciate it final question it's always tough to pick your favorite child but what is your most coolest thing you're working on right now uh-huh I'll tell you the cyber digital twin stuff is so cool and what the cyber digital twin stuff is so cool when you see the power of what that picture the analytics can do will show you do you have a demo of that now you do as your online or is it more in person you got to see it more in person oh that's gonna reach out they both exclusive on that I love those simulation of these very event beneficial a lot of learning I mean who doesn't want practice well and a picture and you know that isn't worth a million dollars it's just incredible to look at it and it clicks it clicks of all the potential things you could ask or do and that's the exciting part now as we show this with customers we come in a date with customers they're coming up with a laundry list oh that's the beautiful thing about cloud is a new capabilities are emerging every day yeah and you can use the good ones these so Connors here thank you very much for sharing your insights global security R&B leaf for Accenture labs acute coverage getting all the signal here on the show floor extracting that from all the noise I'm John Fourier thanks for watching
