       [ Glorzos screeching ] I-I hate this! I hate all of this! Yeah, yeah, keep that feedback coming, Morty. It can only help.    Oh, [bleep] Aw, man! How big is this city?! I know, it's like pick a lane. Are you face huggers or industrialists? Damn, feels kinda good when there's no guilt, huh? Yeah, it's -- it's like in "Star Wars." Yeah, just like in "Star Wars." Go nuts!    Nice, Morty! Give a little "yee-haw" if you want. They -- They always do a little "yee-haw" like a cowboy. Yee-- Yee-ha-- Yee-haw. Good enough.    God, I needed this. Honestly, it's been a while since I've been able to just let loose, you know? Just have fun. I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry if I've been taking it out on you. No, I get it. You got a lot on your plate, amigo. I-I just wish you'd open up to me more about it sometimes, you know? I-I-I'm your partner. Thanks, Morty. I mean that. Thank you. Sometimes, I get a little in my head, you know? Hey, man, that head's a good place to be. Just remember to let me in sometimes, you know? Will do, buddy. Mother[bleep]
