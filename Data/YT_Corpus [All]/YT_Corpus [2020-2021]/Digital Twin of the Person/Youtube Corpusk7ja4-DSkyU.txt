 Hi everyone, my name is Alfonso Albaisa I'm senior vice president of Nissan Global Design My name is Tai, executive design director of Nissan Design We're very excited here today because we're going to show you some of our inspiration and early thoughts while we were designing the Z Proto So Tai-san can you walk me through your childhood, in a sense? What were your feelings? Actually, my motivation to be a car designer was the original Z car Then, I became a member of Nissan Design and then I was on the design team for the 300ZX So the Z is quite a special car for me You know, we have the same history in a sense because I also wanted to become a car designer when I first saw the 240Z And on my first trip to Japan, I was lucky enough as a young Nissan designer to probably see you working on the 300ZX And I myself was involved in the design of the 350Z So I know, together we have a lot of shared understanding of the Z What parts did you feel you really wanted to keep for the next one? Well, at first I was not so sure, actually I was trying to create a new Z first But I saw many sketches from the London studio the San Diego studio And then, gradually, I was kind of persuaded that maybe we should go back to the original one Somehow this time everything that we were doing together the things that looked cool, that felt fresh to me ironically were linking back to the very first one I remember the day when we were designing the new one You were talking about the beauty of the line of the 240Z People talk about the 240Z as having a square grille But no, no, the grille is the result of the hood and the fender creating a square hole And I think on the new one we really showed how we can do that in a modern context Yeah, we translated this rule into this new proportion One of the most beautiful stories you told me was about when you were designing on the 300ZX that you had some artist come and talk about the purity of form Well yeah, at that time we had a kind of consultancy with a pure sculptural artist I remember he was just checking the imbalance or the good part of the shape form So I think that is reflected in the 300ZX Actually, the rule is to create a very smooth, nice shape On that, we can draw a nice line So for me, always – maybe this is Japanese design of course a 3-dimensional shape is important – but this nice graphic on a nice shape that is part of Nissan design heritage, I think Which now makes me want to turn to the left Because, as we were developing this together I do feel that this simplicity which the 300ZX has a little bit is captured in this shape where it almost looks like there are no character lines although the structure has them How did you get that kind of minimalism? For me, this line is very, very important With or without it somehow we are showing a kind of 2020 Z It's a strong line but still it's helping to show the modernity or relationship between other cars we are making I think that's what I like Also, I think that line, as you mentioned with the reverse wedge, is very sensual and beautiful But also, it's lowering the center of gravity That, I felt, makes the car look like you're already driving it Right, right Again, that is S30, the original Z, kind of an icon Basically, this line And this – we call it the "katana" line – is helping to create a kind of low cave movement This "katana" is actually one of these devices that kind of came out of nowhere in the process But as you mention it really has a very huge effect on the posture Yes. It shows where the cabin is, where the line goes So it is indicating the silhouette more than the silhouette itself I'm sure people want to know about our headlamp because the most iconic aspect of the 240Z is the scooped lamp with the circle Yeah. You know, we created different types of headlamps The first one was more horizontal to show more of a modern technology feeling But we recognized the kind of roundness is the key to showing the Z-ness So we created this double-arch type of headlamp And of course, I think one of our favorite parts is the rear view And how, in the digital era you brought back your previous project, the 300ZX I like the 300ZX But if we see it now we can see the headlamp is a kind of halogen or kind of an old technology Especially the rear – the theme itself is modern but the technology itself is kind of a previous technology So our intention is to show that kind of feeling with a modern LED signature To be honest, we tried to create a new invention like the 300ZX, at first But we were lucky to create this as a result I mean, we created a different type of Z-ness Then finally, everybody could agree that this is the right balance of modernity, Z-ness, Nissan-ness Well, thanks, Tai-san I want to thank everyone because this is such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any designer And very luckily Tai-san and myself have been involved in a few Zs But to really bring the generations together and to find the best parts of each generation and take it to the next step – it's been an honor And it's been an honor to share with you the early thoughts we had and our team had, on the Z Proto So thank you very much, and see you very soon
