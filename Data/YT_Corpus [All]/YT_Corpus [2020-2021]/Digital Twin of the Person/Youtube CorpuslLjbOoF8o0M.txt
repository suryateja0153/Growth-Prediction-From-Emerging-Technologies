 hello my name is Debbie Reynolds they call me the data diva today I want to talk about identity and data privacy identity is the way that we interact in the digital world for anything that we do so let's say you create an email address you create a bank account if you're doing any of those things online you have a digital identity of sorts the issue with identity or the issue that it should be with identity is that the person that you are in real life should really match up with the person you are digitally but the digital world only has breadcrumbs about us ourselves and the things that we do so if someone were to create like a digital dossier of us on in the digital world it would create fragments of information about us that may or may not be true or it may give someone an outside impression outside impression of us they may not be full or complete a concern with digital identity or identity in general is how do you match yourself your human self with your digital self so there is a theory and identity space about digital twins which means that there will be a replica of you or a representation of you in a digital world and mask you and the human world meaning that it would be able to connect your true identity with any transactions that you do online so for example let's say you create an email address on a free web web service or web search engine the person that's creating the email address doesn't necessarily have to be you and there's really no way to prove that it is you unless they do more extensive testing or more asking questions so in the other example let's say you're creating a bank account your bank may ask you for additional information so that they make sure that you are the person that you say you are the problem is once you leave the bank let's say if someone has access to your phone and has your password they can bank or do transactions as if they were you so there is a plan to move forward with things called a single identity or a single sovereign identity which is finding ways to match things like information about a person things like biometrics and other information to make sure that you are who you say you are so that it will stop things like identity theft or stop other types of hacking or nefarious things that happen on the internet the damaged people's you know lives or their financial status so I'm very excited to see what people technologies people are coming up with things like tokenization or things like having ATM machines or people go to they help identify them using things like retina scans or other biometrics like like face scans or thumb prints things like that combined with other information to make sure that people's identities are uncrackable or they are not able to be used so freely as they are right now with things like identity theft or impersonation of individuals on the internet that's it thank you you [Music]
