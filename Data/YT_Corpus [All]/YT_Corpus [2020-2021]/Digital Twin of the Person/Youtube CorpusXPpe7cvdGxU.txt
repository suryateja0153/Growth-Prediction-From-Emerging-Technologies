subscribe and the Bell notification button next to it because it means you get notifications whenever we post videos like this videos of us scratching our belly buttons stay tuned for at twickenham tour oh i'm philip burned I'm in my mid-50s hi I'm Gary I'm 61 hi I'm Gavin I'm 52 hi my name is Adam I'm 48 years old and I love BTS and I'm a BTS phone and I'm army used to be sort of like more old school dance music I'm trying things that some of the artists prodigy I like all sorts of music so ranging from the Beatles to Adele to snow cold the snow place over troll even I was really into the Manic Street Preachers at one time tons the sparks I don't you know air Sparks right okay that's a lot the mobile 90s sort of 90s too unlimited snap I'm seeing Keane in a couple of days in Copenhagen you name it I love it Fleetwood Mac that sort of thing Rolling Stones I mean it's like the dam was the voice of music always been to concerts of music maybe the Beatles yes about three years now yeah 34 years ago probably about two years ago but I travel the world quite a lot and I have some Korean friends and somebody told me you must listen to BTS so I thought yeah the polite thing to do so I listened to what was then their most recent album map with a sword persona I thought this is really good classically it was my daughter who brought me into it she she's a bad fan and one day she announced to me this I got to hear this new boy band from Korea oh here we go my daughter got into BTS and you know and the whole impact it had on her and the rest of the family and that's when I became a fan as well and I like the you know the message about love yourself and all that what they do is really really cool I couldn't understand a word of the lyrics other than the English and chorus lines but it just sounded really good so then I got more interested and started to research it a bit more it wasn't until my doctor show me the video to dope that was nearly 2 mean RF years ago now by the way I went expecting a real sort of rocky you know Howard rock style but the song she played was actually DNA so that was a good introduction to them then I started to to read all of these need the lyrics translated and started to understand some of the the meanings behind it which got me more and more interested I then learned that the boys write most of the lyrics themselves which I thought was really quite profound for the boy so young and I was quite surprised that I would like them I didn't so much fight them at first but I thought yeah I'll listen to them I'll give them a first out blown away [Music] I think they're just a wholesome band that there they are what they portray they're not false the message is fantastic that they've but they put over and you know that is something that really comes across the genuine I think they really are GNU many what they say because a lot of pop bands obviously say the right things you know well these are genuine they just come across as really good nice people as lack of said the the energy they bring to the stage the commitment they bring to the stage it's kind of it's different if that makes sense it's it's kind of a it's an experience more than just listening to the music with me I got into pts through the music first year I just thought there's some really lovely harmonies great tunes I just like the music yeah yeah it is it was different to what I've sort of liked in the past and I really liked it yeah now this is do all sorts of styles they do with the rapper to do the classic soft stuff you know so right across the board they seem more dedicated to what they do but that's but I think that's also because I've seen the bring the soul movie last year as well so I saw some of that as what we saw at cinema and that kind of vibe from my eyes as to how much dedication they put in and you know how much effort it actually is to do what they do I've never done this with any other group before or band before I've just been purely about the music but the whole journey just intrigues me so it's kind of it's the journey so I've just started watching some of the I've watched a lot of the what they called the video bomb thing is army bombs and I've started watching some of the run BTS again in reverse order I just find some of them very very funny because the genuine who they actually mean what they say and that's a positive thing for children of any age well for me actually so I I went on a week holiday in in Seoul which is fantastic and part of that was a was the BTS tour they also included going so I can't pronounce the name so forgive me but where they were they shared a dormitory which is just this crummy little office on the third floor we actually got up to the third floor we did we couldn't get into the building cuz it was that sorry that the room itself it was locked but I just love the idea of these seven I think it was nine at one point trainees living in this tiny place there must have stank like hell having to run up the hill to to aunties to have their lunch and trained in every single day just you know the friendship the camaraderie that kind of appeals to me I mean I know that's what I've known has been manufactured yes they were put together but there's a real bond I think that's developed yeah which I think many bands just don't have [Music] I've tried listening to a couple of things but actually that music doesn't work so in my mind all over clearly Korean and they come under the kpop ban I do I don't think of them as what I thought kpop is but then what do I know so it's opened the door to other k-pop groups like straight kids I know a little bit about Super M we were we almost went to see black King when they came to Manchester but we didn't yeah I've been getting into more kpop now yeah yeah SHINee and I've been getting into epic high as well 80s that was the other one the 80s was the other people and I've kind of seen on you know obviously I've seen them perform everyone in house really so yeah we watched on YouTube I've yet to go to a concert but the rest of the family have all been to a concert last year so we're hoping to go this year so so my kids are aware of my my love of BTS I'm trying to educate them it's not quite some their music yet so it primaries for myself obviously talk to Amy and wife Jill yeah yeah I'm not I'm a member of one group on Facebook I tend to be because of I'm a dad another bit older I tend not to be as excited about this sort of thing so I said have you ever heard of BTS and they just felt laughing to begin with but so they're coming around I don't hide it obviously if people want to know I'll talk about it but I don't I try not to protect it too much because it's it's probably not the done thing for somebody of my age to do but I'll tell people that I do like them no none of my friends really know there are though so there's a bit weird that no one's been so heard of them but no from family a bit should we say a bit puzzled although I have got one Ally I've got a cousin who's well into them and she a she and a daughter came to Wembley and I have mentioned my my discover of PS to a number of my friends at a similar age and most of its been polite smiles we say on board I mean the amis but some some are nice to me cuz they have to be nice to me because of what I do friends are a little bit are you serious they're a boy band and the Korean you know but I always tell them listen to them just don't don't judge listen to them you'll see why I go into them don't feel really overs them to be honest I mean it's my choice no it doesn't talk yeah I get the roll dice sometimes when I tell them or I get there who and all that sort of business but I like to educate people and try and steer them into that direction I think actually that I think they think is quite cool if that's happy then they think it's great if they let me play it in the car which is nice I haven't no not really I've I've said to him I have you heard of him before he was going to go to memory I was saying to him you know we can't Wimbley and there's the old [Music] that's totally fine no yes yeah there's not knows no weirdness associate with it's always no school people are saying it you know you do reality our boy band you don't think it's a bit inappropriate for you to like them and I'm thinking well I like the music I don't see what the problem is speaking of career we're hoping to go to career this year's home fully if things work out but that's not just for beats yes obviously it's a culture thing that she likes the culture and the people but yeah I don't know they seemed it just seemed to be a bit of keep it quiet that you like beats yes I'll shout it from the rooftops if I need to I'm quite happy to spread the message you know so they said that the experience was absolutely amazing they said it was you have to be there to experience it cuz we've seen it on TV now since and they said it's just not the same as being actually there and actually in the in the stadium Oh unbelievable I didn't expect to enjoy it that much I mean I was obviously going to enjoy it because I wasn't the daughter as well but we were absolutely I was blown away when we Stadium yeah yeah Oh superb inside and out of the stadium everybody was so happy everybody was so chatty there was no age barriers cuz I I was obviously aware you know an old dad sort of thing well I didn't have to worry at all when we stadiums so being in the earth I just totally forgot how big it always was when we went there [Music] I mean this year's gonna be total domination of course with a new album and the tour obviously they're just getting bigger and bigger and just an emotional trip for them I think I don't really think they can get much bigger than they are doing but I think it's recognition that they lock in for some reason as big as they are quite a lot of people and I find this when I talk about them who are BTS and I think they should probably I don't know if they can work on able I think we as Army need to put the message out a bit wider to people so I think they reached the pinnacle I think the question is rather what happens next obviously with a national service question coming up and our good friend Jin I think has to go at the end of the year I believe all there are there abouts so I think the question for me is actually what happens the band after 2020 I think obviously this tour was gonna send out like it did before so hopefully they were do more tours and get bigger that's very sad I mean III as big as they are I thought they would have been an automatic there on the radio every day but we as my my daughter does the same thing with scouting we're looking for them on the radio we can't find them these guys are good they're good at what they do the sounds that produce a wonderful the dancing is wonderful and the message of port cross is fantastic they can't do any better than the message important across it's all positive I can't see any negatives about them the the BTS music is brain for kids I think the messaging the self-confidence yeah a little ticket Authority as well I think it's fantastic it's fantastic I think the message really is love yourself and it doesn't matter you know whether you know who you are what you are what you do and it's just you know be proud of yourself and love yourself it's all positive it's all love and happiness and I don't see any negativity about them at all the sort of guys that you know I could be introduced to my daughter basically here so I'm happy that she likes them and she adores them but with BTS music I feel very safe if they can get into I think could be brilliant for them but you can't push them they have to develop it I got little hints yeah but I definitely think that by BTS is a safe bet for kids to listen to and I think the message that they're trying to you know transmits everyone is a really good message yeah I have young kids I try and tell their media to be more confident you know to like what like what's in you this is really a fantastic message coupled with some really really good music be good to each other be nice focus on your dream go for your dream do it [Music] definitely heard yeah yeah insert oh it's brought us closer together when we're always close anyway because she don't have to live with me now but we were always close but this is really brought us close she gets very emotional that I like them which is fantastic for me and I think for me it's it's you know it's the impact he's had on the rest of the family's been so it's been so positive and I'm not forcing that I do genuinely like them so we talk about BTS all the time we texted each other about them have you seen this latest video obviously in the latest news when other tickets are twickenham going on yeah i strengthened it's made it yeah obviously brought us closer together and brought everyone closer together to be fair hey sir yes I there's a really positive impact on everyone what she said dad don't worry it's actually so cool that you're doing just a cool dad and I mean for a father to hear that from a teenage daughter doesn't get any better does it [Music] have a bias we were talking about this earlier I have to actually so the obvious one of course is Namjoo unique and kim namjoon because he's just super bright 148 IQ I believe jailed why is a such a smiley person it's always smiling he's always happy he seems like the Joker of the pack and he's just a nice guy but I've got a bias wrecker and that's that's a here I want me to meet my daughter and marry her because she's think RN I think our him and some of the real profound stuff comes from him so I think he's an absolute superstar but I love the fact actually that he's also quite clumsy and forgetful which the traits that I share and you're gonna say why I think it was to do with the fact that he he was talking at the end of the film you know bring the soul and that that's a bit that kind of best a bit I think that got to me to be fair so that's a he's kind of stood out more so when I see the videos he's the one I kind of see more than the others so I have a soft spot for Gina's well Ashley because I haven't percent that I tell lots of awful Pathan jokes which my kids just roll their eyes out why he's Jay hope and my oldest daughter is Jimmy no not yet not yet of the fact that the BTS don't laugh which are they laugh a laugh at him I think but not with him know particularly sugar [Music] well I don't what would I like to say to BTS that's what I like to thank them for what they're doing I would thank them for for doing what they do and to make them keep on doing what they do and don't change cinema missing yeah I think that's a thank you you know thank you for everything you've done and all the effort you've put in and you know and keep on people and doing what you're doing and just thank them for putting a good message across and making people like my daughter very happy for bringing enjoyed a lot of people but selfishly to have given me a whole new genre of music which I thought I would never get into in a million years artists a really yeah just you know just probably just thank them for what they've been doing and just say okay everyone with the good work they're doing yeah and I think Ashley I'm never ordered by people but I think if I met some RM Kim Namjoo he's probably the one person I would actually be a bit starstruck Ashley I thought the same to begin with but as you research online you can get to realise actually their audience their fan base is quite diverse so I think I think they appeal to everyone and I haven't I haven't really noted that they it's screaming teenage girls to be fair I think there's a lot of people that you know a lot of people from all different backgrounds that like them I'm 52 year old and no I really really enjoy when I went to the house of BTS in Seoul I am I did seek we fear that I might stand out like a sore thumb here and yes the majority of the people there were younger Korean girls but but there were so many such a huge minority of people who looked a bit like me or you know different races and I felt very at home though and also the attitude that there's no giggling and pointing I just felt very at home there would not solve III again I was I must admit I have that stereotype in my head and yeah there were a lot of screaming girls obviously especially in front of us but no there was a there was a great mix of it of people people my age people old or even having seen the people coming out I drove down to pick the guys up after the concert and it wasn't all streaming you know screaming teenage girls coming out it was people from all all walks of life and all ages we've heard them on radio what I think Jessica heard them on us and independent radio station one saw where I live it's kind of frustrating in a way because you kind of look for it and we've got the digital radio in the car and you never never see only they're never on so I tend to play on an app it got to the point where she was actually texted me to say there on the radio she's quite excited about it but I think they should be on a lot more than they are so I've got the Amazon music app and I play it through that but yeah it's frustrating I don't know why it's on it's not on the radio because I save they filled out wind blew two days on the trot at 90,000 people each day but yeah they've been on the radio a handful of times i've only heard him once or twice maybe on the radio don't see they come on a couple of chats oh yeah Simon Graham Norton yeah yeah obviously they was on The Late Late Show wasn't they they've been on that a few times it was it seems to be becoming America yeah when a single drop so no I know though on TV once on Graham Norton but didn't Simon Cowell haven't won one of them Britain's Got Talent yeah and that's that's it so exposure really I suppose from popular media has not been that not been that good for them would be a travesty if they didn't I mean they you know they're obviously already a global brand extremely popular with everyone so yeah I think now I think they're probably both getting more to airtime in the national radio I don't see what the there are other songs have been played in foreign languages esposito and all that unless people don't seem to question that but I don't know I don't get all this negativity about the foreign language and of course they do sing in English as well so I mean it's the same when we go abroad we expect people to speak English and it's a bit arrogant and a bit wrong but we work it on it hopefully thanks so much for watching this
