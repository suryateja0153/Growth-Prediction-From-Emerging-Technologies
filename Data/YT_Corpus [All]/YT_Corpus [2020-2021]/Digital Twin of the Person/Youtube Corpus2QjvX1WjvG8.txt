 [Music] the best way to understand the value of my inventory okay study this case is based on the order to cash process of a multinational manufacturing organization the organization has a turnover of more than seven billion dollars 21,000 employees and presence in over 50 countries the organization chose to use my inventio to carry out the analysis and monitoring of its order to cash process it had as an objective to analyze the behavior of the process so that it could identify opportunities to improve its overall efficiency secondly it wanted to identify the critical activities with regards to cost and time thirdly to monitor how the lead time of the process and the sales orders varied according to each customer finally to discover the resources intended as human resources or artificial agents who are key to the process and verify their compliance with the segregation of duties in order to carry out the analysis with my inventio it was necessary to first verify which systems were involved in the activities of the order to delivery process thereafter thanks to the Mayan video scripts a dataset of all the events was imported the imported events were related to the sales orders in 2016 Mayan venue to its powerful algorithms elaborated the data set and automatically mapped the streamlined order to cash process as you can see a lean approach is used for the representation of the process the rectangles represent the activity and the color shows the frequency at which the activity occurs instead the arrows highlight the paths between the activities and the density of the arrows also reflect the frequency in this way it is possible to notice which the most frequent activities are in this case the line creation the logistic block removed the delivery and the good issue to answer the organization's first question which was to analyze the behavior and to identify opportunities to improve the process it was necessary to start from the variant analysis yielded by my inventio by variant we mean the grouping of cases that follow the same path by looking into the most frequent variants it was established that in 26.1% of the cases the orders are delivered in four activities with an average lead time of 24 days in 11 hours this is the happy path or in other words it is considered to be the organization's ideal path the second most frequent variant represents twenty five point three percent of the cases and is very similar to the previous one in this case it was also considered as an ideal path by the organization the only difference is that there is an additional activity involved the header block removed this activity greatly affects the average lead time in fact it takes 40 days and 21 hours on average for the process to complete this path there are two other interesting variants amongst the most frequent paths the first variant occurs in 5.9 percent of the cases and basically represents the orders that are canceled we can easily examine why the average cancellation time of an order turns out to be 3 days in 11 hours instead the second variant occurs in 4 percent of the cases it is a noteworthy variant because it represents the orders that have been subjected to a change of delivery date request as in the case of the canceled orders the organization did not consider these cases to be happy paths in the last scenario the average lead time as 60 days and 3 hours at this stage the organization by looking into the analysis of the variance decided to analyze in greater depth the underlying causes of the most frequent deviations in contrast to the discovered happy path furthermore the organization wanted to understand the differences between the compliant cases with regards to the time and cost that is to say that they have followed the happy path and the non-compliant variant or in other words the case has had at least one deviation from the happy path this analysis has been made possible by Mayan videos conformance checking functionality in this functionality you can define the happy path that you want to use you can either import an external business process analysis system that follows the BPMN standard draw the happy path by the use of Mayan veneer or use the happy path that was automatically derived from the data by Mayan veneer as you can see the happy path is the combination of the first two variants that we have been looking at at this stage it was possible to carry out the conformance check between the automatically derived model from the data and the happy path once again the differences could be identified in an intuitive and visual manner in green the deviations are highlighted with regards to the happy path these are the paths that are not present in the ideal process the activities in red are present in the happy path but are never carried out in the automatically derived model from the data Mayan venue also compares every single order with the happy path this allowed the organization to look into the cases that were compliant in this case it involved twenty thousand three hundred orders with an average lead time of thirty two days and thirteen hours and with an average of five activities per case given the fact that it is possible to specify the standard costs of the activities and the resources in my inventio it is possible to look into the average cost per conformed case which was $18 on the other hand there were 19 thousand 300 non-compliant cases that had worse performances these orders took an average of 44 days and 10 hours to complete that is about 40 percent more than the compliant orders they were on average made up of seven activities and cost $26 on average an interesting aspect of conformance checking is the possibility to understand which deviations occur moe frequently and to be able to compare the performance of the process for every individual deviation the analysis revealed that the change of delivery date activity turned out to be the most frequent deviation from the happy path in fact this activity happened in 9400 cases whilst analyzing the statistics of this deviation it was possible to deduct that when this activity is carried out the time to complete the process rose up to 59 days in 11 hours and the average cost per case became 31 dollars and 10 cents using the root cause analysis feature the organization was able to identify the contextual data that influenced the change of delivery date deviation the second objective of the analysis was to identify the most critical activities concerning cost in time my envenomate sit possible to derive a visualization of the process from data with a focus on the performance in fact thanks to the density of the arrow it was possible to see that the change of delivery date activity had an average waiting time of 24 days and 20 hours on top of that the delivery activity was pending on average for 28 days in two hours when it was carried out after the logistic block removed activity with the same lean approach that was used for the frequency view it is possible to identify the critical activities relating to the performance at first glance the organization had also defined the desired service levels for the completion of the activities they were incorporated in Mayan venue through its key performance indicator functionality at this stage when returning to the process view it was possible to verify which activities were critical in terms of the organization's KPIs in this case the most critical activities were the logistic block removed and the change of delivery date it was also possible to verify this in the dashboard feature in this feature the graph correlates all the activities with the standardized KPIs to quickly identify which do not follow the service level agreement to understand which activities are critical in terms of cost the analysis of the changes blocks was used this means that the activities that were considered to be blocking the process and activities that were considered to be changing the process were identified via the configured advanced analytics dashboard we can see that the most expensive activity block was the logistic block removed activity the organization spend about 192 thousand dollars a year with an average cost of five dollars and 11 cents per case whilst the most expensive change activity turned out to be the change of delivery date activity with an annual cost of around seventy thousand five hundred dollars in an average cost per case of five dollars and 33 cents both activities had the highest average cost per case in their classification of changes in blocks to summarize my inventio identified two critical activities the logistic block removed and the change of delivery date activities from a performance KPI and a cost point of view the third objective was to discover the key resources human resources or artificial agents who were indispensable in the process and to verify their compliance with the segregation of duties in this case the use of the social network analysis was fundamental this representation showed all the active resources of the organization both human and automated systems such as BOTS or system jobs of the process in the shape of nodes the size of the node represents the number of activities that have been executed the more activities a resource carries out the larger the node is instead the relationships between the resources are represented by the arches between the nodes the denser the arch the stronger the relationship between the two resources the color of the cluster of the node represents the role of each resource once again in an intuitive way it is possible to distinguish the nodes at first glance and therefore distinguish the key resources of the entire process instantaneously in this case it was a surprise to see that the resources Peggy and Paul with the master scheduler roles were the two key resources of the process in fact as these resources were blue colors without any associated retention policy the organization was exposed to an inefficiency risk since they could decide to leave the organization at any time lastly we can also see that mark was a key resource in the process mark had the role of customer service representative the organization also expressed the need to be able to check whether the resources were carrying out activities that were in line with their roles and responsibilities via the activity map feature in which the list of activities is shown in the middle and the resources are displayed on each side we are able to distinguish by hovering over or by selecting a resource or role which activities are being carried out by a person or by a group of people in this instance we discovered that the role of the local IT throughout the period of the analysis had carried out some activities such as the change of delivery date and the line creation that were not part of their responsibilities this insight prompted the organization to execute specific audits on these orders for further investigation the final objective was to monitor how the lead time of the process and the sales orders varied in respect to each customer thanks to Mayan videos advanced analytics feature it is possible to create a dashboard that responds to all the business questions such as the ones that we have just answered for this scenario we created a dashboard that was called the tableau du board in which among other things a bar chart was created where all the orders were grouped according to the customers the bar chart showed in blue bars the total number of orders per customer and in orange the average lead time once again with a lean approach it was possible to immediately identify the customers with lead time problems for example the power and telephone supply have an average lead time of around 80 days this was way past the preferred average of 38 days by selecting the client and filtering the dashboard it was possible to verify which process variants concerned this customer exclusively in this way we could see for example that the second most frequent variant showed by the blue path had a lead time of over 115 days and was defined as a change of delivery date activity with the comparison feature of my invention compare the process performance and activities of this specific client against the best performing client kgp telecommunication we immediately discovered that there was an average lead time difference of nearly forty days between the two clients this was essentially caused by the address missing block removed activity this activity was blocking the order because of a lacking address to which the goods had to be sent in fact the customer with the worst lead time took nearly forty days compared to the other customer that took only one day through this feature it is also possible to compare the design of the processes by comparing the design of the processes we are able to identify the specific paths that are followed by the customers these paths have orange and blue colors respectively following my in videos analysis the organization was able to identify their best course of action first of all the organization was able to plan a redesign of the process to reduce the logistic black activity which resulted in an estimated cost saving of $100,000 in an average lead time of two days thereafter an organizational intervention was carried out to improve the alignment of the customer service and the final customer that would ultimately reduce the change of delivery date activities by an estimated cost saving of $50,000 in an average process lead time of three days finally thanks to the intervention in the critical activities the logistic block and the change of delivery date and the constant monitoring of the variability of the lead time per customer the orders that reached the expected KPIs increased by 25% to summarize it was therefore thanks to the use of my inventio that the organization was able to obtain a 15% increase in efficiency of the overall lead time a cost reduction of 18% an increase of the service level of 25% kickstart your process digital transformation try Mayan videos freemium version today you
