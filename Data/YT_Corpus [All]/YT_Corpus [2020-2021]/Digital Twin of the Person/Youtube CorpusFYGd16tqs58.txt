 this is the triumph speed twin roadster  1200 cc and i'm sure you'll agree it's   a beautiful looking bike and straight from  the outset i want to apologize for the wind   uh every time i film this year it's about a 60  mile an hour gale force wind and today is no exception before you even get on this bike you can tell  just by looking at it that it's going to be a   good bike in the corners it's built for the  corners you've got a very short wheelbase   it's got a 22.8 degree very steep rake  and it's got a 93.5 millimeter trail   so with those dimensions it's built for cornering  and for leaning down in the bends setting off for   the first time on this bike it's ever  so easy to ride it's lovely and simple   it looks beautiful because it's so short it  feels like half the bike's missing to me because   the front wheel's almost where your toes are  it's a very short motorcycle and realistically   for someone of my height it's way too small as  you can see if i get on i'm six foot three and   it's like you know it really is a tiny bike my  feet are behind me my hands are here there's   not a lot of room so this is a bike built for  someone about five foot seven five and eight and   if you're that kind of height it's the perfect  bike because it's got beautiful looks it's very   classic modern um but it's the sort of bike you  can have a bit of fun and lay it down in the   corners as well and the engine is phenomenal  it's got a lot of power and a lot of torque   which will go into the figures later but it  really does pull and it's a lovely bike to ride   it's a good looking engine it's actually water  cooled but it looks air cooled it's got uh 97 ps   which is 96 brake horsepower or 72 kilowatts and  the peak power is at 6750 rpm and it likes to rev   um below 2000 rpm it doesn't like it at all but  it's not a sort of bike you're going to ride at   low revs anyway it likes to rip so from 3000 to  its maximum it's in its best and most happy state   uh the torque on this is 112 newton meters  that's 82.6 pounds foot of torque and that   peaks at 4950 rpm so it's got more torque than it  has power which i always like so it's a beautiful   engine it really is and it's the same bonneville  engine that's in most of the uh all of the classic   uh modern classic uh range of bonneville bikes  and in in each version they sort of tune it   differently so in this it's built for some  acceleration and it's a phenomenal bit of kit now it's got a six-speed gearbox and what a  lovely gearbox it is i must say it's very smooth   up and down whether you blip the throttle or not  it will change beautifully so um absolutely full   marks on that now like i said this bike is built  for the corners not only the dimensions but the   tyres and wheels themselves 17-inch at the front  and rear we've got 120-70 tires on the front   and one 60 60 on the rear and they're wide  enough to be very good in the corners and grippy   but not so wide that you spoil the handling now  not only does it accelerate very well it breaks   very well you've got twin discs at the front  four part calipers and they're 305 millimeters   in diameter at the front and a single  disc 220 millimeter at the rear with   a two piston caliper and the stopping  uh power is very very very good indeed now as i said earlier it's not a bike for tall  people but what is i mean if you're over six   foot one six foot two um you start to struggle  with most bikes because they become way too small   underneath you and it's not about the seat height  so much because you could raise this seat to here   it's still a short bike so it's still gonna look  small underneath you what we really need for the   taller guys as i've said before is the length  of the wheelbase so a bike like this is probably   not going to be on your list but saying that  i am 6 foot 3 and i can ride it perfectly well   the seat height is 807 millimeters that's 31.7  inches um so yeah you can ride it for sure but   as i said before the perfect height for this  bike is about five foot seven five foot eight um the wheelbase of the speed twin  is 1430 millimeters to be precise   and the weight is only 196 kilograms so for  what it is it's a lightweight bike and as i said   before everything goes towards that being a very  maneuverable bike personally as a cruiser rider i   find the handling to be very twitchy but if you're  from a sports bike you'd find it absolutely fine so the triumph has a 14.5 liter fuel tank um it  does 4.84 liters per 100 kilometers and that is 59   miles per gallon so out of the tank you're going  to get a 302 kilometer range which is 187 miles   which is pretty good uh obviously depending on  how you ride whether it's up or down on that   unlikely to be up more likely  to be down um and it's got a 10   000 mile per kilometer actually 10 000  kilometers service um interval so that's   pretty good too so um you can get a lot of  riding in a year for your service intervals so we're gonna work our way through the triumph  range um we've done the rocket through you may may   have seen the video if you haven't please check  that out um so we're starting with a speed twin   we're going to work our way through the modern  classics the bonnevilles the scramblers etcetera   i doubt we'll go on to any of the other  trials because they're not particularly   a good fit for our channel but we'll see  what happens but i do like the bonnevilles   i do like the look of the bikes i love the  classic look of them and the quality is   superb um it's a british company triumph um  whether these are made in the uk i don't know   um i haven't been told that um and it's  not sort of publicized particularly   someone might tell me it's made in taiwan or  somewhere but to be quite honest if it's a   good bike and it's good quality does it really  matter where in the world it's manufacturing now let me whiz through a few basic specs  uh before we get on to uh more about how   the bike rides and feels um and also obviously  at the end of the video we'll put all the specs   anyway so you can go to the end and read them  so basically we have a ride by wire throttle   which you have on most motorcycles these days uh  you've got abs and switchable traction control   you've got uh three modes road rain and sport  all self-explanatory um a talk assist clutch   which you can feel it's very nice usb  charger and an immobilizer as standard   now it's a classic yet modern design you've got  conventional forks which work very well they   soak up the bumps well i'm riding today  on the fins i'm actually at home woods   and i think it's called home post or something  it's the lowest literally the lowest point   in the whole of the uk so i'm actually about  10 feet or 10 meters i can't remember below   sea level here so if the sea uh decides to flood  and break the barriers i will be swimming home   so moving on uh it's gonna radiate up the front  very discreetly input it looks like an air cooled   engine but it's not um you've got a lovely classic  design top quality parts and metals i love the   exhaust they sweep up one either side it's got  a nice tone to it it pops and bangs a little bit   when you decelerate twin shot rear and chain drive  and alloy wheels which all add to the handling and   the stiffness of the ride i prefer the look of  spoked wheels but on a good handling bike that   you're going to lean over you get a better ride  a better quality of feel with an alloy wheel   now it's very nice to have a flat bench seat uh as  i've said before i can't stand scoop seats um it's   been washed before i got on it and it's actually  quite slippery so with all the acceleration this   has got have to be very careful to grip on my  knees so not to shoot off the back um but we're   doing a video about uh this grippy seats and i  found a product that can help with that problem so   please stay tuned and make sure you subscribe not  to miss that one because that's a very good tip   of course at the rear you've got this little  extension here for your enormous british   number plate which is the same size on a  motorcycle as you have on the largest lorry   on the road so who thought of that i don't know  surely by now with the technology and the digital   age we could think of a better thing to have than  a number plate there must be some sort of digital   thing anyway handlebars they're quite narrow so  if you're in traffic if you're lane splitting   you've got the far end mirrors and um because  i'm leaning forward quite a lot the visibility   is probably fifty percent of the road behind me in  the mirrors but if you are the height that you're   supposed to be on this bike five at seven five  eight you'll probably be fine but i'm too wide   and too big and too tall to get the full view  of the mirror um you've got lovely twin dials   at the front retro dials you've got a analog  speedometer and rev counter and it relies at   six seven eight thousand rpm is the the maximum uh  number it goes up to on here and then you've got   the little digital displays with all the other  bits and pieces which i mentioned at the end i must say a big thank you once again  to webb's motorcycles of peterborough   they also lent us the rocket 3 which we reviewed  a week ago so make sure you've seen that video   as well we're now in a very strong position with  our youtube channel mr darcy and the old man   to uh be able to review the latest bikes that  come out so we've got access coming up to the   2021 bikes from triumph honda harley davidson and  other manufacturers so we're right there for next   year is going to be a big year for this channel  and hopefully you can go along with us and help us   to achieve that success and another way of helping  us would be to buy some of our merchandise you   can see the t-shirts in the carousel below now  apologies if i'm shouting i'm trying to get my   voice above this gale force wind that we're  experiencing again who is this bike for um   young or old i would say it's got a wide age  appeal you've got to be someone who wants a bike   that handles well and corners beautifully but say  the flip side to handling well is stability and   it's uh from my point of view a little bit twitchy  but i'm used to a cruiser as i've already said   um but the sort of person who would buy  this would want the retro classic look   but at the same time want the handling of a sort  of superbike style bike so it's very good indeed   um it's hard to fault i love the minimalism of  the handlebars and the controls you've just got   your on off switch and hazards on the right and  you've got your lights in an information button   to control the screens you've got a mode button  which you just press to go through the mode   and the horn so and the indicators of course which  don't self-cancel which is a bit of a shame but   it's a nice and simplistic bike the key goes into  the middle in the front there and that's pretty   much it off you go right it's a lovely bike so the  price of the triumph speed twin is ten thousand   seven hundred pounds from ten 10 700 and obviously  it depends what add-ons you put to it so it's in a   very competitive price band so there's uh various  other bikes in that band but like i say if you're   the right height for this bike you can't really go  wrong because it's a superb machine so our verdict   on the triumph speed twin it's a good looking bike  for sure it's very good quality wherever you look   it sounds nice it's got a beautiful engine i love  this engine fabulous gearbox uh it's not for the   tall guy unfortunately it's uh as i said before  for five foot seven five eight five at nine ten um   you'd be fine probably a little bit shorter than  that um it's a shame that uh bikes are not made   for taller people i'm gonna keep nagging about  that because someday somebody's going to listen   and hopefully build a bike for a taller person and  you'll be the first manufacturer in the world to   say hey we've got a bike for people above six  foot three so if you're six foot six and want   to ride this bike you're going to look like  you're riding your daughter's toy bicycle now   it is sad to say that where we are today is a  very small piece of what was once a huge area of   fen land most of it now is taken over many years  ago by farming so this is the last remaining bit   um so in the uk especially england we've destroyed  most of our natural environment and it's nice to   be able to see what it would have been like years  ago but pretty much from here where we are in   cambridgeshire right the way to the norfolk coast  would have been finland and now it's just farmland so so foreign you
