the chrome app find my date and we can complete the mission wait what's the mission again I could have sworn we're doing this for a mission but I figure out the mission was all these ex-boyfriend is somewhere in here we're all in disguise in this virtual prom right now because hackers are gonna be there and they can't know that we are the spy ninjas you know what's weird to these ex-boyfriend is a hacker we're gonna find out who it is today okay I'm gonna log on I gotta think of a username where the hackers don't know it's me so it's gotta be kind of random parts ron weasley 77 that's gonna be my usual why's everyone so focused on going to this prom anyway we're there to spy on that guy who's trying to hit on my wife well what is she not in love with you anymore what's the reason for her deception or something of course she's in love with me she's going to get information about the gkc school that her and i went to as little kids apparently this guy went there with her so he must remember if he and I don't remember it over here on my side there's a little server thing okay let's go hook this up to the server Oh yeah oh you're gonna scale this wall right here mouthing you're gonna get in trouble dude outfit you should do this that's why you should play lookout here chat okay okay fine all right so Melvin's climbing it right now I see him in there he's in there okay come on Melvin hurry up you gotta you gotta be fast man you got a melon hopefully that should do it go on to the server and see if I can find Daniel and Regina who's all in here oh wow is popping there's a lot of people here where is Daniel Regina I wonder what their usernames are here's what this is der glyph gee I wonder who that could be come on Daniel you got to be a little less obvious than that I'm gonna click in Tudor cause I'm pretty sure this is Daniel Barr's I couldn't do with somebody be that you yeah have you seen Regina or chat or Melvin or anyone well I just found her Gina here at the prom and then all of a sudden she just left me can you believe that my date left me now I'm all alone I don't know what to do calm down calm down I'm sure something bad I don't know she might have had a different date she might have clicked into somebody else is that oh la la who is that puppy left me no she wouldn't do that Daniel V oh you guys this chat room well it's about time you found this Regina you left me out here and the prom dance floor people are clicking in on me and talking to me nothing I don't know what to do I don't do my hands do I dance do I talk Daniel I was trying to look for these date how does jingle with the other people try to figure it out who it is yeah Daniel calm down you're right there's a there's a whole mission to this problem you're right yeah forgot you know Daniel what if we all dance to ease the nerves okay okay yeah teach me some prom dance moves and then we'll move on to the slow dance right I'm gonna follow like this [Music] how you feeling now Daniel I feel pretty good I kind of want to dance with other people now so we can mingle hopefully me run into my BFF do you know anything about your ex-boyfriend that we could look out for if we find him what about things he likes and then we can find out what his username is and one of my clues he gets a secret Romeo so maybe like Romeo X Oh something like that Romeo huh me something he's the Romeo and I miss Juliette apparently oh that's so sweet or romantic do you know no that's my ex-boyfriend we don't say that if someone trying to join in our chat I think so I see the one everybody make sure your disguises are on yeah maybe act natural keep dancing oh yeah natural dancing oh is this really the ex-boyfriend you know anything about likes you can't see it's actually pretty cool that's not what we're talking about riding the waves is it people gives me that just smooth it right anyway you don't know any information about skips kid center maybe this really handsome man back in the day used to beat people with girlfriends did you say me what's what's your name Oh my name is Ron Weasley thank you sir what's your name and your phone number - what - Thunderman hey man you're coming on a little too strong all right just just back off a little bit man we all have dates okay you guys are cool with it I guess I just go find some really cool TV because you guys currently so oh my gosh thanks Daniel and fee for saving me I did not like him I didn't like him either that sounds weird man but guys guys guys how do I know for sure that's not your ex-boyfriend V that could have been him that guy seems like such a jerk I don't know I don't think it would date someone like that back in the day I feel like I would date someone like a Romeo someone swap someone with manchak someone sweet like Chad the mission is important I understand but we should take breaks in a while right like it's a time to slow dance yet maybe we don't have time for slow dancing we're on a really important mission well I just thought you know to blend in more like okay fine fine now I'm not the best Packer that's what Dale and Regina for from hardwiring my laptop to the public server while inside a hacker proof device should make our connection super secure so we won't have to worry about anybody finding out our location well you're doing pretty good Lou Thai food Bootsy hijack hat cache patch I don't even know if I want to join the spine and just because of Daniel and Regina what wha hey well we just make a new team with just you Vee and myself no Daniel and Regina are also there the best man I think I found a back door to the server now I can't log us in but I can get us tickets okay and then we can access it from the safe house well maybe after this whole prom thing maybe I can start trying to make things right yeah because it's not just up to me it's up to all the spy ninjas including all you spine and just to decide if we should allow it Melvin back into the team or not you guys can make sure to let me know I'm doing right by making sure you subscribe to the pz9 we're not on your channel right now we're on B's Channel so well you could subscribe to her so make sure this is going except these Channel yes I taking your phone flipping it vertically scrolling right down and hitting that subscribe button turning it great yeah you're part of the team I have the remote access stored on the computer so we can go back to the safe house and we can still get access to the prom Oh let's go wait wait whoa someone's coming in someone's coming in okay ladies in the rule oh wow you got some real nice hair hacker someone who says my dear sounds like a very romantic language I wouldn't mind if this guy used to be somebody's boyfriend he's pretty cool he knows how to smooth talk hey Regina calm down okay remember I said you know do you like Shakespeare sir we're good we're good when you were little do you remember having a best friend and you would make
