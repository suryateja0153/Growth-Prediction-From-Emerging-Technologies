 i'm going to walk you guys through the process of getting everything set up and then you guys are going to publish your data into this unified namespace now the only thing that we probably won't do is we won't organize all the data we'll have everything in the name space but we won't get it organized in a i say 95 structure because we won't have enough time probably to get to that but it's the whole reason that we're doing this is we want to help organizations achieve the holy grail okay so what is the holy grail it's a fully integrated business made up of digital factories right so that means everything and everyone is plugged into the network the layers of the business are integrated and they operate based on data and information from all the other layers in real time stakeholders know the state of the business in real time and analyze data and information i'm actually going to talk about this real quick before we move on machine learning will predict future outcomes based on past patterns and current states ai recommends operational adjustments to improve future outcomes and stakeholders execute or not execute recommended operational adjustments so we're going to talk about machine learning and ai again in augmented reality how do those all play into this right i mean when we walk into a plant a manufacturing facility right now pretty much anywhere in the world they're we know that they're going to have plc's in the facility we can absolutely 100 guarantee that there's at least one plc somewhere okay either the oem put it in the machine or they've done their own installations that where they have plc's that are essentially gateways sitting on top of all the automation right and we could pretty much guarantee that they have hmis right we can guarantee that they have some type of erp system so whether that's even just quickbooks we can guarantee they have some type of erp the other thing we can guarantee is that they got people executing stuff right and that's pretty much where it ends every manufacturer here's another thing that we can guarantee if we walk into the plan knowing what we know we are never going to come to the conclusion that the business we're viewing is running optimally in fact has anyone here ever seen a manufacturer that just blew you out of the water that they ran so optimally they were so bleeding edge they just blew you out of the water i'd love to hear that example all right so i have one example actually i got two one one's a manufacturer though number one is tesla okay if you want the gold standard for industry 4.0 in manufacturing it is tesla primarily they got lucky right they started building the facilities right at the time industry 4.0 started happening and iot technologies existed but if you walk inside of a tesla facility you'll shift yourself i promise you it will blow your mind and you'll be like how why is it everyone's not doing this now that doesn't mean tesla didn't have some growing pains they absolutely did it was painful i mean elon musk was living inside his facilities but tesla will blow your mind the other thing that'll blow your mind is if you walk inside of an amazon distribution center if you go inside of an amazon dc it'll blow your mind now amazon across the board i mean so tesla and amazon they have one thing really income do you have recommendations otherwise understand a tesla does what it does yeah there's a couple of use cases but they're not published rafi should have seen them rafi should have seen the tesla use case well so tesla's very i can get you the tesla use cases the amazon one we can put the tesla use cases in a nutshell what tesla does is they approach each process as a node and it contains all the infrastructure that you know they treat each production line as its own plant is its own facility and it has its own infrastructure that it then publishes into the plant level infrastructure that they then publish into the enterprise infrastructure that they then plug into the tesla ecosystem for those of you who have no experience with machine learning in any way shape or form and you're not artificial intelligence people let's do a quick definition of machine learning and ai i know you've heard of it but understanding what it actually means so machine learning okay is nothing more than writing an algorithm okay so you essentially write a program or you use existing programs to look at data points over time to identify patterns so what machine learning can do is when you call it modeling modeling is the structure it's i've got all the time series data i've got my failures and now i'm going to ask the model to go ahead and learn so it's going to learn from that data and and the information i gave to it to look for a pattern in the time series data to say okay i've now learned what it looks like in the days weeks and months leading up to a failure of the bearing machine learning is not a pipe dream okay machine learning is real it's all around us all day long artificial intelligence are neural networks for the most part they are there's essentially neural networks that replace the decision-making process that we go through so artificial intelligence for industry is going to consume the predictions of machine learning many predictions so not just one bearing failure but artificial intelligence will consume many predictions and listen to some and not listen to others an optimal recommended decision that's what artificial intelligence is going to do in industry the reason that we are sharing this information with the rest of the industry is because we're mission driven most people in my position would not be giving this knowledge away and most people think i'm crazy for giving it away that's not my philosophy i my philosophy is my mom got murdered when i was a little kid when i was seven i grew up dirt ass poor in the rust belt where every all my friends parents lost all their jobs because in manufacturing jobs went away and i have decided that my life is going to be about recreating the middle class so that's why i give this stuff away that's why i talk about where i come from and then just remember solution driven is this idea that we're going to put in this monolith and it's really the concept that we're going to approach every project as standalone when we have a round peg we're going to try and put it in the square hole so i may have a big bin full of problems and not all of them are the same shape as as my solution but i'm going to jam it in there and make it fit technology driven is that i'm going to use a round hole for a round problem and a square hole for a square problem i'm going to have minimum requirements to say that anything i use i mean think about it right now we already do this before before a company will purchase a piece of software it goes through vetting with their it group for minimum security requirements it goes through vetting right what we don't vet right now is architecture we do not vet the technology why because no one understands it what title of person should we be looking for and i said there isn't a title there are a couple of different types of people you want to be talking to right we want to we want to get in front of number one we want to get in front of the floor level champion or the plant level champion who's the visionary you know what we're really looking for is the person who's going to quit the the engineer the electrical technician the scada engineer the person who's going to quit if the company doesn't leverage new technology right i mean if you look at manufacturers and my apologies to anybody here who works in manufacturing but the best engineers in the world don't work at manufacturers you know basically they may have started there but what happens in manufacturing because it's manufacturing so slow to move they you know the bottom thirty percent are incompetent and they get fired the top thirty percent move on and either start their own company go to work for integrators and they get left with the middle forty percent that's who's working at the plan but they have the people and i'm not disparaging those people this is i mean i worked in the this is where i started and i worked in many plants so i don't mean to say that if you still work at a plant you're a middle 40 percent but if you retire from a plant i can pretty much guarantee you're a middle 40 percent if you've been there for 30 years you're the person who can go along to get along you're the one who toes the line you don't rock the vote too much that's just how you succeed in that environment [Music]
