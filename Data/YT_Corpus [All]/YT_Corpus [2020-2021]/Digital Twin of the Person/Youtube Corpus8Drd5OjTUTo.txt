 Today a video about blockchain and supply chain, and actually the simplest kind of supply chain problem - namely couriering goods from a supplier to a customer, and the reason why I am tackling this topic today is because I had a bit of a run-in with FedEx over a piece of electrical equipment that I ordered in the United States  and that is to be shipped over to me here in Finland.  So the problem I had is that when goods arrive from outside the EU to Finland they have to be customs cleared and you have to pay value-added tax and FedEx offered to do this for a small fee, however when they sent the bill to me it was just a scrappy email saying "please pay this sum" with no explanation as to how they calculated it to "this bank" account followed by a blank line, so my initial thought "was hang on a minute is this actually FedEx I'm dealing with or is it some kind of scam that's being pulled here" so I inquired further and then they sent another scrappy email, this time with the bank account number and I went and checked online and found evidence that indeed that is FedEx's bank account. However the values that they calculated didn't match with the ones that I'd calculated myself, because I was starting to feel that there's something incompetent going on here, and I realized at the end of the whole interaction that this feeling of possibly being the victim of a scam boiled down to the fact that you order these goods from a company and then they hand them off to FedEx or UPS or some other courier and you get a tracking number, but the two entities are separate so you don't actually get a confirmation from the person you bought the goods from that that tracking number really does correspond to your package, and this is where blockchain comes in, which is that if you have a supply chain blockchain that is open and public and that you can, as any entity go and check up on a particular token that exists on it, and if the supplier generates a token on that blockchain when they start the process of shipping the goods to you then you can actually - all the parties - can use the same blockchain for tracking the goods and then I wouldn't have had to worry about FedEx not actually being who they said they were i.e. being a scam, because the supplier would pass ownership of the token on to the courier company at the same time as they passed over the physical goods, so now you have a digital twin to the goods travelling alongside, not alongside but traveling with the parcel as it changes ownership, and then as the parcel's delivered to me FedEx can actually hand ownership of the token over to me, and then you have on the blockchain evidence that the whole transaction has actually taken place. So it would add a bit more transparency and security, and I think my experience with this courier company really highlights the problem that supply chain has, because this is a very simple linear party-to-party transaction that is going on and there are only three parties. Now imagine what it's like when you have multiple suppliers supplying raw goods that are being shipped and recombined to make more goods, which are then shipped on to other parties and you have a whole web or network of these kind of things going on If a courier company finds it hard enough to properly track and calculate the costs associated with just one parcel going from Texas to central Finland, imagine what the problem must be like if you are looking at multiple transactions. Anyway so that's why I think blockchain really is going to make a difference in supply chain, and it should make the accountancy that goes along with, and the tax calculations that go along with these kind of transactions much much easier and smoother too.  Plus there's that underlying thing about security - that you have more confidence that the transactions are actually taking place correctly and you're not being scammed. I hope you found that interesting, see you in the next video soon. Bye for now!
