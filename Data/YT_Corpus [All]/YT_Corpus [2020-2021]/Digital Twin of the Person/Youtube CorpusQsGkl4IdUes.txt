  LINUS ALEXSSON: ICA Banken is a Swedish Company. And the bank is as part of big food grocery chain called ICA. Its an almost 100% online bank. Most of our interactions we have with our customers going through either our web or our app. I would say, we have a lot of data that we havent yet analyzed in the extent that we want. We have more data than we have time to analyze I would say because now were capturing all the digital data from our channels and we have a lot of data from our customer what they do and all the products they have and all the transactions and everything. We have been using SAS for many years. And we have seen that our relationship has developed because, first of all the products are very good especially when youre into analytics. And now also into marketing with this engage tool and everything. We see the speed of operation, how were working now, it goes really fast with these tools. A couple of years ago took around six weeks from the idea to execution, a new marketing campaign. Now we do the same operation in one day. We can personalize the customer experience in our digital channels. When youre using personalization youre being relevant to every customer. I would say were extremely proud of the level that we are producing models and how we engage with the customers and building personalization. We get a much enriched picture of the customers because theres more data. Its not only digital. Its not only offline data. And now I would say, we meet our our customers as customers in the digital channel not as visitors anymore.
