 good afternoon everybody and welcome to week five and the final week of our univ 391 um the kovid 19 the mason impact course we are glad you are here with us um we know that if you're in anywhere on the east coast and especially in the dc area you probably are getting storms as we speak um and so um if you wind up losing um losing power and having to log off and log back on we totally understand and the link will rework for you um we are all experiencing those storms too so if you see one of us disappear and come back um it's because power is flickering where we are um but barring that we are thrilled that you are here and excited about today's um today's um topic about models and analysis um that will help understand some of the ways that people have been talking about how you analyze and compare what's happening in the um in the epidemic so far in the pandemic so far um before we get started with that just a couple of reminders this is the last week of classes um you need to have at least nine um responses that are satisfactory to be able to complete the class if you are at seven a reminder to do make sure you do today's and tomorrow's um to and do a good job on them to be able to make sure you're you're meeting that if you get ten or more you get a badge for the class so you can also make sure you're you're completing those and these last two are going to be fascinating um and really relevant to you so i i expect that will be a fun assignment and not a hard assignment um the other thing i wanted to remind you is tomorrow's speech um speakers are going to be julie zobel who's in charge of mason's emergency management um and lisa park who's the university physician and they've been leading our emergency response and our conversation will be about the safe return to campus um so it is directly relevant to your experience and the other thing i wanted to make absolutely sure you do before class tomorrow is the um the student safe return to campus training is now available on the website and we expect you to take that before the session tomorrow and it doesn't matter if you're really returning to campus or if you're going to be working remotely during the semester it partly because we want you to be able to talk tomorrow and be a part of the conversation about what we're doing about a safe return to campus and how we think about doing a safe return to campus so i want every one of you to take the safe return to campus training but i want you to think of it from an inside outside perspective both what are we talking about like what do you need to know to be to to safely come back to campus and what are your responsibilities and the campus responsibilities for that but also think about everything we've talked about through the class so far and how that has gone into making messages um that helped get students thinking about how to return safely and there's several really good readings that are directly relevant including what kind of things have been happening at other campuses already this summer as people have been coming back so important to remember and make sure that you take that training before you begin um class so um today i wanted to um introduce you to three of my favorite people i am i am actually not that much of a secret um modeler and computational scientist myself i really enjoy looking at and using models as way of understanding i study human biology cemeteries and the evolution of infectious diseases over a long period of time and one of the ways i do that is through modeling in comparison of models to the grounded data that i use and so i was really excited that our three speakers all were willing to come today and talk about how they are able to use models and that kind of analysis of data to be able to understand the larger patterns of what's going on with covid19 um our three speakers our first speaker today is um dr lee mchugh she's an associate professor in mechanical engineering um our second speaker today is going to be dieter foser he's the professor and chair of the department of geography and geo information systems and our third speaker today is going to be dr robert axtell rob is a professor of computational data sciences and rob if i'm right economic sciences or economics right um and so they each have been working on models that are being used by professionals um and and decision makers around the country in the covid19 response in the papers today that you had as pre-reads were really interesting especially at the time each of them were published and what kind of information they each gave and how they've informed even the decisions you've been hearing about through the semester so with that i am really excited i'm going to turn it over to lee to you first thank you for being here and i'll let you hand over to each other and then rob i'll come in at the end excellent thank you dr usher so just to confirm you hear me okay and see my slides correct excellent okay so hi everybody my name is lee mchugh i'm an associate professor in mechanical engineering and we titled this session with the three of us y model so why model my team and i have done quite a bit of modeling i'm actually a ship dynamics person so i've got kind of some greatest hits here on this slide i had a student who is doing some very classic dynamic systems verification and validation that's what vnv is short for over here i'm looking at how you would validate codes that are or are for a chaotic system so chaotic systems classically present themselves where a really really small perturbation can result in a totally different end result so for my field when it's shift dynamics that means that a really small change in how a wave maybe hits uh hits a vessel might be the difference between it capsizing so rolling over and it being fine um i had another student who was diving into models for roll damping so again trying to figure out when something capsizes how you model the the damping of the motion as it rolls side to side can make a huge difference so he was playing with using fractional differential equations instead of ordinary differential equations to model the damping of a boat rolling i had another student we jokingly called this project our interplanetary flying dolphin so we said well you know boats are cool on earth why not do them on europa and so we were looking at how you would create a mission profile to look at under ice exploration on one of the moons of jupiter europa if you were trying to look for life um i have had students who have created some of the data sets that you would use for validation so verification and validation again is key where verification is making sure that your code does what you think it does but validation is making sure that it's actually representing the physics that you're trying to model um so i had a student who did a series of underwater explosions my mouse just disappeared on me oh sorry slashing tank started first i'm going to pause this one so this was a student who is doing uh small explosions essentially under water against a flexible membrane to look at how that membrane would deflect so that somebody who's trying to model the computational fluids may be trying to model what would happen if you had an explosion near an air-cushioned vehicle so a hovercraft that's got a rubber seal what that would do dynamically and then i had another student who was creating some of those computational fluids models to try to simulate it so this tank has a flexible membrane in the center and the tank itself is sloshing back and forth and so as the water moves that membrane is moving again looking at this sort of flexible fluid structure interaction and so this model is using what's called smooth particle hydrodynamics so each of those water particles each of those dots that you see sloshing back and forth is treated as just its own little particle of fluid that's got its own collection of properties and how strongly it influences other particles around it are is governed by how close it is to those other particles and we've used that sort of model to then extend beyond just computational fluids um stephanie sherman another student of mine was looking at how you would use that sort of approach to model air traffic and if you're looking at models for aircraft where you have a decentralized control model so you don't have someone in a control tower telling each airplane or aircraft pilot what to do you sort of have asserted all authority out to the pilots and the aircraft themselves um to do deconfliction and so she was using the same sort of philosophy as particle-based approach where every aircraft has its own set of particles its own governing behavior and interacts with everybody else based on how close they are so that might lead you to say how does somebody who cares about ship dynamics and maybe some air traffic modeling get involved in covet 19 modeling efforts so just sort of the walkthrough of how my march went down um mason's spring break for 2020 on march 5th so just before spring break the university suspended all international university-sponsored student travel i was scheduled to be going to panama and columbia for for mason business um starting on march 8th so i did you know walk across campus after i got that email on the fifth saying that the university was was suspending student travel and said do y'all still want me to go i said yep you're not going to a high-risk country you're not traveling with students you're fine feel free to make your trip so march 8th i departed dulles for panama march 10th university suspends all travel effective march 16th and so march 10th i actually was departing panama for cartagena colombia the second leg of my trip on march 12th the governor prohibited all out-of-state travel for commonwealth employees march 12th was the day i was supposed to go from carthage hannah to barron kia colombia and i was scheduled to return from barranquilla on march 14th but on march 11th seeing these university emails coming out getting notices from from the state department and their representatives in colombia i decided to hop an earlier flight from dulles back home from cartagena directly via panama to dulles so march 11th was the day that i left colombia it also happened to be the day that the who declared covet 19 a global pandemic um a few days later columbia closed its borders so all this time actually i was texting with my husband while i was on travel and he was saying oh you're overreacting don't worry enjoy your trip march 16th columbia closed its borders panama restricted entry to citizens and residents so i felt that it was wise that i had gone ahead and gotten home and march 22 panama actually suspended all international flights so this got me you know more interested in what was going on in the world and so you might also say why would i conceivably go to colombia in panama at the start of pandemic this was actually a meeting i was having with some colombian naval folks and and kotek mar which is a non-profit research and development company in colombia talking about planning a study abroad opportunity for mason students under the mason geo program so don't ever doubt your professors and industry members dedication to developing educational opportunities for you even in a pandemic people were still meeting to try to make sure we have plans for a good study abroad opportunity for you when when the world reopens but so i'm boarding my first flight at the start of this pandemic and i noticed the under the armrest and the row of seats in front of me there was cash under the armrest and i thought to myself okay you know they've been talking up how airlines are doing increased cleaning clearly this plane hasn't been cleaned because no cleaner would leave cash in plain sight under an armrest so i'd pack clorox wipes and hand sanitizer and so i'm sort of thinking i hope i packed enough of this stuff and i'm just watching people as they're boarding this was before people thought that wearing masks was was a good thing so pretty much nobody is wearing masks um people are touching everything and you know i sort of quickly realized i definitely did not want the in-flight snack i didn't want to touch anything the flight attendants had been touching um but it's got me thinking you know how quickly could something spread through this airplane by contact and being somebody who does modeling and does models that have this particle-based approach i thought well i wonder if i can model this in an sph-like manner and i know being a computational fluids person i had seen a lot of really fascinating research in the past of people who look at aerosolized flows and you know what happens when somebody coughs in one row of an airplane and it flows back through multiple seats i was trying to kind of go the other end of the spectrum i wasn't trying to look at that really really detailed um high fidelity work of what happens you know with a single sneeze at great detail instead i was sort of trying to think what happens when this person touches every armrest as they walk back the length of the of the plane um how does this sort of potential contact spread because also at the time we thought that kovit was living for long periods of time on solid surfaces and so this sort of contact spread was something that people were really worried about so i tried putting together this really simple model no air slice flow is purely tracking contact and proximity with no movement through the cabin so just where somebody sat if they were sick you know how close were they to other people how healthy were those other people they were around and how and how often do we clean the plane in between flights so no consideration for flight length very computationally efficient though and all really governed by this kind of bell curve relationship between the distance between an individual and any given sig passenger so i looked at this for a hypothetical flight um and had an initial flight where there were three sick passengers which are the red x marks that you see on this and it resulted with a simplified model and the infection of 13 others which are the red dots and so 16 seats of sick and infected passengers were viewed as contaminated when you extend that then and to multiple flights i said okay well if i've got those 16 seats that were that were infected or that were contaminated we don't clean after that flight who else is then sitting in those seats and who else might get infected so now the red open circles are seats that have been been deemed as contaminated and red dots are additional people who become sick over the second third and fourth flights so over this four flight sequence we end up with 55 infections so what can you get out of a model that's the simple well so the upside to it is you can randomize a number of things and so in this model the number of passengers on any given flight was randomized the number of sick passengers aboard any given flight was randomized where those passengers were sitting on each flight was randomized including the sick individuals baseline health of passengers on each flight was randomized so you could account for the fact that some people are going to be higher risk lower risk and then you can start to assess whether or not interventions work and so people were like me carrying clorox wipes and wiping down their seat does that actually help airlines were starting to talk about not seating people in middle seats so how much would that help and so you can do these sorts of monte carlo simulations you can do huge numbers of parameter sweeps with many many many stochastic variables many random variables to try to assess how effective these interventions are so on the left hand side here i've got a figure where i did an eight flight sequence we use every middle seat no one wipes down their seat and i ran 10 000 iterations of it so it's essentially 80 000 flights that are captured in this figure and 98.5 of the simulations resulted in more than 10 infections so that was this vertical red line is where the 10 infection number would be you can see the vast majority of the cases ended up being where there are more than 10 infections conversely when i do the same eight flight sequence don't use middle seats presumably everyone wipes down their seat now i've got only 10 of the stimulations resulting in more than 10 infections so even though this model isn't high enough fidelity to say you know it's actually going to be this many people who are infected it gives enough information to be able to to assess an intervention and say whether or not we think that this intervention is actually going to be effective so what do i do with that right i kind of described this as a rabbit hole that i went down again i'm a modeling person i'm not a i'm not a virologist i i didn't have any background in covid or or other disease spread modeling but i was chatting with a friend of mine who is an epidemiologist who i work with on fishing vessel safety work and i mentioned this to her and she said well that's really interesting the center that she that she runs not only cares about fishing vessel safety but they also care about farm safety and she said well could we do something similar then for farm workers so 10 of crop workers in the us enter on h2a visas and employers have to provide housing for those workers and also because many farm workers even if they're not entering on h2a visas are a migrant workforce often in remote areas it's not uncommon for employers to be providing housing for their workforce so for the safety of those workers in the security of the food pipeline we need ways to help educate farm owners and workers on ways to stay safe with the dormitory style workforce housing so we ended up doing a very similar model for farm workers who are living in in a dormitory style environment so for evenings again it was proximity based just like this airplane model everybody's got a random baseline health so some people might be more healthy some people might be less healthy everyone's randomly assigned to a bed we introduce one sick resident into that situation if the individual if any individual becomes infected in the evening they are given a random number of days for which they are asymptomatic and that's pre under predefined guidelines we start off with the uniform distribution of everyone who was sick for somewhere between 2 and 14 days and we've actually been tweaking this to to more accurately reflect um more of a bell curve and with mean and standard deviation that more closely resemble coveted statistics um so that's what we have in the model for the evenings for the daytime we use an sir type model which i'll go into in a second um so we presume that that one sick person who was introduced on that first night shows up at work their temperature is taken they're identified as sick they're removed to quarantine um but they have potentially infected somebody else on that first night and so the daytime sr model lets uh the infection potentially spread amongst the workforce until people have moved from infected to being from asymptomatic to symptomatic and are then removed from the simulation so the bed locations of any infected individuals are randomly assigned and again as more people become infected they're given an asymptomatic number of days based on those predefined guidelines so sir models this is what you see a lot of when you hear people talking about flattening the curve so s stands for susceptible i is infected and r is removed so when you add s i and r together you should have 100 of the population n is the total number of individuals b is the infection rate and gamma is the recovery rate so it's one divided by the average duration of infection i mean this beta and gamma come together to to give you an r naught value which is also probably something that you've seen in the media quite a bit there are a lot of variations to sir models that have much more complexity they'll allow for births and deaths and reinfection and so on um we kept it pretty simple here and they catch with this model is most of the sir models that you see um if you see there are common models that you can find online but they're often working looking at thousands of people populations of thousands and i'm trying to look at populations of like five to ten people um so i can't have fractions of people in in the model so i had to do a few little tweaks to the sir model in order to have only integer people instead of fractional people um but so to model alone is not sufficient you also need to think through who your target audience is and how you're going to communicate the information so this is again why i really really value working with epidemiologists and people from differing perspectives so the farm housing work the goal was to provide an educational tool for farm owners and workers and so by working with this team that i that i collaborate with who have medical and epidemiological backgrounds and who know farm workers who actually have farm workers on their staff you can get a much better sense of what the end user needs so we pretty quickly concluded what the end user didn't need was a matlab script and what they did need was a website that they could that they could plug in some basic numbers and get a sense for what they could do to change behavior in order to increase to increase safety so we ended up writing rewriting the script in javascript so it could run in browser it could be mobile friendly we added language and graphics to be clear and much more descriptive and we made it multilingual so adding a spanish version of the website was also really important to make sure that our end users would be able to see it so where we started was this matlab script um there's a couple scripts uh but you know it makes sense to me and i don't think it would make sense to anybody else and what we have right now live on the website is something that walks people through kind of a sequence of questions um y'all are probably of the too long didn't read generation though and and so as you know there's a lot of words here not much graphics and so what we're actually going toward is something that is much more um aesthetically pleasing and easier to work with it really clearly lays out kind of step one of what you need to enter step two what you need to enter describes what we're talking about with how people are sleeping in bunk beds what the layout looks like who's getting sick and instead of trying to give a description at the end that talks about monte carlo simulation just tries to tell people pretty concisely what their worst case scenario looks like so why model even with low fidelity models like this with high computational efficiency you can still use this to evaluate mitigation strategies and you can do a lot of what if type scenarios um and you can expand this so where i'm trying to take this is to look at full air travel networks so not just look at what happens on one plane but look at what happens on a fleet of planes going through hubs and the person who goes and gets starbucks before they go get on their second flight and so on you can start considering multiple farms with farm workers who travel between work sites and the food chain beyond the farms hospitals schools ships etc there's this problem is very um kind of a similar setup to a lot of different physical situations but we do need validation data to take this from being an intervention assessment tool an educational tool to something that actually is predictive modeling and it's hard to find that sort of validation data that looks at you know everybody who's traveled through o'hare airport on a given day so that is my story as to how a ship dynamicist doing planning work for study abroad in colombia and panama ends up modeling viral spread on farms and i think that's my last slide so with that i'm going to turn it over to you dr foser all right thanks very much it was very interesting and i think it's i'm not sure if you can make a perfect transition but uh what my goal is in my talk is actually to talk about how students are affected by all this and by when meeting your fellow students in class what does it mean or what could it mean so let's see slide is up can you guys see it hope so so um so my my journey was a bit um was a bit was a bit different to to lee's journey in the sense that i was just asked at um through you know somebody uh bethany actually doctor read a paper about contact network at the universities so students being on campus and meeting each other running into each other and there was a publication on that from another university i believe it was cornell and how um this this kind of interactions on the university campus how this potentially would affect the spread of the virus at the university and yeah although i didn't have any i didn't have didn't have any previous work on that i found a very interesting data driven challenge so digging into data sets um from the university and inferring something that could be actually meaningful to the i think at the end it actually turned out that it was useful and and you know some of the decisions the university takes or took actually were influenced by by some of those results so um let's see a brief background so i'm so my background is actually i'm a computer scientist and um right now i'm um a professor in jail so in geography and g information science because most of my work is in relation to spatial data sets so i like everything that has to do with coordinates and locations and trajectories so tracing or tracking people in in a good sense like vehicles and referring traffic conditions and the likes so this this is kind of this is kind of my my research cup of tea so it's i'm a data person and a lot of my work is in relation to urban science mobility analytics and and just in a nutshell to get a better understanding of what people are doing and so why do people go from one place to the other what are certain commuting patterns why tourists explore city in a certain way so that's really from from an application angle that's kind of my work now in my work what became or what becomes increasingly important is that although we have a lot of data that describes the behavior of the population sometimes you don't have enough of the enough of data and what what's really helpful is actually using agent-based modeling and dr axel is going to talk more about that to actually complement you your data mining in your data analytics um work so if you're kind of short of data well it might be a good idea to complement your your gaps in your data with an agent-based model and and come up with meaningful results and this is kind of where my research is going so in that sense this work is not is not that unrelated as i initially thought um also in terms of teaching so my teaching at the universities in relation to web applications so what lee said before about you always have to communicate your results so right the most ingenious insights and scientific results are meaningless if you cannot communicate it and not everybody bothers to read a scientific paper because some of them are overly complicated but everybody looks at visualization so whenever you see video and it takes you you know i'm not talking about tick tock but i'm talking about you know youtube videos or khan academy i'm sure many of you have used khan academy in high school this is the way of communicating information and in from my perspective web applications web animations so actually quote-unquote videos that people can interact with and where people can manipulate the data that's a very that's a very interesting thing so one of my teaching one of my courses that i teach is on web applications of how to build web mappings web map applications something like google google maps but only on with your own data and your own functionality and the other big thing the other course i'm teaching is on data management so let's talk about the particular challenge so as long in a nutshell as long as we don't have viruses don't as long as we don't have a vaccine the only thing we can actually do to prevent um getting sick is really you know the classical thing so it's you know clean your hands often coughing knees you know in your elbow but wear masks and keep your distance so practice social distancing and just be meticulous about clean work environment and this is also something that the university is advocating for the fall so you will see that hopefully the the kids or the students that are on campus and the faculty that are on campus and the staff they will all wear masks they will all practice social distancing because as long as we don't have a vaccine there is no other solution to containing the virus so from from from a campus perspective i mean this is you know happier times i would say from from mason actually this is how you would be on campus so you would be roaming around uh go and have something to eat socialize with your friends and now then also go to class so what what i since many of the things we cannot control for we don't really have precise information uh about one thing we can really control for is or one thing we can really figure out easily is how many kids or how many students uh go to class and how many classes do they take so this is something there we have databases for that at university and this is something i could readily pull and also keep in mind that classes so taking a class is also a place where you are close to somebody else for a longer period of time which is also one of the important factors when it becomes when it gets to transmissions of uh of uh of copy 19. so being around somebody close proximity for a long period of time so that's kind of the hallmark of typical face-to-face teaching now so the question that i wanted to order was asked and that i wanted to answer is so what are the characteristics of of this classroom environment and essentially the gmu student network and how would it and how is it affected by course enrollment so the questions the university had is well we cert we have some large classes with like more than 200 students so how much do those large classes actually affect the potential spread of the virus right and um the data i was dealing with also we looked at historic data from the fall semester from last fall semester and just to give you an idea of the magnitude of of the enterprise and of the size of the university just on fairfix campus so not considering not considering science and tech in manassas we have 32 151 students that were enrolled in uh 6779 courses so it's really it's a sizeable thing so all the students map the courses and typically students take one more than one course right so this creates quite a sizable contact network just purely on on classwork now in in the model or in what i looked at i didn't consider employees at all so i didn't consider the actual teachers i didn't consider staff you know um dining facilities storms uh commuting people take buses public transport to come to university etc so this is all outside of of what you're going to hear afterwards right so for any for any real model that you would actually come up with for campus that's also something that you have to consider and you will see here afterwards from dr axel what an abm uh could actually do to help also consider those aspects so what i really want what i want to talk about is really just 32 000 students and in 6 000 roughly 800 courses so how much basically uh will you be in contact over uh with other students and the data that that i pulled for this kind of exercise was really course information so here you have a course an accounting course for example that has enrolled students now that's that's not the data that i wanna that i wanna use but what i wanna use and let's see if the markup works is that i have i have a student here that takes the same course as the student here so those two students will be in close proximity let's say once or twice a week for an hour each and this kind of gifts are you know gives a chance that if one of them is infected that the virus could be uh that the other student could also be infected by um by kobe 19. so what we built or what i built actually is this kind of contact network so students they know each other provided that they actually take a class together if you if you then look at the numbers or some high level characteristics of of this data set you find out that during a typical week um a typical student needs 171 other students so this is this is kind of the critical number here so we we basically are with 171 other students in classes provided all the courses are face-to-face throughout one week and and that's kind of you know uh there is no such thing as a typical student and what you see on the right in this in this chart is the different colleges that we have at the university so we have business on top the second row is the college of education so you know teachers and you have the school of engineering at the bottom but what's interesting is that if you're a student in the college of education then actually you're only in contact with 56 students and the reason being that education students are taking smaller classes now if you're a college of science students or if your major is something like math chemistry physics and so on then um you actually are taking larger classes so your contact network is much larger so you're in contact with 217 students now volgenaur so the school of engineering down here has similar numbers right so those are colleges with larger classes so the students they take those majors are also in contact with more students now what we did is now the following um so assuming that we have you know those are the number of courses that we that are offered at the university uh what happens if we transition larger courses like in this case 200 so courses that have 200 or more students in them to online right so let's take out this these large courses transition them to online how would it affect the degree of students how would it affect the number of students that we in contact with throughout in classes throughout the week well interestingly we only had in fall at least we only had 18 students uh sorry 18 courses that had an enrollment of 200 or larger and if you transition all those to online then actually the average degrees or the average students that we meet throughout the week drops to 138 so it goes from 171 to 138 and then so what you see in this in this table is that you have the the various rows with a 100 so transitioning all the courses that are 100 or larger online so this would affect 77 courses so this includes the 18 from above as well and then the degree drops to 107 right and if you take it to an extreme and this is also you know this is this is something the university has considered so if you transition all courses that are larger than 25 to online this would affect 1610 courses so and observe that we actually had in fall we had 6800 courses so we have many courses that actually have a smaller involvement at a seminar style that are greater courses higher semester courses so what would happen then is that the students we run into is only 24. so we go from 171 to 24 and this is a huge reduction right and this is some of the considerations that the university had when actually suggesting that some of the courses have to go online some of them have to be hybrid and some of them can still be face to face now this the what you see here is is really just a visual representation from the table before and it says so you have to on the x-axis you you have the class size so transitioning in this case um what we have here are all courses that are 200 or larger on to online the degree of students or the students that you meet drops to 138 and so on so we have the same thing and on in the extreme case every all the course is larger than 25 transitioned we have a degree of um 20 meeting 24 students per week in classes only now um and um i mentioned before so different college our college is affected differently by by kind of this reduction and um so we we see that for example the college of science by removing the 200 courses larger than 200 online college of science here has a reduction in this number of contacts from 217 to 170. right so the larger the colleges with the larger classes are disproportionately affected uh education is hardly affected at all because most of the courses are small anyways now the complete spreadsheet what we have here is that moving all courses larger than 25 online business students only run into a lot of 11 other students in in their classes throughout the week various uh visually performing arts students interestingly still run into 42 other students that's probably because it's really hard to do dance uh online so they still have to go um still have to have face-to-face classes right so this is so depending on what type of student is you're affected in a different way by by this kind of reduction in class size and moving courses online again so this is a visual representation of the previous table you have so my college is the college of science that's the yellow line so by moving classes online here to 24 larger than 20 25 students so college of science has somewhere here around 40 students or has a number of possible contacts so at the week of 40. right so and the other example is uh education which is done here so education barely changes because education has smaller classes anyways uh now another interesting thing is of course depending on what uh where you are in your studies so if you're a freshman if you do nothing and you just take face-to-face courses freshmen are affected quite a bit by larger class sizes so a typical freshman runs into 346 other students per week so that's a huge number whereas when you're a doctoral student so a phd student then actually you just see 15 other students in your classes because you just take smaller classes of around 10 or 10 to 20 students and this is the same breakdown of how reduction or moving larger courses online affects the different types of students that we have on campus and this is a graph the graph representation and before i get to the to the most important chart an interesting and interesting piece of information that we also found is that we have a breakdown between morning or before p of 4 pm students and after 4 pm students well essentially it means on this side we have undergraduate students and on this side we have grad students so most of the grad students at the university are coming in in the afternoon because we have many working professionals that do part-time grader degrees so that's why grad courses are scheduled in the afternoon to give those students also a chance and you have in the morning you have your your undergraduate students so you see that you're you know on a monday we would typically have 17 500 students coming or being on campus either commuting or living on campus if it would reduce class sizes so would move all courses larger than 25 online then this number would be reduced to 8 000 students right so this is also it's still a huge number but actually as we will see it it has a huge effect on possibly meeting a student that is actually that is infected uh also an interesting piece of information is that although fridays are less popular with undergraduate students they're absolutely unpopular with grad students so on friday there are not hardly any grad courses scheduled in the afternoon and this is kind of that's the the most important chart um and uh i will take quite some or a bit of time to to explain what's going on here essentially what this chart tells you is that assuming you have a certain number of infected students on campus and the total number of students that we have on campus is 32 000 at the university um so let's assume we have 200 students that would be infected so that have coveted 19 and that would transmit um they would be able to to infect others and transmit the virus then what is the probability that you actually are it's not the probability that you get affected but it's the probability that you are in a class with one of those infected students right so orange and it's so assuming there are two in an effective student the line v or the uh the curve we have to look at is this one so this curve tells us that depending on on the number of students that you meet through a week throughout the week what is the probability that we meet one of the 200 infected students well if we don't do anything and if we don't and if we have uh all face-to-face classes and an average student has meets 174 students throughout the week then the probability that you meet one of the 200 infected students is actually something like 65 right so it's really high so if you think about it 200 students out of 32 000 are infected the university would do nothing and it would just offer courses like we offered last year and fall then the probability that in one week in week one that you meet one of the 250 students is 65 and that's really high right so i mean we we can all agree on that so what do we do what do we what does the university need to do in order to make this situation viable well a we want to reduce this number here so we want to reduce the number of potential students that you meet face to face throughout the week so this is moving courses online this is what we do here so this dotted line here this dotted line here tells us that we only have classes less than 25 less or equal to 25 so the number of students that we meet is 24. so assuming same thing assuming we have 200 infected students out of 32 000 but our class size suddenly is only 20 or is 25 and we don't need 24 students then the probability that we meet one of the 200 infected students is actually somewhere around 15 right now keep in mind that this is just this person would be in a class where you are also in there so you have each week you have a 15 probability that you meet one of the students which again you know it's not good i would say right it's pretty high it doesn't mean that you get infected when you are in the same class but you know it's not a good thing either so the other thing that we want to do is actually keep the number of affected people down right so we want to eliminate um and you know that's when contract tracing comes into the picture so assuming we only have uh 10 students that actually have the virus out of the 32 students if we have class sizes of 25 then down here your probability of meeting one of those infected students is something like zero point uh one percent right so in this case you have a zero percent 0.1 probability that one of the students in your class actually um is sick if we have 10 out of 32 000 students and you know still considering social distancing masks and you know um disinfecting classrooms and so on the chances of actually um you know getting the virus from this scenario is actually really really slim so um now again i have to say that this it's really a very uh very basic study of taking the scenario from the fall semester and mapping it into you know contacts or students that are met in class so in order to get a more realistic approach you would have to do something more and uh dr axel is going to talk about agent-based modeling now so what if we could actually simulate dorms you know johnson centers of food food courts classrooms and so on include also faculty teachers and staff in the simulation it built kind of a mini campus um so a digital twin of of of mason and run an agent-based simulation so that could be a nice that could be a nice um way of actually getting a more realistic scenario about what it means to be on campus and how likely it is that somebody would contract the virus at the university so that's it from from my part so i just wanted to share this inside this data-driven insight with everybody and i'm gonna hand it off to rob to talk about agent-based modeling crab you're still on mute can you hear me now yes perfect all right so yeah so uh the the two really talks here and uh nice to go into what i'm going to talk about and essentially i'm going to look at i want to present large-scale models of the pandemic that we're currently going through and uh where really discussed models with like you know between you know a few hundred agents and eaters were you know a few thousand we're gonna look really today at kind of nationwide even kind of worldwide scale models okay so uh here's a quick background for those who you who want to know kind of what it takes to build these kind of large-scale models my first degrees in engineering and then i went to carnegie mellon for a phd where i focused mostly on computing and economics and then at the brookings institution which is what's called a think tank in downtown dc uh with some colleagues we pioneered the idea of agent-based modeling back in the 90s through a research center that we created there today i'm a professor at the ex at the santa fe suit also which is a center for complex systems research and and i've been at mason now for 14 years where uh we have we we created the world's first department of computational social science uh so we apply each base modeling to stuff and what is the stuff well it's almost almost everything we don't we're not very very catholic about only applying it as a mirror as we if if there's an area we can apply it we apply it and i'm going to tell you what agent-based modeling is about if you haven't seen it before you've heard a little bit about it already so we'll go through some details but for example we've applied it to things like you know the financial crisis of the late uh part of the last decade um how how fisheries work um evolution of technology labor markets and i've written here and colored print um how diseases spread and how the economy works we're going to talk about that in the context of the pandemic all right i have this one just one slide about why do we need models anyway you've heard lots of talks about covet 19 about the the virus so far this semester and probably many of them were model-free do not really have models in them so i've written here this you know that we all use models all the time whether it's a form model or i've written in the first bullet here a mental model the mental model is something like you know how do i make a decision so i'm gonna i'm gonna drive uh uh to campus today um how do i get there that that's involves some kind of model how the roads are how the roads work or you might say i'm gonna interact with some person should i say something to them well they might get angry i have a mental model of what causes someone to get angry maybe so uh we can have models either in our head or we can also have models that are supplemented by technology and so these days a lot of us get around with gps and if you say i want to go from here to there and the gps might give you three routes while you're you're using a model basically based on how how the traffic's gonna flow and what the what the travel time will be so um there are many different ways we use models and i just uh i have the one bullet here about um about you know think about the medical example of somebody who's recently diagnosed with cancer all of a sudden we have to figure out which tissues to irradiate that's going to be going to be based on a formal model that the medical doctor uses to figure out what what what can be treated what can't be treated so in essence all of us today uh use models all the time and i'm going to talk now about a class of formal models um and these are going to be you know i've written here the you know if you if you had lived through the pandemic of 1918 maybe you have a model in your head but how to how that how that pandemic played out none of us did that uh so we have to we can build we can learn from that pandemic though and we can build models to to uh to to move forward okay so when it comes to pandemic modeling in particular the current uh situation there are really two classes of models that have been widely most widely disseminated you've heard version of them here earlier today so the first class which we've talked about mostly so far are the transmission dynamic models these are the mathematical and other models that keep track of you know who's infected who's who's exposed who's sick who's uh who's been uh who's recovered et cetera now typically these mathematical models make a lot of what i've termed here heroic assumptions things like you know um the population is well mixed everybody has the same probability of being infected or people are biologically similar you know there's no old people no young people there's no different immunocompetence kind of thing so oftentimes mathematical models are very useful and you heard about sir models they also have have uh achilles heels associated with not permitting much heterogeneity and so these agent-based models that i'm going to show you in a minute have stepped in because we can we can represent every person in the pandemic with a software agent uh so-called and then we can have these ages be very heterogeneous based on you know they're young they're old they're immunocompetent they're not uh and then we can model the interactions between these these agents so it could be that you know somebody stays at home well they're not interacting with the same probability that somebody who's out and about uh has and so we're going to model uh not well mixed populations all right so this is the first class of models i'll show you some examples of this some toy examples uh for transmission but now much now that we're we're into the period where we've had you know quite a large effects on the economy and the rest of our society of these of these uh of the virus uh we can ask questions about you know how bad is the economy going to get how long to recover um what uh are there going to be long term changes associated with how we work can we all work online et cetera and then there are even international effects so i'm going to talk about both kinds of models here as we as we go forward so first um some of you may have seen this this uh this first model i'll discuss back in march that model was associated with a research group at imperial college in london by ferguson at all and it showed the importance of flattening the curve and i'm going to show you a picture of that here in a minute the basic idea for the u.s was that without any attempt to flatten the curve you could get into a realm where you had as many as two million people who who would perish but that if you could social distance you could bring that number down into you know sub 100k range now we're already well above that so we haven't been as effective as that model said but uh but at least we've avoided the the this much larger effect now so this was an agent-based model based on this research team's earlier work modeling uh various kinds of flu the so the flu that h1n1 flew that happened earlier uh in the in this century and then also going back to 1918 they didn't work on that as well and this model in particular this model got the attention of the white house corona task force and so that first lockdown that we all went through bin march when lee was saying she was you know deciding whether to go internationally or not uh the policy that that grew up out of uh the initial uh you know the initial uh uh kind of takeoff phase for the virus was basically largely was based largely on this ferguson model all right and i'll show you just some examples in a second show you some you know some some of the results from that but since that since since we have the epidemic models running we all have some sense now how the virus ebbs and flows there have been a whole variety of models about the economy saying you know a benefit cost model says uh what does it really cost if we're going to spend a bunch of money to keep people at home et cetera what is the uh cost of uh you know what is the bet what are the benefits and the cost associated with with abating the uh the pandemic uh mitigating the pandemic and then we can look at things like well we can get demand shocks when people are not going out to restaurants supply shocks people can't go to work and then what policies lead to uh better outcomes in particular what let's look at differential impact so i want to just talk about those these things in a little bit more detail here so this is a plot from the original ferguson paper from march which is once again sells a very large-scale abm designed to um inform you know you know a large swath of time and large number of people this is for the whole us and what the black line shows is now this is not best rather this is going to be how many people are going to be in the icu which is of course a an important measure when you have a limited capacity the red line here refers to what is the entire u.s icu capacity now of course in reality you have you have state-by-state uh uh limits here and we knew you know we all know that in you know in april for time frame new york was much more serious than than florida but now florida is much more much more serious et cetera so the red line is just kind of the arrogant for the whole country but notice the black line if we had done anything the black fan would have grossly exceeded the icu capacity uh and uh of course things would have would be ex would be on the downside now but we'd have a lot of we'd have this you know several million people dead is the problem so flattening the curve was all about getting us onto either the brown line or the orange line of the green line by basically taking action to social distance and we all know the you know the different strategies that can be used for this now it's no staying home from work worker mass etc but this was the basic abm rendered at the scale of the entire country and they also did this for the uk as well and many other uh countries did similar models for their own country okay so i'm gonna just now for those who have never seen an abn before i'm just gonna run an abm but i just want to say that if you a good platform for running abms is called netlogo and that logo is available for free on the website that i have here on these slides and then if you go into the models library when you download that logo you can find a bunch of bunch of bunch of those models i'm gonna so i'm gonna quick this and then pull up my uh my net logo model i'm gonna have to go over how to share that to share this model which is uh so i'm gonna stop sharing the um uh that powerpoint and show now the net logo okay so in an agent-based model what we have is we have a bunch of individual people and they're all going to be individual software agents so here it's maybe a little bit hard to see but we have green and blue and yellow agents we're going to be in different states of whether they're going to be immune or healthy or or whatever and they're they're positioned on a spatial landscape here and we can do things like you know change the number of people i can make it so there's not many people available around or a large number of people i just by pushing some buttons i can change the infection rate make it higher low and less set out with a low infection rate i can change how long they're infected for a long time or a short time and when i turn this thing on what's going to happen is they're going to all just start moving around and we see we have one sick person here initially that sick person is going to infect other people and when we when we hit go with the go button here now it's going to run very fast and i apologize for it and run probably too fast but it's going to run and we're going to see a kind of a either a take off in this selection in this case we have we have no take off the the sick person did not cause an infection because we have a low infectious rate i'm going to set it up again oops i'll set it up again we have more sick people whoops uh set it up here with some sick people we're not getting any sick people trouble set up and uh let's increase the affections a little bit set up and uh go and that pod is this another case with not many people the duration of the sickness is too short so set it up here the one sick person go they cause a bunch of people to get sick and so what the plots are showing on the um down here in the bottom it's just showing we had a decline in the number of people who were healthy increased number of people who are sick at this point we were down to a very low population this is the case of a very very bad pathogen that's going to wipe out a lot of the population of course in reality the one we're dealing with right now is not so bad but this is just an illustration of of an infectious disease model in that logo and we where we can model you know a few thousand agents over here we have a thousand agents running uh over time we can see how it works and what i want you to think about is not think about a model like this but for the whole country and that's what we're gonna talk about here in the last minute or two that i have the last few minutes i have so i'm going to stop sharing that and go back to sharing my powerpoint slides and uh so once in the the two class the models were these virus transmission abm's but then more recently uh getting into the models of economic effects and so i just a quick summary on these models is and now these models are running at large scale as i mentioned for the whole country are not going to show them but they're kind of round model different kinds of things like for example on the demand side when people are not going on vacation when they're not going to be going to restaurants that that suppresses the demand for goods and that's a shock to the economy on the supply side when you know when a meat packing plant somewhere gets shut down because half the workers are sick or when non-essential personnel can't go to work they can't provide certain goods and services so we're going to have supply side effects and then of course when trade gets shut down you know we if we take no goods from canada or or if china will take no goods from us or something the european goods from us then that has that has international effect so large-scale agent-based models have been built now to study these things how large well the u.s private sector is roughly 120 million employees in six million firms and we can model that entire thing these days because we have the data on how big they are what the ages of the firms are how many workers they have etc and so today we can really understand this giant shock that the economy is experiencing which is something on the order of like between 20 and 30 million unemployed people because every every week in america a million people are losing their jobs we are going through some hiring right now a lot of hiring so about a million a half people are being hired back but we're still losing a million jobs a week so we can try to keep track of all this and i just have a quick slide for those of you who have a somewhat more technical background i want to know a little bit more about the computer science here's kind of my one slide about this is that some when you have a multi-core machine which is almost all of our laptops these days have multiple cores well a big workstation because 100 cores a super computer might have you know 10 000 cores what we do is we just break these large populations up into little pieces put each piece on one of the cores let it run for a while and then rearranging agents so that the ones who are kind of close together around the same core and with this kind of parallel computing we can we can realize very large scale models in fact and so these models are being used today to support policy and i've written here just you know what uh the the current tension and policy today is how can we have uh policies that avert medical disaster like the like the millions of dead we had we saw in the ferguson model but also avert economic disaster with if in fact the entire economy is shut down so there is this kind of thread the needle we want just enough opening but not enough to cause uh cause outbreaks and cause the pandemic to get you know to create hot spots so the only way to answer these these policy questions is with models today i mean there's no way you can just use the back of the envelope or use your intuition to do it that way if you do it you'll get the wrong answer but of course the us's is written here a large heterogeneous place and no one policy always produces the right answer for everybody so you produce all kinds of social frictions and of course state boundaries are porous et cetera et cetera anyways the good news is that these days uh many different institutions from local school districts to companies to universities as we've seen with with leaders presentation counties uh airlines in the case of of um of the first presentation the states et cetera all these models are built to support policy you know what should be done should we open the schools yes or no if we open them how should we open them etc so these days there's there's literally a thousand of these models being built to support particular kinds of applications and i'll finish up here by just saying the summary is that uh these models are ubiquitous at this point abm is used for making policy uh everybody uses models but particularly these formal models through abm these are the way that uh all the work is being done to model what's happening in our country today now if in fact you would be interested in learning more about the sound of the research state of the art i've just gone through quickly here in 15 20 minutes um kind of the current uh the current state of the state of play but every friday in my department i run what's called the mason online pandemic modeling seminar now this was just the generic modeling seminar for my department held every friday afternoon but in march we pivoted over to to having it be only modeling pandemics and so we have the world's most well-known researchers on epidemiology on the economy on all the other dimensions of the uh pandemic come on and they and they give us an entire you know our lecture on what they're doing how their model et cetera if you would like to be added to that uh distribution list email karen underwood who's whose email address appears here at the very bottom and i'll leave this on the screen and she'll add you to the announcement list these will continue through the summer and then in the fall and as i said we have um a regular uh cast of characters coming through here who are some of the world's leaders on on how to build models that are relevant for policy to try to bring us to a better outcome than we would without the models okay so i'll stop there turn it back over and we can have time for q a hopefully
