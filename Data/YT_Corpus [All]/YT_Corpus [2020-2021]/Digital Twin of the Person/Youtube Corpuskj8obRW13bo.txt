 We have to find Madame Rouge before she strikes again. (DOORBELL RINGS) I'll get it. (BEAST BOY SCREAMS) What is it this time? Probably another mirror. Who is you? I is me. How come you looks like me? How come you looks like me? I asked you first. I asked you second. And two is more than one. I think. What is the happening? I don't know, but that's a lot of bad grammar. Wait a second. Is I you? Is you me? BOTH: I so confused! Okay. Don't hurt yourselves, brainiacs. This is Beast Boy. Who is you-- Uh, who are you? -I'm Beast Girl! -(SHRIEKS) Did you tracks me down 'cause we're some of them good old, long-lost relatives? No, pooh. I was just out minding my own, doing my business in the bathroom  and then...  I sees this creepy  green lady looking at me.  I freaked out! And ran, and ended up here. Looks like you got a double, Beastie. Wow. A girl version of me. This is blowing my minds! Is this blowing your minds? 'Cause it's blowing my mind! Oh, my God. My head is so blown. Wait. Hold up. What if... Aah! It's Madame Rouge! Who? Where? You, girl. You's Madame Rouge. I knows it. I don't think that's her. You are being the weird A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y again, Beast Boy. (CHUCKLES SHEEPISHLY) Oh, my bad. Phew! I's was scared. The real Madame Rouge is still on the loose. Titans, back to your stations. You all's mind if I go hang out with Beast Girl for a minute instead? Sure, you don't really contribute much. Cool. Thanks, Robin. So, girl... Tell me about your story. Sweet! Let's takes a little stroll. Where to? Down them memory lane, son. Way back in the day, I was born in a jungle. BEAST BOY: Me too, yo. BEAST GIRL: And my parents  was scientists. BEAST BOY: Mine's too. BEAST GIRL: Then I got bit  by this crazy green monkey. BEAST BOY: No way! I gots  bit by a green monkey, too.  Nuh-uh, bro.  Ya-huh, yo. BEAST GIRL: Then I gots  real sick  and my moms and pops  gave me this green serum  to save my life.  I gots better,  but I turned-- BOTH: Green. BEAST GIRL: And I could  turn into-- BOTH: Animals! Wow girl! We's got so much in common, yo. Then I bet you know what I wants to do right now. You knows, I do. (CHEERFUL TUNE PLAYING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) You know, Beast Boy, you's the first person in a long time that don't make me feel like a weirdo. Me too, yo. That's what's up. That's what's up. What up, Titans? Greetings, dear friends. What up, mind blowers? Yeah, yeah, how you doing? Oh, (CLEARS THROAT) you again. They kind of reminds me of my friends, yo. You's got friends, too? We's so much alike. I got friends and you got friends. We get it. You're alike! Now, if you don't mind, we're trying to find Madame Rouge. Who's this Madame Rouge ya'll keep talking about? She's a super villain who can disguise herself as anyone. Wait. Anyone? Anyone at any time. That means... She could be me! I mean, I could be her! No way, girl. We's too much alike for you to be anybody besides yourself. But check it. Madame Rouge is a girl, right? I is a girl, too! Plus, my astronautical chart has all these pictures that says I's gonna make a change. Horoscopes always say vague stuff like that.
