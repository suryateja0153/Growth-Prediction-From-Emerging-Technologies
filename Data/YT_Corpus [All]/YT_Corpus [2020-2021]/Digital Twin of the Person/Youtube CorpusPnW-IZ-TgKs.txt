 Welcome to an all-new episode of "What The Fit." That's right, people. "What The Fit." You see how many different ways that you can incorporate physical fitness and health into your daily life. Today's gonna be a special day because I got the Dolan Twins on the show today, people. The Amazing YouTube is very, very funny. Very competitive. Ooh, the Dolan Twins! ( honks horn ) That's not the Dolan Twins. Those are just two girls at the bus stop. Okay. ( honking horn ) - What up? - How are you, man? - I'm good, brother.  How you doing? - How you doing? Good. Ethan and Grayson. Now which one's Ethan, which one's Grayson? I'm Ethan, even though I'm wearing the gray. It might be a little confusing. - A little play on words there. - My name's Grayson, so I probably should've put that on. You should've put the gray on. It was a real ( bleep ) move for Ethan to put on the gray. Kevin: Thank you guys for coming on. This is big. - Grayson: Thanks for having us. - What sports did you guys play? - Ethan: Wrestling,  football, and lacrosse. - Together? - Both: Together. - We did everything  together our whole lives. - Always the same teams? - We take sports  really seriously. - Who wins? - It goes back and forth. No, I worked it out. 60% me, 40% you. - That's false. - When did you work it out?  How did you come up with-- - I'm pretty good at math. - That's not true. - I'm also a little better  at math than you, too. - He's not. - He's actually not. - Kevin: Okay, well, today, why not put ourselves in an environment where we can compete-- where we can compete differently? So today, we're gonna ballroom dance, fellas. - Oh, we're dancing? - ( music playing ) - We're gonna ballroom dance. - I'm down, and I'm gonna  beat Ethan. - He always rags me-- - Bro, nah. He always rags on me for being a stiff dancer. And by no means am I good, but I'm better than Ethan. - I'm pretty good. Dancing's  all about how it looks. - There you go. If you look good, then your moves will probably look better. You know what? We're gonna stop and we're gonna go to - this spray tan place.  Don't say it. - Don't say-- Don't say, like, I don't need a spray tan or nothing. Don't say that. - I won't say-- - No. Don't. But just in case you were thinking it, - Don't say it. - I won't even think it. - All right,  we're gonna do the abs. - The abs. - Ab definition? - Yeah, like, I've never  seen a ballroom dancer - without tan lines. - Without tan lines,  you're right. - Come to think of it-- - That's true. I've never seen it. Even the black ballroom dancers have tan lines, and this has confused me for years. - ( laughing ) -   Like this   - Kevin: Hi, how you doing? - Amber: Hi, how are you? - I'm Kevin. - Amber, nice to meet you. - Grayson. - Amber. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. We basically want to get spray tanned just, like, from here up, - 'cause we're  ballroom dancing. - Okay. We don't need everything. - Just nice abs. - Just nice-- yeah. Yes! - I got you. - A little definition. I can for sure do that. So, look, just so people can tell you apart, I've had letters that we can just put on you guys. One's a "E," one's a "G." - I'll take a "G." - All right, who wants  to go first? - Okay, Ethan. - Kind of excited. Yeah, this is gonna be great. You're gonna come out with abs. - Oh, no.  Oh, no, this is bad. - The hairnet. - Wait, it's in his nose. - Amber: Over the ears. That seems backwards. She gave him the plugs for his nose - and the cotton for the ears. - I can't really hear anything. It's not that bad. - They actually paint them. - Wow. - Now don't go swimming. - Okay. You go swimming with that, it's gonna look like somebody - ( bleep ) in the pool. - Yeah. Kevin: Ethan ( bleep ) in the pool! - Oh, that's cold! - Head up! Head up! Put you head up! Keep your head up, Ethan! - Smells kind of good. - Perfect! - That's good. That's good. - Okay, now... - we will pull this off. - Grayson: That's pretty cool. Oh, wow! This looks like my body regularly. You look kind of like a-- like a dancer. - ( Kevin laughs ) - Okay, Grayson. - Looks great, man. - Thanks. - Grayson: Ooh! - There you go. Ah, we messed up. It's one of those things where you can't really fix a mistake, either. Like if she makes a seventh ab-- - You just gotta roll  with the seventh ab. - It's like a third nipple. Ethan: It's looking good, though. - Oh! - Yeah. That's Grayson right there, 'cause he's got a "G" on him right there. Uh, I'm thinking, do I need to get-- because the color, this color looks like it's my color. Like, this is about you guys looking the part. - So you're not doing this? - Well, I was until  I saw the color. Yeah, we're gonna win now. It's about presentation. - You actually do look good. - Yeah. Now let's go! We gonna be late. We got to ballroom dance. That just makes me want to dance harder now. - Kevin: Let's work out. - Grayson: Okay. ( music playing ) Ah! Ah! And snake it. And whop! Hey! Sexual. - Ah, hey! How are you? - Hello. - Good to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Willem. - Hi. Grayson. Ethan, so nice to meet you. We are here to not only look the part but play the part, and we're here to compete at the very highest level. We're going to be teaching you three ballroom dances. - The samba. - Samba! - I've heard of that. - The tango. - Tango. I know the tango. - I've heard of that as well. - And the swing. - The swing! - Would you like to  meet your partners? - Kevin: Yes. Grayson's partner-- Adrienne! Whoo! - Nice to meet you. Grayson. - Adrienne. Nice to meet you. - Grayson's got a "G." - Okay, good, if I forget. Ethan's partner-- Miss Gina! Hello, Gina, that's Ethan right here. - Exactly, the "E." - All right. - Okay, you'll see it. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. Nice to meet you. - And last, Kevin's partner, - Lucy. - How are you? How-- how-- how are you? Hey, how are you, Lucy? - You two look great together. - Do I dip her  or does she dip me? - There's the big dipper  and the little dipper. - Yeah. We're gonna teach you some of the basic steps of each dance. We're gonna start out with the samba. We're gonna put our hands on our hips. And we're gonna take the rib cage, push to the side. - Rib cage to the other side. - Oh! - Rib cage to the side. - Ooh! Now we're gonna go back and forward. - Oh, you done did it now, lady! - Back and then forward. - You want the good stuff. - We're working our core. You want the good stuff? So we're gonna show off the shoe and get away from the fire ants. Show off the shoe, get away. - Get outta here fire ant! - Shoe, get away. - Get off my shoes, fire ant. - Shoe, get away. Awesome. - I'm a natural. - I feel good. - I like it. - We're gonna move on  to the sexy tango. Standing on one foot, we're gonna do a little lunge, send the foot to the back and bend the knee down to the ground. - Ethan: I can do lunges. - It's like the workout lunge. - Hit it! - Kevin, now I see why  this is a workout. Now you see the physical fitness side of it, huh? - Huh! - Willem: There we go. - And then back up. - Something happening  with my pants. My pants definitely in my ass. I'm over here making a mess. I gotta throw these away after this. That's the truth. That's the truth. These pants going in the trash. Y'all put drawers on with your pants? - That's just a known fact. - Nobody said,  so I went no drawers. - In ballroom, you're actually  meant to wear a dance belt. - I'm out here loose, sir. I'm out here loose. Sorry. Sorry. Go ahead. I'm listening. The next dance is the swing! It's cardio intensive and fun. It actually began when someone went to the bathroom. - Okay. - And they walked out with  toilet paper on their shoe. So they're trying to shake it off by swinging their foot. So you start kicking, and kicking, and kicking. It becomes a nice little point when it goes down. - And then hop while you do it. - Am I doing it right? - Willem: There you go. - I'm gonna call these  the "back up off me's." Back your ass up! Yeah, that's what I'm gonna call them. You better get your ass off my porch, George! Right? Right? - Absolutely. - You've got your work  cut out for you, Lucy. - Yeah. - The time has come.  The competition is on. You'll each gonna be doing a different dance. And you'll be competing for the illustrious Mirrorball Trophy. Kevin: Nice! Yes! So we're gonna start off, we're gonna do this walk, and we'll go around. Grayson:   We chose the tango because it involves the least amount of movement from me. Ethan has rhythm, but he's just a little bit stiff. I'm stiff and have no rhythm. Oh. Jesus. - And my footwork  isn't too good. - ( grunts ) Show off the chest and your "E" 'cause people gotta know who you is. - We chose-- what is  this called? Swing? - Swing. We chose swing because it involves a lot of kicks and I'm pretty good with my feet. - Dee-dah. - Ooh! Kicked it--  kicked too soon. - Wait, wait, wait. - It's okay. I keep, like-- okay, I got this. - 3 and 4. - Oh, I started with  the wrong foot. - It's okay.  That's all right. - ( bleep ) My fresh abs give me confidence, yeah. The spray tan was a-- you know, Kevin thought he got one over on us there, but in reality he just played himself. Do you wanna do an actual trick? - Yes. What's the trick? - Do you really want to? - What's one? Gimme one. - Do you think you  could carry me? No! We went with the samba. You know, pretty much because of my hips. Some of the best  hips in the world. It's been called "butter." That's what they called it when I was in France. All right, slow down. So, because of my butter-like hips, it's why we're going with samba. - Right? - Right. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - I'm pumped on this dance. - You got anything? Nah! I give up. - You got this man.  You're gonna win. - Looks like you got nothing. - Yeah, we don't have anything. - How's it feel to have  four left feet? Announcer:   Now, Kevin and the Dolan Twins  will ballroom dance  for your pleasure--  and a trophy with  a ball on top of it. Dancing a dramatic tango  with his partner Adrienne, - it's Grayson.  - Whoo! Let's see what they've got. ( music continues ) Okay. - Kevin: Whoo! - Oh. All right. It's like watching Frankenstein make love. ( music stops ) Great hair. What shampoo does he use? Extra points for hair flip. I loved it. - Thank you. - I felt the passion.  I felt the drama. I felt like I wanted to know more about what was gonna happen in this relationship. I wanted to know where it was going. - You had me. - What dance did he watch? I loved your intensity and the hand styling as you came in. - Nice work. - Thank you. Announcers:   Judges, your scores? I give you a seven. Seven? - It's too generous. - I give you an eight. - Good job. Good job. - Thank you. Good job. Yeah, right. Good job, guys. - The hair flop  got me the eight. - Good job. - So, you can't really do that. - Good job. Announcer:   Dancing the swing  with his partner Gina,  it's Ethan. Nice abs. - They're not real.  They're painted. - Nice swagger. ( music playing ) Wow. It's actually good. How did she get him to remember all this? ( whispering ) Woman: Look at those hips. - Kevin: Wait, he almost  kicked her in the head! - That was pretty good. He almost kicked the top of her head off. - Sheesh, I mean,  I gotta clap, I guess. - Very nice! I loved it. You gave me twisting. You gave me the kicks. There was no toilet paper to be seen anywhere on your shoes. - That was fantastic. - It was high energy,  high-falutin'. - I loved it. - Thank you. Announcer: Judges? I'm giving you a nine. - We gotta get a five here. - A nine! - Whoo! - Very good, guys! - That's all right. - That's a bunch of  horse ( bleep ). Announcer:   After that performance,  Ethan and Gina  are now in the lead.  Dancing the samba with  his partner Lucy, it's Kevin.  Kevin!  ( music playing ) Yes. Use your hips. Use your hips. ( grunting ) ( bleep ) ( grunting ) ( whispering ) There's my hip thrust. That's not the arm-styling I was thinking. ( panting, grunting ) ( muttering ) ( music stops ) ( panting ) Not bad. - I'm so emotional. - It had passion! - Yeah. - It had confidence! - Yeah. - And that's about it! Work on that stiff arm turn. There's a thing that my old dancing coach used to tell me. He just used to say, "More elbow." That's what that's from. God bless you. You know, it had a lot of heart. God bless you. Announcer:   Judges, scores? - All right, so I give you... - Tens. - ...an eight. - Well, that's-- You got a little bit of your... - Ten. - ...turn to work on, - so I'm going eight as well. - The ( bleep ) is that? It's one less than nine and one more than seven. What the-- that's not gonna get us the win now, is it? I'll take my God bless you's back. You guys don't need those. Our winner of our Mirror Ball Trophy... Ethan and Gina! ( cheering ) - Oh, look at this thing. - Here you go. - Wow. - Willem: Congratulations. I guess it still goes in our house. - It's going in my room. - Oh, my God, Ethan was so good. I'm so happy that he has the trophy. "What the Fit," another episode in the can. - Thanks for having us. - Thanks a lot.  Really appreciate it. - Appreciate it.  Had a great time today. - Bet you did. - Bet you did. - Had a great time.  It was great meeting you. - Your hip movement  was really phenomenal. - That was pretty impressive. It looked like that one video of those turtles mating. At least it sounded like it.
