 [Music] we're gonna get started to stay on schedule thank you very much for coming here this afternoon hopefully everyone's had a successful productive conference had a lot of interesting conversations over the past week myself I'm Miles vetro I'm a solutions architect with Google came into Google with orbit era and we're here to talk actually about orbit era and a pudgy two recent acquisitions by Google Cloud both of which are multi cloud solutions connected platforms meant to really enable partner commerce across clouds across different ecosystems across different SAS platforms and really trying to reduce friction and increase adoption of partner solutions in the cloud today so as we go through the presentation today we have an agenda we'll talk a little bit about the market evolution of cloud and what the implications of that are for ifvs talk a little bit about the orbit our platform speak to the apogee platform as well talk about both of their functionalities and real purposes and cloud commerce and then talk about that joint value proposition how orbiter and Apogee jointly together can help accelerate monetization of different kinds of consumption and subscription based products in multiple cloud environments and then we're very fortunate to be joined today by two mutual partners of orbit area and a pudgy we have some people from pitney bowes as well as from veritas we're going to go through a pitney bowes use case in demo showing the potential of an end-to-end customer-facing implementation of a joint orbit era Apogee solution and then we'll bring up a few of the members of those companies on stage and have some Q&A so let's go right into the market evolution what does it mean when ISPs have to go into the cloud there's some really important implications and it's much more difficult than making sure that your application just runs on cloud XYZ from the ISDN side of things there's more demands for the sales motion from their customers customers and consumers in the cloud are demanding more retail consumer like experiences because quite frankly enterprises don't care about what's actually making the solution run they just want to have it work pricing models do to that sort of consumer focus that the cloud is bringing are moving more towards consumption based models pay by the SIP rather than pay by the drink we're also seeing that making sure that is V systems can handle the new monetization and pricing models in the cloud can be difficult and users are really adopting cloud marketplaces to browse different kinds of solutions discover solutions you probably heard a lot this week about different kinds of marketplace venues that are out there to help make your your products discoverable and it's not sufficient anymore to only make yourself available in one venue one infrastructure provider even on the dev side we also see that the actual depth process is impacted by this whether you're trying to package solutions into the cloud or you need cloud-based building blocks to create your solution if you use that old enterprise procurement model where it's not instant non demand it can elongate your entire development cycle and elongate your go-to-market activities it also can restrict your developers from using the most innovative and modern products so having that click to purchase brings back agility and having consumption based pricing helps lower costs and this should overall if we set all these systems up correctly help to make sure that devs are not hindered by the inability to adapt to quick new emerging technologies now the marketplace writ large I mean everyone here you're on day three of Google next I don't need to convince you that the cloud is someplace to be we all know that the cloud is growing but it has some very important implications about where software sales models and where stacks are going to be deployed in the future so in 2019 according to this research study about a third of all enterprise applications will be cloud only rather than cloud first cloud first is still a big move today the industry is evolving extremely rapidly eighty-three percent of IT buyers rely on product demos unless they want that consumer driven cloud experience and they want to get their hands dirty with the solution before they're willing to actually go to all of the time to architect their end-to-end operational workflow behind this cloud adoption and when they get those demos they're fifty percent more likely to actually adopt a solution the industry is growing as well these grey bars in the right-hand chart are showing infrastructure spending growth on the cloud what's not often discussed is those blue bars that's actual software spent on the cloud specifically SAS and passed based offerings most of which have to have some kind of consumption based pricing model behind them that software side of the curve lower than infrastructure but it's still expected to triple over the next five years this is a massive opportunity for isps today so what does this mean well means if you're not a cloud is V you're being disrupted by your competition right now plain and simple ifes have to adapt to the needs of their customers also in the cloud a lot of channel or ecosystems have been left behind in the direct marketplace model and ecosystems that create network effects of multiple partners creating multiple solutions are where you can get true value and start to drive more partner activity as well as more end customer activities it's a very virtuous self-fulfilling cycle in order to create this ecosystem you have to automate it any kind of manual process and cloud distribution slows things down a lot it's unnecessary friction so both Apogee and orbit era are really about enabling automation enabling end-to-end integration to create ecosystems that create virtuous cycles of customer satisfaction and partner engagement so let's talk a little bit about orbit era as a product I heard I heard a product manager from one of our partners earlier today and he said that orbiter has been talked about quite a bit over the course of the week not entirely sure what it does but it seems like if you sprinkle a little orbiter on it will solve your billing problems so let's actually dig into what orbit era is orbit era is an e-commerce platform we try to bring entities on the left who are our customers and this can be software vendors it can be distributors or resellers system integrators that need different building blocks to be combined into bundled solutions or managed service providers that like to layer on their own services on top of cloud solutions all of these are different customer types that can be enabled with the orbit our platform and with that network effect or the ecosystem where orbit era can create what we call an n-tier hierarchy we can scale an unlimited number of tears down sideways up and this allows for flexible business models and we try to bring those entities on the right to their customers we're sorry but the entities on the left to their customers on their right and those customers on the right might not be the end user from a nice v's perspective or distributors perspective the reseller of the product is their customer so they need to enable their customer from that perspective to have a more satisfying selling and development experience so the middle of the box is really talking about the different orbital platform features the first row is really our guiding principles where we want to reduce friction we want to package and provision different kinds of software cloud providers access to different cloud providers through native cloud automation whenever possible enabling single click deployment and with a whole host of configurable workflows to help you scale your business to the next billion users the next three rows talk about the different product lines underlying orbit era and you can think of these either a la carte or holistically and we have some partners who use orbitz arab mostly as a billing engine some who use us for test drive some as a white-label marketplace but they can also be used holistically so billing allows us to implement subscription or consumption based filling anytime we can get programmatic access to that subscription or consumption information we have native support for gcp as well as for AWS for Microsoft Azure for IBM SoftLayer for centurylink cloud more than a dozen SAS applications we can consume any kind of metering or consumption stream and then through our price books apply custom pricing to either resellers or end-users and wrapped around this is dashboards reconciliation rope and reporting tools that allow you to surface to your customers a single pane of glass through which they can consume their AWS their gcp there a shiur their software their SAS subscriptions everything in one shop and we can deploy into multiple cloud environments from that one marketplace that leads us to the next row marketplaces and catalogs where we can enable our partners to create their own e-commerce white labeled storefront looks and feels like their domain registered on their domain space and hooked up with all of the consumption and subscription pricing that's enabled by the subscription management engine underlying orbit era and all of this again is an n-tier hierarchy an n-tier architecture so we can enable your channel partners to stand up their own white label marketplaces where they don't need to worry about the underlying technical integrations lastly we have trials and lead management also known as test drive and this solution as well as being integrated into multiple different Google programs and is also available on other clouds the thin line wrapping this whole diagram is speaking to orbit areas automation capabilities we want to reduce friction not increase systems complexity so we have a rich framework of callbacks and ap is to automate integrations with different kinds of systems and ideally that end system is something like apogee which is a unified management platform that provides us a single integration point to then speak to all of the underlying systems within an IFV I'll get into that in just a minute so how does orbit hire help we try to help you grow revenue accelerate sales and optimize operations specifically we help you grow revenue by enabling true multi-cloud commerce when I say that I mean that we actually meter and deploy into multiple clouds we have the big three public clouds today Google cloud AWS and Azure and we can bundle multiple infrastructure as well as SAS or license based solutions into a single product that's deployed through that single click framework and we do that through the native provisioning services of these different clouds it also helps simplify the purchase experience because it's a much more consumer driven kind of feel and workflow and through this you can actually customize consumption pricing for any end-user it does not have to be shared across users also we have an able channel through that multi-tier framework where every reseller can have their own shingle their own white label marketplace they can put it on their own domain space and so long as a partner has integrated with orbitz era or if they have their own solutions that have some kind of API or some kind of scriptable deployment that reseller can inherit those other products from past diocese that have integrated with us or build their own solutions it's a completely self service framework and this really helps you enable your partner base accelerating cloud sales is about streamlining deployments streamlining access to solutions through test drive and all of this is with an eye towards automation integrating with your existing CRM system so that lead generation is seamless so that your sales team can help nurture these new leads and we can actually notify you in real time when a new lead has access to your test drive you can call them before the environment has has completed in terms of optimizing operations this is really about automation if you have an API we can work with you if you don't have an API we can refer you to a pudgy and then we can work with you just getting we can work with different kinds of partner solutions well not necessarily API driven we have some partners who have you know are just nascent ly entering the cloud and we've implemented work flows through automated email notifications we've done this through automated notifications as different JSON endpoints are totally and to end ap is where orbiter is a silent partner in the background and through our integrations with different clouds we help satisfy your end users needs because different cloud providers have different features and functionalities it's not a bad thing it's not a taboo it's just reality and so your partner's demand to be able to deploy and consume different clouds orbit our orbit area helps you enable that so now let's talk a little bit about Apogee Apogee is an API management platform that really helps streamline the end-to-end digital value chain one of the guiding principles of Apogee is they have a very opinionated view of what api's can and should be specifically it's not sufficient to simply simply look at things from the back end out you can't slap api's on top of everything and expect to have a unified user experience where the user on the far left of this slide is being considered from day one so or Apogee likes to think of things both from an inside out as well as an outside in perspective because it's not just a matter of making sure that your devs are building api's you need to rationalize out all those api's make sure your different dev teams are using the same kind of language and through that Apogee can be the polyglot that does all the translations between your different teams wraps all these together scales secures and helps monetize these different kinds of automated systems that you're enabling so the apogee platform or Apogee edge can be seen in many different angles whether you're the app user you're the operational team monitoring and administering the backend whether you're the developers or the API team trying to bring that develop solution to your apps into your systems so here are some of the principles of apogee that you see on the right hand of this slide apogee is absolutely a purpose-built cloud native API management platform with that centralized point of government fully multi-tenant support just like orbit era apogee is a truly multi cloud platform that can be installed in multiple cloud environments and even on Prem again much like orbit era they take a self service standpoint because the last thing a partner needs when they need nimbleness and responsiveness is to file a ticket with their platform to actually have make something happen but we want to put the tools in your hands and obviously it's about scaling to enterprise an apogee has helped many enterprises deliver their applications their services to millions and millions of users here's some of the flavor behind Apogee deep integrations with multiple cloud environments as you can see here Apogee while fully owned an integrated with Google cloud platform has also installed their application in multiple other environments AWS on Azure through cloud foundry on gcp in coover Nettie's environments as well and you can install Apogee in an on-premise to help bridge that gap between the reality of today where you're not quite yet on the cloud and the future where you want to get to so how do these two platforms fit together orbitz era is a platform that helps you monetize bill demonstrate and distribute your products your solutions products can be bundles of multiple apps or single apps and we help you create ecosystems and Link partnerships together so if you're a distributor you can invite your ifv partners to publish their products into your distributor ecosystem or if you're an isv that wants to enable that you just need to integrate with our systems and you can use us as a force multiplier apogee is API management at scale that allows connections between different user experiences different end systems and if you've ever done a cloud migration you know that it's real it can be painful and onerous trying to herd the cats of all your different api's apogee makes that process relatively painless when you combine these two platforms together or vitara can act as the unified front end with billing management partner management ecosystem management tools as well as all of the reporting and analytics that you might need while Apogee provides the automated unified management portal that orbit era can speak with and scale all of their underlying systems to accelerate your go-to-market activity so let's go through a few hypothetical examples and then we'll talk about a real life example with pitney bowes this is one example of how Apogee and orbit era can help enable isv multi-cloud distribution in the top you see where vitara the visible portion to your end users is that white labeled e-commerce store but it's powered by our billing management engine customer management tools that allow for customer specific pricing or even account specific pricing we can enable test drives on multiple cloud platforms and integrate with multiple catalogs across those different clouds Apogee and meanwhile helps provide that unified layer that allows for a single call into apogee to speak to many underlying systems so here as an example we can help apogee unify payments erp accounting and orchestration Apogee secures it scales it and provides a unified API front orbit Eric and then consume consumption information from Apogee and send orchestration calls purchase calls credit calls into the ISPs underlying systems another potential use case is to create an app ecosystem so because we're batara interfaces with multiple cloud environments and can orchestrate through essentially an arbitrary API call we can enable an ecosystem like this where the applications are driven off of an orbit era powered marketplace billing catalog management as well as partner management by the way and customer management is tooled through the backend of orbit era and allows the store to surface either first party apps third party apps or bundled solutions that call into multiple of these and then the apogee edge API management platform again helps us interface with all of those myriad internal ifc systems so now we'll go into the actual pitney bowes use case demo so orbit era apogee pitney bowes as well as google have been collaborating on a project to help enable different kinds of distribution and device construction and manufacturing and distribution by the part of pitney bowes this requires a lot of work on the Android team on the device side of things orbit era in the marketplace app management and partner management side of things and then Apogee making sure that all these systems both third and first party speak to one another in a seamless scalable way specifically we're collaborating to create an android-powered device that helps modernize and streamline the pitney bowes shipping label machine and turns it into just a shipping label machine or a strong market leading shipping label machine I should say to a digital distribution platform where they can not only fulfill their goal of making shipping easy but also use it as a monetization platform for preacher distribution so if you look at this diagram I want to first draw your attention to the right hand slide the apogee powered payment api's Apogee provides this unified management layer where they have a billing account API payment transaction API different kinds of reconciliation reporting AP is that orbit Eric can call into on any product purchase so once a product is purchased off of this orbit air-powered app marketplace we can integrate with Apogee with pitney bowes systems to instantly validate whether they can purchase this or not checking their ledger account will create that transaction in the ERP system instantly as well and establish the billing relationship all on the click of x or vitara in the middle helps talk to the android-powered device as well as a pudgy and provides a partner portal through which pitney bowes partners can create their own apps and solutions can then be distributed to these millions and millions of small business devices this includes a robust set of governance and approvals so that pitney bowes admins have complete control over what's published and where then we have the android-powered device on the left-hand side we've been collaborating closely with the Android team to create a customized device that sits on top of this shipping label machine that can then be used by these small businesses to purchase new products and services things like G suite for the small business right through the shipping label machine then orbiter itself enables a myriad of pricing models within this ecosystem you can pay by the SIP you can pay by the drink you can pay by the seat pay for it by the week month year fortnight too if you want you define the frequencies and all of this is then integrated with a seamless user experience because we need to have the user experience in mind each and every step of the way and very importantly as pitney looks towards the future orbit era because of our multi-cloud axis or view of the world allows us to then replicate this marketplace onto multiple devices not necessarily just Android devices can include windows can include web other mobile devices as well so now I'm going to go through and actually show you a live demo of the pitney bowes orbit or a use case and we'll actually first start with the tablet so this is an example of a real live tablet that would be sitting on top of a device think of it like your modern copier here on the screen we have the orbit era store as well as a couple apps that i purchased beforehand given that ass live demo so a user can click on the store and see a consumer-driven experience they see bundled solutions here's an example of three applications to first party pitney bowes created apps send pro and the location intelligence my pro adam as well as a third-party app should brush now we're logged in as a user and i can browse these solutions we make it easy for the marketplace owner to populate different kinds of marketing content you can then allow your users to choose from multiple payment options for the same based product and we can change the orchestration or parameterize any of the user choices here to inform how the product is actually deployed i'll go ahead and choose a small business option here and then we get back to a regular consumer driven shopping experience shopping cart like people are used to everyone in an enterprise is a consumer in their personal life so they like this kind of approach here we have purchase orders which are automatically synchronized with the api or apogee powered payment platform house within pitney bowes so this is now after we click checkout validating that the customer has enough money in their ledger account to validate this purchase after we check out the purchase is confirmed and now orbit era sends the signal out to the mobile device that it now has this application if I now go back in I can click on my new send pro product send pro is now interfacing with a pudgy powered api's we have plenty of money in our account I need to send some so I'll choose one of my pre existing contacts I'll decide which package I want to buy as the internet catches up I'll choose the flat rate box and remember this is sitting on top of an actual printing device so once I confirm this purchase I'm ready to print click that green button voila ready to ship except now pitney bowes has enabled themselves to add new products and services over time invite partners to deploy their products and solutions into this marketplace that's already embedded in over 1.4 million small businesses globally now let's pivot and look at the actual laptop where I'm logged into the apogee management platform here's the apogee dashboard looking at the actual activity underlining these apps total transparency into all activity within the ecosystem product managers love this dashboard because it lets them know exactly who has been using which app and for how much whether they're experiencing any errors or not real-time visibility into end user experiences we can actually look at some of the API proxies that are being called underneath this live demo I'll look at for example the shipping API here I'll look at the shipping shipment API and as you can see here it says which environments this set of api's has been deployed into and what the underlying calls are being made within the various internal pitney bowes systems to enable this end-to-end workflow so this platform now means that pitney bowes no longer just sells or or is simply using this device to fulfill its primary mission of shipping labels it's now a distribution platform a digital cloud distribution platform where they can add any kind of fast service first party applications they develop internally or third party applications that they want to bring into their ecosystem and we can then replicate this process across multiple devices in the future whether they're android or not so you then have a unified partner portal two onboard different kinds of apps and solutions through the orbital platform and you can scale these operations seamlessly through Apogee so I'd like to now transition back to the slides and I'm going to invite several of my colleagues up on stage now where we'll have a bit of a panel discussion and we'll also have the opportunity to get questions from all of you before we do that brief review of everything that we've discussed today getting into the cloud requires a pivot from legacy distribution which requires thinking about internal systems as well as distribution mechanisms in the future and multi-cloud is the name of the day from enterprise consumers Apogee edge is an intelligent API management platform helps to handle billions upon billions of API calls daily which helps partners scale their business or vitara meanwhile helps partners monetize bill demonstrate and distribute their cloud-based solutions SAS platforms and virtually any product they want in to channel into their own ecosystem or into partner ecosystems and combined Apogee and orbit area together can help make cloud transformations much quicker and less painful [Music] [Music]
