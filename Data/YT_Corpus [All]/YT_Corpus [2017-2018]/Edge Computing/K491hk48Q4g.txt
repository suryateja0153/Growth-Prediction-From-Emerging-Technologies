 [Music] we are very happy to have you change from USC today you Chang as a PhD student at West Bengal thing that is interested in game theory is part of graph theory and has some really good papers on these topics today is going to talk about information revelation so feel free to interrupt me yet any time we'll start with something it's called a ski this is a game actually learned as an intern here from from an intern from another intern called Wilma so he teaches at MIT and one major tournament yeah he won't like two million dollars overall but now he decided to pursue a PhD we in turn that same summer yeah so this is a game I learned from him it's a simplified poker game there's only the only three cards a sinking of Queen sorry only three coordinate that and it's involved each puts $1 in the pot they can take a badass ante and Alice has the option of betting another dollar or not okay if she choose to bed then Bob can either colorful right we're gonna look at how you will play this poker game and then I'll tell you why is related to everything I want to say today so what if you're a your Alice and you hold an ace what would you do so you know that Bob is either holding a king or a queen right you would never lose so you better $1 dominating to try to try to win an extra dollar from it right okay one interesting thing is when what if what Alice is holding a king what would a dice do when Alice is holding a king bob is either a hooding Ace or a queen right so Bob would would always call you with ice and Bob would never call you with a queen right because higher card wins so actually when you're holding a king when Alice is holding a team it doesn't make sense too bad at all because you only get when you're beaten wait okay the last part is what if what if aliens escorting your queen so we know that she won't you always better with ace she would never bet it was King what about when she's holding your queen it's a pretend she has days is the King so she will bet with some properly depending on the payoff structure of the game so in this game she was bad was probably 1/3 and that's called bluff that's the ultimate playing this game and Bob would call with the ace always catching her Bluff and with a king Bob would forward with probably 1/3 and called the other situation so to take away from this example why is that if you actually play poker this will one will present an example the message is you should actually bet with your best hands and worse hence you bet your best hands for value and you bet your worst hand to bluff the ball when you put a middle hand you should actually just call it not do anything the second thing is there are many aspects of this game that what you will see again again through this talk so one is it's a game with uncertainty no cards are taught randomly to people have private information you know your own card but you don't know you know your opponent private information so three is there's a there's a signalling scheme here right like by patting or not betting and this is revealing something about work hard to Bob this is the setting that this talk is about this talk is about what is the best way to review information and specifically what's the computational complexity of revealing information this is based on mostly two papers one you see and one talks paper and I'm lucky to work with lots of people here receive guidance from many of them and many young minds as well and let me state this three things again so we have first we have a game without certainty then the agents have misaligned incentives so their choices would depend on the information that's available and you have informed principle so here we is the deviance away from the poker setting you have one party that knows a lot more information than everyone else and this principle is trying to reveal information carefully to induce a desirable equilibrium I example like this includes poker and AD auctions for example Google knows a lot more about the user than the bidders and Google is trying to reveal - Mitch about that - to the bidders to maximize revenue when you use Google Maps Google Maps to know more about the traffic than you do but you're selfish you want to get there as fast as possible and when you're graduating your visor visor nothing for you your battery knows better about you than the institution that's trying to hire you so your bicycle choose to reveal partial information about you to healthy these are the two major ways of influencing the behavior of other people one is through designing incentives as a field of traditional mechanism design you promise someone for example running a second-price auction you promise him if you bid the highest you're going to get an item and you have a payment rule saying you only need to pay the second highest bid so people will bid honestly because the way you designed this incentives and allocation the other way is through influencing their beliefs that you influence their behaviour so this is what we call an information structured design and sometimes the TAS often referred as signaling your persuasion this is the optimization problem of how do you reveal what information to people to get a desirable outcome and so this talk is going to cover two basic family of games Network routing games a zero-sum games and then towards the end we're gonna see some ongoing work and more applications so we'll start with network routing let's go back to the Google Maps example again so let me revisit the three point one there's also 2011 one you wake up the congestion of these rows are going to be different to Google you know three Google after Google revealed information to you through these colorful things you're gonna take the shortest path you just want to get work as fast as possible this is not a good example because Nolan drives in New York yes but it's further your California good example of it yes well various in California is also much higher than other places but not high enough what we don't have public transportation you have no choice right the question of how to reveal information ultimately because becomes how do you reveal information to minimize the latency of selfish route so go through two quick examples and now then I'm going to show you the proof outline for this work so one is let's say you wake up in the morning very simple example make sure flips a coin you either get the network on the left or the network on the right okay Google knows which one because Google's monitoring the congestion drivers don't know driver only know 50/50 so what would Google do in this case the latency function are a constant in this case so no matter how many people would take about certain to be always going to be doing one in this case who would reveal full information tell everyone to go on the zero link and everybody would be very happy so this is very intuitive this this is usually what happened is more information induces higher efficiency right but the second example is slightly a bit counterintuitive this is a variation of the famous prize paradox so if this middle link has latency zero then it incentivizes people to take the zigzag path so the social optimal way to route is actually for half of the people have to take top and have to take bottom they each incur a latency of 1.5 but when when you build this extra highway in your city actually it make everybody's life worse and they all suffer a latency of two now think of the middle edge as a bridge right it's a very wide bridge but half of the time is up and half of the time is down when Stanley who use it as zero people uses the exact pass when it's up it's infinity people will go back to social tomorrow so if your Google you know the bridge is up or down you want to tell that to the drivers if you do have the time you're getting a zigzag so half the time you're getting two and half of the time you're getting one point five that's worse than revealing no information about this bridge just tell the users I don't know whether the bridge is up or down and then that's enough to deter people away from using this bridge and half of them with the top half would do bottom and life is good for everyone this is the I would say something that put eventually I don't know like how useful is this and clearly there a Google Maps is very mysterious to me it does a lot of things that I don't understand these days it has a similar ETA thing but sometimes you switch you actually see quite different times and I think back in the old days our ways is very public about this but they will send people to longer pass just to get a better information on that route because you don't know right just because you don't have enough people driving on that route so you don't know so this sort of encouraged people to explore their whole thing about it but a lot of the things about Google map that I don't know I know I know one thing is if two people search the same starting and ending point they sometimes they get different recommendations we have two passes of similarly Vincey very excited right the results here the sabbatical results is it's actually empty hard to get a better approximation then price of Anarchy and in the worst case what you should do is just review for information all right we're gonna see a sketch of that roof very quickly yessiree what's the setup the setup is that you choose the signalling scheme they are new compute price from a different signal scheme and you don't find the right price when I get this thing this is gonna be my suppressor like you choose how to review information that is you can choose how to combine you cell networks right and once you reveal information players play selfishly you compute the Nash flow in polynomial time and you compute the latency of that Nash flow so you take the expected latency across your signaling scheme that is your the quality of your solution okay and you're comparing to the video oh yeah this is shopton will give them two information no sorry you're comparing to the best signaling okay yes you're designing a signal Minsky and you're comparing against the best possible signal so the the approximation ratio is pressed on a kilo of Bryce opponent yes it's it's comparing two Nash flow the Nash flow of your signaling scheme and the Nash flow of optimal signals are you doing you're doing just leave now so I make this latency yes atomic yes there is economic or equilibrium and you can compute it so once you once you decide on the second order scheme the quality of that signaling scheme is computable its modifying you don't know a valid move or do you have to tell the using so you have to choose to tell them something but remaining no information just means give them the prior IC because they have so the construction this is a sketch of the proof basically you would construct the graph that's a to copy of your given graph and let's take the brass paradox example so I'm gonna construct a graph with two copy of brass paradox with a super source and super sink then let's say I design it in a way that exactly one of these links are broken so every day you wake up with some probability one an exactly one of link is down Google knows which one but the players just know one of them is dead and what is the optimal signalling scheme for it for this graph this is the optimal war this is one of the optimal signaling scheme as you partition your head into two sets the red one and the black one and you only tell the user which set the broken link belongs to once the user sees you know for example one of the red link breaks down then he will take the green bar which is social optimal you can tune the probabilities so that this becomes a network design question essentially Google Google is facing whether or not to reveal information about this edge that decision corresponds to whether you want to keep this edge will remove this edge and that problem is at yard it's a network design problem which set of edges you want to remove from your network Nash though is the agency of mass flow is minimized and that is hard to approximate better than forward as well so we use that as a black box that concludes the Google Maps part and we're gonna move on to do or something questions it's neither you're not this is like a two three pages proof essentially following this segment which yes so this is not a zero-sum game but this is a normal phone game setting that we focus on so say you have a prisoner's dilemma I'm not going to explain this and the only Nash equilibria in this game is both fair with the fact unfortunately let's say now you have a godfather in this game that likes people to cooperate so the Godfather would actually know the Godfather just have a mood today and you add a you you give the player who cooperates extra theta dollars depending on the mood of the Godfather this is a uniform number from either it's either to 0-2 Punisher encourage cooperation and if you stare at this game first thing you can see is whenever theta is at least one you can compare these two blue values for example when theta is at least one is enough to incentivize affairs of cooperate let's say the principal's night it's the principal well I guess $1 if they cooperate and zero otherwise okay you are the principal you know the exact value of theta players only know a prior distribution how would you reveal it again let's try the two very simple signaling scheme no information and for information will you reveal no information players going to take theta as risk neutral players are going to take theta as its expectation that's zero they never cooperate when you read a full information whenever is two because it's higher than one they cooperate so you get $1 in 1/3 of the time we expect to pay off the principal is 1/3 when when theta when theta is uniform to 0 of minus 2 how does the principle get paid I think you saw one whose only paint them the know of them ok so the principal is not paying them they're playing this game ok and principal has a utility over their actions on this game the principal is happier with a cooperate so when you say information do you mean the setting of theta or something else principal does it huh probably I see so that's the information revealing you can choose how to help got a cut no there's no cost and you don't decide nature decides it you just learn from nature so these are two are you know say nothing tell them honestly tell them what turns on you can do better in this case you can tell you can tell them when it's 0 2 you tell them it's 0 2 wins - to eat Ottomans - that's the signaling scheme you're going to use and condition on it being 0 or 2 its expectation is actually what when that happens does it not to incentivize them to cooperate so they cooperate 2/3 at the time you get double you you're twice as happy as before because they cooperate this is a sort of the game and we're going to focus on so essentially the input to the problem it's a list of normal phone clicks and the principal has the option of choosing how to combine them then receiving the information the player would do a base update and play an ashram using the expectation of theta replace in play that game and the principal has certain objectives they want them to play the game in a certain way so for this talk we're first gonna restrict it to zero-sum games just to make everything simple earning the yahoo bound extends to general summary as well so let's say that number of games and the number of strategies are both and just to make things easier to talk path and the principal is trying to help one of the players think the think of this as advisors trying to help a student and students playing as they or something with institution the upper bound says there's a possible number time approximation scheme to computer absalom optimal signals okay I'm going to very quickly sketch how do you do this in the quasi hard limit time I note here this problem is in NP because you can show that or given the signal scheme you can compute its quality society network routing days because they equilibrium and there were some cases mortified and has a unique payoff so what happens is I'm going to draw a simplex and put three essentially get three different games at the vertices of this simplex and the blue region is a game in this at this point averages the three game in a certain way and the blue region are the region where the expectation of theta is at least one this is a region if you reveal a point a posterior in the blue region they're going to collapse cooperate so the point the question becomes how we decompose this prior so that you get a blue point with highest probability so the no information scheme corresponds to the review of the prior revealed X sub red point so they never cooperate the full information scheme corresponds to decompose it to three vertices you always tell them where it is and you get a blue point one third of the time the optimal signalling scheme reveal decompose it into these two posteriors that mixes again when this you run to so you get a blue point 2/3 of the time and that's the best thing you can do so essentially a public signalling scheme in this setting and the mother many other settings corresponds a problem of computing a convex hull of this underlying function so now to show you let's make everything Tomos am you I am you two are the posterior and I use that makes two of them and the other one I reveal you complete information and the optimal signaling F applied on the posterior gives the principal's payoff under that posterior the problem becomes computing a plus lambda so then you program so the takeaway from here is if I can promise you the set of posterior so that you will ever use that you can solve it in your program and don't with it so to show you there's a concept point number time approximation scheme all I need to do is to show you there's a abstinent optimal signaling scheme that only uses signals from a concept or MSI's set okay the lists are set when I call log in sparse signals so these are signals as you take a log in multiple multi set you can cover that into a distribution if you seen the approximate Nash this is a very similar to that so the trick is given the signaling scheme that uses arbitrary posterior I'm going to convert it to a signaling scheme that when we use this parse posterior so what happens is given the posterior it describes a way of mixing these games together right for example in our example this is half and this is half right and mixed is the first two games and that yes you can sample from this view pretending as a distribution and get a new coder instead this mu total is log n spots and use standard Kelvin and Unabomber to say when you sample log times all the entries of a new is going to be preserved up to epsilon and you know that mu it's a zero-sum game as well it's the posterior there were something so if all the entries are within Epsilon you know the banding of that game is with an F some of the original game so what you do is you take a signaling scheme you convert it to another signaling scheme of roughly the same equality for now I only uses par signals that shows you can solve a LP and be done with it so there's all that I've been more excited about is this algorithm as simple as it is it's actually typed for this case so there's a matching lower bound based on either plant agree conjecture or hypothesis today I'm going to show you just because yes if you assume it is defined to be conjecture do you use and like single plant extinct or like partitioning into a covering the graph which one are you use the same thing you use the you start from the single one but then you reduce it to partition - yes so it's the same thing it's just - several so actually I'm not going to explain the extra step I'm just going to explain challenge construction in that game right so to show that it's hard to reveal information all you need to do is construct the instance as hard so this is a game and we're going to try to construct so it's a security say hi a trencher that's hiding somewhere on their breath the principal knows where exactly they noticed but the row and column player only knows as a uniform no Knockaround right and the row player wants to be adjacent to theta whenever if this adjacent to theta he can he can he gain one point okay and the column player wants to catch either R or theta so the column player has to hit the exact same node either R or theta to defend the Treasury okay so let me state this for money so whenever there's an edge between theta and r the room that gets one point and one point is taking away from him whenever the defender defend either yes yes so one point for being adjacent and minus one point for a catch either one of the support okay for example if this is a this is a young cub of the game say that is actually here a real place near Colin play here the real player will get one point because he's adjacent to theta and none of them are caught if Rho is caught but bru is adjacent say therefore exempt or disappear so this is zero something I'm only to find real players pay off because they're zero something turns out revealing information in this thing is very hard as hard as politically for the whole reason we can we can do a sanity check over that again the two very simple signaling scheme so the principal can reveal no information that is the principal said I don't know where if they dice you do your best guess then it's very hard for their opener to be adjacent to theta when the rabbit is not super dense right because Rho Rho doesn't know where theta is theta is a random node in there brother okay so that's bad the other option is you can tell most players where if they notice we reveal full information about data that's bad too because the defender column player can just sit on theta and always catch the state of nature so the real player to always get something well the ruler get zero as well you would choose something adjacent to theta by the Condor catches him catches in nature and stuff so the principles pay off is what again principles pay off his what his role Thursday he wants to help room there okay I'm one of them there because it's a zero-sum game social welfare it doesn't make sense it's over zero okay so okay so to show the hardness for rebuilding information in this setting just consider what happens when you have a complete battery back crack's you're the principal you know where the treasure is you want to take advantage of the symmetry and two players payoff and what would you reveal here I turns out what you can do is you can tell which side either the left or right which side say that is on and the row player will choose a uniformly random note on the other side of the graph why is this a good situation for the real player and principle because there will always be adjacent to each other it's a complete bipartite graph and they're both randomizing over a large set of points in this clip I click is large enough it's very hard for the clone player to catch them so the payoff when you have a K by K graph it's actually 1 minus 1 over K it's very close to 1 so nothing we're pretty much done we're the intuition is done the actual proof is actually quite long but the intuition is the clicks are good for the principle in real players so the optimal signalling scheme corresponds to a partition of the given graph into dense sub graph and that problem you can imagine that you're given the random graph Aegean have embedded many clicks in there and you want to partition into creeks and that's as hard as identifying just one practically and then we're done so if you know how to do more signal name you get an algorithm that reveals the click in a random graph that we don't know how to do how to be possible okay so yes so questions cool so since they're part I'm going to reveal tell you something about other applications in the signaling domain and some future work when you can privately reveal information to people you don't have to announce publicly information like sometimes the principle becomes more powerful and can get higher utilities better alcohol see here's a prior on Tito's manifold brain you can't have any any pirate one but it's a common knowledge everybody knows the same part it doesn't have to be uniform but but usually we as a saint okay so because you're proximate anyway you get very close to it doesn't matter what prior you have the underground works for all prior yes lower bound so the last part is essentially just two examples one is you have a Bayesian second price auction so the option here is selling a random item it could be one of these four again bidders don't know which one it is but the auctioneer news exactly which one is the auctioneer is committed to run a second price auction after he reveals information about this item so sanity check to signaling scheme if the auctioneer reveals exactly which item it is you get zero revenue because one flip is one every everybody else is not interested the bit zero you get zero for revenue and if you review another information you just told them is random item they've been dark water that's their expected for red madam and your revenue is a quarter so what's the best thing you can do here you can get half you can you partition the item into two sets and then you tell them is it's the first two it's one of the first two or one of the last one and two of them will be in half it would compete against each other you don't have so then you can ask a question if I have a more complicated matrix than this one how can I extract the maximum amount of revenue so let me denote the F again this is a posterior so this is a low information posterior this is the optimal one of the optimal posterior F max it to principle utility in that case and second price auction is simply setting F of MU to the second largest entry of a times B okay and this is solved by separately by emic at all and notice in effect but it was left open that what if instead of knowing who exactly my bidders are what if I only know a distribution of them think of that as I know the valuation of 1,000 people but a hundred of them is going to show up randomly to my auction and what should I do in that case so that remain open for quite some time and the we solved it by using essentially the same technique of showing that you only need to use fire signals and then solve a help the reason why you need to essentially use them for this view to preserve the value of this function to prove to preserve value of this function you only need to preserve the largest century and second larger surgery so you can even get away with some not leaving the Union bounce instead of getting your class apartment offers and you've got a map since that and it's actually there's a general framework behind all of these signaling problems when you have an options bayesian auction you care about this function we have a vision there were something you care about this function you choose how to mix the A's together and you carry the value of this zero-sum game and you can design other situations like people are voting you can choose what information to tell them so they don't yet know and you want maximizing other people who oh yes say so turns out there's an algorithmic framework that samples the posterior and solve these all in all of these problems and it's very nice this turns into a Fox paper and that solves a quite a few open problems in theory okay so the last example I'm going to talk about today is what if the principal gets a privilege of privately community communicating with each flare and again we go back to the Google Maps example I'm going to show you that there is a case a principal can do much better well a lot better compared to the case where you can only publicly announcement we're going to look at a variation of the pecos example this is an example that gives you the price of a monkey - fluence optimal in this case as the social optimal is for half of the people to take top half takes the middle so but in reality people would all take the top hats in the one we stopped in to all of them where all that passes in the actual program I'm going to augment this with a pass with congestion ability and I'm going to rotate it okay so you wake up in the morning it's one of these three networks you don't know which one but Google does if okay so if Google can only announce it something publicly then I claim the latency has at least one everyone for example Google can reveal for information tell you which one which network it is and everybody would take the X path against the latency of one if Google ever tries to mix up two of these network let's say with some property he is first my own with some property in the second one then what happens because this link yeah has infinity people are only going to take the only edge that's not infinity on either side either one of their graphs right so if I have a public signalling scheme analysis every things to everyone then everyone will take the same path however if I reveal full information or you buy it or try to mix them I don't do very well effectively I get one which is why I get when I remove all information or no information actually when I reveal for information okay so what's the privacy I can't recommend different route to different people so it turns out is very simple you just signal the social movement if this is your rack tell half of the driver to go top and half of a driver to go middle okay we're going to see why is incentive compatible yeah let's say your driver you receive the recommendation to take the middle path what do you know you know is probably you have you are on the first graph and was probably in half you're on the second graph that's all you look you know for sure you're not on the third round because Google would not recommend that to you that's 50/50 okay you don't want to give you because half of the time you're on this graph and half a time you're on this graph if you deviate either to the top link or the bottom link then with 50% chance you're going to suffer a latency of infinity and you don't like that so you would not you will follow Google's recommendation it's actually the for revelation scheme here is patient incentive compatible players would follow the recommendation and the gap between public and private signalling scheme is forward that's a maximum you can achieve because you can always review for so that concludes my talk today to summarize we settle the computational complexity of revealing information optimally we're body games and patience there are some games and we see a cute example where private systems does better than all public signaling schemes that's it thanks question for the zero-sum games is there just one notion of optimality or is there a whole bunch of them yes good question we have a zero-sum game it's actually just one fixed version because once you fix the signal Minsky you can evaluate their quality of it right you get a bunch of whole numbers so so is the principle somehow China get them to cooperate that was one of your example yes if you care call social welfare is always zero so the example I used you care about the goal Canaries pail okay and that's fix after you reveal the second over there it might be much more equilibrium but the rumor gets the same payoff in any of these equilibria okay exercise for define what do you have a general something and it's tricky because after you reveal the information there's this general subject and there are multiple equilibrium sort of different results in the I say you want to maximize social welfare the assumption we make is you can recommend the equilibrium when you send the signal actually I tell you it's either one of these two games I recommend you to play the sequel occur the player can check that this is actually a equilibrium and then they can play following that that's the optimistic view again there's a there's robust notion as well but we can handle that together so that's why in this talk I choose to focus on zero-sum games because equilibrium computation is unique its canonical producer so for this auction question example I think that that's relevant to Google setting of what you can signal so there you have you consider this private versus public and start about borders the most meaningful question to study no so that's that would be because I can really think of signaling buyers or exactly they care about the boss and extracting the Mexican things from them differentially signaling right I don't know there is there is a paper I mean DC last year by dust fact is have a temperature sounds on if you want to combine into problem design the signal Minsky it can also design what auction you run after that then this problem is equivalent to the aunty item auction instead of selling a random item you're actually selling and different lottery to different items then there's 40 item auction right but that's that's different from what you're asking so I don't know yeah it's open for just being I think it's a good question yes well it's likely both theoretically interesting and definitely practically interesting yes well I'm not sure would you say that a commitment to running a second-price auction afterwards is realistic this happen is that you actually want to do Meyerson but no no I mean we fix certain things here's a second price auction it's all those little store this because that's what exchange does all the times yeah well now we say I don't know but that's very interesting I don't know was for example you know a cute example what we do you have an example of an instance where public signaling in the second patient second price auction does much worse than privacy exactly yeah clear I mean I'm thinking of a setting where like the item that comes with meat is the same item right it's there and then people don't know the features of the item that is like it's mighty feature item yes and let's even think of setting where the value is just the inner product of the vector you have each buyer is a vector it's a wi4 right and then feature is a bullet feature vector X and then in the first of WI and X is like B is the Pinner what do you want to do like okay you know one extreme is just looking do the best things for each guy but then you lose some tension there yes there is a way to formulate this problem so that there is some tension in the problem yes I know and I can also put restrictions on like I know how different you can be when you are talking about private signals right like you can't lie or something like you can yeah maybe you can report a zero mean you can't report a zero to be 1 for instance and things like that right it may be reporter want to be I don't know but you can't report a zero to be 1 because that's like saying yes playing a signaling scheme is something the other part the players can verify we think of as Google can publish the curve of how maps actually recommend suggestions you have verified accurate so the zero one thing any examples are lying it is right no it's not oh you can okay so it's not more lying than the bluff kiss in the poker game for example if if you if you know for sure for some reason that you're on this crap then you actually should deviate to the X right because you have to pee boys on that path if you know for sure for some reason this is the same argument as if you know for sure Alice is holding a queen you should call me the key but overall you should end well you shouldn't always call with the King undies you can sometimes you catch and it's bluffing sometime you suffer very much you lose moment so if the players are risk neutral they were actually they were gonna deviate but if there's leakage and say I learned I'm on this graph from some other app then all bets are off right for your question I know their work that studies the following setting where every player can either choose to vote yes or no you know by item were not a item and the principle just cares about not some function say us a modular function over the number of people who buy the item a simple example would be I just cared the number my utility is the number of people oh yes younger people who buy the item there's a hardness result if that function is some modular so the best you can do is to signal privately so this is called I think it will get into you see this year but it's our type it's by chatting on one of his students it's called a private eye you should persuade you you care about how many people purchase the item yes and then you are motivated to look it therefore is a monitor on supporter function you want to motivate us a people to buy it as possible yes and what is the information structured like what are we giving you can you can tau is very different things about like what what is when you think you can not know but what is the information structure like what are you lying about them what are you say you were saying something about this random item right it's a random item okay if the same city itself okay except except instead of carry clearing about the second highest bid you care about the number of people who buy this who choose to buy this okay yes you can yeah so think of it as there's a fixed price which means the number of people who build one or something yes that's what we care about like item eighty there's only one item right yes one item but you care about the not the sum of the number of people who pick one item yes think about I'm trying to sour software a copy of some item might actually have unlimited but the more I sell I get a diminishing return function of these okay so essentially you suffer the one minus one over you because you can be running a very complicated correlated signaling ski mm and when you turn that into independent you suffer this correlation tap or some other functions okay and the best you can do is talk a nice overall independent signal basically for you I'm going to flip a corner and tell you something about the item but that's not going to be dependent on what information with your calories I'm going to flip different coins but they're independent if you want to be bad then it becomes np-hard just maximizing someone you know really cool actually it is very nice I can send you the link okay thanks very much thank you [Music]
