 live from Los Angeles it's the queues covering open-source summit North America 2017 brought to you by the Linux Foundation and a redhead hey welcome back to run live here in Los Angeles cubes live coverage of open source summit in North America I'm John Fourier it's part of the Linux Foundation he would submit him in coho salmon Buki bomb actually guys had bad my scene use the technical product marketing for Linux containers of Red Hat welcome to the cube thanks for having me I appreciate Red Hat has been again the gold standard when it comes to open source this conference really is about Linux you did you get any further than look at the shining example of success that his red hat from when I was growing up back in the day when open source was radical tier 2 tier 3 some would argue alternative to the big boys who were the proprietary operating systems now tier 1 well-documented no need to recycle all that but the fact is rel is a Tier one supports multiple 7-10 web me here is now is way support rel is it over 12 and over 15 years of Red Hat Enterprise Linux at this oh yeah come on John remember when Red Hat advanced server came out and what was that 2000 2001 turned into you know relevant rly but yeah John I was working for you know an infrastructure company and keeping up with kernel.org was a total nightmare and it needed some adult supervision and that's what Red Hat caught yeah of course do and this is well known every bang this is tier one it's part of the operational infrastructure so it's got to be stable but now you got all this growth going on certainly we heard Zen when talking about it on stage the executive director saying looking we're gonna have potentially by 2026 400 million libraries and open source so certainly the open source realm is growing turf operating system skills that a power all this application salutely and so you want the best of both worlds you want the stability foundational aspect of the operating system while still encouraging experimentation failure growth iteration so agile and DevOps ethos is about open source it is about trying it same time gonna keep the lights on then we'll hunt down time what's your reaction how do you guys look at that going forward you want to enable more but you don't want to break stuff yeah I mean that that's really kind of one of the hearts of most of our customers problems right is if you put it in terms of spend seventy five eighty percent of what people spend money on an IT right now is keeping the lights that's really long-term not sustainable right for anybody involved so one of the things that we need to do as an operating system and as a broader than just operate system as a distribution where customers come to us and not want just a less bits but they also want to wing and application components how do we draw that line between things that move a little bit faster an upstream that popular and people want need access to at the same time providing that really long-term stable system user space that really shouldn't change over over a long period of time because that's what provides that that sort of application stability that we can ride out over Matt in the keynote this morning Jim gave a put out a lot of stats talking about 10,000 cook lines of code outed daily 2500 lines of code removed daily you know 450 organizations contributing you know so much going on in the space what are they working on you know what are some of the big you know issues because it's stability we've added growth you know sure there's cool things like kubernetes and containers i remember that the hot t-shirt at the Red Hat summit this year was you know Linux's containers but our haters are Linux so you know we know a little bit about that story so what sort of things is the community working on these days sure so like you said you know a lot of shiny objects right and even those objects to be honest they're not that shiny you look at some of the original support for what's now Linux containers but in 2006 if you really want to draw the line 2002 but there's a lot of things going on in a new hardware enabling right it's not just new applications that are taking advantage of these different kinds of technologies we've got new vendors coming out arm is about set to take off and add some new challenges and choices to the enterprise customers we've done a lot of folks who are working in networking right the networking stack with NREL has changed dramatically over the past ten years and with OpenStack and things that are driving through the DPD K and into natural virtual functions and things along those lines there's a lot of core stability and core change and things we think of as state Brigance it some of those some of those new workloads we spend a lot of time this laughter you're hearing about you know edge computing IOT you know V being something that that's pretty important going forward you know Linux looks like it's gonna be it's a lot of these places mobile you know it's already all there you know we talked this morning you know 2017 s the year Linux desktop this because there's so many devices right now that are Linux so you know how does the workload impact that yes so you know everything these days is really starting to hit the point where almost everything's that distributed look like right we've really left the definitely left a single system single workload paradigm and even the kind of traditional up through the past few years and here we have app web and database that's really starting to get pushed out across multiple devices not only is it getting compute closer to the edge with some of the IOT devices but simply looking at how we do reliability stability you mentioned DevOps that whole the ability to move that reliability layer away from relying on expensive components at hardware or expensive components and software I really distribute that layer knowledge at the application and use more replaceable more commodity sorts of manic as fuss when the operations is one of my degree in my undergraduate in computer science and back in the 80s everything was did the build your own operating system again this is where systems come back sure it is at the cloud today it's real sis systems game and all of us guys and gals from the old days are now in vogue again because the cloud is an operating system now you got subsystems you got anybody just distribute a little bit more decentralized but again again it's the same game different era if you will so you're starting to see the emphasis on operating system so the question is you know Intel the great example Palmer is used to call Intel the hardened top where a lot of proprietary stuff underneath that process that no one really cares off is it just drugs I'm not saying that open source of proprietary at some point you have to harden the top right you guys have that with rail right so okay now you want to create more subsystems or new apps how do you guys look at the future because it's a really dynamic environment so DevOps is rule fast and break stuff you see the Facebook model now let's move fast and be reliable which is now the ethos of hops guys sure they want innovation infrastructure is code but they don't want it to break things so you got a hardening things at the same time you want to don't foreclose and the opportunities as you guys look at that opportunity technically what should customers look at it as a navigation map to go down that journey path yeah absolutely so I mean the most obvious way that we experiment in the open is with fedora that that's where we start to play around with new technologies and some of these new concepts and figure out you know what is the appetite and how do we stabilize those and what's the maturity level of the code but one of the other things that we do is sometimes we get some flack for it but you know we've met this idea of backporting right so for example well seven four just released about 30 days ago it's a three ten base kernel that's kind of old except for the fact that we've added stuff that was in 4.12 and 4.8 so you know we're looking at not only how do we experiment upstream how do we make sure that we're working in the right communities to make sure to understand what that innovation looks like how we're gonna bring that in and then bring it into Fedora actually start to get some people using it and once we actually do realize that it's you know it's time to go ahead and stabilize this we'll put some customer gets here it's changed from an appetite standpoint when do you guys start going okay we gonna start really getting see if about this cause there's always gonna be a fight R&D go in there anything's happened but at what point do you say okay we got to start getting down and dirty sure on to these new trends and what specifically do you look at today and saying okay this is obviously on our radar we're doubling down on yeah for us really it comes down to our customers right they're the ones that we're really trying to drive when people start asking us hey we need to see some of these new features coming out there's a there's kind of a critical mass that we can we can see through the market we can see through some of our partnerships and for example you know we just added some nvme over fabric enablement that's brand new there's not a lot of people out there that actually have devices available let alone put them in a production at this point in time but we need to make sure for our customers that that ecosystem is stable fro from a partner standpoint an operating system standpoint from the driver and device standpoint so that way it's safe for customers actually go ahead and use and in the Meo a fabric that would be published service providers looking at that heavily is it enterprises we've got a we've got actually enterprises we've got customer we've got customer enterprises and we've actually got some partners as well - made a comment a in the keynote this morning said the concept of absolute security does not exist there will be bugs you speak to you know the development of Linux and kind of the communities you know how do they look at security in there are you you know keeping up with those changes making sure you can move fast yet be stable and handle those is how do we look at that from a Linux standpoint yeah that's a really big challenge and I think that one of the key things that happens from a community standpoint is we do have leadership that understands that community that culture of security has to be break baked in from the start it's not something you can bolt on once the product has been released into the wild and someone else can fix that later the community does a really good job of understanding that this has to be reviewed from the get-go there's a lot of things that we do as well that working within the communities trying to understand what what really the threat levels are and what happens with a new threat comes down the pike how do we close that gap faster how do we react to it in a timely fashion but also at the same time preserving all the things we need to do the right way upstream okay what sort of things it is red hot working on in rel what people can share a little bit for the roadmap that your users are asking for that they're gonna find interesting in the near future so some of the things that we're finding that the folks are asking for kind of goes back to the nature of distributions these days people are asking for things that are a little more streamlined a little more choice in what they can and can't use and also looking for the operating system itself to be a little more automatable to make up a word we've got that this level of DevOps and automation that's going on both for the kind of new CI CD systems as well as traditional fleets of virtual machines so we're trying to work on how does the operating system act as a good citizen in a highly automated environment until we put facilities into the operating system that helped folks who are trying to automate do that sort of natively rather than you know having the operation who's operating system fight it when it threat areas automation do you see as hot right now because that's a good thing I'm a big fan of automation because yeah maybe some manual labor will be automated away but those are usually non-differentiated labor roles right which could be shifted to higher value opportunities I'm sure you'd agree with that but so what would be or do you agree and then what would be the areas that are being automated way no answers order of operations no sure yeah no I absolutely agree it's one of those things that my background is infrastructure and you know many many failed attempts way back in the CBS and Canary servers to try to do these things in cfengine in 2000 and I don't really want to admit how old but I think that you know you look at the devops world i the deb side of the house has a pretty good idea of how to automate them how to build pipelines I think that the operations side we're kind of missing that that pipeline view of infrastructure is too right we've got the the state machine at the beginning now the state machine at the end but I would think where there's some interesting opportunities to get some new expertise is that how do I design and let an automated system create some sort of deployable artifact by directly creating and pushing an image somewhere or some sort of other artifact that describes a higher order than just I need to configure these seven things to put an IP address on this box let's think I'll list the view of things exactly I have a good big sense of the trees not the the forest not the trees exactly and it kind of goes back to that everything is a distributed system right we no longer have oh this is my web server it's like this is web server 77 of 82 that's part of this 200 node cluster that does whatever my line of business applications to cloud operations now give you the final word give a perspective of the folks watching what are the cool things that you guys are bringing to the market in the future what can they expect from you guys after the operation systems critical component we heard from the keynote today is powering a telescope in the Arctic so I mean it's everywhere it's done not only on earth but in space absolutely so what's next what's the exciting new things that people could expect it's a different edge right right Eric on what a different edge they're going out to space exactly SpaceX so you got the telescope with the IOT device technically they're over as a you know Linux on board too it's literally on other planets at this point in time can we do better than the Linux on other planets that that's a good question the whole decision to pirate using the quota in Martian movie space pirate yeah so I think you know part of what we're going to be seeing from from the operating system is how do we drive choice and how do we provide a new way of looking at the way we distribute bits and pieces so that folks have more control over what they need when they need it like we've seen sort of uptick in how many versions of operating systems like we're back in that resurgence like we had in the early 2000s at Lennox con 99 of different operating systems of different sizes to do slightly different things I think we're going to see a lot more shape around what some of that looks like hopefully we'll see kind of that robot army of Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems that we can you know make that nicely differentiated space out of I think that you know there's gonna be a lot more and some of the networking space and that's an orchestration your view on orchestration yes orchestrate personally I you know I think it's it's it's one of those right tool for the right job I hate to say it depends because that's that phrase that everyone hates to hear even though it's true usually true and it comes down to like you mentioned containers like what are we trying to work a straight I'm watching like the right layer of abstraction if we're trying to work it straight applications that's a different set of orchestration and perhaps trying to stand up and tear down data centers but maybe not and I think that from an operating system standpoint those are all things that we can and should be able to enable rather than you know resisting and causing friction for people who want to say you know we want kubernetes No we want something else great we're there to support all of those things because those are capabilities that we provide made them at Mycenae inside the cube your twitter handle is at clever beard you can see the clever beard there he's a technical product person Linux and containers for Red Hat thanks for sharing your insight of the cube actually appreciate the support from Red Hat and continued congratulations on the successful open source you guys are the leader the bellwether and open source and congratulations to you and your company appreciate it thanks well i've covered with the cube i'm john 4e was stupid men here in los angeles for exclusive coverage of the linux foundation open source summit in north america we were right back with more live coverage day one of two days of coverage after this short break
