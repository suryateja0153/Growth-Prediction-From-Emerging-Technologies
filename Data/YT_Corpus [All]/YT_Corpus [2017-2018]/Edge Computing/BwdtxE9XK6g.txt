 [Music] hello and welcome to computing fundamentals - there are many useful ways to represent the graphs as we will see in this video working with the grass it's helpful to be able to choose it's most convenient representation in this video we will show how to represent the graphs using adjacency lists adjacency matrices and incidence II matrices one way to represent a graph without multiple edges is to list all the edges of this graph another way to represent a graph with no multiple edges is to use adjacency lists which is specified the vertices that are adjacent to each vertex of the graph let us take a look to the graph G shown in Figure one to represent the graph G use using adjacency lists we need to draw a table that lists all the vertices of a graph G and in the second column we will list but we will specify the vertices that are adjacent to each vertex for example the vertices b.c.e are adjacent to vertex a vertex a is adjacent to vertex B as you can see from table 1 in Figure 2 we can see a directed graph that we need to represent it using an adjacency list first we put down the initial vertex for example a and its terminal vertices we have B C D and E which are connected to a so that we call them terminal vertices vertex V has a loop so we and the are terminal vertices of B but vertex D has no terminal vertices as all edges are going into D not in the opposite direction the adjacency list for directed graph is shown in table two carrying out a graph algorithms using the representation of graphs by list of edges or by the adjacency list can be difficult to handle if there are many edges in the graph to simplify computation time graphs can be represented using matrices two types of matrices is commonly used to represent the graphs will be presented here one is based on the adjacency of vertices and it is called the adjacency matrix and the other is based on the incidence II of vertices and it's called incidence matrix in next slides we are going to describe both of them in details we are going to represent the grass using adjacency matrices let us take a look at a graph G and figure three in adjacency matrix we think of rows as well as columns of their matrix to be labeled by the vertices so we have a B C and D vertices as rows and we have a b c and d as columns as you can see in figure four so let us call our adjacency matrix a and by definition of the adjacency matrix we know that an entry in row I column a will be equal to either 1 or 0 it will be equal to 1 if the H I and J is actually an H and 0 otherwise so let us take an example so if you look at vertex a and then you ask is vertex a is adjacent to a the answer is no because that will be a loop so you put 0 there its vertex a is adjacent to vertex B the answer is yes so we put 1 in that row its vertex B is adjacent to vertex a dancer also yes so we put 1 its vertex C adjacent to vertex a so the answer also yes so we put 1 and we will do the same for there is the rest of the vertices the complete adjacency matrix for the simple graph G is shown in figure 5 so if you notice that if we have vertex B and vertex V is adjacent to a so we put one vertex B is a J is not adjacent to D so we put 0 vertex B is adjacent to C so we put 1 and that takes B is not adjacent to D so we put 0 let us take another example about representing a graph using adjacency matrix this time we are giving the adjacency matrix shown in figure 6 and now we need to draw the graph based on it once we have one in the entry off row I and column a J we draw an edge between the vertices if we have zero then there is no edge between them as a result the graph hitch is shown in Figure 7 which representing the adjacency matrix shown previously in figure 6 adjacency matrices can also be used to represent and directed the graphs with loops and with multiple edges a loop at the vertex V of I is represented by one at the entry I and I of the adjacency matrix when multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices like V of I and V of J or we have multiple loops at the same vertex the entry of this matrix equals the number of edges that are associated to V of I and V of J all undirected graphs including multi graphs and so do graphs have symmetric adjacency matrices so let us take an example of pseudo graphs where we have multiple edges and loops this graph is shown in figure 8 consider that graph P has loops and multiple edges between its vertices this means that an entry between vertex a and B is equal to 3 because we have a 3 different edges between a and B when we have loop as you can see at vertex C the entry associated between vertex C and C is equal to 1 finally we need to remember that rows and columns in adjacency matrix represent the disease of the graph there are some equals the degree of vertex taro represents for example if we ask what is the degree of B we are going to find it's equal to 5 look back into graph shown in figure 8 you will find that degree of B is indeed equal to 5 another common way to represent a graph is to use incidence II matrix but first we need to understand what we mean by incidence a matrix so the incidence a matrix is usually donated by M instead of a there is only one key difference we still are going to be labeling our rows by vertices but now what we need to do is to label the columns by edges figure 10 is showing an example of incidence matrix with five vertices and eight edges so let us take an example of incidence matrix as you can see in Figure eleven there is undirected graph that we need to represent using incidence in matrix to represent this graph we need to draw a matrix M with five rows as the vertices v1 v2 v3 v4 and v5 in the graph we have six edges which represent the columns of the matrix M and by definition of adjacency matrix we know that an entry and row I column J will be equal to either 1 or 0 it will be equal to 1 if the vertex I belongs to the edge II of J and 0 otherwise we can see that X 1 has a several edges that lays on so it has a 2 and a 1 so we will put down 1 below E 1 and E 2 in the matrix for vertex V 2 we have the degree III for each X which are connected to it so we put ones in the Associated cell the complete incidence matrix for this graph is shown in Figure 12 now when you look at the row sum of the incidence in matrix M you are going to get the degree of the vertex as I said in the row when you look at the row sum of V 2 you're still going to get 3 that's telling there is the total of 3 edges that V 2 is incident with when you look at the columns you will find that the number of one's is always 2 so if you look at E 3 you will find there is 2 entry if you look back at each oh in the graph you will find it does indeed has two ends and this is basically the actual definition of an edge that has two ends in this video we have covered the following topic we discussed adjacency list adjacency matrices and incidence matrices next video we are going to discuss graph isomorphism so thank you for watching this video and see you in the next one [Music]
