 Hello, and welcome to KUKA Connect where you can access and analyze your KUKA robot data on any device, anywhere, anytime. I'm Emre, one of the product managers behind KUKA Connect, and I'm excited to walk you through a quick introduction of our product. Once you login to KUKA Connect you'll be greeted by a launch banner on your dashboard, an expanded view of your robots card and several class cards that contain essential information about your robots. KUKA Connect is comprised of expandable and collapsible cards that display vital robot data and analytics. To customize the amount of robot information displayed, you can filter the cards display data for any specific group of robots. The robots card is outlined in orange to indicate its filtering capacity. Select the specific group to change all cards to reflect that group's data. Once a robot is selected from a group, a robot details card is displayed to provide an overview of all data and analytics related to that robot. You may have noticed when navigating KUKA Connect the menu is always accessible in the top left corner of the screen. At any point you can access the menu to customize and personalize your experience using KUKA Connect. For example, you can choose to view KUKA Connect in English, German or Chinese. Thank you for watching this introduction to KUKA Connect. Our team is passionate about our customers and we hope you enjoy the experience.
