 live from Boston Massachusetts it's the huge covering OpenStack 7:00 2017 brought to you by the OpenStack foundation Red Hat and additional ecosystem to support hi I'm Stu minim and my co-host this week has been John Troyer this is silicon angle media's production of the cube worldwide leader in live tech coverage and this has been OpenStack summit 2017 in Boston Massachusetts John we came in with a lot of questions one of my premises coming into the event was that we needed to kind of reset expectations a little bit I know I learned a lot this week still one of the you know my favorite communities a lot of really smart people really interesting things going on and you know open source infrastructure is really the focus here start with you kind of you know big meta takeaways from the show so far big picture my first summit my first summit here I didn't quite know what to expect I loved the community a lot of activity a lot of real-world activity going on people building clouds today so that was very insightful and very you know that's a great data point as far as the ecosystem goes a lot more talk about integrating with the rest of the opens open source ecosystem about integrating with other public and private clouds so I thought that there was also a lot of self awareness here about where OpenStack is on its journey and you know how it might proceed into the future so overall I think a you know a really practical focused and grounded week yeah um came in like right was that the whole concept the big tent I I think we said there's there's a big hole poked in that you know there's the core is doing well there's a number of projects I forgot the user survey whether you know there's a kind of the six core pieces and then there's like you know 9 or 10 and the average configuration so there's there's more than the core there's interesting things going into it and last year I felt that OpenStack kind of understood where it fit into that hybrid cloud environment as you pointed out this year some of those upper your things I feel like I understand them a little more so you know of course containers and kubernetes a big piece of the discussion that this week you know containers definitely transforming the way you know we build our applications it seems a given now that the containers will be a big part of the future and openstax ready for it we had yesterday we had the people that did the demo in the keynote but you know containers doing well kubernetes fits in pretty well even though I think it was Randy Baez that said well you know OpenStack needs kubernetes you know my paraphrases kubernetes doesn't need OpenStack koukin you know is going to be an Austin at the end of the year and that show could be bigger than this show was here in Boston year-over-year from the North American show attendance is down a little bit but still robust attendance lots of different pieces containers kubernetes you mentioned some of the other pieces any other add-ons on that well no I mean other than it's it's worth saying that these are not either/or these are these is all and if you look at the total addressable market every place that containers and kubernetes can play that's every cloud in the world right it's up it's up there at the application layer if you look at where OpenStack belongs yeah it is in these private clouds that have special needs that have some privacy security or functionality latency you know just data gravity right there's all these reasons why you might want to build out a public cloud and we see that with with telco right telecom is building out their own infrastructure because they need it because they were on the network core so that's not going away as far as containers go again the story was was not either/or it's and you can containerize the infrastructure that's super useful sometimes being bare metal is useful separately you can put containers on top because that's increasingly becoming the application packaging an interface format so I didn't see a lot of ideology here stew and that was refreshing to me people were not saying there is one true way this is a modular system that at this point in its life cycle it has to become very pragmatic John I think that's that's a great point because we knock on and everybody knocks on open stacks not simple and the reason is is because I t's not simple everybody has different challenges therefore it's not a Lego brick it's lots of ways we put it together I have some really interesting you know deep dives with a customer a couple user today the Adobe advertising cloud Paddy Power Betfair both of those gave us real concrete examples of you know how and why they build things the way they do how OpenStack and kubernetes go together how like acquiring another company or switching your storage vendors is made easier by OpenStack so you know we've talked to a number practitioners they like OpenStack reminds me of like VMware people like being able to build it and tweak it a different scale for some of these environments but people are building clouds the telecoms are doing some good things all the Linux companies are super excited about the future that it helps them kind of move up the stack and become more critical environments and you know how it all ties into this you know multi hybrid cloud world you know digital transformation you know many of these pieces you know I need that modern infrastructure and the open infrastructure coming from OpenStack and related pieces pull it all together well where is the innovation going to come from in this next generation of cloud I thought our segment with Oram talking about the massachusett open open cloud was great because he's there as a computer science professor somebody who's been intimately involved with virtualization with with IBM with VMware saying ok we need to we need to build this next-generation where can we innovate we have to we have to own the stack and OpenStack is a great way for us to to innovate with that with those different components one of the challenges because OpenStack as a set of technologies is so modular is how where do the where's the knowledge come from where's the knowledge transfer can you find an open stack expert do you have to grow them so I see that as one challenge going forward for the OpenStack community is how do we grow the knowledge base how do we make sure that people are trained up and able to architect and operate OpenStack based clouds yeah John how about the individuals themselves we talked to Lisa marine amphi about the ambassador's program we talked to a number of our guests throughout the week about you know training everything from Oren Krieger talking about how his students are helping to build this - you know engagement contribution I mean it's nuanced when I I look at the future of jobs a lot of companies here hiring which is always you know heartening to me what's your take on that aspect well it's still a very vibrant community you look at these different camps a lot of them are vendor affiliated these days there are very few there are very few communities that are that are outside of a vendor and these open source foundations are one source of those I think look there's still five or six thousand people here right this is not at this small event and these people are active hands-on operators for the most part so yeah and the thing I point out there are lots of companies that have contributors here the other category is still really big here point lisa-marie made many of the people that have contributed here have switched jobs a number of times you know NASA helped start it they kind of left they came back some of the big telecommunication telecom companies uh they're not selling OpenStack they're using it to help build their services so it's like wait you know which are vendors which are you know providers I think we know everybody's becoming a software company you know Jon tech reckoning are you a software company yet we use a lot of salt we use a lot of cloud mostly on SAS yeah yeah Silicon angle media we actually have a part of our business that is software we've got a full development team you know open source plays into you know some what we do but I guess what I'm saying is like the traditional demarcation between the vendor and the consumer and open-source tends to be blurring I don't remember in the keynote if they had you know hey how many people have contributed to the code that's something we used to get partially because we have splintered out that did this this event a little as to you know the goals it's no longer the people building it they've got lots of ways to do that and a lot of the drama's gone we had for many years in OpenStack it was you know who's going to own what distribution and who's driving what project and a lot of that come out we talked about the last couple of years has it become boring in certain ways but it's important it's driving a lot of pieces and you know OpenStack should be here to stay for a while yeah it's part of the conversation I love the term open infrastructure we heard it once or twice that we'll see if that becomes a topic of conversation you know going back to lease mean am fees segment I encourage people to check out your local OpenStack meetup right you'll find that other conversations are going on there other than just OpenStack this is this is an ecosystem it interacts with the rest of the world yeah and talk about that next generation you know edge is really interesting the conversation we had with Beth Cohen also talked to lead to oil from the analyst perspective lots of cool things happening with that next generation of Technology 5g is going to play into it so there's there's always the the next next thing and openstax doing a good job too as a community to be open working with it and understanding that they now don't need to be all things to all people certain other pieces will pull in and we have that broad diverse ecosystem let's say I'll go out and make a prediction I think in in five years we're going to look back and we're gonna say actually OpenStack driven plumbing is going to be driving a lot of the next generation of the Internet yeah I love that actually I forget if it's two or three years ago what I said was that as Linux took a long time to kind of work its way into all the environment OpenStack pieces will find its way there Brian Stevens from Google said you know if it wasn't for open source in general Linux specifically we wouldn't have any of the hyper scale guys today and you know all those companies leverage open source a bunch you know we've heard whisperings that you know not just the telecommunications some very large global companies that are trying to figure out how OpenStack fit into it coming into the show it was all the talk about Oh Intel stopped its joint lab with Rackspace you know HPE pulled its cloud out there's some other you know hyper scale companies that are looking at OpenStack it's reached a certain maturity and it will fit in a number of places all right well John we started the beginning the week it was cloudy and overcast a little cool in Boston the skies open up it's blue I've loved having you know two weeks here in Boston really appreciate you joining me for the journey here here here for the opening I have it was fascinating thank you John I want to thank our audience and thank the whole team here in Boston and the broad Silicon angle media team this is our biggest week that we've ever had it's how much content we're creating so thanks so much to everyone thanks for community for watching as anything when they scale you know let us know if there's things we need to fix or feedback that you have for us force to minimun John Troyer the whole team here here in Boston and beyond I want to thank you so much for watching the cube be sure to check out Silicon angle TV for all the upcoming events let us know where should we should be at and feel free to reach back it reached to us with any comments and thank you for watching the cube
