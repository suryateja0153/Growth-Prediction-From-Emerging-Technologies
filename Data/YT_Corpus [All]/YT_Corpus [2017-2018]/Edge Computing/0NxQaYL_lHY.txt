 it's it's a pleasure to be here with you and to tell you about something I've been dreaming about and working for for many years and and now it's coming to the surface quite powerfully and quite usefully in in many areas I apologize sometimes these flickers for some reason but I hope it doesn't disturb the story I'd like to give you a little touch of history since I was there at the beginning of this journey and give you a brief introduction to what we mean for for computing and then go quickly to three powerful application spaces for this technology together with industrial internet and one is industrial automation that the focus of our activity has no bureau technologies the other one is one of my favorite ones and we'll get there is the automotive that caught fire here in Silicon Valley in the last year's the the autonomous car the connected vehicle and so on and this is related to also intelligent transportation and smart cities and then a little touch on what for computing means for smart grid energy but many many other sectors will find the same usefulness the same architecture dimensions of for computing applicable so this is the this is the story that comes back hopefully here the the day in 2011 at 10 when for computing the word started here oh god is jumping around I think is the connector this is that the age of the dongles this is not an Apple dongle and so we are having troubles and this is not yet one of the last machines that are out let's hope for I never had this problem okay all right this is a de 2010 at the aquarium Research Center in today where I gave a talk about robots going down deep in the bottom of those big big valleys under the ocean and when I finished the lady Jeannie in the middle approached me and told me look why don't you call what you're talking about for computing because this cloud community brought too close to the ground and I protested for about 15 minutes and under a drive home I thought that's really a good name for what we are doing what we have been doing in the last year's and I started trying it out and using it and more and more I found good response and so seven years later I'm still here talking about the same thing what's happening is the fuck'em the edge of the network saw was very important but it was always very important in IT is still very important in IT in mobile in content distribution but when I he came to the surface it became even more relevant to understand the need of resources virtualized real-time capable secure trusted with storage computing and networking coming together at the edge at the edge of the IT Network now they are calling this mobile edge they realize we are realizing that mobile can benefit from local resources at the edge powerful real-time capable resources but also and more importantly for what we are doing in this space of operational technologies this is the space at the other and at the other side of the boundary between information technologies and operational technologies and here is where we are living with far computing these days so apologize I apologize for this behavior that is maybe I have another dongle Apple dongle maybe I could look at that maybe Morris can help me out here anyway so what is for computing for computing is really the platform that brings modern cloud inspired computing storage here is important for our friends at Western Digital and networking function closer to the data producing sources in our case machines things but not just bringing cloud down is also bringing functions up from the machine world the real-time the safety functions the trusting and and reliability function required in that area and this is a unified solution at the edge that really brings together communication device management data harvesting analysis and control so this is kind of new except for our friends in in in wall street the real-time part was not as sensitive now we are realizing how important these and how important the position of resources is in the future of solutions in this space and so it's a it's a is not boxes is a distributed layer of resources well-managed at the edge of the network and really has a lot of potential across multiple industries here we see the progress also in the in the awareness of this topic with the open for consortium that is now a very active and even the VC is Peter Peter Levin here is talking about the importance at the edge what is really happening here is the convergence I think we should probably stop and use a different angle is this the one no no this is not the right dongle in the world of dongle sorry or you have the computer with a problem okay is the right dongle with the right computer okay all right we are getting back there this is the new Apple okay we are here this looks better thank you all right so this is to be understood this is the the convergence of IT functionality the modernity functionality with the OT requirements and this is fundamentally the powerful angle that that for computing brings to IOT II and machine world so all the nice things that happen in the cloud come down but meet the requirements of resources the the needs and the timing of the edge and so when you look at what is brought into particularly the the world of operations you see these kind of functions that are not usually there in fact when you meet this operational world you find micro processors you find Windows machines industrial pcs and so on not so much Linux not so much the modern approaches to computing these are the type of dimension that you'll see have a particularly impact particular impact on the pain points seen in the world of applications so now we go to the use cases in use cases in in the Internet of Things I think is on your side I'm sorry because is the second machine okay oh maybe this is the solution so we have seen this picture of IOT multiple times a lot of verticals we are concentrating on these three one is the industrial the second one is the autonomous vehicle and intelligent transportation the third one just touched upon is the smart grid this is the area of activity for nebula technologies those kind of body shops and and industrial floors with large robots with a lot of activity around those robots with cells protecting the activities within each working space this is the the world of PLC's industrial pcs controlling robots very fragmented here we are really finding even more critical this boundary between operational and informational technologies this is a firewall also a mental firewall between the two worlds and the best practice is very different in one place in the other particularly also in the the way we handle data security in many other areas in this space which is also a little more characterized here with this kind of machines that you see in this isuh 99 or ISO 95 type of picture you see the boundary between the two spaces once more when we come back and alright so the key message here is very tough to go across it's very complex the interaction between the two worlds and there is where deeply we find a number of pain points at the security level at the hardware architecture level at the data analytics and storage level at the networking software technologies and control Kotetsu there's a lot happening there there is old 1980s timeframe very stable but in need of new approaches and this is where for computing has a very strong impact and we'll see sorry this is a disaster here all right what do we do all right maybe I should go around with this computer and show it to you okay now it's there for a moment now this is maybe you have to remember one picture of all this talk look at this what is this this is a graphical image of a body shop of a of an important car company you see that the dots represent computers bark in within boxes industrial pcs PLC's controllers for welding machine tools and so on that is if you sum up the numbers is thousands of computers each one of them is updated through a a UPC USB stick sorry and is not managed remotely is not secure because there's a trust that the whole area is enclosed through and protected through a firewall on the other side but it's very is very stable but very rigid so this is the world that we are finding with dedicated isolated not secure computing this is edge computing but it's not what we hope to be seeing soon as for computing in action there so this is the situation very delicate very powerful and very motivating and now comes a IOT and this is not the solution it's helping IOT tries to connect this big region in for the operational region to the backend to the clouds to the power of computing that is their very important predictive maintenance many other things can be done from there but it's still not solving the problem because now you have to put little machines gateways into that region one more machine to manage one more machine to secure and now you're taking the data out you are not solving a lot of the pain points there's some important benefits this is very very good but it's not the story the story is sold once you really go one step deeper deeper in fact from connectivity between information technologies and operational technologies to really convergence and you see it here where you're starting to replace those machines supporting each cell with a fog node with a powerful convergent point of computing real-time computer that can allow control and analytics and storage and networking in the same nodes so now these nodes are trying to replace all the objects controlling a cell and offer more functions to the cell itself and now you can imagine where these goes to a convergent architecture much more compact much more homogeneous much more like cloud much more like cloud brought down to the edge when this comes back ok almost there so this is ok this is now the the image that you can imagine leads to this final picture that is now even not ok you see it ok now you're seeing the operational space with the fabric of computing storage and networking there is modern that is virtualized that supports an application store now you have containers there you can imagine virtual machines and and Dockers leaving in the operational space at the same time you have a continuum from the cloud to the network to the modern network moving to the edge into the operational space these is where we are going and this is where the world wants us to go and the picture representing this transition in this application of a computer in this area is the following the triangle the pyramid is now showing a layer of modern computing that allows communications analysis control application hosting and orchestration in a new way this is cataclysmic really is a powerful shift still not fully understood but with immense consequences and now you can do control tight close to the machines a little slower through the fog and a little slower to the cloud this is where we are going and there's many many use cases I don't dwell on those but we are proceeding with some of our partners exactly in this direction now the exciting topics if I can have five more minutes making up the time wasted what's going on here the connected vehicle the autonomous vehicle the electrification of of automobile are all converging and I think it's very clear that the paradigm of for computing is fundamental here and in fact imagine a the equivalent of a manufacturing cell with the converging capabilities into the fall and compare it with what's going on with the autonomous vehicle this is a picture we used at Cisco seven years ago but this is now a car is a set of little control loops ECU's little dispersed poorly connected computers very difficult to program same as the manufacturing cell and now where are we going we are going towards a fog nor on wheels data center on wheels but better a fog node on wheels with a much better network in between with the convergence of the intelligence the control the analytics the communications in the middle and then a modern network deterministic Ethernet is called TSN is going to replace all these canvases and all this flaky things of the past same movement in industrial and in the automobile and then you look at what's going on in the intelligent transportation you can imagine for computing at the edge controlling the junctions the traffic lights the interaction with cars cars - cars and you see it here this is the image again where you have the operational space of transportation connected to the clouds in a seamless way with these nodes of computing storage and networking at the junctions inside the cars talking to each other so this is the beautiful movement coming to us and it requires these distributional resources with real-time capabilities here you see it and now there's mark grid again it cannot continue to go the same way with a utility data center controlling everything one way it has to have and this is from Duke and a standardization body you can see that there's a need of intelligence in the middle Fogg nodes distributed computing that are allowing local decisions energy coming from a micro cell into the grid and out a car that wants to sell its energy or buy energy doesn't need to go slowly to a utility data center to make decisions so again same architecture same technologies needed very very very powerful and we could go on and on and on so what are we doing will will we want advertise here but the name has to be remembered the name comes from a grape that grows in the fog in northern Italy it's in Piedmont my hometown is behind that 13th century castle you see there out there is northern Italy close to Switzerland that vineyard is from my cousin it's a good nebula starting to be sold in California too so this is the name nebia fog comes to no beard maybe or technologies we are building platform for this space with all the features that we feel are required and we are applying it to industrial automation and our funders are not so much from here are from Germany Austria cuca robotics t-t-tech GI TV from Japan and a few bullets to complete my presentation for computing is really happening there's a deep need for this converged infrastructure for IOT including fog or edge as someone calls it but we need to continue to learn demonstrate validate through pilots and PLC's and we need to continue to converge with each other and with the integrators because these solutions are big and they are not from a little startup they are from integrators customers big customers at the other end and an ecosystem of creative companies nobody nobody has all the pieces no snow Cisco no GE and so on in fact they are all trying to create the ecosystem and so let's play let's enjoy the cloud the fog and the machines and try to solve some of the big problems of this world ok Flavio well done sorry for vegetation sorry for the hiccups now we did that on purpose to see how you'd react of you're pro thank you so much for the great presentation now we're gonna get in the panel one looking at the data models and putting data to work and
