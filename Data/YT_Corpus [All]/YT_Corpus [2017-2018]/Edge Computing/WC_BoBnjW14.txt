 Hi, my name is Harsha, and I'm the chief commercial officer at Anacle Systems I'm here to introduce the Tesseract a smart energy management platform Tesseract is your next generation platform for smart energy management in this video We will be demonstrating energy disaggregation also known as non-intrusive load monitoring with Tesseract So energy disaggregation is a technique whereby by measuring only the main power line we can determine What appliances are powered by it and how much power they consume The amount of data and processing power required to disaggregate energy is huge That is is where the Tesseract comes in with its power of edge computing Next up we will show you the setup of energy disaggregation as well as the single power line that is connected to the Tesseract The Tesseract will only be measuring the total energy consumption from this single power line So what I'm going to do is turn on the fan and you'll be able to see in a short while the consumption of the fan over here And as you can see in low-power mode. It's about 14 watts and a high power mode if we switch it across is about Roughly 23 watts so as you can see over there Now what I'm going to do is showcase another interesting application. I'm going to turn off the refrigerator That's been turning on for a while and when I turn it off What is 52 watt here which is measuring the refrigerator. It's going to come down to about zero. What is interesting about this is that it's not just capturing the fact that is zero watt, it also sends an alarm as you can see the flickering light The refrigerator has been turned off. We're in the age Where energy supplies are not able to tell you why your bills are so high and what's actually causing it? But we have created a solution for you A data analytic platforms such as Tesseract which collects and analyzes real time energy information for you meanwhile generating data services regarding energy product and providing customers insights.
