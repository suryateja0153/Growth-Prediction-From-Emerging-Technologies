 live from Washington DC it's the cube covering dot next conference brought to you by Nutanix welcome back to DC everybody this is the cube the leader and live tech coverage this is our special coverage and presentation of Nutanix next conf 2017 is the third u.s. conference that the cube has done of Nutanix dot next Nicolas Radford is here is the senior vice president of engineering and the CTO at Houston mechatronics where you hear what these guys do and Saatchi mikvah Ghani who was the VP of Technology at night annex gentlemen welcome to the cube and oh he hiding let's get right into it yep we're talking IOT we're talking edge you guys do some pretty interesting stuff tell us about the company what were robotics is a service company primarily but we do some intelligent automation and intelligent drilling in in the IOT space so it's it's it's pretty exciting and dynamic area actually and then just imagine taking a bunch of different systems that haven't typically talked together before and we've kind of glued them all together and and then one of the big oil field services companies was attracted to our sort of thinking in this area and have taken some given us some work and you know we're taking taking and running with it could you just explain what robotics as a service means well usually you know they're just kind of rake this down in a couple different ways you know there's a lot of people out there that sell robots and and it's kind of a thin business right you know you might sell a robot and then that the people you sell it to use it and make a bunch of money off of it and then you're starting you know you're stuck trying to find a new customer to sell a robot to but if you consume the robots so to speak that you build and then use them as a service it's a much more lucrative position to have and so we do technology systems development for for partners and then we also operate that robot in the field for them so it's a good residual pull-through revenue stream for us so Satyam the the the industrial technology world the information technology world to come and crash them together you know IT and ot mechanics has been talking about the edge you more and more I mean if you're not talking about the edge not the game but give us an update on your strategy with regard to the edge and and really you're thinking about companies like like NYX and a great question I guess I have so much sit down well yeah I guess we kind of sort are not it naturally fell into it because we saw that the future of computing might be more edgy then we think is you know right now we are spending a lot of time and energy worrying about clouds you know private cloud public cloud how to consolidate them but then at the same time we are seeing that there's so many of these sensors being deployed in the world just this year it's going to be roughly eight and a half billion sensors if you can't consumer an industrial era T together by 2020 it's got to be 20 billion sensors it's all the data that these sensors are going to generate is going to be processed in real time closer to where the sensors create the data as opposed to slightly further away which is in the cloud of course the cloud remains relevant is the cloud is going to do much more longer-term processing and H is going to do real-time process real-time processing on the data and so in that sense we saw that as a natural natural step to of the hyperconvergence yearning is if you think about step one of hyperconvergence as the convergence of compute storage and network resources inside a data center step two is the convergence of the edge and the cloud into one fabric one ôs okay well I wonder if you could help us unpack that a little because we saw kind of public cloud pulled at the Dana Center for years and now the edge is pulling out the client backyard edge is different from the data center so most people think of Nutanix you know I mean they're living in a data center or maybe some service provider so you know it's different form factor I know I know there's some announcements Nutanix made to kind of get to robo cases is that the same for the edge yeah different form factors because you know some of these hardware needs to be ruggedized united sunrise rates are drones or military vehicles and so on but also slightly different and evolving storage stack because now the problem of deploying applications at the edge is developers having to write code and not having to worry about how the code runs of the edge because as soon as they have to worry about that developers become operators infrastructure operators and so this one will also have a slightly higher level of application stack you know machine learning services or analytic services at the edge so that applications can directly consume those higher-level services as opposed to the lower-level you know which actually that's it's really intriguing because it's part of our robotics as a service side of our business we have a pipe inspection system that we're going to be deploying in quantity and so what you that that's that's a type of edge device right that's that's that's a robots are really nothing more than fancy data collection systems right and so we put them out into the world to collect the data but then what do you do with that data how is it stored what sort of post analytics are you doing on that data to then feed forward back to the intelligence at the edge so that they can make decisions better right so when you have our robot we call pearl a pipe inspection robot you'll actually see a demo of it later probably as it's traveling through the pipe it's collecting all this data right so but all of the runs prior to that it's afforded all of that knowledge on the decisions it's making right then and there right because we've done all this back learning if you will on what deformities look like which increases the quality of our inspections and so then if you start looking at a ubiquitous deployment of these type of assets where you might have ten twenty thirty in the field that's a massive amount of data that you're collecting right there right where the sensors being taken the processing of that data is determining whether the robot stops and maybe observes a little bit more but then it's all being shipped back at a later date to the cloud for further analytics then to feed forward on the next operation to perform that better so it's this feedback process of learning between the the application that's actually happening in real time and the later on analytics that will occur so let's keep let's stay on the data for a mom it is all about the data is it correct that much of the data in your world is analog data that your you're able to now can convert into digital or yes you already there at the end of the day your talk you're trying to take an analogue measurement of some type right we live in an analog world and and if I'm trying to measure the thickness of a pipe I'm usually I'm using a transducer yeah that by nature is typically an analog device I can then digitize that information and that's how I send it over and in you know communication streams and what not and of course it's stored digitally but at the end of the day you know we're taking analog information doing data processing on that looking at what it means in the activity that we're trying to do measuring the thickness of the tube and then we ship the data back at a more convenient time when we have more bandwidth back to the cloud for all the deep learning deep type of analytics you kind of explain that like kind of your stack I'm so when you explain it to me because how did you get to Nutanix you know what goes into what public cloud what services are using there if whatever you could share we're involved with Nutanix on our rig automation side and so we we use their their their their storage you know we use their storage in a way that they they've created an excellent way of doing that and so that's that's primarily how we interface with them and one of our big oil and gas partners is a huge client of theirs and so you know that's that's our primary relationship with them in fact I sent I sent rich a picture of a Nutanix box that we just recently installed in our server room and I was like you know give him the thumbs up and I was like you know all right in public cloud you know did you have a specific one you're using using mini clothes yeah for the processing of data you've seen some of it goes to public cloud though it just ya know I mean it's it's it's more about the local area I mean this is the stuff we're using in turn I mean this is this is the security requirements that we have is so your cloud is an on-prem clock yeah okay how much of the data I mean they know it can't be precise but if you think about all those real-time decision-making that you're doing how much of the data is actually gonna go back to the cloud I mean it's even in rough percentage terms well we'd like to hit it all back right it's just what you don't send then and there right there's there might be a little stream of it coming back off of let's say our pipe inspection robot but at some point though you want to take that download everything store backup I mean it's an all the big data analytic analytic techniques and analyze it I mean you know so you won't pretty you you expect you want to persist the majority of the data and you ultimately will not do that at the edge you'll ultimately help yeah that's that's we use the shipping up in you use this every truck access method to get it there go ahead I have a different opinion kind of sort of the similar principles very different opinion it says you know in terms of volume a very small fraction of the data is going to make it to the cloud there in terms of intelligence you know almost 100 percent of the intelligence is going to make it but it is how the edge participates in reducing the volume of the data you know just again to give you numbers you know in the year 2020 it's projected and this is I think the Cisco global cloud index they project that roughly six hundred zettabytes of data is going to be created on the edge and the public and private cloud combined in that year is going to roughly witness 15 satellites of data and so the question is well weighted the rest of it go and I think my answer is if you look at for example a smart building or a robot inspection a kind of scenario the robots taking pictures or video strains which is ridiculously rich data and changing it into time series they whether some anomaly it was detected or not you look at a smart airport example we're going to take a lot of surveillance data and changing into whether a person of interest was detected detected or not or did you see a white van that you are looking for and and so really the information the volume of information goes down but the refinement goes up is you know the cloud really is interested to know because you know presumably in the semantics for example you know somebody is again sitting at a dashboard monitoring all California airports looking for a person of interest and all they are worried about is whether some somebody showed up or not and so it's the metadata that shows up as opposed to the audience the needles go back you just go back exactly that's a good way to put it not a haystack yeah it was one of the things we look at IO T is it's really created a much larger an order of magnitude more surface area for security attacks is that something that that can turn view your client you know what concerns our clients you know very much so absolutely in fact one of the first one of the first questions out of everybody's mouth is how are you gonna handle security so it's it's it's paramount and very important absolutely all right it's not - how you gonna solve that well I think your guess blockchain and you know people stop asking questions as soon as you say blockchain no it's an unbelievable problem in fact something that probably we haven't you know kind of solid in generations we are struggling with cloud security with cyber security and now we are talking about a number of devices that's going to be three orders of magnitude more than the number of servers that run in the cloud today what about weddings we haven't talked about its conductivity how do you connect the edge just all wireless yeah I mean the ubiquity of the wireless networking systems very high right now I mean it's all high quality you know good wireless it's like Wireless yeah but it's actually it's a you know one of the one of the issues that we're having with honestly our pipe inspection demonstration today is just being flooded there's so many there's 4,000 people in the main hall right and so there's all this wireless activity and sometimes you know our pipe inspection robot doesn't know who it should be quite listening to and I mean you know that you go to a concert and you look like you might head to a Metallica concert here and there and and you know you sometimes you can't even send the text because there's just so many people and trying to connect and it's it's a big deal so so it's a challenge for you absolutely it's a challenge excellent I've seen some vendors they are deploying special networks right they are deploying low bandwidth networks where aizen's doing it I think he's doing it no pineapples that's like the most recent Silicon Valley all right gentlemen listen thanks very much really appreciate you coming on the cube a great story and use cases it's always pleasure something good good luck hi keep right the everybody we'll be back with our next guest the cuber live from Nutanix next conference right back [Music]
