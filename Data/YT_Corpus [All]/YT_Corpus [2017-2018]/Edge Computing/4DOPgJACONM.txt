 live from Madrid Spain it's the cube covering HPE discover Madrid 2017 brought to you by hewlett-packard enterprise welcome back to Madrid Spain everybody this is the cube the leader in live tech coverage we're here covering HPE discover 2017 hum de Volante with my co-host for the week Peter burst Randy Myers back he's the vice president and general manager of synergy and mission critical solutions that hewlett-packard enterprise and Paul shell are this year the director of the Center for Theoretical cosmology at Cambridge University thank you very much for coming on the cube it's a play good to see you again yeah good to be back for the second time this week I think that's a nice day out let's play too right talking about computing meets the cosmos well it's exciting yesterday we talked about Super Dome flex that we announced we talked about in a commercial space where it's taking Hana and Oracle databases to the next level but there's a whole different side to what you can do with in-memory compute and it's all in this high-performance computing space you think about the problems people want to solve in fluid dynamics in forecasting in all sorts of analytics problems high performance compute one of the things it does is it generates massive amounts of data that people then want to do things with they want to compare that data to what their model said okay can I run that again they want to take that data and visualize it right okay how do I go do that and the more you can do that in memory it means it's just faster to deal with because you're not going and writing this stuff off the disk we're not moving it to another cluster back and forth so we're seeing this burgeoning and the HPC guys would call it fat nodes right we're going to put lots of memory and eliminate the i/o to go make their jobs easier and professor shel art will talk about a lot of that in terms of what they're doing at the cosmos Institute but this is a trend you don't have to be a university we're seeing this inside of oil and gas companies aerospace engineering companies anybody that solving these kind of complex computational problem that have an analytical element to whether it's compared to the model visualize do something with that once you've done that okay so Paul explained more about what it is you do well in the cosmos group which I'm the head we're interested in two things cosmology which is looking and trying to understand where the universe comes from the Hobby bang and then where interests in black holes and particularly their collisions which produce gravitational waves so they're the two main areas relativity and cosmology big topics oh okay I mean I don't even know where to start I just want to know okay what have you learned and can you summarize it for a layperson I mean where are you today what can you share with us that that we can understand well what we do is we we take our mathematical models and we make predictions about the real universe and so we try and compare those to the latest observational data and we're in a particularly exciting period of time at the moment because of all a flood of new data about the universe and and about black holes and in the last two years gravitational waves were discovered okay so there's no pearl Pro Nobel Prize this year it and so lots of things are happening so it's a very data-driven science and so we have to try and keep up with with with this flood of new data which is getting larger and larger and also with new types of data because suddenly gravitational waves are the latest thing to look at and where is that one of the sources of data and new sources of data that you're tapping well in cosmology we're mainly interested in the Cosmic Microwave Background yeah the sources of data are the cosmos yeah and so this is relic radiation left over from the Big Bang fireball okay so it's like a photograph of the universe a blueprint and and then also in the distribution of galaxies you know so 3d maps the universe and we've only it we're kind of in a new age of exploration we've only got a tiny fraction of the universe map so far and we're trying to extract new information about the origin of the universe from from that data in relativity we've got these gravitational waves you know these are ripples in space-time there there are traversing across the universe they essentially earthquakes in in the universe and they're sound waves or seismic waves that propagate to us from these very violent events so I want to take you to the gravitational waves because in many respects it's it is an example of a lot of what's here in action here's what I mean that the experiment and you know correct me if I'm wrong but it's basically you create a catalyzer two lasers perfectly right each other shooting a signal yeah about two or three miles in that direction it's right and it is the most precise experiment ever undertaken because what you're doing is you're measuring the time it takes for one laser versus another laser and that time is a function of the slight stretching that comes from the gravitational rage yeah so that is an unbelievable example of edge computing it where you have just the tolerances to do that cannot is that's not something you could send back to the cloud you got to do a lot of the compute right there wait that's right that's right yes so so a gravitational wave comes by and you shrink one way and you'll stretch the addition towards the space-time yeah you become far enough right yeah and these tiny tiny changes what's measured and and nobody expected gravitational waves to be discovered in 2015 we all thought are another five years another five years you know they've always been saying well we'll discover them we'll discover them but it happened and since then it's been used two or three times to discover new types of things and there's now a whole and I'm sure this is very central to what you're doing there's now a whole concert the gravitational information can in fact becomes an entirely new branch of cosmology if I got that right yeah you have it's it's called multi messenger astronomy now because you don't just see the universe in electromagnetic waves in light you hear the universe this is qualitatively different it's sound waves coming across the universe and so combining these two the latest event was where they they heard the heard the event first and they turned their telescope and they saw it right and and so much information came out of that even information about cosmology because this these signals are travelling hundreds of billions of light-years across to us we're getting a picture of the whole universe as they propagate all that way so we were able to mention measure the expansion rate of the universe in the techniques for the observational the technology for observation yeah what itwhat is that how is that evolved well you've got the wrong guy here I'm from the theory group right we're doing the predictions and and these guys you know with their incredible technology a seeing the data are seeing you know and and it's it's imagine that the whole point is you've got to get the predictions and then you got to look in the data for a needle in the haystack which is this signature of these black holes colliding well and that's and you think about that I have a model I'm looking for the needle in the haystack that's a different way to describe an in-memory analytic search pattern recognition problem that's really what it is this is the world's largest pattern recognition problem you know most precise and I mean literally and that's an observation that confirms your theory right is that well the way firms look there maybe was your theory of probably in my group we have relative this who are actively working on these black hole collisions and making predictions but their dampening vibration from passing trucks and these things and a yeah and the technology is amazing the technology is one of the reasons why it this becomes so exciting and becomes practical is because for the first time the technology has gotten to the point where you can assume that the problem that you're trying to solve can be focused on and you don't have to translate it into technology terms right so to talk over to talk a little bit about because in many respects we're that's where business is business wants to be able to focus on the problem and how to think the problem differently and then have the problem and have the technology just respond I don't have to start with the technology and then imagine what they can do with it say so I think from from our point of view it's very fast-moving field things are changing new data is coming with the data is getting bigger and bigger because you know the instruments are getting packed tighter and tighter and there's more information so we've got a computational problem as well so we've got to get more computational power but you know there's new types of data like suddenly there's gravitational waves there's new types of analysis that we want to do so we want to be able to look at this data in a very flexible way and ingest it and and explore new ideas more quickly you know because things are happening so fast and so that that's why we've adopted this in-memory paradigm for a number of years now and you know the latest incarnation of this is the HP Superdome flex and that that that's a shared memory system so you can just pull in all your data and and explore it without carefully programming how the memory is distributed around okay so we find this is very easy for our users to developed pipelines data analytic pipelines to develop their new theoretical models and to compare the two on the single system okay so it's also you know very easy for new users to use you don't have to be an advanced programmer to get going you can just stay with the science in a sense you know PhD in physics to do great physics your PhD in physics and technology it's a very flexible program of flexible architecture with widget programs so you you can more or less take your laptop pipeline to develop your pipeline on a laptop take it to the Superdome and then scale it up to these huge memory problems and get it done faster you can iterate yeah you know and and I mean these are the most brilliant scientists in the world bar none right III made the analogy the other day supposed to say present company excepted imagine I am pay or Frank Lloyd Wright or someone had to be their own general contractor right know they're brilliant at designing architectures and imagining things that no one else could imagine and then they had people to go do that this allows the people to focus on the brilliance of the science without having to go become the expert programmer we see that in business to write parallel programming techniques are difficult right spoken like an old tandem guy parallelism is hard but to the extent that you can free yourself up and focus on the problem and not have to mess around with that it makes life easier some problems parallel wise well but a lot of them don't need to be and you can allow the data to shine you can allow the science to shine is it correct at the barrier and your ability to reach a conclusion or make a discovery is the ability to find that needle in a haystack or maybe there are many but well if you're talking about obstacles to progress I would say computational power isn't the the obstacle it's it's developing the software pipelines and you know it's the human personnel the smart people writing the the codes that can can look for the needle in the haystack oh-hoo-hoo have the efficient algorithms to do that and and you know if they're cobbled by having to think very hard about the hardware and the architecture they're working with and how they paralyze the problem our philosophy is much more that you you you solve the problem you validate it I mean it can be quite inefficient if you like but as long as it it's a working program that gets you the way you want then your second stage you worry about making it efficient you know putting it on accelerators putting it on GPUs make it go really fast and that's you know for many years now we've bought these very flexible shared memory or in memory is the new word for it in memory architectures which you know allow you and allow new users graduate students to come straight in without a master's degree in high-performance computing they can they can start to tackle problems straight away what it's interesting we hear the same you talk about it at the outer reaches of the universe I hear it at the inner reaches of the universe from the life sciences companies we want to map the genome and we want to understand the interaction of various drug combinations with that genetic structure to say can I tune exactly a vaccine or a drug or something else for that patient's genetic makeup to improve medical outcomes the same kind of problem I want to have all this data that I have to run against a complex genome sequence to find the one that gets me to the answer so there's kind of the you know from from the macro to the micro we hear this problem in all different sorts of languages so one of the things that we have our clients mainly in business mm-hmm asking us all the time is with each will let me step back in as analysts not the smartest people and what test I'm sure for real but as analysts you know we like to talk about change and we always talked about you know mainframe being replaced by mini-computer being replaced by this or that yeah I like to talk in terms of the problems that computing has been able to take on you can't able to take on increasingly complex challenging more difficult problems as in consequence of the advance of technology very much like you're saying the advance of technology allows us to focus increasingly on the problem what kinds of problems do you think physicists are going to be able to attack in the next five years or so as we think about the combination of increasingly powerful computing and an increasingly as simple approach to use it yeah well III think the simplification you're indicating here is really going to more memory you know holding your whole workflow in memory so that you what one of the biggest bottlenecks we find is ingesting the data and then writing it out you know but if you can do everything at once then that's that's the the key element so you know one of the things we've been working on a great deal is is in-situ visualization for example so that so you you see the black holes coming together and you you see that you've set the right parameters you know haven't missed each other or or so that something's gone wrong with your simulation in in the same way it's so that you you do the the post-processing at the same time you never need the intermediate data products so so larger and larger memory and and the computational power that that balances with that large memory you know that it's all very well to get a fat node yeah but you don't have the computational power to use all those terabytes and so that's why you the this sort of in memory architecture at Superdome flex much more balanced between the so so what are the problems that we're looking forward to in in terms of physics well I mean in cosmology we're looking for these hints about the origin of the universe okay and we've made a lot of progress analyzing the Planck satellite data about the Cosmic Microwave Background where we're honing in on theories of inflation which which is where all the structure in the universe comes from from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle rapid period of expansion just like inflation into the financial markets in the very early universe okay and so we're trying to identify can we can we distinguish between different types and and are they going to tell us whether the universe comes from a higher dimensional theory ten dimensions gets reduced to three plus one or you know so so lots of clues like that we're looking for statistical fingerprints of these different models in gravitational waves of course this whole new area I mean we think of that the Cosmic Microwave Background is a photograph of the early universe well in fact gravitational waves look right back to the the earliest moment you know fractions of a nanosecond after the Big Bang and so it may be that the answers the clues that we're looking for come from gravitational waves and of course there's so much in astrophysics that will learn about compact objects about neutron stars you know about the most energetic events there are in the whole universe I never thought about the idea because cosmic radiation background goes back way up about three hundred thousand years on yeah that's right very well in for four hundred thousand ever thought about the gravitational waves effectively being noise from the Big Bang and yeah yeah well well with the Cosmic Microwave Background we're actually looking for a primordial signal from the Big Bang you know from inflation so yeah well anyway what are you gonna say Randy well no I just mean it's amazing the the frontiers were heading down it's it's kind of an honor to be able to enable some of these things right I've I've spent 30 years in the technology business and heard customers tell me you transform my business or you help me save cost you help me enter a new market never before in 30-plus years of being in this business have I had somebody tell me the things that you're providing are helping me understand the origins of the universe it's just it's an honor to be affiliated with you go on and the honors mine Randy that you're producing the hardware the tools that allow us to do this work well now the honors powers how do we learn more about your work and your discoveries and conclusions in terms of looking at how to see average Stephens books they're very he's got a new one called the brief a history of time more accessible than the brief history of time so in so your website is weary yeah our website is CTC cam a co uk the Center for Theoretical cosmology and we've got some popular pages there we've got some news stories about latest things that have happened like the HP yep partnership that we're developing and some nice videos about the work that we're doing actually that very nice video and certainly there were several videos run here this week that if people haven't seen them go out they're real on YouTube they're available in your website till they're on Stephens Facebook page also I think you sure your website again well actually you can get the week that's the the beautiful videos of Steven and the rest of his group on the discover website is that right yeah okay HP discover webs yeah but your website is CTC dot-com AC dot uk' and we're just about to upload those videos ourselves secret marketing suggestion yeah supervisor CK AC UK okay we got we got to get the cubed bone up a little bit thank you alright keep it right there buddy mr. universe and I will be back after this short break
