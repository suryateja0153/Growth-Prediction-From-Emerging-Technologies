 from Las Vegas it's the cube covering VMworld 2017 brought to you by VMware and its ecosystem partners [Music] hi I'm Stu minimun joined by Justin Warren and you're watching Silicon angle production of the cube here at vmworld 2017 three days of wall-to-wall coverage sometimes people ask me Stu you guys are doing so many interviews you know isn't it tiring I say well when I get really good guests that makes it my job really easy we've had lots of customers on and been enjoying Justin many as though that one of the people that I've gotten to get to know through the VMware community I'm thrilled to be able to bring back on the program is Steve Herod who is now the managing director of General Catalyst Steve thanks so much for joining us thank you I feel like a veteran of this program yeah I remember back when we created like one of our first what we called sizzle videos we had you know b-roll from you and Pat Kelsey drew before he was on the on the VMware side that's right so you are always welcomed on our program where we're glad that we could find time that fit on both of our schedules you made a you know guest appearance hey younger Steve haired maybe you know in the keynote had had a lot of us laughing so I was that was fun to be back I think that the story is kind of interesting I don't know if it got lost in the dialogue a little bit but the idea was something seems super novel at the time and it becomes kind of the new normal right and I think that was the point he was trying to make and it was it was truly the case back in there you know early years of him are trying to convince people to do these virtual machines was like ridiculous oh yeah I know it's all these other topics I think back you know I've worked with VMware for 15 years I think back to how many people I explained like you know what is virtualization when vmotion first came out you know the awe and excitement on everybody's but it's 2017 come on virtualizations like the legacy now it's cloud and developers and blocked a nebulous serverless that's right I guess that brought up server list before I did so what what's happening in your world these days what are you know some of the big conversations yeah this one I obviously founded my favorite conferences to come back to also just to really see what's going on at a top level mostly because of the customers that are here and then obviously the infrastructure vendors but I'm I know I feel like as I get older and go through this industry longer you see a lot of the new things that are popping up and for me it's it's always been about heterogeneity and when we started VMware what actually mattered is like you had different vendors of servers and like it caused chaos by having different server vendors that's by that by teams yeah exactly it's like the BIOS or the Hal and Windows had to change or something and like no one talks about that whatsoever now but if you just kind of squint your eyes a little bit the heterogeneity is now am I in a public cloud or a private cloud or maybe I put my software into a container versus a VM so I just I always like looking at what is the heterogeneity and then what our real customers must to do with it how do they navigate it and what companies can be built that help you sort of smooth it out and use the different things I've been doing that all my life and continue to look for companies that do that yeah that mix of different things in in customers particularly enterprise customers you have like nine of everything it seems like with VMware and the AWS now being more well we're friends now whereas previously it was like oh no you have to pick one or the other it's like the heterogeneous nature of things is that well actually no we need to work with multiple of you all need to play nicely with each other otherwise we can't use you because even if I M&A for example I hilum by someone they might have something different that's right that seems to get lost a bit the vendors seem to focus a lot on our grain fields so do you think that this kind of we're friends and yes you can use both of us and it's all good do you think that's gonna be that that's the way it should always have been and that's going to be good for customers they're gonna adopt this a lot more than they might have with something which was like no no you have to choose I think I think that's absolutely right now the way the way have already seen people doing things the customer always wins that's kind of every time I have a startup who's gotten created and they have a great customer and they say you know blank vendor won't work with us I have them call the customer and tell them to tell their other vendor work with a start-up yeah and and the good news is you know any any company is successful a super customer centric and they they didn't listen I think in this case it's it's really fascinating if you think about it it used to be like you've been coming this rubber used to be VMware was about server consolidation that's like the furthest thing from anyone's mind now right now it's the real limiter to doing these new things tends to be people and operational skills and so the idea that you can use the same way you're used to working with infrastructure the same way that you grade storage and the same way you think about it and then apply it into a world that just kind of outsources all of the underlying goo it they used to do on the servers it makes a ton of sense from a vmware customer standpoint and you obviously as you look at the relationships they have with Google or with Amazon you know they're very inserted to have new cloud services that people are able to consume and the number one problem for them is how do you get like real important apps to leverage these new services so if it's symbiotic in the sense that maybe some of these existing apps as you start to morph them they can leverage a Amazon or a Google service and so it's you know it's it's helpful on the needs of the public clouds as well yeah why don't one of the areas where the heterogeneity of the environment causes even more complexity is security so I know that that's something you've looked at a while we've talked to some of the the companies that you work with heck I think you know IOT the surface area is just changing by orders of magnitude security top issue you know being discussed here you know pack elster got up on stage and says hey I need to apologize for the industry because we failed you it's not it's so you know Steve why haven't your portfolio company fixed all of this yet yeah what's your tables doing and yeah I mean it's a it's obviously something people if you if there was the cube in 1981 it would have been talking about security as a challenge and I do think um you know things have changed quite a bit as of late I think the number of really advanced attackers you know truly nation-states or organized crime going after it and it's the same reason that robbers robbed banks it's because that's where that is and so I think the sophistication has gone up at the same time when the complexity of the environment has gone up a ton as well and so I would say if we were in the good old days of less sophisticated attackers and like a closed-end data center with no roaming mobile phones or SAS like we probably be in pretty good shape but the combination of those has really made it take to the next level I think you know I think you have to really look at the complexity of those changes right now I think that the fact that there is a public cloud in a private cloud and that you have a device that has certain characteristics and then you have your server it leads to the heterogeneity that we're talking about before and so I really obsess over companies that can come in like VMware certainly trying to do as well but they really try and come in and make something where a single way of thinking about security applies wherever stuff is running yeah I think it's just too complex to have to have different admins different policies different everything and certainly if nothing else it'll keep you from moving faster and leveraging the the full cloud models yeah given that Security's has been an issue for her forever it seems like that's something that just doesn't change is that due to the fact that we haven't actually done anything about it the right way or do you think that it's just an inherent situation that is not going away because the problem is humans and the problem is always humans it's everything it's a people problem but in this case is security is it just gonna be something that we have to manage rather than solve I I personally think that I'm pretty optimistic we can do so so much better than we have I think it's always been we are coming off a pretty low bar so I thrive under low expectation it's really good but on a serious note I think a lot of the way that people have looked at security has always been the cat and mouse game yeah where it's I'm trying to stay ahead of the other guy and on zero days or whether it's I mean now we're getting malware infected through ad networks that show up on your favorite websites and through emails like the sophistication of spam attacks or phishing attacks are just ridiculous now yeah I mean it looks so realistic so I'm I'm just a big advocate of let's totally think a different way about how we do security and one thing I talk about often I'm really obsessed with is the notion of okay we're always gonna try and stop the bad stuff from hitting but now we actually have to stop it from doing damage once it's in yeah and that's where whether it's the segmentation that goes on the network or whether it's I have companies that are really focused on doing it in web browsers the notion that you really have to sandbox and keep things in the place is something I think is gonna be a big step forward even like a database level right now whenever you hear I broke into anthem health and stole like six million records yeah like maybe we have row by row encryption or maybe we have ways that again try your best not to have them happen but when they do let's just stop the damage from being as big as it is so like a model like that I think will be a a really important part of the security posture going forward which just people haven't put enough effort in hmm okay Steve we've talked to you last few years about developers this year I know they've got a hackathon but yeah I don't see as many hoodies I there's no longer a developer track even pivitol made an announcement this morning I'm like come on they didn't bring James waters out yeah Rob mieze like all dressed up looking proper with shoes loose shirt and you know the blazer and everything so where are the developers for the community here why I dunno like when we were first starting to introduce a developer track the day we announced the spring acquisition for those those that were around for that there is complete stares and just like this audience is a great great audience mostly focused on infrastructure and and thus you know it really wasn't a good fit there so I think part of it is just knowing your audience knowing that the goal of this particular conference is to make IT enabled development of apps in a new way so I think it's very smart that it's changed the focus quite a bit but I do think you know when you when you have this type of solution you're trying to solve all the problems in the hypervisor layer or in the management tools layers that you have I think as you go and think like take the security model a little bit further some interesting announcements and good things going on here but I'm kind of obsessed also with how do we make developers do a better job of having the applications be protected in the first place and so there's a lot of research and interesting startups that are around self protecting software yeah and it's like really putting at an even higher level in this stack and that's not something that you would do at an infrastructure layer it's something you would actually do it at a developer conference or developer focus so I think you got to just be careful that you know your audience you're you're certainly talking about the right solutions but you're aware of the different approaches to doing this and actually for things like DevOps you really need to really immerse yourself without people are developing and shipping their software to get the solutions in place yeah it does feel like VMware is stopped apologizing for existing so you know sort of bringing developers and saying oh yeah we have a developer track it's sort of like oh wait no no we're cool we really we're cool and then whereas letting that go feels more like no no we know who we are and this is our audience we will be the best us we can be rather than trying to be someone else I think the the buzz I've gotten just from walking around as you all said as well like this has been a very positive VMworld and and again it's not only not being apologetic but it's also like real announcements and real partnerships that are shipping obviously the Amazon and Google being big ones but just across the board there's a lot of positive if you even look at like the top tracks that are going on it's VMware on AWS so there's like real progress and I think there's real interest in that side of things yeah that makes you not have to focus on you know some of the developers stuff that might have been focused on well certainly they're doing well on things like NSX and Visa and which just seem to be selling like hotcakes so yeah that helps and customers like interesting yeah yeah Steve speaking of the public clouds I mean we felt this year we're finally starting to see some of these things come together for a few years we were almost like oh you know messaging was like they don't exist or they're booksellers or you know they win we all lose and everything I was at the AWS summit in New York City a couple of weeks ago and there's a couple of sessions done by VMware Amazon's in the booth Andy Jesse gets a big applause here last year I've been at reinvent for a number of years a big AWS show I know you've been there for you're starting to see some of the people that you know were early in this community playing there how do you see those worlds colliding the you know the the the landscape the competition the coopertition you know what what interest you there these days I think it's pretty clear and people have been talking about this for a while but it's more clear to me than ever that you know there is there's always a swing back and forth of decentralized centralized I think I think what we're really trying to find out is what did the boundary is going to be between applications that live in the public cloud and applications that stay on premises and it's usually tracking some level of certification some level of data movement all the things that you all have talked about before but I think you know whether it's 50% is in the public cloud or 80 percent or 20 percent I think that's where these lines are being drawn now and it's very obvious that customers who want some of the benefits of the public cloud are going to be using more and VMware needs to be the guider to help them get there and likewise Amazon and Google they'd love to have more of the on-premises workloads and and have a way to really speak to those more valuable in many cases applications that makes perfect sense and this is like this I think this battle that'll be going on forever and I I don't want to forget this either what I think is also fascinating is we also have these you know people talk about edge computing but whatever it is there's powerful devices network connected even further from the data center so I think we're gonna have in the end we're gonna have like these edge device things you're gonna have your own data center and then you're gonna have a plethora of public clouds and SAS offerings and I think again just getting back to the master theme how do you tame and let people effectively use these different layers and protect them that's gonna be where I think a lot of interesting companies are born yeah now that's a great point because sometimes the people conflate some of these things because for me it was the public cloud kind of pulled from the data center and now you've got the edge kind of pulling you know that that relation for the public cloud and that intrested dynamic and you know where customer lives what's you know what's the role of IT in the future what's the role of the the CIO is that there's some of the things did you look at those pieces I tried to you know I actually tried to create this I tried to make this nerdy formula I'm like the number one question for a variety has traditionally been like where should I run stuff to be most cost effective most responsive from a time standpoint to my customers that I can secure it based on the type of data that I can pass certain certifications so in many ways when we got start with VMware it was all about let's take inventory of all my applications and bucket them and choose which bucket could be virtualized which had to stay native now their bucket izing them and saying which ones could run in a public cloud which ones need to be rewritten and I think at the end of the day an IT a good IT team will know the business value and the like the goal of these applications and then help provide the easiest way to run them in the right place for what they're trying to do you know again whether it's whether it's these end devices or whether it's that their own data centers or elsewhere I think the idea that they're a broker of services some of which they provide themselves and some of which they outsource I think that's the modern IT role yeah that's quite a substantial change from what IT has traditionally done and there has been talking to customers and and service providers and vendors there there has been a shift in ability I think but it feels like it's still only just getting started rather than it being you know it's well advanced is that what you're seeing as well and I do it's a it's a real shift like you're saying I think it's we used to say it's like moving from the Builder of services to the broker of services so I do think that's a good analogy where it used to be if I don't build it myself I can't offer support for it I can't do call controls I can't offer it up quickly yeah and so now I think they're just realized you know their job is to get you the best thing for what you need to do yeah and again some percentage that time it is by building it themselves yeah okay all right Steve I'll give you the final word with a wild card you know you know VR AR AI ml blockchain aetherium you know what's exciting you these days what things you're looking at John freer is gonna run up here and tell you about the ICOC I think but you know what what is you know you're you're about the valley what what's real what's interesting especially from your time I have an awesome job like like you I get to meet interesting people all day long and and all of them have interesting ideas where their world is going all of them are optimists they think they're gonna be the one to deliver it so I love that part of it but cutting through what's real and what's hype versus not as really the core job I guess for you as well I would just say as with the traditional Gartner cycle things get so overblown and then reality settles in and then they go forward I probably get five pitches a week on this is machine learning for blah and if you even know a little bit about AI in ml you realize no you're using stats like it's just being used so we used to do that with the cloud right cloud washing it was called at the time yeah so anyway I do think there's a lot of really substantive things going on I love the blockchain work I think it's also been a little overinflated but the idea that you can do distributed brokering and keep consistency is going to play out in all sorts of areas maybe John's ico will be a sign of the core piece there but I'm a big fan of what's going on with the combination of proper machine learning that's accessible by mere humans and that has cloud resources to back it and I think it's those two things you have to have both of them to to really just start attacking a lot of problems and we look at certainly I look at the ones as they apply to security and to things like that but they apply across everything from medical to almost every other part of our life so I see a lot of those right now and I think it's going to be a pretty big change as we head forward awesome well Steve Herod always put pleasure to have it have you on the program thanks so much for joining us for Justin Warren I'm Stu minimun the cube will be back with lots more coverage from VMworld 2017 thanks for watching the cube [Music]
