 Next year, or in 2019, the Chinese will have a quantum computer that is a million times faster than all the computing power in the world today. And they have created a quantum communication system from Beijing to Shanghai that is unhackable. And it is a new form of internet. And whoever owns quantum communications and computing will literally own the world. And the Russians are working on this as well, aren't they? The Russians are working on it as well. And the United States surely is, but not as concentrated as China is. So all I'm saying is that there can be technological obsolescence as well. Because if you-- one of the big problems with the internet is that anything and everything can be and is hacked. There's absolutely no privacy. And data is available for anybody who wants it. We've been writing about this for 17 years, urging people to buy the internet security stocks, knowing full-well that they admit they can't stop it, they can only mitigate it once it's happened. So the idea that you create a new unhackable internet is also one possibility. But quantum computing does another thing, which is almost destroy Bitcoin because cryptography is almost worthless at that point. That's right. That's right. And it would destroy the way many things are done. So it's the ultimate disruption.
