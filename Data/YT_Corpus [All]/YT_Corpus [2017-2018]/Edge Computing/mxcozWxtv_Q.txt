 Dan: If you can make the edge of your network as agile as cloud, if you can basically give the same experience to your users, the application owners, that they get from cloud, and give them a place to actually do the interconnect securely, you actually get to win. You make this no longer a fight between agility-security, you can actually get both. It sounds like that's the right answer. Michael: That's exactly right. For the the edge services you need infrastructure and you need technology that facilitates self-service, that facilitates agility to the point that if it's easier for your teams to do it the right way on that infrastructure then that's the way they will do it. They always take the easiest option. If they can also apply their security policies because they are the app owners, they know what policy should be around those edge virtual machines, but if you can do it in infrastructure that facilitates the security folks to be able to audit and review the network folks to be able to audit and review and the infrastructure folks to be able to actually run the platform that is used by all the other app teams, then I think you end up with a win-win. All organizations are very, very happy, plus you get significant increase of security posture and an ability to do audit and compliance and reporting that today a hybrid enterprise just is unable to do.
