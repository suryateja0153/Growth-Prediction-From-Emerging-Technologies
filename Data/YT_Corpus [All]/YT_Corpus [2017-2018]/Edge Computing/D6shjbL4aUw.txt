 quantum engineering is trying to exploit quantum mechanics a hundred-year-old physics theory in order to develop new technologies such as computers sensors materials to take advantage of the subtle properties of quantum systems there's a variety of different techniques we use we use magnetic fields we use electrical fields we basically use any field or any property of nature that we can to probe these systems one of the most popular is lasers or light fields as this is a very non-invasive way of interrogating various quantum devices well LIGO is an example of the levels of precision one can obtain if you push towards the quantum limits of a measurement people that were interested in performing gravitational wave detection were way ahead of their time and thinking about how quantum mechanics limits one's ability to measure things so one big takeaway is that the continued push on the technology and the engineering in many ways mimics the sort of work that needs to be done to develop other quantum systems like quantum computing the Kavli Nanoscience Institute is a very important vehicle and facility for developing new types of devices because the devices in the fabrication techniques that the Kavli Nanoscience Institute has allows us to develop devices down at this submicron even sometimes sub nanometer scale and that's the scale that's required to control quantum system and to develop new types of climb devices well it's very early days and it's not certain exactly how quantum technologies might impact a society but there are several areas which we believe there's great opportunity one is an area of computing quantum computers are potentially exponentially more powerful than classical computers there's new materials so you get emergent phenomena from quantum systems that might have radically new properties that we could exploit there's also the way we sense the world around us and quantum mechanics has different rules about how we sense the world around us and there's also communication when we communicate information quantum mechanics says there's different rules for how that happens versus classical communication and so there's opportunities for new types of communication schemes and techniques as well in many ways were probably limited in our imagination and how this is going to change our lives. I think it's a very very tough problem but a very important one so that's the key there's lots of good solutions but it's when you find these important problems to work on and I think this is one of them I think Caltech is in an unique position to really be at the cutting edge to really have an impact it's what drives me every day the gold systems behind me is what's called the dilution refrigerator this allows us to cool samples down to ten milli-Kelvin or so so a few thousandths of a Kelvin above absolute zero and at those temperatures you remove all the environmental most of the environmental noise that might perturb the quantum system you want to study so in this case we're studying electrical circuits superconducting circuits and the goal is to build the components that might make up a future quantum computer you
