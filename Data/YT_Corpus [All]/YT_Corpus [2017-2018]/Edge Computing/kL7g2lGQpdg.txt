 we're in the cloud event but behind the cloud that is the data center somewhere sometimes nobody knows where but for sure there is a data center somewhere because all the applications include all the databases should be stored somewhere and where can we store the databases on the servers or storage equipment those storage equipments to should stay somewhere in a data center and I will speak now about data centers because in the data centers are happening all the important things for running your application let's see how it's working ok not too long time ago a lot of people try understood that all the computing processes will be centralized in big or very very big extra large data centers but a lot of problems appear due to the latency due to the long distance from the customer to the place where the servers are running sometimes the customers won't be able to run their application and immediately after that they discovered that the long distance is coming with with some some problems even some years ago when Facebook opened the the first data center in Europe in Sweden also google opened two data centers one in Finland one in near amsterdam a lot of people started to think that all the big data centers will go in the north part of Europe due to the very good climate conditioned for the running a data center the cooling for the data center is a big challenge and it's very easy to call a data center in Nordic countries but also also in this in those cases they discover that is not so appropriate to run all the applications and to have that those applications only in big data centers and now when we start to talk about Internet of Things IOT and when the car manufacturers start to think to connect the cars to the internet and to send the all the technical parameters from the car to the data centers even more they start to think about latency and bandwidth and speed of transmitting the data not only the car but when we talk about medical facilities when there is a surgery in operation they need to have a lot of information a lot of images already stored somewhere but they need to have it very very fast and sometimes if those images are in the big data centers somewhere a very long distance is not available those images are not available in the right time so big problems latency limited bandwidth and sometimes local regulations because for some type of data it is not allowed by the regulation by the government to have the data store in other country and this could have this could be a big problem for for example as I know in the last year's last year's Russian government started to think to read collect all the data in their data center in the last five years because the encryption of the data is forbidden in Russia a lot of company goes to baltic countries they opened huge data centers there for story for storing them in their data outside of Russia encrypted but now the government start to elaborate some regulation which which made mandatory for the Russian company to store their data inside Russia will be some changes there will be a lot of data centers in bulking countries available for other applications because all the Russian companies should move their application and data inside Russia if we talk about regulation and I am sure that every government will start to think about some very sensitive or very sensible data to be stored inside the country how much data we store if we talk about flights every flight create 500 gigabytes of data because all the engines are transmitting the data through the internet in the data center owned by the producer by the manufacturer of the engines maybe you remember that years ago one malaysian air aircraft disappeared and after some days somebody announced that that plane flight form or seven hours after they disconnected all the communication devices on board how they know because the engines were running for seven hours more and in the rolls-royce data center there are data collected from the engines they didn't they don't know anything about the place where the plane was on that time but they collected the data from the engines so the engines were running perfectly without any problem seven hours after they disconnect the communication devices on board what we can do with Internet of Things there are shoes running shoes and there are some type of running shoes which collect data about speed weight of the people how many calories consumed and things like this and those that are sent it to the data centers and store and the people after running can see how many calories they burn and things like this but this is if 1 million people start running in the same time around the world they will overload the networks even if we think about music when a very good very well-known singer release a new song a lot of people want to see they will overload the network to youtube or to the place where the song is store what is how we can improve that this situation very easy to install to install some small data centers at the edge of the network very near to the customers very near to the people small premises with some servers maybe 10 servers 20 servers in a small or micro data center how we call this this type of solution this will improve very very much the latency and also the accessibility from the customer to their databases or applications recently some companies from this industry from cloud computing from the internet of things start to move from big data centers to they they keep also they keep huge extra large data center but they started to install small solution near to the customer and we have some examples here this type of solution could be could be assimilated to the one company flying company and they have a hub somewhere and they have all the time flights to different to different zones so Microsoft it was the presentation before me but they have huge data centers and more than that they have more than 100 globally distributed computer notes they call these cloudlets so small solutions with some servers running there and they run these cloudlets for improving the condition for their customer also Google use for data center extra extra large but they have also 70 edge point of presence in 33 countries just for improving the communication just for improving the speed of the data transfers I have here a case study internal they had some some issues with these things I already told you they started to think to have small solutions installed near their customer and our solution for this request from internap was to supply them switchgear power cooling racks management software and services in small solutions not in big data center they already had big data centers another situation is that dark points in dallas texas they started to think how to use this small solution in their big data center for colocation and we prepared and convert it off his building in the colocation space and we offered them a certified Micro data center solution they had some benefits on cider price + data colocation and they used neutral telecom and cloud what we can do in the last year's we launched this this type of solutions those solutions could be installed in modular approach but installed on site and our solution is our classical infrastructure solution or we can deliver something like this type of containers there are 10 containers link between them we have 102 rocks inside and we deliver an entire data center with 100 drugs in three months on-site we only need to link those containers connects to the communication to the power supply and we can run a data center very very high very very quickly after the delivery of the solution what is included in our solution called infrastructure we have UPS's electrical distribution and UPS uninterruptible power supplies we have cooling solution rocks security equipment we have security appliance is dedicated to IT environment not for home not for offices we have special design security solutions for data centers and ID rules we have also software because the software is the future because sometimes in the future we will not sell products itself we will sell services and software and products products will support that services and software and also we include in this solution services all type of services we call data center long life services we can deliver different services in different stages we can sell as a service plan a data center how to optimize how how to build a data center after is built how to administrate the data center we have another type of solution very small one rock wall rock which could be installed in the office environment you see in the middle there is a rock with sound proofing with ventilation and is looking exactly like furniture we can put this type of rock in the office and inside we can have servers which is routers one-ups and nobody will know that in that closet it's a a small data center in fact another solution is smart bunker we use this mark bunker in a very harsh environment we can have inside one rock one cooling unit detection and extinguish system for fire security equipments and all the things needed to to run a small data center another solution is to to deliver containers and we have been involved in the last year in a very wide variety of application we delivered a lot of containers and smart bunkers around the world in different application for remote branch for remote office locations for server rooms were in industrial sites one of our solution is in formula one we have a very very old collaboration with Ferrari we built for them the first their data center some years ago we built the second data center a new one with the latest technology and we deliver them the solution for the races because as you can see where every lap they collect 30 megabytes of data from 200 250 sensors installed on the car the car is communicating permanently with the servers and store their data you can see it's a simple solution by but they used to transport this solution on each race they have in their paddock in their premise locally they have the solution install and they collect all the data and they analyze after the race or during the race they analyze of the data collected another solution is in transportation in TransCanada what we have installed there is a rock with some operating systems with storage with communication and this solution is used also for mining and oil and gas companies some other industry analysts agree that in the future they will need to have small data centers installed near very near to the customer not in only in huge or extra large data centers here we have a one opinion and we have another opinion from from Microsoft regarding this this small data centers used to be installed near the customers okay next because the last presentation was about as or maybe in some cases you use this cloud platform but in some cases some company want to have their in parallel solution for storing storage on premise what if some something is happening and the communication is down totally and we will need to think about this especially for governments for special forces for army and police what if internet is down they don't have any information about people about anything they should have some databases locally the one big problem of man maybe you remember some years ago in Tahiti was a big earthquake after the earthquake not so much people were dying but after some time the police lost the control and a lot of people died in crimes because the police didn't have any control and also the Army has any control after sometimes the United States sent them some communication equipments local to be installed locally our solution for small data centers for micro data centers are as I already showed you smart banker asics is a really rock smart bunker six is that one which is installed in office environment smart banker ethics is used in every type of environment and smart shelter is in fact a container with four to ten rocks inside and could be installed all the things in our factory and deliver to the directly to the site also I want to remember you about our infrastructure modeler infrastructure solution which could be installed in an existing data center in summary regional data centers taking off as the edge and we will see in the future that a lot of big players in this industry will open small or micro data centers near the customers localized data centers are already here today but we don't know we consider that all the applications are running somewhere in extra large data centers which is not true sometimes the big players in this industry already have some small solution installed in near to the customer if you have questions
