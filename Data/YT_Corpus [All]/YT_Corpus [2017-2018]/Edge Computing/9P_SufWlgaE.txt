 [Music] grim loser medicating design and we're on the industrial hygiene roadshow in Austin Texas I'm at silk'n labs and I'm with Daniel Povey who's fsvp biotech products that don't need it thanks for having me today sure we're talking about industrial IOT and specifically some of the connectivity issues that are happening there Daniel I've been talking a little bit about the different types of standards Wireless for private area protocols in questions of that nature that are happening in that space what you see do you see this we're still in using proprietary or moving the standards as abortion images now that it has been it's going well leasing that the the roots of the IOT space in industrial settings of proprietary protocols because these things have been connected for the last 20 years before the rise of bluetooth before the rise of Wi-Fi of ours even LTE so a lot of these customers have proprietary wireless systems but you know that they can't leave an abandoned in the field but they're rapidly and adding in standards-based protocols like LTE Bluetooth SIG P and so on so we're seeing just an increase in the total number to a market right now but proprietor is not going away okay so how is somebody supposed to address that we're you know one foot in proprietary world wanting to move to standards from all of them market safety not I'm going to do a lot of rework so how do you do both at the same time well first these comings are hiring for engineers and their leave other suppliers heavier so some companies have both some don't and so they're really just issuing RFPs for both kinds of applications right now and see what comes back but I think most of the industrial side at this point if they have they have their core strategy built on connectivity they're finding the way to staff and develop this and then in layering in the security needs that go on top of that right now okay so is is different silicon required to make this possible to make the transition from proprietary to standards-based or just make sure including get some insurance to make sure that you're doing you know whatever its best with from some people yes from us no we have one silicon platform they can do proprietary and standards-based wireless protocols and we have the software stacks for our customers to pick that up and get their application into the market not everybody has this strategy we think it's good for us and for our customers and winning market share because of that is if there's orders it's over I think about us both okay I have to think about it as a software game but I think there's a famous poet it's that if you're serious about software you also build your own hardware and so our software engineers are a critical piece of specking down to the transistor level and so we need to bring them in we have to understand what kind of software architecture memory map they're going to need and we spec up all the way down into the chip at this point so it's very unified product development process that it is starting to yield some pretty good results well that's pretty interesting stuff and those of us working in the industrial embedded space because everything is going to connected these days and combining solutions hardware and software to get to market faster imager looking at Greg Lee is going to be top of mind thanks Brandon Lewis being a bully grits I loves our industry [Music]
