 The topic today is going to be at least to me and I am of course partially biased coming from this space but the topic is going to be an interesting one and we'll explore artificial intelligence, this third coming of AI as I refer to it AI 3.0 and what this will do to our world what this would do to established companies and get into some of the reasons of why this is happening and where some of these opportunities might take us to in the future. So with that said let me get straight into it. So with a lot of my presentations I like to start off with this I've been sort of talking about this software is eating the world and AI is eating software now for several years. The original statement came from Marc Andreessen where he said software is eating the world and the AI revolution is doing the software what software did to physical systems in other words more and more software is being built using AI methodologies and we're now getting to a point where artificial intelligence actually can evolve methodologies and can evolve approaches, evolve models itself and this is a very interesting transition so we talked a little bit about this but at the essence of it what does this mean? What this means is that the bulk of the value of processes is shifting to software. The bulk of the value of physical goods is shifting to software and I will give you a couple of tangible practical examples of what I mean by this as we go forward. Of course if you look at what this sort of tech-heavy you know period of innovation of the last ten years in particular has gotten us to, I'm sure many investors of this call would be quite familiar with this chart but basically there are many versions of it ultimately the idea is that just over the last five years there has been a dramatic shift in the top five companies by market gap and now all five of these companies are tech companies but another thing to really take note is that it's not just tech companies, it's actually companies that have probably some of the most major AI investments. In Apple's case, they talked about it less at least over the last few years they've now started talking about it more directly but for all the other companies alphabet Google Microsoft Amazon Facebook these have been very public, very vocal efforts to acquire AI technology and also to demonstrate the capabilities there of. Now there's a couple of other corollaries on this slide that I want to point out for you. If you notice the chart under fuel for dominance it really talks about three of the companies in the top five Facebook Apple and Google / alphabet and if you look at the number of AI focused acquisitions, this is actually the rate is picking up and there are now recently just over the last couple of weeks been several thought pieces written in a variety of different business publications wondering about whether the big dominant players in tech that already have a lead in AI technology and already have a lot of access to data whether in the consumer business at least this gives them an unassailable lead, particularly as young and impressive and promising companies are being acquired, AI companies are being acquired at a fairly healthy clip. So with these two elements of the strategy that we can see here you know clearly there is an intent to own and dominate with AI technology which adds value to a variety of products across the spectrum for these large companies and the last point that I'll make on the slide again many of you might already be familiar with this but when we talk about change and when we talk about these sorts of sort of you know Voytek incantations the world is changing we will change the world etc it's a transformative technology, the reality is that that is reflected in numbers also if you think about the shrinking SMB tenure, yes technology is making some measurable, meaningful, tangible shifts and you just can't be you just sort of can't hang your hat on your pride achievements anymore and this is actually something that I feel you know as they said three points make a line so I've shown you the three points so they make a trend rather, if this continues you know I think you start to see that 14 year diminish even further so with AI technology in particular the ability for a company to get very large very quick is going to be accentuated and that means that the dominant incumbent players are not going to be as easily kept in that you know top five bucket or top ten bucket as the years and months go on. Now I told you that I wanted to give you a very practical example of what it means when software is eating the world, well here's what it means in terms of number of parts and in terms of complexity. On the left at least on my left there is a traditional internal combustion gas engine and just take a look at all of the complexity, the gears, the pistons, the valves, the chambers, the spark plugs and you know in the olden days the carburetor but now the efi and the timing belt and this and that okay. On the right hand side you see basically an electric motor which is far less complex. Now where is the rest of the value going? So you have two physical things and on the left you have a huge number of parts and of course you know the people that design this one fuels each one of those parts has a function, it does something. For example the efi or the carburetor controls the rate at which fuel enters the chamber. Now that is a process it's something that needs to be done, the gating of energy into the system is you know a piece of value that this system must have and traditionally that was done with physical metallic mechanical parts. Well today it's done completely in solid state and there's a few lines of software that are the efi or are the carburetor equivalent there's many other parallels that can be made around braking and regenerative battery charging and all of these sorts of things but i don't want to get into all the details just giving you one example and showing you these parts my hope is that this statement becomes real for you. You understand what it means. Software is actually eating the world, it is actually reducing the amount of physical goods that need to be produced to provide the same kind and in many cases better economic output. Now the next part of this is how AI eats software. So I told you about the combustion engine versus the electric motor but now we're looking at the process with which software has been built thus far. Thus far it's been about very smart, very talented people sitting at a console typing out learning a language many languages learning about architecture and then typing out a bunch of lines which reflect algorithms, their inventions, their IP and then all of this is embodied in a program and application that gets deployed and it does something but in artificial intelligence, there are many evolutionary techniques now I don't mean this to be a detailed study of all the evolutionary advancements or the neat algorithm which was actually let me brag about that a little bit it was pioneered right here in in Austin and worked on by the University of Texas at Austin computer science department which I advise but these evolutionary techniques take a step away from the traditional sit down in front of the keyboard to start writing code because once you've built the evolutionary mechanisms and you've defined what fitness means fitness for a purpose in other words go and generate possible specimens that I can evaluate and then tell me how fit or unfit they are and this is a process that can run millions and millions and millions of times on its own evaluated for fitness and and then you can make a determination as to whether what you ended up with was appropriate. With these  virtual creatures that are being tortured by boxes being thrown at them or being made to navigate rough surfaces undulating surfaces are actually evolving the behavior of of navigation and walking and the interesting thing is that that in this work done by ... that the specific mechanics of the creature are not very relevant in other words it doesn't matter if the creature has four or six or nine legs, it doesn't matter if it's an upright creature or something like a spider for example that stays very close to the ground. Ultimately the same algorithm can evolve behaviors for all of these different systems and here you see that these behaviors can be optimized for different circumstances. Here we have a good-looking robot jumping around on the moon and that's the most efficient gait to not escape the moon's gravity but at the same time navigate and cover distances at a fast pace. So again I'm just touching on this to say, I mean at SparkCognition for example we use fusions of deep learning and genetic algorithms to do model development automatically. We can look at sensor data that's coming in from IOT equipment from large pumps, turbines, generators, military equipment and automatically learn models from those without really knowing the physics of the asset. So these techniques of which one example I'm showing you here because it's well shown visually and it makes the point, that these techniques can now augment at the very least and in some areas may replace the explicit instructions and the age-old if they're else phenomena that we've been dealing with. There will always be room for brilliant programmers so please don't take me wrong but a lot of the stuff that takes a lot of programming time can probably be evolved and we are already seeing some some marked improvements in that area. Another little point that I would like to make here is that as we progress beyond deep learning because unfortunately AI has become a very much a market hype driven phenomenon now and you know everyone that goes to Barnes & Noble and picks up two O'Reilly books and three chapters and implements one algorithm cut and paste, now has an AI company which is good because it spreads the message but at the same time it can also become very difficult for people wanting to make real tangible progress in the science of artificial intelligence to then get above the noise and that is a challenge in most fields but you know we take that challenge on and try to do our best but in this area you start to see that the current focus of the hype has been squarely on deep learning, right. Deep learning is all about perception, it's about recognizing things, using it to recognize human vocal patterns and identify words or create a brilliant system for handwriting recognition or picture recognition and so on and so forth and where a lot of applications will start to head to in future will also involve techniques like reinforcement learning where reinforcement learning is not just about recognition and in fact it can work with deep learning but reinforcement learning is about planning the optimal strategy, planning the optimal set of moves of actions and this then brings an AI framework to a word where good AI perception already exists in the form of deep learning and it is now augmented multiplied in capability by techniques that can use that sense of perception to carry out actions in the real world. So instead of just recognizing a picture or recognizing a pattern recognizing that and doing something about it right that's the way that you can start to think about this coming marriage between reinforcement learning style techniques and deep learning. So this diagram, why is AI working out, well you've heard the the top level bullets in blue before like data you know there's more data right, there's more compute well you know people build clouds and it's easy to get access to more compute and algorithms, your deep learning being the biggest one. I just want to point out a couple of additional things so far we've been gathering data from virtual systems IT systems from software but as you know concurrent with the growth of the industrial Internet of Things we are also starting to see data coming in from the real world in massive, massive quantities and because we work very closely with clients like Honeywell and Flowserve, which is the largest manufacturer of pumps in the US and Boeing and others, what we've learned is that the sensor enablement of much of the manufacturing infrastructure has been in place for a while, now the software technologies are catching up and are being able to do something with that data. So that data won't just come from sensors but will also come from the results of physical actuation when you go perform an act what happens after that you can now measure that too so it's not just your ability to optimize a single outcome or a single decision that an AI algorithm is making but rather across a sequence of moves and entire workflow that actuation can have intrinsic learning built into it, so that's a different kind of data. On the compute side yes there is talk about cloud a lot, obviously, there's also now a lot of talk about GPUs and NVIDIA has done some fantastic work, Google has done some fantastic work in building frameworks like tensor flow that can easily use GPUs but at the same time there is also work being done on ASICs application specific ICs, both Microsoft as well as Google have experimented in this area Google with TPUs, the tensor processing units and at Microsoft has a lot of work out of the azure team in fact an old friend was a professor when I was a graduate student at UT Austin, Doug burger is now involved with that initiative at Microsoft but this goes beyond just the ASICs and the CPUs and the GPUs and the cloud we're also talking about where the compute will be deployed so as you think about applications start thinking about smarts at the edge right what can I do with AI decision-making at the edge. There are a lot of systems that are totally cloud based where all the intelligences in the cloud and the data the observation has to be transported across a network from the field into the cloud a decision is made and then that the outcome of that decision is transported back to the edge but what types of applications can you enable when you bring more AI to the edge. This is an area where we work with Hewlett Packard for example they have a set of edge products they're trying to gather IOT data and do work in that realm. On algorithms, yes deep learning I just told you about reinforcement learning at a high level and also an area that we've pioneered that we've invested a lot in at SparkCognition which is automated model building, the idea that you replicate meta algorithms that essentially embody the processes that go on in the mind of a data scientist right so today you solve problems by being a domain expert in the problem, getting a bunch of data about that problem, understanding what variables should go into a model and what should be excluded then you go and you find a machine learning expert that says okay you're trying to classify this data and therefore here are all the algorithms that you could use you could use an SVM you could use a neural network you could use maybe decision trees and we find the best algorithm, we apply the data and we have a model. Now the challenge with this is that the idea of learning in this context is limited to the set up that was established at the very beginning of the model design in other words, if you had 10 inputs or 10 features going into this model then those are the features going into the model and if later on you find additional data the model doesn't adapt. If tomorrow you find that the data is best modeled with a completely different algorithm, you want to move from SVM's to neural networks some human being has to come in and do that. So this makes widespread scale deployments of AI problematic and one of the reasons why we've seen rapid adoption of our technology is that with automated model building we've done a lot of the automation that was earlier dependent on individuals or data scientists to go do and we've demonstrated this actually works pretty well across domains. Now, is this for real? I mean as an investor wanting to put money into companies and and having the patience to see how these, go is this a trend that's real and and I will tell you that as an AI researcher, somebody that's been absolutely passionate about AI since a very very young age and has actively been researching in this in this area for a while and also in an entrepreneur which is frankly all I've done, based on those two inputs I can personally tell you that I think absolutely the time for artificial intelligence mass deployments, truly disruptive deployments across a broad range of industries is here. It's not about when we will achieve artificial general intelligence and when you know we'll have commander data come to life, it's more about whether AI is good enough in certain categories to reduce the amount of human labor and human input that is necessary to fuel those areas of pursuit or those professions so what you see in front of you is the the results of a study when will AI exceed human performance and I have selected for you three graphs from the study and essentially this is a probability measurement based on interviews with a large number of experts which basically says that this is going to be the century of very very capable AI, okay and the graph on the left shows that for example there's a higher than 75 percent probability that artificial general level intelligence will come about within a century. Now if you think about do you need artificial general intelligence to disrupt the economy, to upend industries to take down dominant players in a market, no you don't. You need capabilities that might be artificial special intelligence that are so disruptive that can completely destroy the economic advantages and the market positioning advantages of other players and on the right-hand side you see a variety of different areas and estimates that show by when those types of capabilities are expected to materialize. Some of these might be a little optimistic, some of these might be a little pessimistic in some areas now we have started to see the traditional trend of optimistic AI projections being reversed in some areas progress is happening faster than experts expected, particularly in vision, this has been the case. So just a very quick survey you know we're obviously focused on the three verticals that we focus on at SparkCognition, our industrials which includes energy then also national security in the military defense in general and then finance so across the board let me talk to you about if the innovations that we're seeing these are practical things that pretty much exists today that are leveraging AI. So the first one in the area of cognitive robotics, so full disclosure I'm on the board of this company makerarm, it's an austin-based robotics company and they build this robot arm that can have up to 18 different implements or 18 different interchangeable heads and this thing is a factory or a desktop. It has very sophisticated software that allows it to detect and use all 18 of these tools and they also have a tool development kit which means that you can keep developing more tools but this can revolutionize how we think of rapid prototyping, how we think of physical production, how we think of setting up factories because this is not just about 3D printing. The software and the AI routing and the measurement of objects and the vision and all of these AI capabilities in this robot and frankly also the collaboration capabilities in fact in that lower left-hand square, you'll see that there are two robots collaborating on a process one pick something up the other hands into it the third one can drill a hole the fourth one can actually place electronics. So this is again a general-purpose factory bot all powered by multiple AI algorithms and the company is now investing a lot of time and energy in innovating in areas such as learning by example, where you don't just program the robot explicitly but you show it a collection of tasks and through vision it recognizes what those tasks are and can replicate those tasks. So training becomes easier in that context, this is just one example of what's going on. The fusion of artificial intelligence and augmented reality, this is again a SparkCognition product but what this shows you is a factory floor that's being looked upon through a hololens which is running an application that we have developed. So SparkPredict and DeepArmor which is our cybersecurity product it can I first of all identify assets and indicate for you the health status of any one of these assets. You see these red flags indicating problems, so as the engineer sits down and starts to look at why this pump actually has a problem he can actually simply ask a question in natural language, our DeepNLP API but this is not the only one out there, there are many others Watson for example does natural language processing, you can ask questions and you get exact answers on what to do, within an AR context, now if that is a problem in other words you don't understand what to do or there's not sufficient information this application integrates within the headset the ability to find other people who have successfully solved this problem before and by the way all of that is being tracked, tagged, categorized, clustered again with AI algorithms and now you connect it to an expert where you can have a dialogue also through natural language understanding and text to speech, speech text and and that comes back to you and then you can solve the problem. The interesting thing is that this entire interaction happened within the context of the company's AI, AR system, so all the words that were spoken, all the images that were seen, all the solutions that were rendered was captured in the cognitive corpus and can now be available for future problem solving. Imagine this on a naval ship, imagine this on the you know with the electrical grid, imagine this in aviation and by the way that's exactly what we're doing so Honeywell is using technology like this for example on iPads not yet on the hololens to solve problems of exactly this type and to cut down on turnaround times for example aircraft, commercial aircraft. This is an example of artificial intelligence being employed for security so on the left hand side you see a traditional signature based security product and there is a database, a Google maintained database, of the latest threats that is updated very frequently and has a large community that contributes any found threats to that database. So you can go and get a third-party set of malware and then compare how your traditional antivirus performs against those threats versus how an AI powered solution would perform. On the right you see the SparkCognition DeepArmor product which has caught 50 threats and on the left-hand side you see a traditional signature based product which on that same set has found six threats and usually what we do is you know on any given day, the threats change and for a demo on the day we'll go and we'll get the latest threats and we will show this but the last three or four major zero day attacks including Wannacry have been detected by the system. Now the question is why, why is AI working in security? AI is working in security because we have now successfully been able to replicate many of the thought processes that a human security researcher brings to the discovery of whether something new is malignant or whether it's benign and this is done along with many other ways through a process that's called static analysis and DeepArmor is actually an AI based static analysis system, so it can go look into the you know so-called DNA of the code and find structures and identify the causes that make it believe that this object would probably be doing bad things as opposed to just simply waiting and looking for a signature so this is again one example there are other companies applying you know similar solutions with slightly different approaches but the point here is not about a product, the point here is about AI disrupting security and that is already begun to happen. In concert I will tell you what we do. So we have four products in the market, SparkPredict, which takes sensor data from large industrial and energy companies companies like Honeywell, Flowserve, Dover, Boeing and many many others and automatically builds models and identifies when machines will fail, dramatically improve the efficiency and the maintenance costs. DeepArmor, which is a cognitive cyber physical defense product which can be embedded in the IOT, which can be embedded in the military IOT as well and is essentially a static analysis specialist in the guard of an AI algorithm. SparkSecure is also a security product that gets into log analysis rather than looking at files, it looks for firewall logs, it looks for wan optimizer logs, gateway logs and identifies trends and patterns that the traditional security infrastructure such as such as firewalls have missed and we found at many customers that this happens to be the case. DeepNLP, finally, which is our natural language processing capability it's available as an API, we are using this today in production with a large number of big customers including Nextera, including Honeywell, we're in deployment with Flowserve also on this and these capabilities are far beyond what you would find in stock toolkits in the sense that they deliver understanding of for example tabular structures, they deliver understanding of personally identified information going beyond simple search terms or regular expressions and there's a broad range of capabilities including cognitive document recovery, deep question-and-answer that DeepNLP can support and provide.
