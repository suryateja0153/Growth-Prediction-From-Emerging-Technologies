 just as a way of an outline we went through the introductions I'll give a overview slide presentation of focusing mostly on 5g communication and then dr. Whirley will give his presentation on evolution of wireless communications and IT connectivity industrial trends of IOT is presentation title for dr. King and after that owner will give that of Philips visible light communication presentation that he has prepared for you each one of these should be 10 to 15 minutes long leaving plenty of room at the end point of time to have a discussion and Q&A session so you can pose all the questions you may have to the parents I'll start with this quick overview we're clearly at the bleeding edge of communication technology these days we are just barely putting the finishing touches on the last versions of some of these technologies we've got LTE advanced 4G and we got Bluetooth Low Energy able to that 11 AD and 60 gigahertz and H in sup gigahertz strange these are barely known even in the community NSC it's been around of course a little bit and so many more and before you know it talking about going into 5g and Bluetooth five a to the other than ax and ay Y and Wi-Fi and so there's there's this great momentum going forward and reminds me of the old days when we were trying to go try and find them Vince he bolted to go to 3G even from 2g communication and it was asking why do we need to do that or from 3G to 4G a 3G is already got enough capacity why do we need 4G and it wasn't until the applications that necessitated you know the kind of data throughput that we now are are so used to came about that vision for for those jumps in technologies actually present itself and the momentum start and now we're at the point where we we see their vision for the next decade emerging in terms of Internet of Things and having trillions of devices in connected and they all want to talk to each other and it's all data driven and of course we need we need even further and capacity and throughput and latency improvements and power consumption improvements that can't possibly be handled and supported by the current technologies we have in place and that's the impetus for going to these next generations so I'm going to focus on 5g here of course among all those and this slide basically is trying to differentiate five year or at least summarize how 5g is different from the previous generations in various aspects from the services perspective we had two G only focusing on voice and later on short short message services and 3G we still were worried about voice because we didn't have enough capacity to cover these demands we also had a non narrowband data for G focused most mostly on the mobile broadband data communication 5g though we honestly are doing more mobile broadband called enhanced mobile broadband we're also thinking of a massive machine type communication ultra low reliability and low latency is key and power consumption as to be high I'm everybody's agenda as well from a channel perspective we were very narrow email all days from 200 kilohertz during the GSM era to the well to 5 gigahertz 5 megahertz in 5 T 20 megahertz and 4G and we're talking about one gig and find spectrum also has widened the spectrum of usage has grown from just less than two gigahertz to all the way through 100 gigahertz over the last taking ready access technologies we only is to have one weather with GSM or GPRS or some of you remember is 136 even and I'm thinking myself and then pretty he was still similar just one one rat at a time and in the 4g still it came coalesced around the LTE and 3G PP standard but in 5g we're talking about multiple runs at the same time some new radios as well as you know a thorough of types of services and features access type used to be predominantly sort of it switched for voice a little bit of data packet that has switched over data through GPRS back then but it has evolved to mostly packets wish and all IP in 4G and now we're talking about even improving on that with ICM network topology mostly macro cells initially but over the course of the last decade we've been adding micro cells and small cells and now we're talking about mobile edge computing even and network slicing things like that so hopefully it gives you a glimpse of what what 5g it's going to bring in compared to all the other past generations so IG design is the approach ways of course you can do it the way we've been doing it so far it is evolutionary I'd spend whatever we have right now which is Ltd lte-advanced I know you just relentlessly add on to it with full backward compatibility it has a 10 benefits from that perspective obviously but because of that legacy you're limited to what you can do or how much you can add or you could just abandon everything and make it revolutionary and bring any brand new bearing faces and networks and do the best you can with the technology we have yet those backwards compatibility which is not good for business the 3gpp should be 3 DD 3 GPP approach is a combination of these two initially is to be more evolutionary and lte-advanced pro or you want to call it four and a half to three 5g going around but they're all referring to the fact that we're just adding on to what we have to get backwards compatible and I hope that you're gaining more from what you had maxing the last generation but it also lays the groundwork for for a revolutionary set of features for the long term and those would mean that you have a new network topology and a new radio set of Legos that you can add to the system and need transport channels and so forth so when we say 5g it's a it's a very vague terminology in it and it could mean anything from the 3G or four and a half G all the way to what in the next decade will take over all that and replace all of that in the future so what are the five G applications probably have seen a lot of these diagrams and has mobile broadband is a terminology from around a lot changed you basically I mean a much higher data rate internet access with the reality and cloud storage and massive IOT or massive machine communication sensor networks smart homes remote health monitoring logistics tracking and applications you know I'm sure will grow exponentially from here ultra reliable and low latency communications is another aspect of major aspect of the 5g applications where you want to be able to support industrial automation driverless cars remote surgery smart grids which really depend on ultra reliable and ultra fast response in terms of linkage in 5g you can imagine that it will not be limited to one type of network for a number of reasons one is as I said before we have backwards compatibility that we want to keep but at the same time we want to have the freedom to explode into the future without the strings attached to the past so the network topology is going to be allowing you to have multi-layer networking and each layer can be actually isolated from the others or or not even be there depending on the applications and deployments and that's also good from a security perspective if you can limit the exposure to one layer and not the others so you may have new radios and old radios and even non non 3gpp type of radios all part of the neck or rolling one of the key things that is always thought about and talked about as we are exploring the next generation of communication and networking is security it's all in the past was it used to be a side issue or an afterthought now its front and center for obvious reasons and there are many types or aspects of security that are are being considered someone some of them are new enum authentication authorization and accounting these are very understandable in been around but availability is a new one that has been added confidentiality is obviously been there but privacy control of the data that you can see what from your private data is another area integrity has been around but non repeated repudiation is another one that's been added so you can here here you can expect to be tracing and monitoring them where do they does then who's seen it so there's no denial of having received the data and so forth so 5g security considerations infrastructure security so you want to make sure that the network trust models are asking to distribute an infrastructure and multi-state stakeholder and mark networks are going to not necessarily be owned by one entity so that's that's part of the model and has to be services security so variable service level a pharmacist is needed and resilience is a key factor there so enablers for for such an architecture would be as I mentioned for the network layers or slices new radios that we have the over all right we have thought of so far and potentially it will be adding to in the future quality of service alliance and the services that we offer and opportunity for third party network infrastructure providers to offer services so those are the American neighbors of such thing one of the things that doesn't get talked a lot about at least not in such settings and I thought it would be interesting to bring this up on the admissions here is the value and the importance of intellectual property in all of this I'm sure everybody's aware and then familiar with patents and owning rights to those and things like that but how much does it actually matter in development of new technologies it's usually an astronaut before for researchers but companies who deal with those are business are very much aware that and we all have heard of the patent Wars gone on in 4G and if you thought that was ugly wait till tidied up time so I thought it would be interesting to to go through this exercise for 4G if you had a smart and a generic smartphone of the one I'm showing a bit of generic smartphone let's say at $400 retail price the modem the baseband processor that takes care of the cellular communication there is about 10 to 13 dollars to cost for you to including direct device the royalties you have to pay for all the and ideas and patents that are included in there and people have rights to is costing roughly $60 so you could go and build a lot of money imagine how how much work and effort and money goes into building a chip like that and yet it's 1/6 of the value of the other ideas that people are claiming rights to you go to 5g same phone we'll probably have about $120 worth of royalties you have to pay for before you can actually sell that from and all the other components in there are about the same cost so the royalties on the patents are as much as expensive and as they as the whole form you have to develop taking managing that companies are paying a lot of attention to the them they want to be having their business not just focused on how to build it but also have the rights to intellectual property and that's why you see a lot of debates in standards everybody wants to contribute to the standards where these things get settled into the standard essential Pappy's and so by a quick look at the top ten 3gpp contributors for 5g you can see that you know the main players of the industry are very much aware of the intellectual property value embedded into all these devices and anything that will be inside you as well whether it's device or service it's all saying I notice while way is the top player in terms of contributions and extending that to to meaning by by patents as well and notice of the top ten six of them the red ones on from Asia probably interesting so accepting that idea a little bit further I call that ultimate abstraction commoditization is the name of the game in my view so you've had chips in ICS and processors getting commoditized by hardware systems a good example that is IBM doing that back in the day where you know being a chip design architecture and developing company was no longer a hot thing but how you put the whole system together then that got commoditized by the software so now you have all the hardware but it's all the applications in the software and OS and all that goes in there software got a lot dies by the services so okay you have software you have hard work but it's really the applications and the services that I have put on it that makes the most value for it for DES for this important business so if you go if you extend that then come on ization to the idea level is the ultimate goal here and services get commoditized by ideas and patents to some extent I'm obviously simplifying the whole thing a little bit but just it's to give the impression where things are going and why there is such a tremendous effort on the part of the player to be players if they spend and most players in defy G as well as the other industries to have the patents then don't I can to protect them and even purchase them to make sure that they're supported well and a lot of the players actually go vertical they basically integrate vertically and Apple is an example of that they have their hands into all of these components but they haven't lost track on the most important one which is the idea the part at the top I'd leave you with a couple of very interesting uh and if notes nobody--this ins the inventor of the light bulb all he actually bought the rights to the first light bulb patent from Henry would work back to 150 years ago and a lot of you may know hedy lamarr co-inventor of the frequency hopping spread spectrum she was a darling of the hollywood as well and she sold that to the lapse of 75 years ago we're bad I will leave that the session or a presentation to doctor going to be
