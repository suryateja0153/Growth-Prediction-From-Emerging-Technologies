 about the future but keep in mind that the future is a path what are living right now and this is a word able to understand we already have some signals to looking for the future so focusing on to what we what we had what was the past because for us is the past now completely is the past version secondly Mussina was started experience of cloud thousand seven the first European approach that the mode from green to the cloud was named in the reservoir to the successful project and then the project officer but it's carrying a Greek goddess she said oh I feed that Amazon is trying to copy this kind of project because we started soon and so that people are going in the phone we're moving in for computing in the pad on the star but what is happing there again the corner is a massive LMS committee the idea was multiple trying to bring all together also an entirely new data and then we go in looking for this happening with tendency of obstruction of stuff nobody without micro services and ideas to leverage them in some way though this kind of move application essentially that allowed to be right bored easily and in the hanukkah wedding this was not looking for eyes took a mouse arrested food co-op so on so forth why api of this system mr. Dinard each other in massing will know who in a secure way yes but you know the summons will right now is something Twitter you know the socially it's our towards good or not oh shut up bad okay as I said the fire - as I said the path to is a damn job gathering on the stuff right stopping it going towards as much computing okay this opinion I'd like to start to do gotten hypercycle poses are really his eyes of eumundi game we are the summer precipitation strongly believe what you are looking for is great it's the peak of this recession with some suffering I like it without bad to be careful we have to see their consolidation this is what I thought that we feel to be on the cloud was on top 2009 long time ago is why I totally believe that clouds consolidate right now okay the cloud right now is in this domain everybody's talking about clouds and everybody knows with this crowd which is funny I'm in Italy they need clouds after years and years their realizable class we know everybody this cloud while I put in the picture of cloud because cloud has changed it in our mindsets cloud was a really mystery who changes the stop for the whatever for what reason so what's Europe even you are try to to clear less on the cloud cause it's a scary by let's gather Google Amazon Facebook April at the push away the cloud but it's not possible we know it okay cloud private cloud is an example public cloud I agree this well know stuff but what does who knew knew was paying as you go look at the bathroom this service you finished you cross your your agreement will be comfort this is a really this this as a change in everything in our system okay you need it use it that's it this is the new paradigm and where would you look even for the future to continue in this direction look at the IOT everything in this way because people can understand when I mess the phones sharra in San Francisco what's the funny to use you burn oh shut up click the back door need to go from here to there take the money from credit card who cares nothing difference those are not an except for like an about month many more example I our B&B or all the stuff let's go look in this direction this is why people want to go if people were to go in this direction less going in direction cause we're the master Smarties few months digital technology this was happening in any domain we can apply it okay as I said be doing what clique angle so God started with this idea and others understood the powerful of the system and now we are looking to the connectivity last the last month I ran I went to the telco corrector in Italy ask you the Telecom Italia to over the fiber at home am i spending dilthey euros that we do under the mega meat for 50 uses nothing I have a fiber at all so not really fiber is on the cabinet but you cannot imagine I connect all my smart TV all this kind of stuff my daughter is not complaining anymore now she's happy because I I felt really frustrating because like well if you see do you know I wouldn't even know intern it's called it for eternity cycle exists for us it was up I understood we are moving on the four experience of cloud we're moving on before because if everybody's connected and more than the four needs just there was some kind of instruction where all the operators can make some business was missing the business for the telco Marie this is the answer to the cloud or take over at Oakland they all come true was a Cisco starting with idea for try to push this concept where in some way starting from the cloud you try to to distribute it very well fashion the data inside the network okay this is a essentially the idea of of fork and repeat currency some worth of service usually experience connecting Internet of Things cloud using smart things to connect each other you see that is some conveyor or is this kind of stuff there is a new trend six months ago was announcing the powerful architecture local security scalability programmability GDP it's not a network but somebody else can this is the same on the cloud what this is the difference yes yeah this is an only difference anymore this was a sapling we're going towards a dimensional where everybody is asking for but obstruction mr. destro this is new trend but it's not a new trend you know it the cloud buys new trend on that LT is the new trend on the networking by the fog and patch look to the head is the same things were receiving in many inputs from different domains where each of us is staying in our apartment okay isolated what we believe propriety solution no guys we are going to say so this should be different domains if you look on edge you need some kind of or non-centralized the behavior peer to peer computing similar to what folks try to provide that okay some type of grid computing cluster II but we're close the customer this page you can have the Gateway home get you in the network you can have in the cabinet gateway we are trying to use power of computation there okay guarantee good but the self is low latency scalability some words they already seen on how they phone but this a really well-known the cloud was changing okay the story is always the same and now you see the big high meter at things where you are trying to connect to connect all the device where I think in the era of industry 4.0 with industrial royalty even industries are looking for this domain okay and of course digital market and data they have come massive because all these components or this kind of stuff I like this representation amazing only 15 years ago whimpers continues a locked storage remember the tail we put there is incredible last 20 years and everything has changed and is increase in the volume of data reproduce in massively every year business announcement we are producing much more data is that the premise here were going not anymore from petabyte but from thetaba and so on so forth okay I like it at the pay-per-view presented correct also looking to to understand sort of the track next the future Service Commission keeper about the doctors cross missionary composition of abstraction architecture so you see they're in for microservice obstruction is it great to see converting you were concerned by fool and I hope you manage to be part of the loop remember my previous feature a pre-prepared design before and then I was looking to the paper patella we are we are going the same direction okay one of the main concerns of using standard you know are confusing standards because each of us is a talking their domain does interact each other but the matter is the same whatever service computing is incentive to bring whichever - yet we Ravens we cannot try to adjust in our they are a beautifully this is what you are trying to propose of the shareholders I can explain in why essentially the process of these mosses you something's that since I got really answer osmosis process okay Sensa the n-terminus kind of solution that is able to move around but it's not possible to move early want they need some barrier and then is a member and that allow you to move in solid subsystem at the end of the day you don't need to add all the system with the same solution or you can have a part of them what is required is iut inside for computing in silent working inside people you don't need to have everything no we need have a subset of things not everything in order to do this in the disturber some technology that allows you to an architect elements and people interact each other in order to host mechanic an exchange stuff once we figure out this way ok is this to us it is a mess usually a cloud of you in uniform you had you know very well what if I like a drunkard said yesterday services right services are providing use case other user needs the right is an argument of products but you look through user service to understand how they affect now our technology will to satisfy them but the reality we don't know where we are either of the cloud remotely logic or allen on IOT on the edge we're at wrong and what is between and sure that focus meeting or focus in the ground now focus button in the cloud but Elizabeth in the edge okay you don't know but the idea essentially to see here is a mess this is reality is the reality comes is able to make some clearness otherwise doesn't work because the reality is you never won your freedom technology you want domain this wasn't happening okay we can fight with even our coordinate from the service domain the network in demand is not on our home the euro is not it's both together try to give an answer for the users users are not using the services this is a there here is why we to define so step an entity for disagree in this domain you can define by the software this is really good for us you can define anything but you can have a little tease for the rest of domain I can give you parts of my stuff not always well this is the best if you were around the world you can get into the connection by a0 do you know what this everyone is educational for me it's the first example that the words allow you to end the connection all around the world only because we offer you will all do the academia even the the Stockholm Airport is using it is a matter of a federation and to make federated different we can define by the software ABR's service security everything okay and we are ready to divide us smarter obstructed you know this new trend putting containers inside the raspberry boutique on sale inside the SPC to do is the release more device I'm a structure maker Python you can ever be Kahlua you can ever micro jobs create everything me grow what is the same what do we did in the cloud yes I'm looking forward raspberry device but will do pursue this powerfulness maltimus 2 euros you can buy them for 2 euros you can defer what you want there are some kind of how do we know like a detection anything the programs you won't put some these sort of instructions ok this is the concept oh happy you baited the only news example raspberry except for the orders control itself but yeah example I have to you know ok also the device are ready to take this flow in this concept ok to go more honest more together if not we stop Clarice this domain I know is challenging what but you were trying to make some clever step okay I repeat he heads for clown why don't I find that was bought in them you did some things I can flow to you what you need that's it it's a part of the game okay well all the ingredients and this is a huddle already said we're not talking about that anymore of maker Sandy's we introduced the concepts of micro element we move macro element I can explain you what understand micro elements between membra between god nephew monkey aisle tease when you need some things obstruction is the first area you need it okay which on you need switch off the somatic process continue in other direction okay you can tune it do you need the much more competition on the edge move the micro elements of the edge you need a nice movement but everything should be smoothly done transfer to the user information of course with this variant possible okay say application this is the smoky start to introduce several it up with some kind of framework I can explain each box is it's an idea different type of man on the trout on a UT on the package what is it grain is to create some kind of bar we remember everything inside that context should be smooth management if somebody's happened destroy them avoid any damage you can add a bigger elements on the device you see here you can ever micro elements on the cloud on the edge allergies this is essentially the idea were looking for different aligners on the top on the penalty is essentially the architecture we are trying to create right now with different engine low level engine and I'm an engine they are just well essentially some abstraction from the ground of course some local behavior on the hedge allow you to behave okay you see resonance micro Arabic she changed by said you need to tune them it's automatically configuration you know it may can we use those car why not there is kind of a concept by the toshka you can define an environment was a good presentation yesterday the environment of the note can we define it by the Turkish kind of was work environment why not it's also ones like they could have their okay essentially there ever was morning what we're working right now from the cloud to the head but even to the edge from the HP cloud this is different modality cloud you push my prep elements but even from the edge you can use macro elements on the cloud under the device this is new model we are working on with an architecture and we are working some concrete stuff there okay what are the shop is the paper the brakes totally wave in Vietnam to some joint work shut up on the fathers when we started this concept okay run time into service deployment at that time it was a bigger sense but now there are micro elements we understood there were somethings different to show you why configuration networking security and computing you know are any these elements is a part of your domain you know that do we need this kind of stuff sometime deployment you know somebody can say okay but we are using this idea except for music intelligence why not let's start from there what you are going to do is tribal somehow construction that I would move with a machine is containers not share stuff smoothly who cares what they are what is important to represent service okay here should be priority based application even and I agree okay never matter service configuration when you start to meet some of us for strengths also some generic algorithms network process repeat I am totally sure some of you are already the domain okay because we are focusing technology specifically for this characterization we are looking at from the top even the domain of networking can we try to deploy a SCADA yesterday can interact in container by the network in Menasha yes was Molly computing management organism and then we want to do as computing for uploading provide uploading of services which resembles the sense of the idea of course teller II the micro-services adapter on monetary to understand what's going on some us vibration but keep in mind is not only specifically for one domain something to spread the allergy from deities the fog and the cloud okay orchestration summarize this is control between concept we ready know this is an important to remark we are not ourselves anymore but we talk to a macro elements macro sense metadata because I want to bring with you not only the service itself but how you have to configure it how to change the behavior during the deny me okay sure there is some link between macro sexy metadata of course useful for you for managing the operating system of the service to characterize the container to characterize the known as the environment okay but everything in one domain at the end of that would be on one man's it's the graphical representation of you different max what is challenged there are you can connect on the merits how you can represent them how we can move one man for one device except you can one man in our condition okay or you can run well on the you can move them a specular do you need example if we project as someone a metronome interpreter you can use it for understand what is temperature there it is possible to move the man from the air-conditioning offer them the sensor we can a ground in the projector this is essentially the idea what you're looking for is the personality who cares what is the technology behind okay these are allow you to move so many softer defining memorizes of what what you right now with the shot and the others as they essentially say looking for the security in this aspect okay and looking for the memorizes filter as a gathering of gateways in proxy and looking for the security was a we scared a lot and security and IOT and stop an internet you know in the past there's the opportunity that hikers were able to switch on the camera baby in in New York in the night maka naka de the baby from the opposite of the world there opened the my for operate the speaker's talking with the baby is a crazy physical you cannot imagine what this is that our people can scare it off as you know also there was energy smart television is we chatted on by the company Korea they say to improve yourselves every time I hear you try to improve the service know shall never scared I remember the first man from Google we are in Zurich 2009 so Peter I asked Amy why I'm trying to make search again the same answer or I haven't Messina I understood they attacked me they said proving the service but the end of the day chuckles okay this is not to happen well to put it in place technology just give an answer to shamans and obviously this matter was put in place technology that allowed these peoples be prepped - [Music] man grunts means you isolate everything in other domain okay we put everything there okay in something's happened you destroyed destroyed what the cloud path the big data path the fog layer or the edge computer shown the direction with device if it's not secure anymore you have to destroy it the idea essentially is to have some kind of structure I repeat were working on it the monkey gather all the facility you be there to secure them with something's happened destroy it is essentially that means if there were some attacks on the baby it's a notice where I involved their only switches off the camera button to cross the port it's possible to buy the pop computing not delivery date they will destroy everything because your child to allow the patient to continue in exaction anymore this is what we're expecting what what you do it right now because we have assumptions structures in the network structure the cow obstruction nineteen even the small camera the baby camera is possible to deploy stuff there let's put an agent or smooth kitchen it's kinda if he was Monica not from the scratch where you suppose is there don't care Google Ads mezzos repeat it's not gonna make sense to like that do it let's start what we have what is a really interesting they are looking oh so what but it's doing they are orchestrating very well containers but the tweeter number idea is to orchestrate them and in mind the processor was much completely even in jails is great to see that some experience even there where you can consider meds your service application many things are on the clients because there was more device where it's for suitable sample JavaScript facilities you can avoid so mobile TV is more device okay why don't get them inside concept of as much completely okay of course using yeah Jason this kind of stuff Tosca simple profile less stuff from any device and we can make sure it is raspberries were known which is happening also there's more devices really cheap the xp-50 do or 66 okay it's great double double code it's kind of stop don't care with only more one idea is great because you can change how you can verify the pipeline of water moving or not talking water but also the maths by the order device doing what the fast Fourier transform is what process and humans last year there was a great presentation of messina it was oblivion that we'd like to share with you what was an ingredient from this person is movie maker of Norwich in your practice he took one hour to explain his stuff but what is amazing to me was after an hour he spoken about digital life that pushing us to say so it a new Meera we said that in the past to make a movie we spend years it was an example only to go on in a small village of to make someone some part of the movie you have to knock people can please remove them Tecna if you do it for one under the forms spend a little money time stop remove them make the movies and replace them now anymore Philemon was amazing to say okay we're moving in new dimension it was really great when he said is trying to figure out that the Kafka was trying to describe a beautiful woman say okay I dreamed about you last night you're so beautiful you wake up in the morning spend twenty minute to say that in the future he said you can ever this situation oh dear I thought about you I do it not you in attachment you can save my squadron you see this is the concept of this why we are looking to be smarter of the musician adaptation what is important is good continuous dynamic visual towards we are stop right now there we are but we meet thanks to the visual stuff that the domain right now visual meetings we forecast social behavior we are destined to draw two perspectives pain social isolation is what we have to do smooth and not destructive anymore with eco so what can provide an answer okay user interface smart osmotic CDs social service so that they far as most for people you see here okay why I am saying that because we are part of the game we are trying to drain our ideas to others [Music] okay [Applause] [Music] we define it to God which is great if you definitely grab leverage new classified okay that means it is not be party to the game this is something that about the future understanding well you came armed announced that the mean September some France yet you cannot defeat away in the garbage every technology understand something that allows double combo practical to the common behavior of world was looking for the future but repeat we already have some elements Tosca they are micro elements of I'm a preset from tennis K move in these divers already what we had we can apply hit Saturday where with some happened that was multi behavior and then it relates given in melee act in my opinion we can ever really a great benefit how you can allocate manage this kind of violence with looking body your buyers are already concept of garbage or a movie star because my idea II need them this is a tough sell feeding can be done by osmotically havior where elements can move each other can stay in one place another one in any domain to put a gateway to stay in the domain dedication a picture you can take what you require you continue to be was it what you were before this right references right yes CdeBaca certainly if of computer science think about something like agents running in a container of different sizes micro containers containers and containers as well this is different here or to give your minds at the concept itself when I said I defined this off the different remember it's an environment she behaved myself the low regulated should be not to know the badge should be not that our final T she will not allow over the cloud okay should be some kind of record whether this is the story this over that to go to be part of the system if you are if you're moving away you be this content would be garage welcome to guaranty Qi a since I say to you it exam viscosity we are going to introduce the concept of viscosity what this is cartography how you can flu the death I'm becoming machine so many they move out that Robert of the game the bed tends to be in equilibrium is no matter of exchange engine is a matter of already be stateside should be in equilibrium systematic different move out garbage on getting and some sample destroying to put it on some kind of a higher destroy it is not part of the system anymore it will keep you stay learn equilibrium I wanted to see how many today are there now you're basically on the rule say the way this is to the review scottoline is not matter for exit your message the mother you say master agent what do you want but they are the path to the domain of each of elements apart it's an element service because it's data yes but that allow you to have a configuration to have to set up the magically changed we seldom a perception essentially has to be active and then meiosis need metadata but why I'm saying the same reason because of the domain I came to find the vitamin D where animals can move already specific elements with the star that we wanted to be executed in this case you can apply some different behavior because they are happy they can be dangerous data are passive you can change music movement yes but all of them is a matter of the same membra once we discuss it before that microelements you can move only the service micro service but you can move also micro service with metadata of only metadata okay but what is this is important you are obeying the structure of the membrane woody since I can guarantee to you by the quarter service the concept of viscosity because you are noticeable to some pro with the everything inside is an environment is working as you expect to apply it you can move that if you need to have a massive data you can ever the concept of set up the system the channel to deliver a big movie not micro like micro elements should be a service micro-services our people Michael Devon Michael is it not Michael said is exactly it would be careful mechanics computation right you deploygate start the system configure it start to worry you can have 70 cents with this Daniel Butterfield we can he prove it some use case we are trying it if not since they have time official announcement switching that said it's a good news here at the summer school reservists from
