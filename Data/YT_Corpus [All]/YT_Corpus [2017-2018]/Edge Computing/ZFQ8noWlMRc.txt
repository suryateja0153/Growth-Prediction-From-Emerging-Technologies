 [Music] [Music] we have been summarizing all the aspects of quantum computing implementations that we have been dealing with in this course in this week what we are now trying to do is trying to see how all the different aspects that we have discussed in this course as a part of implementation how does it work in conjunction to make sure that quantum computing becomes a viability it is an interdisciplinary field so it takes a lot of different areas and therefore we are spending this last week in a lot of detail discussion of the different aspects of subjects that we have covered so in this lecture we will be looking into the digital versus quantum computing aspects from the principle of looking at the Traveling Salesman problem what we have learnt until now is the digital computing produces serial results on the other hand quantum is truly concurrent or parallel digital computers need an exponential amount of resources to accomplish a task which can become polynomial in the quantum sense that's because quantum computers performed to to the power n computations where n is the number of qubits so these are the basic advantages we have taken oh when we went from digital to quantum so some of the very simple examples of the quantum nature has been told in terms of very basics of interference for example the two-slit experiment where if it is a classical case then for a single slit the bullets will only come from one of the two places where the holes are on the other hand when both of them are simultaneously present then it produces interference for example take a look at a wave for example the sound waves their behavior is something which is very different from when only particles are being considered classical particles so to appreciate this let me show this once more so bullets are classical particles let us consider the case where we are going to have two slits going onto a detector but for understanding this let us start with one slit so when we have bullets passes through one here is the distribution on the other hand if we have the bullet on the going through the other slit there is the distribution only one of them are open if both of them are open then what will happen is you will get a total distribution which is of this kind so one two and this one is one plus two on the other hand when we do sound waves let us say then if we have a similar situation of one's slit or the other slit the initial idea of having one each is fine but when we have both the slits open they don't simply show the addition that we just showed you for the bullets instead it shows an oscillating pattern which is the superposition which is distinct from the individuals that we talked about so that is the wave part or the interference nature of this so these same thing extend to the electrons and just going to show this for completeness and so we know that electrons essentially although they are particles they behave like wave but when we are observing electrons then we do see them as bullets so they behave as particles so that is the dilemma with quantum mechanics which is what we are working on when we go to fundamental particles which are quantum then they have put the properties when we observe them that is when we make that classical then they behave exactly like a particle analog as to the bullets that we talked about but many of their other phenomena behave like wave-like which is what when we talked about the sound wave so that is all the principles of quantum mechanics just summarized here so in terms of quantum computation we have been utilizing the concept of superposition both 0 and 1 and the qubit representation has been in terms of the number of wave functions that we are using so the superposition of states for instance would essentially have a concept of amplitude square of which leads to probability these are all the concepts that we have taken and as a result a summation of all the square of the amplitudes for the states would always be equal to 1 in order to make the probability laws to be sustained so we have been using these kinds of states entangled States superposition states and we have been representing them either in vector term or in the matrix term and whenever we want to change them we talk in terms of unitary transformations which are essentially unitary matrices whose conjugate transpose is the inverse essentially ensuring the hermitian nature of the system is preserved so we have shown many a-times Hadamard transforms where we can go from a particular pure state to a mixed state for instance we also have talked about other simpler gates for example the C not gate the not gate C not is the two qubit gate not gate can be a single qubit gate and so on and so forth there are visual representations which essentially tell us about the circuits the worse the representation of the gates and how they interact the Hadamard the see not and so on and so forth in order to do something more interesting we would like to use one of the algorithms which helped us in getting forward with the ideas of computation and one of the major ones as we have discussed is the global search algorithm which is in polynomial time whereas the one in Shor's algorithm is in exponential time however the Grover's algorithm has the advantage of wider applicability because it is looking for a search so its analogy is always given with respect to searching an unsorted set of data for example a phone book to find a specific number without rearranging so the idea always have been to magnify the amplitude of the chosen number and always we use the concept that there is an Oracle which knows the solution so we flip the amplitudes of the selected items and rotate all the amplitudes around the average and repeat this until the selected items probability or being read is greater than half so that it can be observed so in terms of graphical representations this is what we have done earlier that once we get a marked system we basically can go through the flip and then average them and then flip all the amplitudes around the average to get the mark state amplified the time complexity as I mentioned it's in terms of square root of n whereas in terms of a normal classical search the minimum number on an average that you require is n by 2 so there is a large enhancement when we go to Grover's algorithm now we would like to actually extend this problem to the Traveling Salesman problem that's because the principle of a travelling salesmen problem is that they require going through the different parts with different levels and the difficulty is that it's not possible to go through the search in this particular case in a simple polynomial structure as it is possible for a classical computer so here is an example of a Traveling Salesman problem where the ABCDE are the vertices are the points into which these traveling salesmen is supposed to go that individual can take different paths and that's roughly the basic idea behind this problem to start with and they can have different weight edge factors depending on how many times a particular path is being traveled versus the other so here is an example of a path which has been shown here where this particular path route can be taken to go to all the five points that we have discussed so this is sort of like a moving target traveling salesmen that we just discussed that the target itself is moving so that you can do a traveling salesman moving target point of a problem so we have this origin from where it starts and we have the particles or the points move with respect to the origin so these two are moving away whereas the other two are moving closer to the origin and while this happens as you can see here we define this problem as the moving target traveling salesman problem and depending on how they move we have these initial and the different positions as we have defined here so this is the basic idea behind this moving target travelling salesman problem so it's a very difficult problem because it's an intractable problem it is non determinate polynomial hard because the classical travelling salesman problem which is generally without the moving target is a np-complete problem whereas the classical TSP can be reduced to a moving target traveling salesmen problem TSP under this regime where it is np-hard problem so by giving some velocity to each of them we can get this so the non determinism incomplete set means that it is contained in the end non-determined polynomial kind of principles and the decision version is based on the tree path with time which is less than the time that it takes non-deterministically travel all the paths if one exists with time less than our time T return true else returns false so this is one option this is contained in both of them are contained in our the non determined polynomial version the other version is the optimization version which is the what is the minimum time path minimum time path that is taken where the upper bound of time with initial random path then binary search the range by testing T by 2 T by 4 etcetera to find the optimal minimum time path so this is a np-complete problem into which we are trying to see how this search is going to work or not so in the classical sense it is a very difficult problem because whenever this is necessary it needs to be able to visit each and every element of the path which means that each of these would take that many time travel paths and that's why it's a very non determinant polynomial kind of a complete path that is necessary to be taken classically in the quantum computing case however it is possible to traverse every possible path by using some tricks of quantum computing that will be shown and then once that is possible then we can have a search through all the paths superposition to find the shortest route so this key element of superposition exists in the quantum computing way of looking into this problem enables to take advantage of the superposition of the different paths once they are all possible to be traversed this was a problem which was initially tripped up by rudolf by utilization of superposition of cubic by parent graph in linear time in terms of cubic means then all the nodes have degree 3 by per turn means that nodes are partitioned into two groups each node is only adjacent to nodes in other group so this is the advantage of making this particular approach where it was possible to come up with a cubic bipartite graph in linear time by utilizing this principle so here is an example of this problem we take this same condition of a bipartite cubic graph in which we will be using the for qubits such that they are going to come in a set so that they can interact with the first part and then can get superimposed into the two different sets one set is between 1 & 2 & 1 & 3 and the other one would then be put up with the other two sets and so the superposition grows as we have shown here now the potential problem in these cases is that the extracting the Hamiltonian path and the second problem would be finding the cycles but not the path and the actual fact of this kind of a graph theoretical approaches that only works for cubic graphs so in terms of solution to the first problem of extracting the Hamiltonian path only the paths containing all ones in the first register is the question which would so in that case we can use the clover's algorithm so the first part where we are only going to focus on only the ones in the first register we can utilize the Grover's algorithm for the second part we can use the blacks box for Hamiltonian paths to solve for Hamiltonian cycles and that corresponds to the graph theoretic approach of Hamiltonian paths and finally for non cubic graphs we can make all nodes have the same degree wherein the degree must be a power of two and the algorithm when all nodes have degree 2 to the power I so in step 1 we can give all nodes same degree of 2 X the graph G has n nodes we find the nodes with the largest degree D and we find a value X where the node degree lies in between the two possibilities so this is essentially how it looks we have situation which is of this particular kind in this format wherein we are making the groups of X nodes of the path which can be then mapped into this set and we can try to find out how these nodes can be contained within this set so we go through the graph G node by node and go through the new nodes set by set and what we get is is set where we can put them together in this kind of a path and link them by using this particular principle so the algorithm which requires this quantum transition for nodes with 2 to the power x degree would be having of this format where we have the control bit coming if it is all zeros then it essentially just as a mixing of the two states whereas if goes through the other set then it will be going through this particular set of operations so the first operation when the control bit comes it is going through a Hadamard so that's how the first Hadamard works the next one essentially takes another head amount of the two and then we are putting in a control knot on top of that so the final one is another set of the control knot and here we are then going back to this set where we start the other control not set and then finally we get to the sets that we are interested and so here is the circuit that we get yeah it goes through that many elements that we are going by and it's an iterative loop ABC are the nodes adjacent to the input is a register keeping track of which nodes have been transversed and in this way all the nodes are being covered once that is done the minimum is being found by measuring the lengths register m we create a superposition again now we search for all paths such that it's less than M on an average we have to do this log of K times and K is the number of items in the superposition so this is how it looks we go through the iteration one then in the second time we make the flip and so the point about the average keeps on moving and then finally we are able to go through this entire step so we can do this on an average log of K times so that we can get the number of items in this superposition so what we have understood here is the same principle that we did at the very beginning where we said that we started off with the idea of particles and electrons which are quantum system have the properties of wave like the sound waves but when observed they behave like particles like the bullets that's what we did so the algorithm works well for all graphs it may double the number of nodes but it takes order n steps when we search the first register for all all ones and the added nodes do not affect the solution so these are the key observations for this operation now this can be extended to the overall travelling salesman problem where we need another register large enough to hold the longest path and at each step add edge weight into the register all the paths of length N and their weights would run an algorithm for Hamiltonian cycles and we look for ones in the first register superposition of all the Hamiltonian cycles and then the Grover's algorithm on some register finds the minimum so now after having seen this how it works on a regular tier speed can be then extended to the moving target TSP in this moving target TSP each node has a velocity we find the minimum weight roundtrip for each of them so we add a time register track the total time elapsed so far for each of these motions each step would calculate the time to reach the next node as the motion occurs and the unknowns for us are the velocity along this direction vxvy and the time so in order to determine the optimal path need to add time to reach the next node to the total sum need to find the minimum which is similar to the TSP problem that we just did before and we need we have an added time complexity is which is linear the added time complexity in this case is linear because of the velocity component so in summary what we have shown in this particular approach of Rudolph is that the have extended the Hamiltonian path algorithm for qubit bipartite graphs for travelling salesmen problem and for moving target traveling salesmen problem paths superposition can be obtained in linear time the Grover's search algorithm works in square root of number of objects in superposition and there are two to the power n different paths so the total time is order 2 to the power n over 2 which is still in polynomial time and therefore this has a benefit over the way how algorithms can be applied to non determinate polynomials and their principles we will also look at another kind of problem in this context which is related to Traveling Salesman problem in a slightly different way but generally at this point this idea the fact that we can search an appropriate path for the different trajectories which are involved in travelling salesmen are very important for making progress in terms of algorithm development as well as application of these algorithm developments to problems which are quite difficult to be taken care in terms of classical computing so all the non determinate problem problems have been targeted and attempted through quantum computing by using these kinds of principles so maybe if time permits I would actually do one more of this kind of problem in the next class thank you [Music] [Music] [Music]
