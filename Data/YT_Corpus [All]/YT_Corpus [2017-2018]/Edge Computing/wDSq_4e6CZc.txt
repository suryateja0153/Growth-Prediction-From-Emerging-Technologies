 live from Boston Massachusetts it's the huge covering OpenStack 7:00 2017 brought to you by the OpenStack foundation Red Hat and additional ecosystem to support welcome back I'm Stu minuteman joined by John Troyer this silk an angle media's production of the qubit OpenStack summit where the worldwide leader in tech coverage live tech coverage happy to welcome back to the program someone we've had on so many times we can't keep track he is the creator of the term pet versus cattle he is one of the og of the cloud group Randy you know wrote about everything before most of it's done so good to see you thank you for joining us thanks for having me all right so Randy coming into the show we felt that it was a bit of resetting expectations people not understanding you know where infrastructure is going the whole hybrid multi cloud world so I mean you've told us all how it's going to go so where are we today what have people been getting wrong what's your take coming into this week and what you've seen well I've said it before which is that the public clouds have done more than just deliver compute storage in networking on demand but they've really done is they built these massive development organizations they're very sophisticated that are you know really come from that web scale background and move it of velocity that's really different than anything we've seen before and I think the hope in the early days of OpenStack was that we would achieve a similar kind of velocity and momentum but I think the reality is is that it just hasn't really materialized that well there are a lot of projects there are a lot of contributors the coordination between them is very poor and you know it's just not the like architectural oversight that we really need it isn't there I a couple years ago there was a Silicon Valley gave a presentation called the lie of the benevolent dictator and I charted a course for how we could actually have more of a technical architecture oversight and just that really fell on deaf ears and so we continue to do the same thing and expect different results and I just that's a little disappointing for me so what is your view of hybrid cloud did you know no disagreement you look at what the public out companies especially the big three the development that they can do you know Amazon thousand you know you know new features a year Google what they can do with data Microsoft has lots of applications and communities around them the you know we're mostly talking about private cloud here it was a term that you fought against for many years you know we've had great debates on it so how does that ibrid play out cuz customers they're keeping on premises edge fits into a lot of this too so it's there's not one winner it's not a zero-sum game but how does that hybrid cloud work yes I didn't fight against private cloud I qualified it I said if it's going to be a private cloud it's got to be built and look and smell the way that the public cloud was right if it's just VMware with VMs on-demand that's not a private cloud that's that was my position and then in terms of hybrid cloud you know I don't think we're there yet I've presented on this at many different open stacks you can you can see it in the past in and I sort of laid out what need to happen and that didn't happen but I think there's hope and I think the hope comes in the form of kubernetes and a certain degree how and the reason that kubernetes with helm is very powerful is that kubernetes gives us a computer abstraction so that you don't care if you're on the public cloud or you know OpenStack or VMware or whatever and then what helm gives us are charts so ways to deploy services not just software and so what we could think about doing in future is building a hybrid cloud based off of kubernetes and helmet yeah so Randy since last time we talked you've got a new role you know juniper juniperus done a contour acquisition you know quite a few years neck back you wrote a good blueprint on one of the Juniper forums about the open contrail community so tell us a little bit about your role your goals in that community so open contra has been a primarily a Juniper initiative and we're going to press the reset button on the contrail community I'm going to do it tonight and call for people to sort of get involved in doing that reset and when I say reset I mean wipe the operating system reloaded from scratch and do it really as a community not just as a Juniper run initiative and so people inside Jim are very excited about this and what we're trying to do is that we believe that the path forward for open contrail is ubiquitous adoption so rather than playing for just the pieces that we have which we've done a great job of going to take the world's best Sdn controller we want to make sure everybody uses it because we think the in aggregate that's good for not only the entire community but also jumper so love the idea of kind of rebooting the community in the open right because you have to be transparent about these sort of things right what are the community segments that you would like to see join you here within the open contrail what kind of users what kind of companies would you like to see come into the tent well anybody's welcome but we want to start with all of our key stakeholders that exist today so first one in arguably one of the most important is our competitors right so we're hoping you have my Nexus at the table maybe Ericsson Huawei anybody Cisco hey come join the party a second is that we have done really well and SAS and in gaming and we'd like to see all of those companies come to the table as well workday synaptic and so on the third segment is enterprises we've done well in financial services we think that's a really important segment because their leading edge of enterprises typically and the fourth is the carrier's obviously incredibly important for Juniper folks like ATT Deutsche Telekom all those companies we'd love to see come to the table and then you know that's really that's really the primary focus and then anybody else who wants to show up anybody who wants to develop in controlling future we'd love to have ler well with open source communities right there's always a balance of the contributors and developers versus operators and you know we can use the word contributors and a lot of and a lot of roles some open source community is much more developer focused others more operator focused where do you see this open contrail community starting out so where it's been historically is more of our end users and operators I think that's I think that's interesting and an interesting twist because I think sometimes open-source communities get stuck with just the people who can contribute code and I'm I'm from an operator community myself so I think that's really interesting we still want all those people but I think what has happened that when people have come in and they wanted to be more sort of on the developer side that community hasn't been friendly to them okay and so we want that's a key thing that we want to change and you know when we were talking to certain carriers you know they came and they said look it's great you're going to do this we want to be a part of it and one of the things we'd like to contribute is more advanced testing around VMs and I just look at that and I'm just like that's what we need right juniper is not can't carry all the water on having you know sophisticated test Suites for Venus and more advanced networking use cases but the carriers are deep into this and we'd love to have them come and bring that so not just developers but also you know QA you know people who want to increase increase the code quality the architectural quality in the aggregate value of open contract okay Randy could you help place open contraire where it's you know fits in this kind of networking spectrum especially there's open source things we've talked about VPP a couple times on the cube here the joke for many years was Sdn was still does nothing NFV solutions have grown have been huge use cases really where the early money for big deployments have been for OpenStack where does that open control for it where does it kind of compare and contrast against some of the other options out there I'm gonna answer that slightly differently um I I've been skeptical about Sdn overlays for a long time and now I you know and helping with you know one of the world's best Sdn overlays and what's changed for me is that the last year I've seen key customers of contrails of junipers actually do something very interesting right you've got an SD and overlay it's complex it's hard to boy you've got to wonder why should I do this well I thought the same thing about virtualization right until I figure it out sort of what was the killer app and what we've seen is company one of our customers and several others but one in particular I can talk about publicly Riot Games take containers and open control and marry them so that you have an abstraction around compute an abstraction around networking so that their developers can write to that and they don't care whether that's running on top of public cloud private cloud or in some partners datacenter globally and in fact we're going to talk about that today at open contrail day is at 3:30 well those are going to present a lot more details and that's amazing to me because by abstracting away and disintermediating the public clouds you actually have more power right you can build your own framework and if you're using kubernetes as a baseline you can do a lot more on top of that computer network abstraction you talked about open contrail days again my first summit I've actually been impressed by the foundation acknowledging there's a huge landscape of open-source and other technologies around there OpenStack itself doesn't have to invent everything can you talk a little bit about that kind of attitude of bringing I mean we talk to we can talk about Cooper net we can talk about kubernetes and that sort of thing but all the other you know CN CF projects monitoring even even components like Etsy D right we're talking about here at this conference so can you talk a little bit about how OpenStack can interact with the rest of the open source and cloud native writ large community that's sort of a tough question job I mean the reason I say that it's like that the origins of OpenStack are very much NIH and there were has been a very disturbing tendency to sort of reinvent the wheel great examples Keystone still to this day I don't know why Keystone exists and why we created a whole new authentication standard when there were dozens and dozens of battle tested battle-hardened protocols and bits of code that exists prior it's great that it we're getting a little bit better at that but I still I still sense that the origins of the community and you know some of the technical leadership have resistance to you know organizing lis working with outside components and playing nice so it's better but it's not great it's not where it should be really you know OpenStack needs to be broken down in a lot of different projects that can compete with each other and all run in parallel without having to be so tightly wound together and I it's it's still disappointing to me that we aren't doing that today Randy one if you can give us a little bit of a personal reflection you've been involved in cloud many years we talked about some of the state of it where do you think enterprises are when they think about you know their IT how IT relates to business some of the big challenge they're facing and kind of the just rapid pace of change that that's happening in our industry right now yeah well the pressures just increase the need to pick up speed to new faster and to have a greater velocity that's not going away that seems to be like an incredible macro trend that's just going to keep driving people towards the next event and but the what I see is that the the tension between the infrastructure IT teams and the line of business hasn't really started to get resolved you see a lot of enterprises backing into using DevOps as charter as a way to try to like fix the culture change problems but it's just not happening fast enough I have a lot of concerns that basically private cloud or private infrastructure for Andersen enterprises will just not materialize in the way it needs to for the next generation and that the line of business will continue to just keep moving to public cloud all the while all the money that's being reinvested into public cloud is is increasing their capabilities in terms of feature sets and security capabilities and so on and you know I just I don't see the materialization of private cloud happening very well at this point in time and I I don't see any trend lines and tell me it's going to change you know what what recommendations do you give today to the OpenStack foundation I know you haven't been shy in the past about giving guidance as to the direction what do you think needs to happen to be able to help customers along that journey that they need I don't give any guidance there instead foundation anymore I'm not on the board of directors and frankly you know I gave a lot of advice in the past that fell on deaf ears and people were unwilling to make the changes that were necessary I think to create success and even though I was eventually proven right you know it there doesn't seem to be an appetite for change and I would say that the hard partition between the Board of Directors and the technical committee that was created at the outset for the fit with the founding of the foundation has led to a big problem which is that there's simply business concerns that are technical concerns and they're technical in terms that our business concerns and the actual structure of the foundation does not allow that to occur because that hard partition between them so people on board of directors can't actually tell the tea seed that they'd like to see certain technical changes because their business concerns and and technical committee can't tell visit the board directors they'd like to see business you just made because there are technical contains around them and I think that's just that it's it's fundamentally broken until the bylaws are fixed just awful so Randy beyond what we've talked about already what's exciting you these days you look at like the serverless trend is that something that you find intriguing or maybe maybe contrary view on it I'm curious what's exciting you these days I server this is really interesting in fact I'd like to see serverless at the edge I think it would be fascinating if Amazon Web Services could sell a server list capability that was actually running in the mobile carriers edge so like on mobile towers or in central offices if you could do distributed computation for IOT literally at the very edge of the network that would be incredibly powerful so I am I am very interested in service in that regard with kubernetes I think that this is the future I think I've seen you know most of the other initiatives start to fail at this point docker incorporated just hasn't made the progress they need to hopefully change the leadership will fix that and but it does mean that they're more and more people are gravitating towards q4 Nettie's and that's a good thing because whereas OpenStack is historically got no opinion given Nettie's is a much more prescriptive model and I think that actually leads to faster innovation a greater pace of change and combined with Home charts I think that we're going to see an ecosystem develop around kubernetes that actually could be a counterweight to the public clouds and really be sort of cloud agnostic private-public at the edge who cares Randi bias always appreciated you're very opinionated viewpoints on everything that that are happening here pleasure to catch up with you as always John and I will be back with lots more coverage here from open tech summit in Boston thanks for watching the cube
