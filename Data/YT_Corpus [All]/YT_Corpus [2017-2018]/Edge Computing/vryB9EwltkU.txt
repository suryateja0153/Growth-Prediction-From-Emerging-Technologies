 from San Francisco it's the queues covering dev net create 2017 lock you by Cisco hey welcome back everyone we are here live in San Francisco for Cisco's inaugural event first time they're having dev net create an extension of their classic dev net program I guess it's not so classic Peter it's been three only three years I'm jeffer with the cube and here at my coast Peterborough general manager wiki bond comm our next guest Jim LaGuardia who is the founder and CEO of Narmada start-up welcome to the cube thank you John so thanks for coming on first question before you started what do you guys do take a minute to talk about what your company does and why are you your head Cisco dev net create right yes in armata is a SAS for cloud application delivery and management so what we do is you can think of us as a logical layer above you know the big three cloud providers as well as private clouds and we provide a common set of application services for developers who are looking at multi-cloud use cases and even edge computing moving forward to provide a common layer I was just at covering sa piece a fire last week again on multi-cloud gang coming out multi cloud is the hottest trend right now in terms of what people are seeing and that makes a lot of sense no one clouds gonna win it all it's never been a winner-take-all Jerry tenet Greylock said that many years ago turns out he's right however you get the big the big cloud guys lining up the question is multi cloud is it reality yet or is just hybrid IT hybrid cloud just the stepping stone to potentially a multi cloud world your thoughts yeah good point and hybrid is certainly the stepping stone but what we're seeing more and more as the applications sort of being chosen to go on one cloud run or another so now it's not at a point where we're seeing the same application span multiple clouds but based on the workload based on the application type enterprises deciding whether to put them in private cloud public cloud or a choice of public clouds so define multi-cloud real quick take a minute after I like to get your definition of what is multi cloud right so to me it's a combination of being able to choose your interest church services primarily and being able to have a portable set of application components and constructs which can span either these public or private cloud deployments and today of course is a lot of momentum towards public cloud but private cloud is also going to continuing to grow and will continue to grow for various reasons so having that choice of deployment is really what we're seeing as multi cloud today of course put a plug in for wiki bond and Peter's research they just put out a new true private cloud report and had it pegged at a market of what two hundred and sixty billion for true Pro cloud yeah yeah so you're right but it's gonna be big and John just another plug we're doing we're actually doing a multi cloud crowd chat tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Pacific so anybody the ones participate in taking a crowd chat about multi cloud 9 a.m. Pacific tomorrow good good plug check it out Pacific crouch at net shits be right down the front page as you get on that Jim but I want to ask you to go to the next level mostly cloud let's peel the onion bill button what does that mean I can run workloads on any cloud or do I put a workload on one cloud and I put another workload on another cloud yeah or can this workload if the capacity is bad move over to another cloud this just smells like a latency problem it means this seems like ungettable at this point right what's your definition of this at multi-cloud what is multi yeah so what's happening in the developer space of course with the big adoption of containers and the push to words in a container izing applications now we have that ability to rapidly spin up services as needed on different cloud platforms and really the cloud becomes you know a place where you I can have a container host and an endpoint for deployment so you combine that with management services application management services like numata and now you do have that choice of being able to set policies either based on you know like a demand and scale or usage or based on you know recovery from faults in the infrastructure to spend different clouds for the same workload okay next question for you it's great to have you on great subject matter expert here thanks for for answering the questions but this one is a little bit different if I want to secure a cloud with the Amazon put my stuff there you see mostly test dev and then oracle CEO chuckles all the time it's pretty much all test tab okay that ship is sale pretty much no brainer what percentage of the workloads now or what workload specifically or going beyond test and dev that you're seeing that are going into production because now with hybrid it opens up more range of apps beyond testing them so certainly test dev is happening we get that o L hanging fruit what's the next level yeah so I think the one way to categorize it and is systems of engagement and systems of record of course so we're seeing anything public facing whether its mobile web properties web applications more and more you know micro-services style so applications those are the next wave that's going to cloud data residents in the tends to stay with private cloud for a longer term but even that over time we're seeing but VP sees but you know the right security constructs being a viable public cloud being a viable option there one of the top questions we have in our crowd chat community that comes up all the time around DevOps someone give you thoughts on this what advice would you give to op operations practitioners who are afraid DevOps is going to automate away their jobs yeah so yeah great great question and that's very far away from the reality right so there's what's happening with DevOps is now we're getting to a better definition of what devs need to be concerned about and what ops needs to be concerned about right and again pointing to containers as one of the enablers micro services as another we're seeing where application developers want to operate their own applications they want control of their destiny but the farthest thing from their minds is to worry about IP addressing and security concerns and things like that so there is you know and it's interesting because Enterprise DevOps is very different than what you would find in a start-up or in a cloud or Internet giant right and there is no mythical enterprise developer who can do all of this themselves needed Evan you need an ops and there's no man it goes out the window we had CMO EVP earlier on we had it was you know Matt Howard okay and he's an experienced guy but he was saying you know hundred developers have ten IT supports in one security person he sees that completely flipping around so if you take this whole notion of the jobs are going to go away which i think is BS certainly things have to be automating learning is great for that but you can see the shift happening that's certainly on more security guys wrong more operational IT guys not doing escalation doing actually really and I think there's gonna be a shift of jobs so you might be displaced functionally you're a plumber from now you're a machinist I get that yeah we're the hot job so get that if that's the case if you believe which I think you do right we're said we're the gonna shift it what's that yeah what's the job profile look like yes much like we're seeing even in software development itself right the level of abstraction and the amount of knowledge that has to be absorbed keeps increasing so it's more similarly in operations what we're seeing like you mentioned rather than being something doing something at a low level now it's understanding what are the best policies for let's take security as an example in AWS in Azure or in private cloud how do you now make sure you have the right visibility and governance with things like containers micro services where the applications are so dynamic across various environments so it is a transformation and the type of role in skill set and I think it's for the better because now you really have time to step back and look at this holistically and contribute back to the business here's a philosophical question for you and maybe Peter you could weigh in to what single misperception about DevOps would you like to see change out there as people try to drop jealous we hear it's a movement where its playbook with this so agile manifesto grow organically you know Conway's law and all kinds of stuff we've been talking about so bottom line what is the most miss misunderstood or miss perceived issue about DevOps yeah you'd like to see changed yeah so to us the one one issue that we always emphasizes there will be a dev and there will be an ops and any product that tries to minimize one roller and other is not a good fit for enterprises so what's needed is the transformation of that obstacle to the role from from just being the direct service provider they hands-on you know ops person to more of a governance curation in some ways an architect type of role right and that's the that's what we're seeing is that obstacle is not diminished it's actually high height and then highlighted great point I would I would we've already talked about in many respects the idea that we're going to go from application development to pushing a button and having it having the business suddenly run differently is just silly at the end of the day I think people think that that's what DevOps as a magical you know grab the Ivanovich a lot of people to think that DevOps is is a step on the path to no ops to having no people involved in operations at all and that's just not that's just not going to happen evilly the opposites of any relevant on the GOP's is always going to be relevant I think that Deb is going to revolve to better understand and have greater data and visibility in what's going on in ops ops is going to have greater predictability and what's going to happen from a development standpoint so I think we will see a combination of roles will see the productivity of ops continue to grow but the idea that this is going to be that there's there's magic in here and Gandalf is going to wear his dev from say about DevOps I work great at I'm gonna say Trump would say Oh trouble so I've never been to Mexico yeah I'm gonna make it amazing I'm gonna build a wall I think I did bring that inside and they'll you laughing about Trump earlier with the whole thing going on okay good good point some are staying in the community not no ops but new ops it's a new kind of vibe yeah the way we see it is dev would really think of as DevOps so splitting more into functions like application operations security operations and infrastructure so really all three need to be accommodated and they need to work together and that's sort of how we have built up new Mata as our project there's ops for all three of them the last calm conversation we had John was and test you on this is that it is the inherent quality or the inherent distributed quality of a lot of new applications that we're building actually dictates that we start to parse ops up differently all right that it's no longer running it on a single machine or on a single database with a network out in a client-server domain it's it is just inherently distributed and therefore the tasks and the responsibilities and roles associated with the operation side of that or themselves can be inherently distributed which requires new ways of thinking new conventions and new tools Qi I'm gonna give you a final word give a plug about your company thanks for sharing your by the way appreciate you answering the questions what are you guys doing what's knowing the company talk about the status the employees how much funding you have the most revenue you have what's your goals we'll lay it all out yeah so myself my other co-founders our background is you know enterprise software and we come from a network management background where we build centralized management systems for complex networks distributed devices etc what we saw happening is with cloud applications are starting to mimic that complexity right and as applications move from back office productivity functions to these hyper distributed mission-critical real life functions that we use day-to-day there's a need for this enterprise grade management so that's the type of centralized management we're delivering as a service to our customers apps become networked off ID so you have to have Atlanta living I mean that's pretty much what you do in your bridge network measuring paradigm to apps exact versus a monolithic app and some dashboard now it's all over the place multiple form factors access methods right so now we're looking in the app it is yeah and today you know the customers are left to cobble together about 12 to 14 different tools correlate data across tools and what we need to do is move beyond systems with just observe and report to being able to observe react and learn and do things the actual time exactly so you guys are simplifying that process absolutely and again use it as a single pane of glass or the service is it a software product it is a cloud service so you can think of us as an overlay across any public or private cloud and we early on we kind of decided the best way to deliver infrastructure is as a service and we've learned that in Rio we're doing that are winning uh absolutely I would say wedding yeah yeah he was sage I'm gonna drain the data like swamp yeah who knows what he'd say well I could I could get that in there so via bill treating the swamp you didn't get the data lake swamp no I got it okay go ahead so we've been there Marta completely as a cloud service because of that philosophy that we started with and we want to give developers and DevOps teams the choice of any platform right and today it's all about cloud I mean the edge is also very real we have industrial IOT customers were looking at connect your world again you're Tam your total just will markets getting bigger and bigger i OG device has data on because data is an asset it's a it's part of the app I mean I want to bring that up just if we have just say ahead yeah I'm curious because one of the things that we believe is that increasingly the whole concept of digital business is how we'll date a feature as an asset in your business especially for creating sustaining customers totally buy into the idea of the external view versus the internal view for customers versus for employees that for customer side and engagement side is really driving a lot of this but at some point time it makes me wonder if we're going to move from a DevOps orientation to a data ops orientation where at the end of the day the physics of how things run is rare as data what's the latency to get at it how do you handle the state of it etc do you foresee a a least or an extension of the DevOps concept so the data as an object is something that we act upon and we understand what role it plays in this whole bringing together of a lot of piece parts to create distributed digital systems I think so I'm the starting point of that that we're seeing is the split between data services and Behavioral Services look I mean in any form of programming it's all about packaging behaviors and data right so whether it's in a programming language and the object-oriented it was about putting things together a table now with service oriented in microservices these service boundaries so so having the data services and then having the you know Behavioral Services separated gives a lot of flexibility and then being able to move the computer to the data versus the other way around that is also very interesting so we're working with some partners where we're looking at you know cross cloud data can we you know as even services and containers are spun up on one cloud can we clone an entire environment into another cloud can we migrate some of the data efficiently challenges like that well Jim we're going to recruit you I just made a note to ping you for tomorrows crouch and see if you could make it or one of your co-founders I'd love to get your input at the community as part of sharing insight into this really fast growing changing world of management with all this complexity hi I mean there's more tools out there than ever before they're all different types a lot of complexity so we'll help bring you back in the studio or have you good idea Skype or crowd chat okay this is the cubes exclusive coverage Cisco's inaugural event dev net create I'm John for at Peterborough stay with us for more coverage after the short break hi I'm April Mitchell and I'm the senior director of strategy and planning for Cisco
