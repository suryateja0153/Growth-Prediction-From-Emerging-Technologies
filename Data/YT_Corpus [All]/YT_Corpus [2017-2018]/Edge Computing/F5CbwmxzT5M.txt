 that's enough that you don't is it thank you so much friend I me and you interrupt me anytime so little bit of me and my story I've been a default for about 15 years I I moved to United States and she are we in 2001 before that I was in a poster for the University of Warwick after the University of Utah um HP and so so it as your professor told you that I started as with a PhD in statistics and then when I was at University of Warwick in England I started working on a project that involved bayesian networks which is a machine learning technique that is used for a classification and so that Kevin took me to a movie friend that action from a very mathematical PhD research too much more applied and so it's still using very complicated math algorithms but I could see some interesting application in a in a much bigger dimension which a lot more features a lot more variables and what I I used to work with Judy my PhD because that's how I fell into machine learning and they did a song its world which should walk we call it nowadays right so what I'm going to talk to you about and also one of the faculty leaders were they programming team analytics which is a seam in a graduate program that you guys have over here which is a machine learning and data file so what I would be presenting today is a project that I work with some students of our graduate program so our graduate program has a requirement a practical requirements for students have to work on ryoko data and they often we get requests from local organizations or companies that have projects that can be used as a capstone within our school in there in a course or outside which is what we did it was a project led by faculty member and John and David where they can receive and it's leaning his lab work the as you can see the goal of day the goal of this study was to develop these second equation which is a machine learning application to define similarities among objects or servations in our data sets and so the data is related to the housing market and to do socio-economic characteristics of Northern Illinois around the Chicago so is anyone any of you in from Chicago or around Chicago one person two three okay so maybe you recognize where you live so this study was funded by a grant of the Chicago metropolitan agency for planning and that's a Regional Planning Organization and their role is to support the policy makers in north eastern illinois and so that is a developed plans or four so they're fair goal is to support and provide resources for this policy makers from local sations instead you got new policies or new programs or the future so they have to be ready if there are changes in the population it is an influx of young families to their communities in the next ten years they need to be make sure that there will be houses that will there will be ready for this new families there will be school for those families so really understanding they interested to the needs of the communities is important so what we're doing what we did was developing this model that gave this organization a tool to better understand the similarities among the different communities that's the overall goal of the side so it's so here is the overview so 530 should be done by six fifteen or so so we're going to talk about the data that we use some of them are public data some of them are files data I was able to talk about three plastic approaches that we also use I don't many of you are don't really have a background in design to machine learning so i'll just give you and kind of like your understanding what these techniques are without going into the details more like intuition and then i'll show you the comparison of these techniques and i'll show you what we did and gave results through maps and finally I I'll show you a tiny bit of this interactive data visualization tool that we developed with that we're still developing is totally work in progress very buggy but I just want to give you a sense of what we did as a second phase of the project so the motivation so again as I said before we wanted to build this integral model that explains the different characteristics of the communities around Chicago so it's cookie auntie and a bunch of other account so we looked at seven different counties in northern Illinois and so if you understand is the property of the market level characteristics of these communities you can decide which fall is my work better for certain community community you can also talk to other majors that are they have similar problems that you have and so kind of develop a better and more integrated planning for the future that's idiom right it's also Florida of nidm you can see that there is a with the housing market recovery but now all communities are recovering the same pets we actually have communities that are still suffering and so how do you handle that how do you tell the policymakers that you know that you need to support that you need to provide some more help okay so that's something that we also discovered through this study here is the area of the region that we analyze so again the Chicago the students that are from that area Yuma is a nice young County we use public data from the Census so we used a 2000 census data in the 2013 American Community Survey which is the wave data collecting nowadays there is no more complete population this anxious now going to send you these big questionnaires anymore it's too expensive so the example they select a group of the population and they collect data from them and then we also use a private data and that's from our Institute for Housing Studies which is a research institute added all that as a clean house and collect housing data mortgage activities and these are all private data so that's their role region is subdivided into census tracts so our data units are census tracts do you guys know what a sense of tract is I didn't so so census tract is this big German which so the census divides the regions into these subdivisions and in Chicago typically a census tract is as big as a couple blocks and the data that are recorded through the senses are adult level because we have before individual data because that would be too sensitive right so they provide estimates at like two blocks type of leader oh you're right if you live out in the suburbs the track is bigger as a wider area just because they attract is based on the number of people inside so they tend to divide a sub divide the region's into tracks and the track tend to contain about 4,000 people again there is a little bit of variation so if you go out in the suburbs and you could you would expect the population is not as dance a dance so there would be like a bigger right so in total we have about 2,000 units of subdivisions of all these regions and we removed all the regions all the units that have no population so you will see in the maps some grey areas because those are the airports so you have a hair of midway we have some industrial areas that have no people so not all of our nature so I'm going to give you real I'm gonna go really fast about this list of des Arcis ok so just to give you the different dimensions that we analyzed in our study um this is a cigarette center we got home values we got values demographic and vision level the age the income level digital census data we also have housing characteristics are the size of the house the number of people in child age there is natural activity the number of owners versus renters we also use the flat sales so the number foreclosures the number of cash cash sales capsule is typically a an indicator of distress sale low-income no value ok any questions are so this is a guy some of this is a mixture of senses and privately and then we also included this change variables we wanted to see also how communities have changed from the cast so we use the two thousand census data and we looked at changes in terms of number of you know whether ships in the population we love that changing unemployment rates income number of children so see whether communities have changed in terms of you know becoming maybe with more older people versus younger families so gonna get that sense of dynamics rather than amex within the different communities so this day and I'm you think oh gosh I which senses there they're going to be super clean right easy to use they're not so there are quite a few challenges when you use census data and I guess if you're a social scientist that use census data all the time know that I did not know that that I was going to spend about two or three months just cleaning the data which is the fan of data science you probably if you take a data science class you know that you're going to spend eighty percent of your time cleaning the data in twenty percent modeling and having you know developing this beautiful result that's where computer science plays a big role in vega science so first of all the census tracts are not fixed they change over time because we're not really sense the census tracts are defined based on the number of people so because of ships of population there may be especially in the urban communities like Chicago you might have areas that in 2010 a certain number of people that a lot more people moved in and new houses to think about the new in Chicago you got a lot of new development so you had a lot more people with so the tract had to be split so you have new tracks created different tracks you know redesigned everywhere so in order for us to compare 2013 with 2010 we had to map and is the computer side employment open so we have to create a mapping between the old tracks and the neutrons so we did that with a vendor community survey we have an arrow with a velocity there because they so the American community service a survey you guys from here with that so they could they send out surveys to I think 250,000 people every month throughout the United States so every year they sample about 3 million people right so that's about two point five percent of entire population so every time so when you get data for a certain track so I'd say income level they didn't sample the entire population in that sample charging that census tract they only took two point five percent of the people or three percent of the people there right so we have a problem with the margin of error of the sample estimates so what we did is considering only values that were trustworthy that gave us enough information so where the margin of error wasn't big so sometimes if you have a very large margin of error and you look at an account the actual interval could be anybody between zero and let's say 10 right but series in there so you trust a value could be anybody that big range so the typical approach is to compute this with the coefficient variation and use a sample estimate only that has a coefficient variation of beedle thirty percent so again this is another issue that we have to deal with and they were valuable two features that were important and then we wanted to keep in the study we have to do some data manipulation and aggregate the different levels together in order to get a sample estimate that was meaningful and usable this is our little revolution and obviously you move on the missing values the outlier should be the standardization either the usual set for the equation so once we had all our features clean ready to go and you saw that list before the idea now is to develop a clustering application so what is clustering so closing this machine learning methodology that we use to separate observations into groups each group contains similar observations right and then observations that are placed in two separate groups are assumed to be different or have different features different characteristics and so there is this technique and it's a recoil and supervised machine learning it's a non super ma and supervised algorithm because the problem is that we don't know what the actual number of groups is right so we're trying to discover the color among the data without knowing what the pattern is so that's the unsupervised so we will show you inner as I progress through this job that there are different ways of selecting the right number of groups there are objective metrics and there are also subjective ways and two needs to be combined in order to reach to that final results that you can use in practice so um there are this is a mathematical approach so we look at similarity between points using Euclidean distance this is all numerical attributes of numerical features so I can just apply typical distance metric between put the dimensional points and that's it simple Euclidean distance that we all know by what a the quality of a clustering result is based on the separation among the groups so a good posture result will have dense clusters so groups where the points are exclusive possible to each other means that they are similar and separate groups means that each group should be far right so the the optimal question result will have groups that are far from each other and points within each of the pretty close to each other and here is the evaluation methods of lasting results so we call it cohesion cohesion is our a quality in terms of the the deadly within a cluster so we measure cohesion police using within within cluster some squares if you did an oval in a statistical class you probably seen that so we look at the distance between points in the pasture and then just take the average that's one measure that's cohesion right so we want that measure to be small and then the other major separation the separation you want the clusters to be separated right so you want points that belong to two different cluster to be as far as possible from each other so you compute the inter this is a day between cluster subscripts get a distance between so we have different ways of measuring this right so but we don't clustering algorithms when we get to a final results we check am i getting our separation at this clusters cohesive a very dense right do they make sense okay so the students worked on three different methodologies what is the standard can I do it which is probably one of the most use techniques in clustering together with k-means it's a very fast it's also easy to explain and this is an important issue when you work with a client right because you need to be able to explain what you did and it's if you manage to use a technique that is powerful but it's also easy to understand the business audience or the client will believe your and trust your study a lot better right and camaro is it's very Twitter and it's also very effective which is obviously the main point right so then we use two other techniques that are more more complicated computational intensive more interesting from a machine learning first active ones the self-organizing maps which is a forgetter to artificial neural networks and the other one is spectral density clustering which is a newer technique that is developing 2001 it's a lot of people and so from a student's perspective you know kind of learned some new technique that's really neat math in underneath so can I toys are purely algorithmic is a partitioning technique which means that it defines separate groups of observations so for the computer scientists here you really can read the algorithm pretty easily one of the issues that we have is that when we apply clustering we need to define the number of groups so often we apply clustering multiple times so you because you don't know right I told you before it's an unsupervised technique I don't know how many groups I should find right among these observations think about clustering is used in market segmentation like you never think about a customer analytics applications where companies good customers that have similar behavior right in terms of what they buy at the store you don't know how many groups you have right how many types of customers you have so and that's the goal of your algorithms to discover that so what we do is select different caves and run the clustering methods multiple times and then compare the results and select the best that we get the best is defined in different ways so we use the matter that we use in here is Euclidean it really depends on the features of your data that I love different matter say you can use it finally on the features of your data yeah categorical data you cannot use the opinions you could use a different matter so all these different techniques that are part of this algorithm so and then we so you start these initial centers of their so think about this as an eternity process you select let's say we start with I want to discover five groups it's like five values in your data set totally random and the algorithm will grow points to the different to five different groups based on the distance from this initial point so each point is up is assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid and then once you have divided up all the points the algorithm checks within each posture and recreate and recompute the center of the faster and then reshuffle the points again so at the end the algorithm will converge when there are no more points that travel a lot so when the clusters that are formed a stable and there is no more change and at that point you clustering is done so that's Gameiro it as I said please easy to understand easy to explain right so more than we have the Goldilocks problem I say what is K how many value should I select if it's too large if I take a que that let's say it's too small right I take let's say there are 10 groups but I only find I only decide to look for two groups what happens your groups are too big right your end up with these very large groups and really not really telling you much about the characteristics so that's two course if you take it that is too large a few stops you know create too many subgroups then you just you know I just to do small it's hard to differentiate among the different clusters sky like leaning to overfitting so that's not good so it is to find the just-right k okay how do we do that well there are different ways we can use these empirical metrics which is see us and gap statistic and these are based on measurements of the data and then we also use domain knowledge and the domain knowledge here and interpretation results is a key factor when you're black cluster just using standard objective metrics by themselves is not sufficient because again this is a technique that you have to use to learn about the data right so you're trying to discover and so making sure that the clusters that you create make sense is one of the most important part of plastic and here are some of the references for both of those techniques so I'm checking the time to see so i have a few slides that explain some of these statistics gap statistical spherical is being developed in 2001 by group of researchers at Stanford and so they look at this to this gap statistic um it's um they do behind is that so the idea is that we assume that your data you're there Ariza a true number of groups that you want to discover so your distribution your data distribution so it's kind of talking from it so this perspective there is a mixture of distributions and you know that there are certain if there's a fixed k right and if the number case what you want to identify there's a true k that you want to find okay and the point of these gaps with mystic is that the assumption is that if they so you have this optimal k that you want to find so if you define a number of groups that is below this optimal k then the changes in the dispersion math in this metric of the cohesion of the of the clusters so as you get closer and closer to the optimal value of K your dispersion matrix decreases at a much higher rate okay so means that you're improving right you're improving your constant result in a much faster pace once you get close to the optimal care but if you pass the optimal k and you let's say my optimal k is five and I start building clusters and I started with two clusters and three clusters you can say I'm improving right I'm getting closer and closer to the true value 5 and this in this magic that I use to evaluate quality will get better and better at much faster pace but once I jump and I I say okay now I past five and I say okay I'm gonna start creating six or seven clusters the improvement on that statistic will get smaller and smaller and so the gap statistic is a way of measuring these different degree of changes and you do is that the true the best of K the best number of groups can be found when these gaps of these tickets at the maximum body and that's the so I'm going to skip the actual details and you guys I can leave it this light here there is a reference to the paper so feel free to really evaluate the silhouette coefficient is a confusion that is in aiken feel that so the formula there what this formula is bi measures the dispersion so that's with Destin simulation this is the cohesion so that's identity within the cluster so this is sort of a joint metric of separation and cohesion and the sis we compute that for each point the average to do act is a global measure of the quality of the postures and we want this measure to be as close as possible to one the one is our ideal world whenever gather as usually anything x+ above zero is you get a piece of it off so this is what happens in our data so what you can see the silhouette what we look for is the knees right so this type of me that's all good so kind of change price and you get it fast weekly the money stops the freezing so they if the degrees of the extent of the decrease changes the slope changes so as you can see here either seven so this is a shot around study so let me explain this graph here so here is a silhouette web this is the result of the silhouette for different case so here we create a clustering with two groups three groups or groups and so on right is that clear okay so so the idea here effects when you observe some type of change in the slope that's where we say oh that's that's a good k so here could be the seven or eight now we chose it because when we compare the results it made more sense to us it defined a certain grouping of the data that was helpful it was meaningful and that's why we kept it singer for the gap statistic here we said okay when the gap is the highest there should be a good luck so really here to be 676 would have been a good boy it could be softer right I just have a balanced to six groups however would seek sugar six groups we were missing some groupings that we feel revealed to be quite important from a practical application so we ended up to say okay so a seemed to be a good Bob ok so again that remember that compromise between the objective metrics which are silhouette and the gap statistics and the actual makes sense use of the techniques so that's what we are so we use those different techniques that came I dies then we use the self-organizing maps um so these are so self-organizing maps are a technique that was developing the 80s so with Kim iodized it's just this really neat technique that you know you have to start with different points like a group in partitioned data we self-organizing maps it's a more complicated to explain and it's an obviously more it's more intensive additionally and then the idea is that you create a projection so you start with your space of your data with a K dimensional space in our case we had about 50 or 60 bodies or something so you have like a 60 dimensional space and you project it onto a two-dimensional space which is this topological map that we call and these two dimensional space allows us to first of all visualize the data right so this technique was used was developed as a way of visualizing on high dimensional data because this is one of the actually challenges in data science is I haven't visualized when you're you know data length are defined us so many attributes and by visualizing it it's more than a two-dimensional space you can actually see the similarities among the observations so so this is the dual application of a self-organizing malice um they tend to be quite helpful and we use them because this technique will use that was used in a similar urban study I think it was baltimore and it was successful for their study so it's like well let's give it a try right and see if it works for us as well what didn't work that well here's some of the overview which I'm gonna skip don't think of running out of time and so and then we have a spectral fostering a spectral clustering is as a newer technique it's uh it's more powerful than any other technique that I showed you it's so can I rise and the self-organizing maps are good to discover groups that are elliptical so it's kind of like a regular shape shape groups so an easier easier so groups that are easier to detect kimetto I self-organizing maps division if you have harder more complex situations where the groups are not elliptical there might be like Criss crossing each other and the spectral clustering has proven to be much more effective and you do spectral clustering is related to graph theory so again it's math and computer science he replied so we're points are so your object space your data values your metrics of points are represented through a graph so again it's quite intuitive if you think about it so just to give an idea um so this is a simple graph each vertex is a point and then the points are connected if according to some distance metric right so similar to the camera came in toys idea so if two points are somewhat close to each other we connect them with an edge and so there are different ways in which we build the graphs one way is to again give a I constraint on the distance between wanting it's ok so if this distance is below a certain constant C we connect the two points so you end up with a graph right um otherwise you can use k-nearest neighbors which is another sugar you're not going to them down to create these typos crops so but once you're given the graph you can then define algorithms that apply clustering on the graph itself so you lose the data space and you now live in this graph and so the so points that are connected right there will be friends that are closer to each other so if i use type of cat in algorithms on the graph right then I can just cut pieces of the Grouch and those are my concepts again here I need to define a number K of clusters as well so here is some of the techniques some of the elements that are associated to be scrubs you created a agency matrix which you have the matrix which is the size of media space one if the components are connected 0 otherwise you have a degree metrics and you have business cool decoration and it's dead and so if you then use this matrix here in the White clustering of these metrics and that's how you define dispatcher fostering extremely nice theory behind again for anyone is interested there are some really nice papers on this as well so again gave you these three different methodologies kind of intuition behind what they are and so now we compare so we are we notice that all three techniques identify the same features in terms of the features that drove the clustering now every feature not every valuable in your data that will be useful for the cluster right the whooping features that are more important that define the differences across the different postures income housing units nothing surprising here unfortunately income housing units the age of the housing units economic hardship indicators is still you know these are indicators there's a lot of segregated areas Ichigo so spectral clustering provided the strongest result but compared to Canada is kind of similar so we actually ended up using humanoids for the deliverable to our power and then the self-organizing maps were not that so here's kind of like find the difference ah and so these are the results displayed on the map so these are the entire region and we'll go through the details of the clusters in a minute so this is kind of gives you an aid of the differences right it's feel like that casual game or something that is just trying to find the differences so let's see if you guys so this is Chicago this is cook county right the urban area remember what I told you that so these little squares is legal and Solomon squares but already still areas units those are the tracks yeah this is our date of theta level so as you can see this is it this is the city so the tracks are small because you are a lot of people in the city right but as you move out to the suburbs this is one truck this is out of very you know like a place with very few people this is a candle thing so any so all the different colors represents the different people remember we define eight groups right each color defines a different group and we go through the groups in a minute so we ended up using this result the brown area it's about similar between the two the glue is also similar the king is similar the queen is major differences in the city so Camaro is X Factor foster did not agree in the city there were quite a few that were placed in the same categories on the same technology but not all of them in fact the yellow topology in the spectra faster different from the yellow technology in the camp a droid okay so let me explain what these different different method technologies of time so here is the result the master differently Christmas is done by different tool so what let's see we have one into our most distressed areas they are in urban community urban communities they are in the west and south side of Chicago we also notice some of them in other larger communities in Illinois I have Samantha and and so then we have you can notice like these boots boots I rain so we have this is the Gold Coast this high income younger no kids small households here again you have distressed low income and low educational attainment the green up is different from the yellow for a double for a couple of things there the income is regal is higher slightly higher and the households are bigger so those are primarily households with us again we're talking a percentage wise right but another is speaking at a higher number of large households five to six more people so there would be forget larger families um what else before is this older stock of housing if you are from around Chicago you know what I'm talking about this would be berwyn movie so this will be suburban cook county and then the this purple five those are the high-income wealthy neighborhoods high education attainment hi homebody no disguise family children and then we have the six is how sorry five is the waters income to I'm getting rupees with the colors and the six is the hottie same time so that's the orange park so here will be highland park but also over there winnetka here we have hinsdale yeah normal of you kind of high income communities and then the interesting part is this number seven this is the growth classroom this is where you have a growing population growth in the number houses newer homes and you notice that there are other suburbs but very trusted it's right here little so it discovered this tan little you know the high development area in the roof as well and then the age is the middle income suburban saudi aging and but families inch or so so I'm gonna skip this because this is just a detail what I decide guys can look at it more in detail and let me show you they be drawn up next door because the problem we had was too we had a program how do you keep this information to be for me happy now you have this government agency on service local organization and they're supposed to use this right I mean there's a lot of data behind it's like features and features so we had different way so we decided to do this and maybe some of us might have a better idea so one is to create this table here just like what is them so this oh sorry [Music] me so this table we thought okay is this table which is so within each so this is a current map of the valuables that we thought okay so this one so so we have the quartiles which kind of gave an idea so here to be a hardship so kind of given a key about numbers give them something that I could use and then the other thing we did was feeling this visualization here so this is a tool that is exporting products so it's very bugging the values there don't look at the value some of my concerns but video is this is built by one of our graduate students and Susan III and so we want to create this interactive visualization where you have valuables here and so we can click on any track and you get a histogram and then the back line here represents the value for that specific track so again work in progress we're going to add more features histories as we can click on tracks just yet so here it gives you a sense of what we're trying to do how to make these data available and usable to today to no substitutions move your scientists and so we also we also want to add additional features which is one of the things that we realize that we want to work to learn about that you look at the map right so the interesting part of this map is that we did not use lon longitude or latitude in this clustering however the clustering follow some geographical order if you look at the map here they are the tracks belongs you the tracks are so the colors are not all over the place right you see parts of them out there have specific color so and the question would be so what happened through those clusters like clusters that of those tracks that are neighboring right between different types do that not so because i would expect those tracks to be have a different you know gradient so like this track so this is the distract here right so okay so it's it's called a pig but is it's going to be similar to the yellow the yahoo is a completely different type the yellow is there so one is I income being on its low income right is it possible that across the street and I get a new completely different neighborhood yeah sometimes you can and it's true you can but often you don't write so often the difference is not so strong right so the idea would be to analyze these tracks that are neighboring between two different types and evaluate whether their characteristics maybe are more of a kind of a morphing into the other topology as well so these are all the gifts that we want to investigate obviously improve the interactive map where yeah we also use this map to gain and to interact with the people that understand the neighborhood and so related to my point let's say someone says okay you know this is pink but really I know that area it should be yellow right terms of the time and so the idea would be to have a map where I can input that knowledge and change the clustering membership or that specific track to make it interactive where it's not just visualizing the data is interacting with the data and providing the domain knowledge is that is so important in data science so that is the end of my presentation and I have questions because I mean questions so Oh ok so the map that I showed you even up that is not the projection that is just a here I'm just mapping the psychology this is self-organizing not just for the self-organizing maps are ok so with the self-organizing maps you define this topological mouth and the way there are so each node or neuron in that map is defined by several weights and the weights measure the similarity with a point so it it so to answer your question whether it they the features that are more important in defining similarity between points will have a stronger way in creating that topological map the weight is determined by the algorithm see so it's learned from the data so there is a function that measured distance and and also the function depends also on the the boundaries around so it's a really really interesting technique if you look into it yeah there are a lot of different parameters that go into that [Music] do you have you time chef comparison to see multiple experiences so crammed into the purple track yeah good question yeah dynamic so yeah that's that's a really good question we did a senior study so this is version 2 of the study we did a similar study in 2010 but just for Cook County and for that we use nineteen eighty nineteen ninety two thousand and 2010 census data and we looked at the transitions and we try to to do a little bit of that work but I don't know sometimes I think the census data some no no you get enough but yeah we try to do that so at the core and it kind of an eye level we were able to do that yes you guys we go nice your area we will see from Chicago did you find yourself laying down ah where do you live with you very fun what about you i'm from mchenry county all right let's thank our speaker one more time [Applause]
