 live from Madrid Spain it's the cube covering HPE discover Madrid 2017 Razia by hewlett-packard enterprise and we're back at HPE discover Madrid 2018 this is the cube the leader in live tech coverage Dom Dave Volante with my co-host Peter Burris this is day two of the event johannes Koch is here he's the Vice President and Managing Director of Central East ern Europe Middle East and Africa for Hewlett Packard enterprise he's joined by Ali Salah is the senior vice president and chief commercial officer at GE digital for Middle East and Africa gentlemen thanks so much for coming to the q appreciate you for anything Johannes let's start off with with you GE HPE what are you guys all about what are you doing together talk about the partnership in the Alliance so you know it's sorted actually if by month ago I suppose and it was you know meetings that we had with with General Electric to understand the you know the customer requirements in in cyber security and what we figure these that you know in this world of you know IOT and Internet of Things there is a an increased requirement for for security and there was from our perspective you know lots of solutions out there but it's quite difficult for customers to understand you know the the landscape and you know who to turn to and we also figured that in this world nobody can serve every requirement of a customer so this is how we figured out with you know GED that we have a joint interest here to serve in the central Eastern European and and then mainly in the Middle East and Africa part you know our our customer base and this is how it started and I think what I can say is you know it has accelerated incredibly during you know two months since we signed you know the joint agreement you know we've been building a channel we have been having lots of meetings with customers and have filled a really nice pipeline in the meantime also I think here the show you know reflects an incredible interest by our customers so I think we are in a very good state at the moment you know having a lot of interest having basically you know probably all the key customers in our region having this on on their agenda Ally maybe you could describe the situation of the you know the the industrial expansion if you will in Middle East and in Africa what you guys are seeing in terms of the big trends and what the economy looks like well thank you you know GE has been in the Middle East Africa for over 80 years in some countries and we have deep relationships on industrial side whether its power oil and gas aviation health care and others and our customers are thinking a lot about cost quality and access and productivity is top of mind and and they've discovered that their industrial assets are smart and capable but the data are not being collected so when we collaborate with ecosystem of partners and we fetch the data and get connected and get insights from the machine to make them able to make the right decision at the right time and then it drives optimization this is top of mind they want to see how they can do better for Less okay so the customers are GE digital the customers are going digital and have all these devices instruments machines and they're moving in a new direction because we're trying to what are the challenges that they're facing what are they asking your help on what are the big problems that they're trying to solve so everyone wants to talk about productivity and calls out that challenge is that not everyone is ready for digital transformation some do not feel there is a burning platform and and those are all ready when they feel there is a burning platform they don't have a plan there have a playbook so it's important that we collaborate and help our partners and customers understand their current state and an heat map and desired state and pinpoint two quick wins so that they get it and they see incremental improvement and as a performance management has been an easy way for us to say your asset is underutilized compared to your industrial entitlement you can do 10x better and this gets their attention and this is where we say the power of lawn in the industrial age is relevant 1% in our market in the open market when we talk to them about 1 or 2 percent productivity they laugh at us they say talk to us about 10 or 20 because there has been a lot of a lot of gap in productivity and efficiency are you able to so it's only been a nine months but are you able to start to see any kind of customer results at this point you have some examples even early wins with customers so-so to be exact the start of the relationship in a formal way issue is two months oh no no no we started our first conversation so Antilia sort of became so they're great it is really brand new and I think what we can say is I think we have you know I think you know you know 180 partners already engaged we have you know probably more than you know 500 customer contacts in the region already so with large accounts and we have a pipeline that is multi million in size so we're expecting the first close you know within our first quarter which ends at January 2018 yeah so I think there's no question that there is a big market opportunity out there right and I think you know the the show here I think for me even accelerated things because you know when I think in the past you know digital transformation was sort of limited to a few industries you know which we always give you know travel industry we take banking sometimes or we did but here I think what became transparent to many of the customers that that we had here there there is no industry that is sort of immune against what's happening out there and specifically also that you know the sensors and you know the the devices that out there require special attention and I think you know with with you know specific on the OT side we have a solution now with GED that we can basically roll out across our territory yeah so I want to talk about three things very quickly I lay this out and ask you if in fact this is going to catalyze that much more attention number one is a lot of the industry in Middle East and Africa our natural resource industries where the historical ways of doing things have been relatively inefficient so there's a lot of opportunity to use IOT and related things to bring more efficiency better practices overall resource management number two is that the technology is now capable of doing that in places where you don't necessarily have the best infrastructure aruba technology for wireless and some of the other things are now possible that adds to it and number three you know we've seen some recent steps and liberalizing of some of the countries that have the most opportunity to do some things differently you know robert mugabe no longer in zimbabwe of the new prince in saudi arabia talk about liberalizing things are you seeing these come together in a way that would encourage people to think new ways do new things use information perhaps differently than they did before what do you think is this a confluence is this a moment no I agree with you and absolutely today our customers and partners in region are more ready than before and they're pulling hard and when we put our act together as an ecosystem partners to make it easier on them to make the right decision when we talk productivity productivity comes from people from process operation from industrial entitlement and when we talk about the digital thread that brings it all together whether we look at the culture and vision and mission and people utilization look at the process defined or not and how we can optimize it look at the industry entitlement and tell them compared to your peers this is where you can be we get their attention and with the push from the government for productivity and utilization and do more for less this is becoming top of mind everyone is talking about it so so when we partner together and we say this is the playbook and this is how you can start and this is the edge to cloud solution in a secure way and we linked it to the industrial entitlement and that's underlined Industrial because when we speak the healthcare language and the power language and the oil and gas language we get their attention excellent so there's a there is a increasing interest but and you anticipate that there's going to be new action with their with their pocketbooks and I would add you know I think we I mean this is not an easy marketplace but you know you can have you know some outstanding and we have you know in the region we have I mean you may have heard about there was in the the private investment fund you know when the conference did announced any project you know or you know we have in you by smart city as a fall check or it with the city of Dubai I mean which are you know all projects you probably would not happen in in Western Europe right I mean so there is potential there are bigger things happening and I think there is also an understanding that you know this is a way how to leapfrog and is it to your point you do to leapfrog technology and I think that is what can happen what we need to be careful is you know where to invest because you know I mean there are lots of ideas out there and and to understand you know what are the real things and what are the things that you know we need to to make happen you know I think this is I think the challenge they wouldn't happen in Western Europe because what the maturity of the infrastructure the space limitations the give the example of smart city and so I think we have a lot of in sort of in my remit you know we have lots of discussion on smart city but it's usually you know you you know you have to find a city that is willing to pay a PSE 12 layers in a nation and you need to talk to each and every city individually whereas here if you have a decision maker to say yes we do this the answer the answer is about readiness when you go to a large enterprise is very successful you meet the CEO and you quickly conclude whether they're ready for digital transformation or not are they going to make this top of mind for them are they going to give you time are they going to talk about productivity or is this gonna be an IT discussion and they're gonna treat you as a supplier those that are ready we roll up our sleeves and we put put in our dedicated resources to help them look at the transformation when the government official is pushing and mandating for calls out then obviously everyone wanna wanna copy and talk about it and this makes it easier for us to execute and you're talking again big numbers not 1 percent 10 percent so that's the sort of Nirvana how confident are you that you can actually have that type of impact so we've got we've got data points right if you look at health care and the Saudi Ministry of Health will be collaborating on looking at operating room optimization or emergency room optimization without touching digitization looking at the process and utilization of appointments no show and the way the clinical governance is taking place were showing 40 percent improvement if you look at the factory of the future with oh by cohn in saudi arabia we've got asset performance improvement project and they already yielded a 12% improvement and the entitlement is up to 20 that we're working on when you transform something it's iterative right when you transform something that you have not pushed for efficiency before it's easy for the first iteration to show an incremental change that challenge will be for the change to last and this is where digitization makes it last and make it impactful and when we look at the HPA relationship with the MOH on the electronic medical record we've got right now two active projects with two hospitals and it's all powered by predicts and HP peripherals are being deployed to the site and if we go to the Saudi electricity company you've got a project now on asset performance management across all their assets and again HP peripherals are also deployed and it's all about GE ecosystem of products enable solutions so I have had the pleasure and honour of speaking in front of a relatively large group of CIOs a couple times in Africa in the past few years and I always was surprised by the degree to which they suggested that the necessity of change in this region and the fact that a little bit of technology can have an enormous impact the degree to which we might actually see some leadership technology come out of this region what do you think is our the are the types of issues that types of problems that could be solved with this technology in Africa are the types of problems that solving them there could actually start driving the industry in different directions you know solving new classes of whole new classes of problems do you think that this type of technology can have a transformative effect not only in Africa but more broadly absolutely you know this is a way for systems to leapfrog if you look at Kenya right now they've got a transformation project for 98 hospitals and they've got massive shortage of radiologists so right now we're replacing equipment in 98 hospitals but tele radiology is the answer for the shortage of radiologists if you look to South Africa and discovery what discovery is doing is best in class and I haven't seen any other insurance company looking at the ecosystem the way they do it so absolutely we're seeing pockets of excellence in African and this can be a way to leapfrog you said you started the conversations around security cyber security what was that conversation like why why was that the starting point and I mean obviously it's important but I would have to leave this to you but I think it was you know because mainly there was we saw the we saw the customer interest yeah and you know I mean it's not I would say you know probably a year or two years ago you would have not seen this as a very typical HPE alliance yeah I mean this is you know we were a technology people you know we were I mean software or hardware people yeah what you see in and I mentioned at the beginning you know in the world of IOT you know things are plural a bit you know and what is happening on the edges is very much you know in the business of General Electric also so I think these bills automatically the new eco system you know and and when you look at appear at the discover you know the alliances become more and more which are industrial companies you know it is linked to industrial 4.0 and and you know core industries and all that you know everywhere where data is being created we need to have you know we need to have the partnership because and that is because the you know though the data that is being graded at the edge also needs to be computed at the edge right and so you know we need to if we want to be successful guys we cannot limit ourselves to the data centers that this is the rest is the others and these I think where we find a very good connection point because now we have software that actually can you know can can operate at the edge and I think you have good examples all that yeah I know absolutely if you look at the pain point in Middle East Africa majority of our partners and customers are government entities and for them top of mind securing their large industrial assets is important and in the operation space there hasn't been much done on security where you can go into a hospital and simulate light flickering with a voltmeter and you can take over the temperature and play with it today there is a lot of smart sensors out there but we're securing the IT firewall but within the hospital within the plant we can do a lot of crazy stuff and we owe to our partners to show a capability that's what we do within our factories and our platform is designed around security for operations so the easier interlock with HPE is our ability to get closer to the edge and peripherals and ensure the operation is secure and that's the first experiment but then obviously we're expanding beyond that to other opportunities excellent all right gentlemen we have to leave it there thanks so much for sharing your story good luck with the partnership thank you hope you can come back you know maybe and in Las Vegas or maybe next year at this event for give us the update thank you thank you okay keep it right there everybody we'll be back with our next guest Dave Volante for Peter versus the cube live from Madrid HPE discover 2017 [Music]
