 oh this is Jeffrey teper tiller thank you for joining us on our YouTube channel service management leadership today's video is the tenth in our series on cloud computing adapted from a salesforce.com article in this one I want to talk about loss preventing of prevention salesforce.com kind of has a slanted view on loss prevention and that way you need to go to the cloud but I have a different view and I think the cloud is great for keeping your data so that you don't have human error to worry about in the days of us having employee loyalty or long gone aren't they we can't depend on our 40 year veterans to keep the data center secure because we've outsourced different pieces of it and so many times especially with the data itself we need to make sure that it's encrypted and kept off-site this is an unpopular belief and I I understand because when we keep it on site and I can speak from the a few of the corporations I'm close with they have several vendors that have access to that data vendors me and service providers solution providers whatever you don't call and so would we not be better off having an SLA with Google Amazon Microsoft for that data transferring that risk over to them encrypt it and then to have access back and have some kind of gate keeping on our to and from I think that answer is yes because it lowers our risk of having all that data stored locally it also takes the weather out of the fridge I know many that live in a high weather whether it's in Florida for hurricanes or California for earthquakes for the Midwest for tornadoes it takes the weather out of it because if we store data off-site in the cloud then it allows us to access access that data anywhere anytime this is Jeffrey T for tiller thank you for joining us on our youtube channel please like or share the video subscribe to our Channel leave me feedback below I'd love to hear from you and I hope you have a great great day fine you
