 (Narration voice-over) The Gator Computing Program, a two-week STEM opportunity featuring visits to cutting-edge research labs, coding classes, and lectures from distinguished faculty, will be held June 4th through 15th, 2018. The GCP is for high school students entering 10th or 11th grade. The program, limited to just 24 students, is an opportunity to learn about a variety of STEM-related disciplines in a collaborative setting. During GCP 2018, students will create and present a computational project using the knowledge gained from lectures, tours, and activities. The Gator Computing Program is managed by the UF Information Technology division. Students selected for the program will spend each day with the scientists, informatics specialists, and programmers who work on HiPerGator, the University of Florida supercomputer. It is a unique opportunity for students interested in STEM disciplines to learn from preeminent scholars and technologists. Does this sound like a program that could benefit your future academic and career path?
