 the computers of tomorrow will be so smart we won't understand how they solve their problems but don't panic we'll make them explain it to us computer intelligence is fascinating whether it's a super computer that has enough processors to tackle complicated problems with brute force or sophisticated algorithm that allows you to teach rather than program machine artificial intelligence is cool but we're running up against the problem computers and algorithms are getting so sophisticated that sometimes it can be difficult or even impossible to figure out how a computer arrived at a particular solution take for example the Stampede cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Center in May 2016 the supercomputer with 800 course tackled a doozy of a mathematical question that had challenged mathematicians since the nineteen eighties it took approximately two days to suss out the answer the question by the way was can you separate all natural numbers into to set in which neither set contains the Pythagorean triple you remember the Pythagorean theorem right that's the one about right triangles in which the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides in other words a squared plus B squared equals C squared so could you divide up all natural numbers into two sets in which neither set contains a Pythagorean triple the answer the computer discovered is no but it took 200 terabytes of data to get there that's way too much information for a human to comb through and therein lies the problem computers are giving us answers to questions it's getting harder for us to know how they came up with that answer and this is just the tip of the iceberg I talked in the past about artificial neural network these are computer networks that imitate the way our brains work using computer notes to represent neuron here's the problem a large artificial neural network rapidly approaches the level of complexity so great that even the network's creators can't be sure how a machine arrives at any particular answer the artificial neural network becomes a black box meaning its inner work our mystery as arthur c clarke observed any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic we don't want the use of an artificial neural networks to be the equivalent of consulting is horrible this could lead to some dangerous situations if we put complicated systems to work for us they may come up with solutions that are actually not the best option for us to follow there could be a flaw in the computers reasoning but if it's a really complicated system that floor might not be obvious and unless we know how the machines came to that answer we may not know there's a problem until it's too late researchers at MIT are working to overcome this challenge the MIT computer science artificial intelligence laboratory also known as CSAIL has been working on a system in which artificial neural networks have to provide not just an answer but explain the rationale behind that answer and they're using this approach to make artificial neural networks research breast cancer meanwhile researchers at chongqing university are using a special algorithm to pull decision-making trees from an artificial neural networks processing to trace the sequences the network used to come to a conclusion the bigger the artificial neural network the harder this is to do imagine taking one of those old choose your own adventure books and mapping out every single possible sequence and you start to get the idea many of the tasks artificial neural networks are tackling today are pretty trivial it could involve color correction image recognition voice recognition and other basic aspects of machine intelligence but as we build computers to look at way to your problems will really want to be sure they're making the best decisions possible let's make sure we require computers to show their work what question would you ask an all-knowing computer i want to hear your thoughts in the comments below thanks to toyota for sponsoring our show and making it possible if you enjoyed this You can support our show by clicking that little like buttton and subscribe to our channel to join Forward Thinking think tank and you can learn more about the possibilities of the future in these videos right over here [Music]
