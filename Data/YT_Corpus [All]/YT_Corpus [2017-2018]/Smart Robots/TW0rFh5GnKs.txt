 Walmart has started using shelf-scanning robots to handle tasks that are repeatable, predictable and manual, like scanning shelves for out-of-stock items, incorrect prices and wrong or missing labels. This new shelf-scanning technology frees up time for walmart associates. Walmart has tested this technology in a small number of stores in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and California. And based on these initial tests, Walmart is expanding it to an additional 50 locations. Walmart stresses that the robots are there to supplement humans, not replace them Walmart believes that this combination of people and technology is helping make their stores more convenient and easier to shop, ensuring that products are available when their customers want them.
