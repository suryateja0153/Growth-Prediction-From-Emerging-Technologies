 The robot industry is often described as the core of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution. The roles robots play in our society have diversified with the advancement of technology. In our next report by Kim Hyo-sun shows... how some robots are put to work at a local bank and bookstore here in Korea. A local bank gave its customer service a boost by using a robot to introduce its products. (SOV) "Hello. How may I help you?" The robot greets customers and introduces tailored financial products according to their gender and age range. Equipped with artificial intelligence,... the robot can also engage in simple dialogue with customers on subjects like the weather. (KOREAN) "Waiting for my turn would have been very tedious and I would have just spent time on my smart phone. But it's very interesting to see a robot in a bank." This robot is also being used to interact with humans. It welcomes and befriends children who visit a bookstore. The children call out the robot's name, and the robot helps search information about their favorite books. (KOREAN) "I just showed my face, and the robot guessed my age. It's cute and looks like an alien, too." (KOREAN) "It's amazing how the robot's arms moved. I think it's very easy to use." These robots are the result of great leaps made in AI and big data technologies. (KOREAN) "The development of AI provided the technical background for robots to cater to the different needs of the people. This made social robots smarter, and better provide the services we need in our daily lives." Robots are becoming increasingly noticeable in daily life, and they are certainly gaining a foothold in showing their endless possibilities...one greeting at a time. Kim Hyo-sun, Arirang News.
