 [Music] ten years ago I did not care about robots I'm a coach for professionals in service and sales but now I'm concerned because robots will replace many jobs of people I work with today like receptionists sales personnel even nurses that's why I want to share some ideas with you about coping with robots as you're sitting here think of a time long long ago about 100,000 years ago and you're standing in front of your cave as one of our ancestors you're overlooking the valley and there you see somebody approaching your cave a stranger what was our first concern is it an enemy or friend what did our answers the probably - he waved a hand and called who who who who means no weapon you welcome and what did the other - he waved hand - and he called now beam yourself back into the future about 10 years from now you're entering a hotel you're approaching the front desk you see your receptionist waving a hand and saying with a friendly voice welcome what will be our first concern in such a situation in 10 e earth is it a human or is it a robot fiction of fact facts are already today we are surrounded by robots vacuum cleaners moving machines your car even in surgery we use robots and chat BOTS acumen communicating with us and they can solve some of our problems better than humans and this every new problem they solve they learn so no surprise that experts predict that computers will be more intelligent than humans in about 5 years from now and there are forg leaders who pledge that humans should become cyborgs to cope with all that artificial intelligence around us and we will be connected to what we call big data from the cradle to the grave do we have to cope with robots yes sooner than some of us may think now remember just ten years ago we bought our first smartphones and now what do we do as soon as that we have a minute free crap by the way where is it oh you know what I mean more than that robots look more more like humans have you seen or have you do you know Sophia Sophia the robot she has been presented here in this building this year 2017 and Sophia the robot she looks like a pretty smart young lady and she is able to show different facial expressions like joy anger astonishment skepticism maybe you ask yourself always what will remain the difference between humans and robots in the future let me share two aspects first is artificial friendliness we do not only have to cope with the artificial intelligence of robots we will also have to cope with the artificial friendliness of robots robots belong to someone on the owner of a robot programs the robot to be friendly 24 hours a day even in situations of stress he's always smiling is always friendly he always gives the right answers ask for humans it's more difficult you know that sometimes you don't feel friendly so you don't make a friendly face right sometimes you're in a stressful situation then it's very difficult is to stay friendly one moment so in the future if you meet a really unfriendly receptionist it will certainly not be a robot we train humans to be friendly and very difficult sometimes I do not feel friendly so where do not act friendly but in the professional world it's advisable to fake friendliness sometimes I used to say better are no Fanta kill friendly then authentically unfriendly so just an example how can you train to make a friendly face on command did you ever try that so it's easy in fact it's a natural behavior imagine you see a good old friend you haven't seen a long time and you're a little bit surprised so you raise your eyebrows you say oh nice to meet you but there's another one oh nice to meet you that's friendly face you can try that later you can try it now come on ah thanks to me the second aspect I would like to share with you is trust back to our ancestors 100 thousand years ago what did they do to check if another human could be trusted or not they had to get closer to each other to the distance about of about the length of two arms that was the danger zone in this zone I could have hit you with my clock in my hand so we got closer to each other and they where did we look to check if it is a friend or an enemy in the eyes right and in the eyes there is the truth in the eyes you concede you the real emotions of someone and if you look into the eyes of somebody and his eyes begin to shine you know that is a good relationship he likes me and as soon as you look into shiny eyes your own eyes start to shine too so you have a good relationship zoom your friends and the second thing we did to check if a human can be trusted or not we touched each other so where could we touch a stranger a strange person here here no here no here no but I suggest the elbow you can pat the elbow wrap it a little bit to it right now take your right arm and part your left elbow do it right now do it now pat your left and then drop it a little bit how does it feel try yes you feel the difference is it warm is it cold is it soft hard to you to you you feel the muscles the bone this is how to touch a human being remember that sensation once you will touch a robot in the future to make a difference you can try these techniques the next time you're about to socialize when it comes to socializing you know these cocktails meetings where you should socialize meet with other people so what you can do first is you approach somebody to the distance of length of two arms you wait a moment then you step forward and you say oh nice to meet you and then you look into the other's eyes you concentrate on the color of the eyes and you think I like these eyes so you can observe that your eyes of your other the other person's thoughts begin to shine and your eyes will also start to shine so your shiny eyes together and maybe in this moment you you tear to accidentally pat their toe relation building as human state one thousands of years trust has a lot to do with instinct and instinct is the heritage that we have from our biological evolution this is a heritage humans have and robots do not have my conclusion it will be harder and harder to cope with robots robots are programmable therefore they are probably more reliable than humans and they are probably even smarter than humans in the future but humans are in advance once they purposely make use of the non verbal communication skills like gestures touch smile eyes and voice friendly voice a dominant voice or a convincing voice robots may be similar to humans but will never be human we will never make our next me to the same baby - we will never have shiny eyes as we have when we like somebody and to touch a robot will never be the same to touch a human of flesh and blood that's what makes us truly unique and strong as an old species on earth let's cherish moments like this being alive as we have been for hundreds and thousands years My dear fellow humans thank you for being here with me [Applause] thank you
