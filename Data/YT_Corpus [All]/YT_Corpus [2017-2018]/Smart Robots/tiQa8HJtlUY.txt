 We developed a new rehabilitation strategy based on a robotic harness suspended from the ceiling that enables natural locomotion in people with spinal cord injury or stroke, neurological disorders affecting locomotion, and this is really a new way to rehabilitate people across activity of daily living. Concretely how does it work? The patient is attached in this robotic harness that applies just the right amount of forces to the trunk in order to enable locomotion. This means that there are algorithms, based on deep neural networks, that calculate the precise forces that need to be applied in multiple directions in order to create the more facilitating of environment for the patient. The patient appreciates walking freely and independently in a safe environment during their training. We have tested this robotic harness in now about 30 people with spinal cord injury and stroke and in all the participants, we could find a marked improvement of the locomotor capacities. Even people who could not perform a single step over ground in this robotic harness were able to walk naturally for a very extensive period of time. I really think that this new walking assisting device will really bring a lot of things for the patients not only for clinical studies but also for regular rehabilitation.
