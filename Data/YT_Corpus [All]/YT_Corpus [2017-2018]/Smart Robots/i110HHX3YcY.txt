 [Music] hey folks your OS reviews you're watching our official video review of the app Riley this is a smart home robot which sells for $200 on Amazon and through the company's website this product was successfully campaigned for on IndieGoGo a few months back and it's by a Korean manufacturer it has a very clever concept we have the body of a robot or kind of like an RC remote controlled Wi-Fi car on the top there's a typical IP security camera with a 5 megapixel resolution that captures 720p HD video it also offers infrared sensors so you can still see content under low-light environment so this is really useful if you have a larger space to cover and a traditional IP camera obviously a static it stays in one place this allows you to change it and you can place it into different rooms it can move around it's much more dynamic and you get a nicer view of what's going around in your house when you're not there it's also pretty fun to play around with and you can see that it comes in just this one color but you can get these accessories that they sell for the rings on the wheels if it wears down or you can change the color to make it a bit more customized so it comes in a pur free app that you can download with both Android and iOS you can find in the App Store in terms of the packaging it's fairly simple some other features onboard it will automatically charge itself once battery is running low pretty similar to those smart vacuum cleaners so like the Roomba it will try to go back into it into its docking station once battery is low and you can see there's two way audio communication you have access to a 70 degree field of view so it's not as wide angle as some competitors that stay in one place but still works well enough so a 2600 milliamp hour capacity battery that charges in under two hours the robot itself weighs 300 grams so on the very top give access to a QuickStart guide that's printed in full-color and tells you a little bit more about the device in terms of what's supported how to reset it and set it up for the first time using the companion app a bit more about the Wi-Fi information as well so again as long as you're connected to Wi-Fi with the security camera and then your phone is connected to Wi-Fi and be on a different network you can access what is going on in the field of view just by opening up to a proprietary app that this company has designed so here inside we have the Riley itself we'll take a closer look at that in a moment and here we've access to the charging cable and the plug for the wall so pretty standard USB based charger along with a standard microUSB cable as well for the charging station on the other side is just a decoration you can see some of the colors that you can swap out with these customizable rings as aforementioned and finally on the base here we have access to the charging station and that's essentially it so the charging station it uses two contact pins to align itself and then it doesn't really use any additional wires once it's running out of battery it's just going to go it onto the charging base itself like so and then obviously the base will be plugged into the wall on the floor so that's how the entire thing works taking a look at the construction of the robot first it's pretty well made it's constructed out of this polycarbonate plastic material that feels pretty solid in terms of its weight it doesn't feel hollow or anything surprisingly hefty and the top here features the sensor again it's not a wide angle lens but it does feature just ability for the robot since you can really rotate this and make it go in any direction using the app so it's not as much of a concern there's access to that aforementioned IR kind of light that illuminates in darker environment and switches the image quality into black and white and there's also LED lights for notifications and that aforementioned microphone the base there just features some basic info about the company and again these rings which create some friction and it's easier to travel over hardwood surfaces can be detached and and swapped out at the moment Riley is charging and there are a few things I want to point out you can see there's a notification light on the robot which will tell you as charging status and it will stop flashing when charging is complete another thing that's interesting about the base is there's actually a motor to it so the base can rotate 360 degrees so that's the motion that it makes the benefit having a motor in the base itself is let's say the robot is struggling to get back into the charging station this going to line itself more properly so the contact pins are easier for the robot to reach you all just also notice that there are some LED lights on the base itself that also tells you the power status and finally there's also an interesting design where there's a micro USB ports that go on either side of the base so that it gives you more flexibility to pending on how you set it up it's easier to charge than setting up it up for the first time it's pretty quick you just download the free app Riley app from the Play Store or iOS store and afterwards you go into your phone settings and using Wi-Fi you connect to the Riley's Wi-Fi signal first afterwards you can open up the app and the app will tell you to then enter your home's Wi-Fi password so that the Riley connect to your router and then essentially be connected to the Internet and once it's done you'll be able to instantly see the image as well as to take videos and control it what's kind of interesting about this particular app though is that each time that you reopen it it asks you to re-enter your password it's not the most convenient thing but it is an added layer of security which since this is in security cam at the end of the day could be a good thing depending on your use you can add multiple Riley's if you purchase sets and in our case the default password is still set to one two three four so I'm just going to enter that again so again this is verification and it takes about 20 seconds each time to Rivera fie and then connect everything back into the Internet when the Riley is in its own charging / docking station you can still use the virtual on-screen controls but instead of having the motors actually move the wheels what happens is that the motor of the dock will spin round and round so it's essentially like a stationary or a regular security camera although it has 360 degree lens since the base can rotate through sixty degrees it's actually quite cool and of course you can change the angle of the lens by rotating kind of the head of the robot alright so a quick example of that it's a nice charging base right now you can see the wheels don't move but the actual motorized base moves when I spin it using the virtual on-screen on kind of jog dials here you can also see the image quality is actually surprisingly clean and crisp it's 720p it's not 1080p or 4k but really that's a good thing since it's not going to hog as much of your Wi-Fi access so the overall frame rates are still pretty fast and also it's pretty good in terms of the clarity I've seen quite a few security cameras over the years and this is definitely acceptable for most folks to use does get very bright and again I can use this to very easily change the angle of the dock so it's actually pretty cool you maybe even take some time lapse videos or even some fancy shots if you want to record video for and with this motorized dock it really is a cool little accessory and a trick and here I can change the angle of the lens you can see it's facing up and now it's facing down to toggle in two more things that you want to do such as such as the settings you just tap on the key over here that brings up a few features you can toggle the resolution for taking images and videos between low medium and high res depending on space you can take a look at your firmware you can also turn on facial recognition so it scans faces and once a face has been detected it will send you a notification same thing with motion detection there's also kind of the playback of media content that you've stored images locally or video files finally over here we can turn the infrared sensor on or off manually so you can see that does go into black and white mode but it makes everything still visible under low-light environments which is indeed a good thing finally I can also have it automatically stand back up so what this means is if the app bot has fallen down which is a very realistic problem it might look like this so the base is just reorienting itself right now what happens is if it's falling down I can tap on this key and it's going to try to jump and you can see that it's back up now so it's a pretty fun little trick either direction works even if it's falling flat on its own face and I tap on the jump key it's a realigns itself so it's a pretty cool robotic trick I know they probably spent a lot of time perfecting that a specific feature there's also audio so you can turn on the mic turn it off so you can hear what's happening in the room that the robot is in and communicates like a walkie-talkie with it and finally there's also the ability for it to tie in its own charging dock how it does that is there is an infrared light on the dock that it detects using the infrared sensor and after it gets close enough there are red LEDs that guide it visually onto the position of the dock which is pretty cool so I'm going to show you guys that next so let's just say it's facing the dock like so and I'm going to tap on the find dock function so again it's going to be scanning you can see that red dot up here which is showing up in the field of view of the camera essentially it's going to come closer and closer to the red dot and it's found the dot now the red lights are on it's going to realign itself and now it's charging now that's not to say that the app Riley is perfect there are a few occasional glitches that do pop up such as maybe the connection being lost to the internet so you have to turn over power it off and then power it on again and also in terms of the auto charging or the auto docking feature it has to at least find that infra red dot within its peripheral view so as you have to be within kind of a 1 meter range if the dock is in a completely different room it can't find that location so that's one limitation at the moment they did come up with a previous iteration model called the app bot link that had only a 3 megapixel sensor so at 5 megapixels this is already huge improvement as far as the overall resolution and the quality especially in a well-lit environment the app also tells you the battery status on the top as well and it's not a huge problem you know as long as you keep it within a closed area since it's always going to be near that charger as far as the performance of the battery is concerned it's really fun to play around with as you can see there's not too much lag between what you on screen of your phone or tablet and what happens with the robot I was just surprised with how well the wheels actually move as a robot I was thinking okay if you put this on carpet or something with more a softer material it's going to struggle with movement but actually it moves with great affinity and even if you put it on a slope or a slight schlampe it still pulls up so the motors here are quite strong and it can actually rotate 360 degrees and its own little circle if I tap on the same position and keep on holding it down you'll see why it just spins in this one position so it's pretty cute to play around with the ankle adjustments pretty sensitive easy to use it goes all the way up you can see all the way flipped to the ceiling and of course all the way down if you are looking at something smaller maybe a pet or something so it's a very easy to some final remarks about the functionality as a for mention there is a facial recognition mode where it not only recognizes faces and gives you a notification it can continuously track it so right now I have it on it's basically found my face and even if I'm moving my head around you know it's the sensor of the camera is following my head as it moves there's a box over my face in the apps display so it's almost going to follow people around if there's intruder and keep on just shooting their face to give you that video feed so it's actually very clever and a very interesting twist that I didn't really expect that it could do so well when it's in the facial recognition mode their facial tracking mode the jog dial Zoar the the ability for you to move it around manually it's disabled since it's going to be doing that automatically image phone two-way communication also does work as far as the microphone on here it's not the cleanest sounding mic in the world there's a bit of static in the background which is fairly common for these IP security cameras so audio quality isn't going to be crystal clear there's going to be some echo so maybe some noise cancellation by popping in two or three mics in the future could improve on that if they want to bring out a second generation model for the hardware but you know overall it does work if you want to communicate with someone in the house even though they won't be able to physically see you but you'll be able to see them finally I'm just going to talk about the video and the photo recording so you'll notice that the Apple Riley doesn't have a built in on kind of a micro SD card slot that you can expand memory or save it locally like the majority of almost all security cams I've seen and said if you take a video or take a snapshot it saves it on the phone's memory which is really great so it's basically online storage and you can use your phone memory to manage that or save it to the cloud it saves it as a folder by default and you can see it in the gallery both videos and images playback really well so that part also functions pretty decently so at the end of the day I have to say that the app Riley is quite impressive it claims to be the first robotic security camera and it's off to a great start there are a few limitations as far as the apps sometimes having a little malfunction of the Wi-Fi connection is weak I'm not too certain about setting up a password and re logging in every single time I launched my app whether that's too tedious or if it's actually a good security feature and again finding its base can be a little bit of a struggle at times but all-in-all the video quality is good and sub $200 it's not too expensive a lot of brand name security cams will be charging that amount anyways and you're getting a lot more functionality and a fun camera to play with anyways here at the same price so a good start and I think a job well done you can learn more information about the app pot Riley in our official written review but for now this has been our video thanks for watching here at OS reviews
