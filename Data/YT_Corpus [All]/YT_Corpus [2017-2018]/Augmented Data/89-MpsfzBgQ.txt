 When you look at the relationship between big data, architecture, and city planning we're starting to realize that having more and more data about the city that we're trying to develop really helps us to understand the way that we should actually approach designing that city. We can look at things like energy and energy clusters and where we might be able to save energy through a combination of which buildings are placed near each other, or centralized services. We can look at transportation networks and how we can really enable people to get around a city better. A lot of the work that I do, dealing with virtual reality or augmented reality, is basically taking a whole lot of that data and actually making it into an accessible and really understandable format, whether it's 3-D models, or you know different graphs, or what have you. Big data allows us to see how things are coming into play, make predictions, and better understand our world.
