 I am super passionate about science education. And, we found here that a lot of people don't really have a clear idea of what watersheds are. Even though our - We all live in a watershed. So, watersheds are important to all of us. We want kids to understand what they are and understand that how we take care of a watershed affects how healthy we are, affects how healthy the plants and animals in the watershed are. So, when I saw the sandbox for the first time I thought, this I want to play with this and I wanted work here. The sandbox combines the hands-on fun of a sandbox. We all love to play in the sandbox. Combines that fun with some really cutting edge technology that uses motion sensing cameras. Kind of like what you use for video games like in the Wii. And, it marries those two things together. What do you think this thing is in the middle? Volcano or we can make it rain right in the middle. It's a lot of rain and it floods over the side. Okay, did you have fun? Would you play in the sandbox again?
