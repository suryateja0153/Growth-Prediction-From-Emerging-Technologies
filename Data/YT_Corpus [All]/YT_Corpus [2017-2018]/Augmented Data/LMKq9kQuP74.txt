 [Music] in digital geology we bring the geological field trip into the office environment using exhibits of real geology like rock slabs course and fossils we combine these with digital overlays to provide hands-on reservoir characterization analysis underpinning key upstream business decisions this is done as various skills of geological analysis ranging from basin scale to grain scale each with their associated workflow and related upstream decision let me take you on a virtual tour along the various digital geology exhibits at Shell's Learning Center in Iraq in the Netherlands let's start with the basin scale exhibit at this scale exploration geologist analyzed the geological evolution of large sedimentary basins through time and the associated processes of hydrocarbon formation and trapping for this global data sets and plate tectonic reconstructions are used which show the development of depositional environment and plate movements through time which are crucial for the understanding of the development of Oleum systems and the formation of hydrocarbon reservoirs once a basin has been identified we zoom in further to the play scale at which we try to assess the various play elements like the presence of hydrocarbon charts reservoir development as well as the presence of seal and structure in order to arrive at the play map that defines how and where a play is likely to work this could end up in the decision to acquire a new acreage for example or to drill an exploration well once an exploration well has been drilled the newly acquired data like where logs cores and fossils are integrated with the seismic data at the environmental scale to interpret the depositional environment as this governs the overall reservoir architecture and therefore the fluid flow in the reservoir a range of conceptual geological models are constructed that provide guidance on what type of field development would be appropriate and whether further data acquisition and appraisal is required in order to arrive the robust investment sea once an economic field development has been established and more well data has been acquired it becomes important to predict in more detail the reservoir architecture and fluid flow away from the wells to optimize fuel developments this analysis is done at the facia scale exhibit for which dedicated fully court research file was drilled together with the University of Barcelona and Summa shape the acquired core data is linked through augmented reality with log data as well as core description and interpretation results force observes in certain dish to be captured in a range 3d subsurface models to underpin the field development decisions once the field has been in production for some time there are later field life decisions to be taken such as the choice of secondary and tertiary recovery scheme this requires a thorough understanding of the composition of the poor network fluid properties reservoir heterogeneity as well as porosity and permeability distributions this analysis is done at the grain scale at which small scale heterogeneity can be analyzed on both plastic as well as carbonate rocks lamps [Music] finally the results of the analysis at the various scales can be visualized and integrated in shells virtual reality center the iscope in this collaborative environment multidisciplinary teams can come together to jointly interpret and discuss the outcomes of the various analysis to arrive at a common understanding than the pinning effective business decisions the digital geology concept has proven to be an exciting new and innovative learning approach for our young professionals it also serves as a platform that promotes collaboration between the various disciplines within the company and provides a permanent exhibition of subsurface workflows and technologies the next steps are to acquire additional digital outcome data sets like drone footage and panoramic photographs to be included in the exhibits further enhancing the virtual experience watch this space [Music]
