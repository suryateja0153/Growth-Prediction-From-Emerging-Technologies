 The cubical represents a tyranny that confines your imagination and thoughts are confined to a small physical area. Imagine pretty much every software engineer or finance person being able to disconnect from their desk and look at holographic monitors on a beach and doing their work from there. that’s not going to be science fiction - it’s the modern office place. Silicon Valley is all about building the future. A startup called Meta thinks it’s getting there first, thanks to a big bet it’s made on Augmented Reality. How are you? Good, Thank you.  Welcome to Meta. Thank you. Call it a 360 degree office where you can spatialize your thoughts as part of your workflow for education, architecture, design, engineering, etc. People often mix up Augmented Reality with Virtual Reality. VR totally blocks your ability to see or hear the real world. AR overlays holograms onto what you already see. Meta has tried to make its version of the workspace feel familiar. You grab the hologram, instead of using a controller or a mouse and your brain already knows how to do it. In other words, we’ve designed an operating system that humanity has always known how to use. So you can see this eyeball, which is, by the why, photo-realistic. You can see my hand is including the eyeball and now the eyeball is including my hand. Right. See those two circles? They get small and then they turn into this glowing white ball and then I can move my hand around super naturally. I can do this with two hands and I can rotate the thing, I can stretch it. I can throw it back into the shelving system and that’s all you have to learn to become a modern worker. And to prove this, the employees at Meta have started to get rid of their computer monitors -- trading them in for Meta’s augmented reality headsets. Meron thinks it will be less than a decade before we'll all be wearing strips of glass that can project holograms.  In the early 80s, everybody had computers on their desktops but nobody was using them because they had a lot of work to do. So they were still using typewriters. At some point the CEO took all of the typewriters away and everyone was forced to use the computers so it’s very exciting to see a new generation of technology, a new paradigm. I consider us like pioneers in the holographic wild. I’m, you know, pulling up my browser with my hands and I’m sending out emails to my colleagues and just kind of really acclimating to the new environment.  Now you’re putting on my computer essentially. Our digital lives live on our phones they have all of our pictures and notes and things - so why don’t you write yourself a little sticky note. Go ahead and take your first right over the sticky note and close your fist. And now…. What?! Meta’s own transition to Augmented Reality has run into plenty of unexpected problems and it’s still gonna be a while before you’ll start to see these devices in YOUR office. But I think it’s a future worth waiting for. If we could see these holograms between us, we will have been able to share our work with one another more naturally, more efficiently and more productively than ever before. Humanity will have evolved slightly.
