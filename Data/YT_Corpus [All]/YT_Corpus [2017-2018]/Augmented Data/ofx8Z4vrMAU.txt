 [Music] welcome to second part of lecture 15 on graph theory today we will learn two basic concepts residual Network and augmenting path in a network with respect to a given flow these two concepts are important to find maximum flow in the network so I will start with residual Network first so we talked about this two basic concepts one is residual network and augmenting path okay so this residual network with respect to a given flow so consider an arbitrary Flo if in a network gee then the nest the residual Network denoted by GF has the same party sees as the original Network and one or two edges for each age UV in the original Network so I wrote this definition in the previous part also let me just repeat once more if the flow amount in the edge UV is strictly less than the capacity of the edge UV then there is a forward edge UV with capacity see if UV this is the capacity of the age forward is UV in the residual Network and that capacity is C UV - if you fee and the other condition is that if the flow UV is flow along the edge UV is strictly greater than 0 there is a backward edge with capacity see if the backward is is vu with capacity C if V u equal to F of UV well as I said that of course this is a very important concept I'll slowly explain the significance of this one also let me give an example to illustrate this one so I will consider this network this is the source node and these are the other nodes the sink node tea so there is an edge from s to a which has capacity 3 there is an edge from s to B which has capacity 1 there is an edge from B to C which has capacity 5 and an edge from A to C with capacity 3 C 2 T with capacity to B to D with capacity for D to e with capacity to e 2 T with capacity 3 so this is the Network G and I said that this residual Network concept it is with respect to a flow now let me just assign a flow here so I will send 0 and our amount of flow along from s to a 0 amount of flow from A to C and then from B is to B 1 the flow amount is 1 and B 2 C 1 C 2 T 1 and here B to D 0 D to e 0 e 2 T 0 now first we need to understand that this is a valid flow this is a valid flow because you can see that everywhere so this is the notation right if flow capacity so everywhere you can see that the flow amount is less than or equal to the capacity right so that capacity rule is satisfied now look at the conservation rule now you can see the amount of flow that is going to a is zero and the amount of flow going out of a is zero similarly if you look at the node C the amount of flow that is going into C is 1 and the amount of flow that is going out of C is 1 look at me the amount of flow going into B is 1 the amount of flow that is going out of B is also 1 so 1 plus 0 and similarly the flow conservation rule is true for D and E because the amount of flow going into D is zero and the amount of flow going out of T is also zero now just for if I remove this one by say if I put 2 then the capacity rule is true that 2 is less than equal to 5 but the conservation rule is not true because here you can see that the amount of flow that is going into B is 1 and the amount of flow going out of V is 2 2 plus 0 so the flow conservation rule is not valid so that's why you can't put 2 here I just wanted to clear such concepts so this is a valid flow okay so this residual network is is with respect to a arbitrary flow that means valid flow of course so now I will draw the residual network of the network G with respect to this flow okay so it says that the residual network GF will have the same set of vertices so the vertices are again is a B see tea D and E now it says that one or two edges for each edge in the original Network now in the original Network there is an edge from s to a so corresponds to this edge there could be one edge in the residual Network or if there could be two edges now see in this case there will be only one edge that is the forward edge since here if you can see that the flow is strictly less than the capacity so there is a forward edge UV with capacity 3-0 so there will be a forward edge from s to a with capacity 3 that's all and there will not be any backward is because the flow is no flow is zero flow is not greater than zero if the flow is greater than zero strictly greater than zero then only there will be a backward edge similarly from A to C this is very important I will explain why this is required why this residual Network is required at some point of time so there will be a forward edge because the capacity is strictly less than sorry the flow is strictly less than the capacity so there will be a forward edge with capacity C - if now look at this age SB so here you see that the first condition this condition is not true the flow is not strictly less than the capacity it is less than or equal to so there will not be any forward edge here and here you can see that the flow is strictly greater than zero so there will be only one so there will be a backward edge so in the residual Network let me draw the backward edge using a different color so there will be a backward edge from s to B with capacity with capacity equal to the flow amount that is one okay so the capacity is one now look at this edge BC so here you can see that the capacity is strict sorry the flow is strictly less than the capacity so there will be a forward edge with capacity 5-1 that is 4 and also there will be a backward edge because the flow amount here is strictly greater than zero so there will be a backward edge so I am drawing all the backward edge with a different color so there will be a backward edge of capacity one cut about CT so there will be of forward edge of capacity one right because the flow is strictly less than the capacity so there will be a forward edge of capacity 2-1 and there will be a backward edge of capacity one because the flow amount is one okay now for BD it is clear there will be only one edge that is the forward edge with capacity for 4b e there will be only one forward edge right and that is a capacity to and for e T there will be only one edge that is forward edge with capacity three and this is called the residual Network of this networks G with respect to the flow F okay so I hope that you understood what is residual Network next to talk about of augmenting path an augmenting path is simply apart from source is to think tea in the residual Network and this has a purpose whose purpose is to increase the flow okay so what I'll explain how an augmenting path increases the flow amount first let me find out augmenting path so here we can see that there is an augmenting path that means we have to find a path from s to T so that path could be there are many maybe but I can see that one path is s to a and then a to C and then C 2 T so the augmenting path here is is P let me denote this augmenting path by P so P is is a C T and now we talk about the capacity of this path so the capacity the path capacity of a part is the minimum capacity of an edge along that path so what do you want to mean by this one is that so here we took the path we took the augmenting path let me write here we took the augmenting path P to be is a C T so the path capacity which is denoted by Delta P is that you take the minimum of the capacity of a the capacity of a C so these are the ages on the path P and the capacity of CT okay so minimum of this three is equal to minimum of so the capacity of s a is three the capacity of AC is again three and the capacity of C T is equal to one so this is the path capacity is one so this is what the meaning of path capacity so what we do using this one is that by considering the augmenting path P in that example of course which is is a C T we can increase the flow we can increase it's the flow by delta p amount that is the capacity of the flow which is equal to one here unit as the path capacities okay so so once you have an augmenting path which is a path from the source to sink in the residual Network you compute the capacity of that path if the capacity of the path is 1 you can increase the flow amount by one unit so if you recall in in the first flow that we took there the flow value was 1 I didn't mention that I'll go back to that so now using this new this augmenting path we can augment one unit of flow in that network so that means we can increase the flow by 1 so the final flow in the network after augmenting this 1 unit of flow it will become the flow value will become 2 so we will understand this part now so let me just mention here so this is this was our residual network here you can see the flow what is the flow value here what is the flow value that we so he started with the flow and the flow value the value of the flow is 1 now using this augmenting path we can make the flow of this we can increase the flow by 1 unit that means the flow will become 2 okay so see we consider this path so that means we'll send one unit of flow along this path so the flow here will become instant we'll replace this 0 by 1 we replace this 0 by 1 and we replace this one by 2 so we can we are adding one unit of flow or we are augmenting one amount of flow with respect to this augmenting path so let me just draw the new flow now so I can move to our next page so increase the flow along the path P the P means the one we considered in the example increasing the flow along the path P with one unit yield the following Flo so what flow we get now is that this one so this is the source and the other part assists our a-b-c sink vertex D D and E so now here the flow value along is a it was zero before now it will become 1 so 1 and capacity is 3 so along AC the flow was zero before now it is 1 and the capacity is 3 along CT before it was 1 now it will become 2 and the capacity is 2 so SB it was one before now it is 1 and B see it was one before now also it is 1 and B D is 0 for de it is 0-2 and et it is 0-3 okay so we have increased the flow amount from 1 to 2 and the question is can we increase it further so we talked about the ford-fulkerson algorithm it says that when you have a flow in a network you compute the residual network and if you can find an augmenting path in the residual Network you can increase the flow in that case so that means so we have a new flow now and again we will compute the residual network with respect to this new flow and see whether there exists a augmenting path in the new residual Network ok so this is how the algorithm I will talk about the algorithm of course but this is sort of we are trying to explain the algorithm or sort of before stating the algorithm I am illustrating the algorithm so let me just compute the residual Network for this new flow with respect to this new flow and then we will stop so here the residual network with respect to this new flow is this one is the same set of vertices so the residual network this is the network G and the flow is given and this is my residual network so here as you remember there will be a forward edge with capacity to and there will be a backward edge with capacity one so AC there will be a forward edge of capacity - and there will be a backward edge of capacity one here there will be no forward edge because the flow is equal to the capacity so there will be a backward edge of capacity - and this is one so in this case for SB there will be a backward edge only of capacity one and for B see there will be a forward edge of capacity for and a backward edge of capacity one a capacity one and four B D there will be a forward edge of capacity for no backward edge for de there will be a forward edge of capacity - and for ET there will be a forward edge with capacity three so this is the residual network with respect to the new flow and in the next lecture we learn how to find maximum flow in a given network using the idea of residual Network and augmenting path thank you very much [Music]
