 okay thank you for the introduction and let me also welcome you to the afternoon session I'm going to present you some work I did together with my co-authors Sebastian azita Neal afar and Moe and Max and the title of the paper is cloud pets supporting conversations through augmented zero query search with the visualization let's get started so if we have a look at our everyday conversations casual conversations and also formal conversations we see that the existence of Technology and the existence of Technology in those conversations has changed the nature of those conversations we always have our smartphones around our tablets our laptops our smartwatches and we constantly play with them even during conversations with with someone and this often obviously has an impact on the on the nature of our conversations so what would we do reuse those smart devices for information retrieval so for clarifying facts for searching for related information and after we retrieve this information we use our devices to share this information with other persons that are in the conversation so we show around the website that we just found we show the nice cute new cat picture that we found on the Internet and of course this this change of the nature of the conversations through technology has good sides and depth the bedsides this this technology helps us to enrich conversations through additional content and sometimes there are situations where this information retrieval and information sharing really helps us in conversations because if you are planning some trip for example in situation you can check for prices for for sightseeing and things like that and this helps us as I said to enrich conversations but of course there are also bad things because if you constantly play with technology while you're in a conversation you need to switch your cognitive focus between the conversation on the one side and the technology and the process of information retrieval on the other side and this can of course hamper the flow of the conversation and sometimes people even favor the interaction with the smart device or the the information retrieval over the actual conversation that's a thing that is called sobbing from phone snubbing in the in the literature so for this work our focus was on how to provide conversation support so strengthen the good things that come from technology in conversations while helps you mitigate the problems that arise from that if we look at the industry there's one big topic today that everyone's really interested in and that is personal assistants like theory like katana like Google assistant like Apple Alexa and what all those personal assistants do is they use something that's called zero query search zero query search means that the system retrieves information without an actual search query so the system uses your context the the things that the system knows about you who you are where you are and those things to retrieve information that the system thinks is relevant for you in the current situation and pushes this information to you and if you transfer this idea of the Iroquois research from one person to multiple persons and to conversations you end up at something that's called ambient voice search and the idea behind this is that you have a system that constantly records what you are talking about in a conversation and does some some machine learning magic to extract topics of this and to provide additional information that is relevant to you so so it's not necessary for individual information retrieval but the system can do this for you I have two examples for this one is the inspiration wall by Andolini @r from the cnc 2015 they have system that supports brainstorming or gear generation sessions through recording what you're talking about and posting words or concepts that relate to this on a public display or similar example they a gear expander from magnet valve that also support brainstorming sessions through posting picture of stimuli so pictures that might help you in the brainstorming that are relevant for the context that you're talking about also on a public display so we found this concept of ambient or search very interesting and we were thinking about how can we move this from public displays to augmented reality and from a shared display for all users to personal displace and personal output that we can do using augmented reality and therefore we started with conducting an exploratory study to gain more insights into the design of such a system let me talk about this for a minute we started with individual semi-structured interview sessions with seven participants focusing on two main research questions the first one how can a system effectively support information retrieval in co-located conversations and what are the requirements for the user interface of such a system right the general that idea was that we asked our participants about their their memories their post positive and negative memories of using technology and of information retrieval and when it was necessary in different conversation scenarios and to stimulate this we asked them about different conversation scenarios that were different in terms of location objectives mood and relationship between the participants of the conversation we selected five the first one was a consultation so that's what we defined as a conversation between persons with different levels of expertise and different levels of information and understanding of a problem domain for example a medical consultation then we had a meeting scenario between coworkers so peers with the same level of experience and and information then we have the authority gradient which might be also a conversation scenario with the same level of information but with with different levels of information but with an additional authority gradient like situation with the instructor that teaches the trainee but we had informal talk which might be you talking to a friend at a bar perhaps and the last one we had different intentions which is a conversation between person with obviously different intentions something like a salesperson trying to sell you a new house or something let's have a look at the results from from what I found in the in the study we identified three main areas of results and categorize them as with for the user-interface let me walk through them shortly the first one is provide unsolicited in real-time service during the study we found that one of the major reasons for private information retrieval on smart devices is the shame of not knowing things people do not want to ask if they don't understand something that they think that they should know and this was one of the main reasons why they didn't just ask the other person who was talking about something but just took out their mobile phone and googled something some abbreviations some birds some countries things like that that's what we heard from the participants and as a second thing participant remembered a lot of situations where information was necessary to continue the conversation so they needed additional input and that led to persons taking out their their mobile phones looking at this information but while in the process of looking up this information slowly drifting away into the interaction with the device so for this the first requirement that we found is that a system should provide unsolicited and real-time service so provide the information when it's necessary and provided without the user without the user having to explicitly ask for the information as a second requirement we have supporting fluid transition and reengagement that's somehow connected to the last point of persons drifting away while interacting with the technology and retrieving information because participant old us that sometimes you're just so involved with the with the information and retrieving this information and reading things and look things that they felt at heart to come back to the actual conversation and they just didn't know what the current state of the conversation was what they were talking about so therefore we think that a system should provide means for them to easily come back to the conversation after the process of information retrieval at the third point we have selected sharing from the public private information spectrum and during the study we found that information into sharing is a very important point for for for users they as I said they want to share a share this new cat meme or something with you but in co-located settings they found it very complicated because how do you share information either you use some integrate sharing solution from your smartphone but you won't do this and the local in in a co-located setting in a co-located setting you usually just hand over your device showing the content to another person but this means you're not only sharing this special content but you're sharing the whole device and it's probably just one swipe away from that embarrassing picture from last night's party so we think it's important that you provide means for very easy and fast sharing of information and just small information bits so let's come to our system based on the results from the study and from the related work we created couplets our concept let's work into that we had two main design goals that were support and effective and fun information visualization to mitigate the challenges that we've talked about and support interaction with the retrieved information hearing conversations cloud bits is an augmented reality system for head mounted displays that supports users through small information bits - falling from the metaphorically cloud above the user these information bits appear based on the topic of the current conversation so it's for example if I'm talking about Brighton they might appear a map of pride in there might appear the weather of Brighton there might appear places for sightseeing just depending on the content of the conversation um this includes public information from websites as well as private information like from my personal emails my calendar my pictures something like that this private information is only visualized for me not for everyone else and I'm loud or I can share it with other persons later let's have a look so information is displayed as small information bubbles falling from the top to the bottom if I don't interact with them they will hit the ground and once they hit the ground they will disappear if I do interact with them however they are pinned to the last position where I've interacted with them so I can grab them move them around in the space put them somewhere all of this happens in a shared information space so the position and everything about the items is synchronized over over all the users so if I see something on the table over there some information you also see it on this table and when there is information sharing I realized this is an old picture here the information sharing is visualized as this small bubble on the right top and the newer versions that you'll also see in the video it's visualized as a colored background for the information that's whether it's private or shared and I said I can crap items and move them around in the space and the other person will see them on the position in the space I can pin them up in the items to positions in the space if I want or I need them for later access if I don't need anything anymore I grab it give it a little bit of acceleration and throw it away and it will disappear and if I want to access some information because in the beginning all of them are shy just showing something is to depict what's inside this bubble if I want to pop those bubbles and look inside I grab it and turn my hand upside down and open the content let's have a look at some videos because I think it's easier to understand as I said it's an AR application that we built using hololens let's have a look at the channel of things in the scene we're talking about as UI and where it is this year so some content related to this starts appearing so like a calendar entry and the weather from Brighton I might be interested in that so I crab it and keep it there and then I can interact with it for example I'm interested in the weather so crab it and open it open it yes and I can see the the content and it's better than I expected when going to the UK and I can remove things by just throwing them away and then we are sharing as I said this is the new version that has a colored background to indicate whether some information is private or shared this one is orange so it's private information and if I take it and move it to her I give it over to her and share it with her so she can also see the content and interact with the content let's have a look at the evaluation of ours we invited 12 participants to our lab and divided them in six groups of two participants each which chose two pairs with different relationships so work work colleagues close friends spouses and we focused on three research questions first if and how people leverage the surrounding space for acquiring and interacting with information second if and how cloud wood provides mutual awareness of activities and eases the re-engagement into the conversation and third if and our cloud which enables selective sharing from the private public information spectrum as we wanted to focus on the concepts and the idea behind that we opted to use a Wizard of Oz that he set up that means that we did not use an ambient voice search engine in the background to to transcribe the conversation between the participants and do all this machine learning stuff and extract the topics and so on but we had everything prepared and had two researchers sitting there and letting them up appear for the for the participants we chose this way because we want to focus as I said on the concepts and not on the technical implementation details what did the participants have to do their overarching goal always to plan a vacation trip to some city we did this two times for each pair for the smartphone for a smartphone condition and one for the condition the participants had four tasks first a Korean about departure date and length of the trip depending on their time and their calendars and things like that then for the selected time frame select flights then select the hotel based on your left over budget and allocation of the hotel relative to some sightseeing places and then as last one select restaurant for the first night based on the location left over budget and type of food they serve and then we additionally had one hidden task in which in both conditions we imposed one interruption because we told them there was some technical problem with recording they should wait for five minutes to find out how they reengage after this break into the into the conversation and let's have a look at the results so first thing is that we found that people actually use the available space the whole available space to interact with information and they all really liked it and when we had a closer look we found that one thing was we found overall participants or participant groups was that they build things that we called working zones and storage zones where they kept information so working zone where they actually have the information they were currently working at and storage zones where they kept information that they wanted to keep for later use not discarded and while we found those working in storage zones of all groups the actual layout of those zones was different so for example one time it looked like this having the information they were currently working on one side the storage zone number side for some it looked like this having the information you work with directly in front of you and the storage zone somewhere above sometimes the storage zone was just on the side the working zone between you sometimes it was two sides and we even saw this where the working information was basically ringing around the field of vision between you and the other person and this is the one thing that we also found for all the groups you don't want to have information or some augmented stuff between you and someone else when you're talking so and need to be one pop for eye contact even if it's complicated using today's head mounted displays if we add private information to this we found mainly two behaviors so one thing we found over all groups is that participants did not mix up private and public information private information was all the time separated most participants kept the private information in somewhere close to themselves out of the way of the discussion and we also saw that other participants move the information far away to the site but also don't mix up with the public information and the information that both of you are currently working with then regarding awareness and the mobile condition with we saw participants constantly asking for for updates from the other person what are you doing did you already see this can you show this to me things like that so a lot of overhead in the discussion about this while in the cloud would condition when we saw people trying to engage with the other person and talk to them they just had a quick look and saw what they are doing and if they were in the working on the same things as they were and then just directly started talking about the stuff the other one was currently doing you saw that the participants used this shared space and the shared space and the fact that information was appearing on the same position for all the participants of both participants here for very natural interactions between the participants so like look here or check this something like that there was very natural and the participants really like that regarding the support for real engagement [Music] so after this post break when we told them that there was some technical issues then they came back for the mobile phone condition they took them all that phone and we're like wait what was I doing and then they asked themselves and we're discussing and we did some of the work for for two of the groups while in the club its condition we found they came back had one look at the working zone and then directly continued with a with their discussion because they were back into the context regarding information sharing we saw that there are we found that people place themselves or locate themselves in the in the in the space to support the information sharing depending on the condition so and the mobile phone condition people most of the time set next to each other or for work colleagues at different places in the in the location but for sharing stood up walked over to the other person showed them the phone or if they were sitting next to each other all the time and they would just turn to the sides turn back and showed something so there were a lot of movement involved why for the cockpits condition so we didn't enforce any any positioning in the room the participants were free to sit wherever they want to place themselves wherever they want for both conditions in the club its condition we found that after playing two or three minutes with the system they arranged in some face-to-face setting and that supported our our means for for sharing and they yes and they they really liked it that's at least what they told us okay I'm running out of time thank you for being here thank you for listening to me and I'm open for questions [Applause] do you have to flip the the text was a individually at the point of view yes so the pointing of an image the pointing of a did that cause any problems so yes we're rendering all the information rotated towards each of the person so even though maybe the informations here it's related for me so I can read it for you you can read it no no we did not find any real problems with that because everything that we did was pretty pretty small and they only refer to the whole thing and not too details within that thing that then might lead to problems but that's nothing that we really saw but I can imagine this happening if you have bigger things and you want to highlight no sorry I was not allowed to bring the hololens did you notice any sort of issues when interact when the participants were interacting with each other in the cloud bits condition in terms one thing that came to mind when I was watching that you know if I have something in my personal space I may not be aware of it or forget about and I start referring to that and there we have no clue what I'm talking about because I'm pointing over here in space any yes one yeah I think the the thing that we realized most was people interacting with private information that the other one does not see this is strange if you see something someone just interacting here and he's doing something but you don't see what he's doing there so for the next version we have a like private display that just tells you he's doing something here and this is like an email but not what's the content of the email but just tells you there is something that interacting and that helps a lot in this situation so this is the thing that we saw the most [Applause]
