 It's story time again. Years ago, self-driving cars didn't exist. All we had was some driving assistance. We wanted autonomous driving but were worried about safety. Map aided driving, cameras and other sensors simply weren't enough. But it was solved by using a functionally safe GNSS system to complement the sensors. We could receive information from multiple global navigation satellite systems and guarantee the position of our car. GNSS data coupled with correction services and motion sensors gave us an accurate and reliable position. Together with the other sensors we got a guaranteed location at all times. Thanks to u-blox GNSS innovation safe automated driving became a reality. And we could live happily ever after.
