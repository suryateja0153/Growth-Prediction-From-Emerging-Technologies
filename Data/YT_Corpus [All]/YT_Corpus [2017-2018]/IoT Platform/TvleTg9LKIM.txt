 we have here Windows 10 IOT core based wearable so this is design for industrial applications so it's not for consumers it's more for using on the shop floor using a different types of scenarios like hotels like grocery stores where you want to track your employees and messages to the employee it has all the beauty what you have what you get if you built an application builds on with based on Windows 10 so you have all the security features when you talk to the cloud you get the TPM functionalities you get everything what you expect from a secured device so this makes it also usable like in really industrial applications where you one don't want to use your own devices or use an standard Windows Phone for example or a mobile phone in general or in most cases you lock down the application two hours ease the device to one single application to one use case so this one is actually one application from a partner from us as a company called home act which is producing boot manufacturing machine and they're using this application to monitor their machines and send information directly to the workers on the shop floor so they can if something goes wrong or if they just have to affect the the machine with you supplies and they can get informed and use this instead of I think pulling out of a smart phone or something or another device there's also different types of devices so you can run different applications so everything as it is Windows 10 IOT core you can leverage all the application platform so you can use the camera interface as you as you know it from Windows Phone or from big windows we have NFC in it we have GPS in it and also you can install every Universal Windows app application on this and even if you install it from the store and if you provision the device correctly you can actually leverage all the store functionality as well audio interfaces in it we have different vendors in it there come two different flavors so with camera without camera we are also versions where we have a heart rate monitor also most important is as it is designed for industrial applications we are having different requirements to customer device consumer devices so this is ip67 so you can actually wash it you can disinfect it if you want you can remove the bands you can wear it different ways so there is a handheld way of wearing this there is a wristband and there there might be other your variant as well so it's actually available as samples today and because it's running Universal windows apps you can actually start developed right now and you can even use other devices to check performance or something like a dragon board or something which comes as our standard IOT core platform and then just porting this to the device it's very simple it will just run both in most cases you
