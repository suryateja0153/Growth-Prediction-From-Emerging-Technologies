 [Music] this is John John is 200 years old confused and lost 100 years ago he started building an IOT product but as you can see he's still working on it are you doing John there are many makers developers and hobbyist waste a lot of time money and energy building an IOT product going the traditional way to build such a product is boring cumbersome and most of all tough so what should people like John do they should get this sorry this this is bold an IOT platform that lets you control or monitor things over the internet with bold it's just a few steps connected sensors or actuators to bold write a short code visualize the data or control your devices over the internet [Music] my bike tells me it's using too much fuel and I better get it serviced my plants tell me they're not getting enough water or sunlight so what bolt basically does is that it collects and visualizes necessary data for monitoring for many of the sensors you can also remotely operate and things like a robot and run machine learning algorithms to predict its battery health over time and replace it before a breakdown suppose you wanna know how efficiently you run every day or keep a track of it on a daily basis you can do this either by taking note or by developing a simple monitoring or control system using bolt [Music] Boult is a completely integrated platform the board app identifies a chip when it's powered on and connects it to the Internet network you've setup it then establishes a secure connection with your cloud account and notifies you once it's completed the cloud dashboard lets you create products in just two steps all you need to do is configure your hardware and write a code to either monitor the data from your sensors or controller device the platform's open API is let you add your own tools to the dashboard and connect it to different apps for your own unique project the cloud lets you receive notifications of critical events and with a single click lets you run machine learning algorithms to predict future data or to even detect anomalies in your machines and prevent a failure well ahead of time the platform is language independent and lets you work with any of your favorite coding languages this helps you save time and avoid unnecessary complications and the best part is the most economical IT platform available bolt is applicable in large-scale industries as well you can integrate bolt with your heavy duty machines like this this this also and this and ensure they are performing at their optimum level but simply bolt is where all over is to build an IT product or project come to an end so as you see the possibilities are limitless whether you want to monitor your own performance or the performance of your products whether you are a businessman a developer or a maker whether you from the banking industry FMCG industry or the automobile industry both will save you naught of time and effort and we want you to be part of this revolution with Pohl we're launching bolt now on a crowdfunding campaign so support us and help us to get bold to you as quickly as possible you [Music]
