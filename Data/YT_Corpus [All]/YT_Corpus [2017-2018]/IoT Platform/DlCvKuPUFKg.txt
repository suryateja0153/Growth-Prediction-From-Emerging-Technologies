 Internet of things is a breakthrough technology that connects various devices to internet and make them smart & efficient. In this course, you will build an IoT based smart water monitoring system that collects data about how much water is being consumed and sends the data to the cloud for storage and analysis. As a part of this course you will use a water flow meter to collect data on water flowing through a pipe and ESP 8266 WiFi module will send the data to the cloud. You will also an Arduino board and program it to coordinate between the flow meter and ESP 8266. You will then use ThinkSpeak IoT analytics platform to analyse the data to show results in visual format. The course runs on Skyfi Labs Learn-Do-Review methodology which ensures that you learn the technical concepts in addition to building the project with your own hand using the kit. A topic like IoT can only be learnt by building project and Skyfi Labs makes the process super easy for you. Kit will be shipped to you within 24 Hrs and you can complete the course within 1 week from anywhere on earth and earn a certificate. Using Skyfi Labs you will not only build the IoT projects with definite output but also learn the concepts involved in it. So you can attend and crack interviews with confidence.
