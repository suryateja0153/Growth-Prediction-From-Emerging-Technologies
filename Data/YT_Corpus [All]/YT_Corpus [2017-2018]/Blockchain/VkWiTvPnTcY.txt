 hey guys welcome back to my channel and today we're going to talk about miracle trees we're going to discuss what Merkle trees are how they work and why they are so important for a blockchain why do we use Merkle trees and blockchain and last week I've asked you to suggest names for for the plant and VI Alencar suggested Merkle tree and he got 17 likes which is why this is the winning suggestion because it's got the most likes and so from now on this is a Merkel tree ladies and gentlemen and this is why I wanted to talk about what Merkel trees actually mean and how they work so let's get into guys but because this is very we have a very bright Sun today I'm afraid I'll have to move you to table otherwise my visual aid won't work so guys here is my computer right so let's start by talking about what Merkle trees do and why we have myrtle trees so basically a miracle tree is a data structure and in this data structure it is very easy to verify the validity of the contents in the structure so let me give you an example guys let's imagine that we have four values a b c and d and because we talked about blockchain and because we talked about bitcoin so much on this channel let's imagine that a is a transaction b is a transaction see the transaction and these also a chat a transaction so we have four transactions and let's imagine that this is these already trans transactions in a block so ABCD are transactions in a block and one issue we get is that in order for all the nodes to validate the transactions it will it would require a lot of computational resources and storage and so on so we don't really want to to send all of the transactions in all of the blocks to every client because guys think about what if we have a mobile app which uses the blockchain it would be unviable for us to send all of the transactions to that app so we need a way to validate these transactions without actually sending all of them so how can we do that well we can do that by using hashes so we have our transactions here again a b c and d and now we hash a and B together and we get a unique number a B so this would if we hash a and B we would get a number but now we just write a B so a B is this unique number we get by hashing the hash of a and hashing the hash of B and hashing them together will get a unique number a B and we do the same thing with C and D so we hash C and we hash D and then we had those two hashes together and so we get C and D which is also a unique number and then we hash these two unique numbers together and get a another unique number which is ABCD and this is the miracle root and this is the miracle tree all of it so why is it so useful well if we would change a single bit in a or b or some transaction if only one single bit would change in for example a B let's take B as an example if I change a single bit and B this unique number a B would be completely different guys that is a beauty of hashes if I change a single bit in annual of a and B this 8 number a B would be completely different and have no resemblance to the original a beam and if these changes then of course the hash of this and this would be completely different and we would get a complete completely different Merck merkel root so yes as you can see this is very tamper proof a technique because if someone would go back in the blockchain and say that in this transaction C I received a million Bitcoin well then the hash of CNG would become different because now instead of maybe maybe you receive 10 Bitcoin but you say that you received a million so instead of 10 it would be a million here in C and this would produce completely different number here C and D and then in turn these two numbers would result in a whole other hash so this is why it is so important we can validate transactions lie by just having a part of the miracle tree so for example in order to validate a we only need the this branch we don't actually care about this branch so if a client wants to validate the validity of transaction a it would only require a part of the entire Merkel tree namely it would only require this branch and it wouldn't really care about this branch at all and as I mentioned before this is a temper and a temporary data structure it is very hard it's well it's impossible to change something and do it in such a way that other nodes in the blockchain will not notice the tampering and that is why it is so important guys and that is what we mean when we talk about miracle trees it is a data structure where we hash the where we have a base layer of different data so it could be Bitcoin transactions like this or it could just be numbers or files I mean a file systems use miracle trees so this is not only not only used by block chains this is also used by for example file systems so we might have four different files and then we hash two files together and two files together here and get a root and so we can use this root as a verification that all of this data underneath right all right all of this data underneath is actually valid and that is what miracle trees are you what do you think I am personally very impressed with hashes I think they are really really cool that you can take two two numbers well basically you can take one piece of digital information and another piece of digital information which is and I mean any digital information information is just a number because you can always express it binary and every binary string is a number so you take these two numbers and you can hatch them together into another number and if you change anything in any of these two original numbers it would be completely different and when I say number of course I mean it could be anything it could be pictures it could be movies it could be Bitcoin transactions because everything that we have in our computers are basically numbers a movie can be expressed as a string of one and zeros and of course it would be a number because it's a binary number so I personally find them really really exciting and it's a very innovative approach that Satoshi invented that you could use this as a as a ground Jose as a foundation for the blockchain technology and Bitcoin and so in a block we usually don't store all of these hashes we usually only store the and the miracle root of the transactions because we want to save space I mean another aspect of hash functions is that these numbers a B C and E they can be gigantic maybe they are several megabytes in length while the hash of two such numbers would be much much smaller and usually hash is a fixed size number or fixed length so if we have several megabytes here this would only be I'm not sure exactly how large this would be but it will be substantially smaller and then we hash these two together they would be the same size as here because all hashes are basically the same the same length but completely different values of course so that's it guys that was a miracle tree I hope you learned something and thank you once again VI Alan Carter for suggesting the name for the plant and if you are a new viewer guys and you like blockchain technology you like Bitcoin blowy theorem yeah all of all of this exciting blockchain take you should definitely subscribe to the channel guys because you will find it interesting I myself am a software developer and and I'll see you guys in the next video have a good one
