 [Music] hello and welcome back to - school I'm your teacher Amanda B Johnson and as you will recall we last left off talking about the digital ledger that is called a blockchain and how it is used to record changes of ownership among people we ended with the questions who gets to make updated entries into our emoney ledger when do they get to make them and why should anybody trust that the updates that they make are accurate and all of those questions can really be summed up under one heading security what is the security model of a blockchain to understand that we first need to conceptualize how a blockchain is run to begin with and that is via a network using the Internet the basis of the network is people keeping copies of the blockchain on their computers and they are connected to one another via the internet Irina in Russia communicates to Chen in China communicates to Joe and Australia communicates to Harry in Hawaii communicates to Carrie in California Maria in Mexico Larry in London and hundreds or thousands more people across the world looking something like this you get the general picture and the purpose of this network is for all participants with a copy of the blockchain to agree on the state of that blockchain at any given time for example a situation like this in which Chen's copy of the blockchain reports that I have three monies but Marie's copy reports that I have 47 would cause a total chaos and would be of no use to anybody whatsoever so the state in which all or the majority of the network agrees on the same versions of the blockchain is called consensus and it is from consensus that a blockchain running network achieves most of its security so back to our example of chin and Murray having conflicting copies of the blockchain a big no-no useless for everybody how do we prevent that from happening and keep consensus about who owns what I'm gonna talk a little bit of computer science to you right now but don't even worry it's not a big deal the mechanism used to maintain consensus on who owns what at any given time is called proof of work and that just gives us a fancy way of deciding who gets to make an update to the ledger and when see the primary goal here is to not have both chen and marie broadcasting conflicting versions of our blockchain at the same time we gotta have one or the other so which is it going to be Chen's version or Murray's version using what's called proof of work mining and I know it's weird that I would use the word mining but you'll see why in a moment we can maintain consensus so back to a stripped-down basic version of our network right what we don't want is two different people with copies of the ledger making an update at the same time we want only one update to the ledger being made at a time which everyone else can then take a moment to agree with and incorporate the update into their own copy of the blockchain this is achieved using specialized computers called miners here's what one looks like yeah they really are weird-looking specialized computers the computer code computer code looking something like this that makes our blockchain possible contains a math problem to be solved seems kind of silly when I say it out loud but I'm not kid the computer code has a self-adjusting math problem that these mining machines are built to solve and the difficulty of the math problem is set to increase as the number of miners on our blockchain network increases and all this fancy mumbo-jumbo is done to ensure one thing that only one miner solves the math problem at a time and that it happens consistently every few minutes and what happens when a miner solves the math problem well two things happen actually first is that he gets a reward of newly-created coins on the blockchain yes I am not kidding newly created coins on the blockchain are paid to the miner who solved the math problem as a reward for proving his work and secondly he's the one who gets to create the next block or in other words he's the one who gets to publish the next update to the ledger containing all of the transactions that happened in the last few minutes and thus it does our blockchain which is a chain of blocks keep perfect record of every transaction that's made the time that the block was published and the total number of coins that exists including the increase of coins as the miners were paid in new coins as their reward as an example 1,000 coins then one thousand five then one thousand ten and on and on in this way our money supply as recorded on the blockchain can be considered open and honest in other words it's viewable to anybody this also means that inflation aka the new money created is both transparent and predictable though currencies like - will not be inflated forever but that's for another day what you need to know now is these accounts they're not actually tied to your name that wouldn't work at all accounts on a blockchain actually looks something more like this long alphanumeric addresses which are actually longer than these are totally unique and you can own as many of them as you like what does this mean what is this witchcraft well it's based on a form of math called cryptography actually and you are totally smart enough to understand it so hop on over to Episode three to see how cryptography allows us all to have accounts on a blockchain cryptography is a form of mathematics that provides the basis for how different accounts on the blockchain interact with one another so that whole public address private key thing the stuff that's mostly managed by your wallet that's the cryptography bit see I told you it wasn't that hard
