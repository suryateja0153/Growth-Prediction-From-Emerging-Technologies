 Salam Alikom Wa rahmat allh Wa barakatoh This is Rami Baik and this is Just Info Blockchain that was the reason behind the cryptocurrency what is it and how it works ? revelotionary technology that might change the current exchanging system specially the the way of transferring the money and surely it has many deferent applications  but today let us focus on transfrreing the ownership and let me explain what is the blockchain in a simple way i just want draw to your attention that todays video is not a technical todays video is a simple video for those has no technical background to give them the chance to understand what is the blockchain that they will be in need to use it soon and i will not talk about the Bitcoin or the Ether or any other cryptocurrency  and to understand what is the blockchain i will use a simple examples to have an overview on how the blockchain works and how we would benifet from the blockchain simple if the people does not start using the blockchain in our countries a huge gap will be created between us and those who are using it Suppose that you have person A wants to transfer money to B in other country Person A has to take his money and use a third party trusted entity like a Bank so it has to be centralized transaction a third party entity will do it in his behalf Person A give the Money to the third party and the third party give it to Person B and this is called centralization in addition to that transaction will take time and will be a remittance fee might be high or suppose you want to sell a land belongs to you for any one you have to go to the registration department and transferring the ownership should be done there and this might take couple of days and this is also called a centralization so this is the normal routine we are all using on daily bases so what does the blockchain has to do with that and how it helps suppose that all people are connected to the network and all their money are registered in one open ledger and this ledger is available on the network for all to be seen so everybody in the world registered their balance into this ledger only one ledger  and all has access to it and to see what in it for example if i have 10 USD and these 10 USD are registered and X has 10 USD registered un the same ledger Y has 300 Million USD also registered in the same ledger and all can access this ledger and see whats in it and if i have a 100 USD i want to transfer a 10 USD from my balance to anybody else i do a transaction that Rami wants to send Mohammed 10 USD out of his 100 USD balance if Rami balance does not have the 10 USD everyone will reject the transaction Saying this transaction can not be done since Rami Does not have enough balance or you have a property you want to transfer the owner ship of it to some one else you send a transaction over the network that i want to transfer the ownership so other people know that you dont have the ownership for this property and this property is not registered under your name in the ledger so you will not be able to do the transaction or if its under your name , people on the network will authorize the transaction to be done then ownerships will be transferred to the new owner and it will be registered as new transaction in the ledger so a question would be come to your mind that every one will know that how much Bill Gates has ??? because i said that everyone will know every thing in the ledger so all can know what everybody else has in the ledger answer is yes, but not exactly what happen , that every one will have a wallet and this wallet will have your real information and will has another name "Fake/Public" to be used in the ledger and no one can link your real name with the fake one and both your real name and fake one are only connected in your wallet so if you want to do any transaction to be registered in the ledger you will use the fake/public name so people will see the fake one and instead of Rami they might see XB has a property so no one can know who is XB and the only one who knows is is Rami because inside your wallet Rami is linked to XB so you will be able to see all records registered in the ledger but not under the real names but for fact you will know each one transactions and because of that ledger and all knows each others what they have so no need to use a third party to do a transaction to authorize it since all see every thing and no one can cheat where any transaction has to be confirmed by the other people connected to the network by looking into the ledger and this is eliminate the need of having a trusted third party entity (centralized) because the people connected to the network will be responsible on confirming or rejecting the transaction and this is Called the Open Ledger everyone can see whats in it so what if Hacker comes and change all data in this Open Ledger this is a potential risk and here where the blockchain shows or you can call it the Public distribution ledger what does that mean ? instead of having on ledger seen by all each one of the network will have his own copy of that ledger and all transactions are reordered in all copies so all will have the same copy of the ledger so if Rami wants to do a transaction this transaction should be broadcasted for all to see the records to validate this transaction with the actual registered transaction and to check the validity if the transaction if its valid they will confirm it and if its not it will be rejected i just want to mention something people connected to the network will not have a physical copy of the ledgered they will have a computers with a special software installed to do the validation and if the transaction confirmed then all ledgers in with the all will be updated with the new record and it will be kept with everyone so if the hacker wants to change any thing he has to access all computers and to do the changes ledger by ledger which is impossible lets summarize everyone will have his own copy of the ledger with all transactions and balances and know one knows the real names of the owners but you can see that XB person has this amount of money or this property so if person wants to to do a transaction and to send a money to someone else this transaction has to go thru two main steps first to be validated by the others then either they accept or reject based on the ledger Next a new records will be recorded in this transaction of its accepted without the need of going to a third trusted party so no need to use the bank to give it money and ask the bank to transfer it to someone else you will do it direct and people on the network which they dont know you and you dont know them will either confirm or reject and a certain amount of transactions will be reordered in one block and this block will be connected to the next and pervious one and these connected blocks called a Blockchain again this is not tech Video thats why i did not talk about the mining or hashing or anything related to the technology i spoke bout the concept itself to simplify it i just finished todays video if you like it please dont forget to share like and comment and if you dont like it its your call and if you watch this video on youtube appreciate subscribing to the channel and to turn on the bill notification sure you have many questions in your mind just put them in the comments and will try to do another video to answer them thank you and wish you all the best , see you next Satudday in Sha allah
