 hereas CEO and Founder Patrick Byrne the strategy made him so successful you've found Bitcoin and blockchain religion and now he's looking to sell his multibillion-dollar business as he starts a new venture with this man the world-renowned Peruvian economist Hernando DeSoto both here in a fox business exclusive great to see you this is interesting I remember how you took so much flak back in 2014 of people said that guy we knew was crazy he's even crazier that he's accepting Bitcoin again I guess it turned out well for you it's we've made a few shekels it's worked out for us a few bit chuckles so but you know when we started taking Bitcoin I said back then four years ago this the main event of Bitcoin ain't Bitcoin it's this thing called blockchain we're gonna change the world with blockchain which is a ledger that tracks Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trades exactly it's the invention it's the it's the invention that lets Bitcoin be possible and all these other cryptocurrency is this thing called blockchain that's the real innovation and we realized we can change the world with that we can create a version of Wall Street that no one can cheat we create a monetary system that's frictionless but most importantly and I said this four years ago there's this crazy Peruvian economist who has an idea of how to end global poverty someone has to take this idea and build someone has to take his ideas and build them on the blockchain and you have this idea explain to our viewers out there what this idea is it involves very poor people in third world countries who live on property and in essence owned it but they don't have proof of that ownership what do you do with that to solve world poverty well a little bit what the United States did during the 18th and 19th century is recognized that there were they are documented properly so not only fulfills the function of giving you a home but a guarantee for a credit an identity the possibility of converting it into cash as an investment limiting liability putting boundaries around it setting settling problems through law rather than violence the thing is that with blockchain would took you United States as you went in your manifest destiny towards the West and it took you 150 years to get your act together the gold rush and all these things with blockchain we can do it in five ten years and it can unleash you say a trillions of dollars Patrick to the point where you have now built this gigantic business overstock.com you've traveled the world you beat cancer when you were almost gone I've known you a long time I've been through all this mishegoss let me tell you much sound and fury signifying nothing no no that you can sell your business which you say you want to do and move on to help DeSoto here but but who any buyers for this before listen I'm not sure I'm gonna sell it I should be clear we have we did make clear a few weeks ago we started a process hired Guggenheim there are a lot of brick-and-mortar companies and other companies who are freaking out about about this big Seattle Walmart I would think would want to buy you I'm not gonna speculate but there are lots of those kinds of people that were were one stop check to solve it on the other hand there are also some large funds especially in Asia but a couple in the United States an equity major private equity are there going private or large strategic so you'd consider that I would consider I'm probably 50% thinking we should probably solve the problem for brick-and-mortar I'm 30% thinking we should take a large strategic investor and I'm 20% thinking go price if we have the right company to go private with someone who can bring something to the party and not just write a check but can I'm spread very thin now between overstock retail and 10 blockchain companies of which is the most important I need some help i oughtta have to sell something off and capitalize this or I need a company like Bain or somebody like que quieras away who can actually help in across this huge tableau of investment as we finish up Fernando your biggest dream with this partnership you have the biggest dream is that what works in the United States the most successful prosperous and probably democratic country in the world should be extendable to the rest of the universe and we can do it with your technology it's a question of simply of remembering what you did in the 18th and 19th century and with technology we can shorten the whole project I've learned anything is possible with Patrick because Patrick is the entrepreneur see it one last question sure would you let Buffett buy it Warren Buffett your good friend there's an interesting question well he does have about eight furniture chains I remember and I can solve all his problems I went I'd rather Buffett get involved Buffett and DeSoto and I could all right I gave you the idea I want credit for that this is the honor of my life too I'm gonna give everything else up if I have to implement than suck this man's ideas in the blockchain Hernando de Soto and Patrick Byrne the one and the only let me tell you
