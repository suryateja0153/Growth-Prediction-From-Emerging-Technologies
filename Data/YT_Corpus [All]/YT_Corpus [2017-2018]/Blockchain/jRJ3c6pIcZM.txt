 [Music] case hello everyone welcome I didn't expect this many people actually is more than 50 people right now and I'm happy to see a gender balance as well I usually do some YouTube videos and I'm very active on Twitter and most of my subscribers and followers are like 95% males so it's really good to see a balanced here I'm very happy today you're going to talk about basically introduction to Bitcoin and blockchain when these guys here and start posted the Facebook event it was around $5,000 as you can see around seven thousand three hundred and thirty six dollars right now maybe we can refresh and see what surprise is actually let's do that two hundred forty four so it's went down hundred dollars as you can see it's a very very volatile market so it's very dangerous to enter and it's very risky to do trading in this market so just to start with if you trade it so it's on your own risk I'm not giving you here any trading advice okay so what we will do this month we will talk about what is Bitcoin everybody hears about it everybody talks about it these days it's become very mainstream and we'll talk about what is Bitcoin I'll tell you I'll show you a couple of videos and I will reference this guy quite a lot unrest on altona poulos he's like one of the pioneers in cryptocurrency and Bitcoin scene and he's a Bitcoin maximalist as we can say so I've read a couple of his books and our reference to his books a few times so and you'll go to what is blockchain technology and what's the cryptocurrency what is a wallet and what is Italian I will touch a terraeum very very small ID won't go in detail in its all introduction so we won't go any in detail but if you go to the next slide we can see many people line up behind when to buy and when to sell so it's most people they want to know if they can if they should by now or if they should by later or they should sell later but what people are missing is understanding Bitcoin you hear a lot of people talking about how Bitcoin is used with criminals it's yeah it was used with criminals and we'll get to that and we'll talk about why it was used with criminals and but we will try to understand it coined today and instead of finding out if I should buy now will I be a millionaire in a year I mean possible who knows but possibly not as well okay so it's the first decentralized digital currency created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and the bitcoins birthday was actually last week so the price jump was on bitcoins birthday so what happened was it was about 5,000 and it was actually considered they say they considered in u.s. they're going to cause the Bitcoin of the features investment so it will be probably regulated hopefully soon I'm not sure but it will be considered that so many big companies can buy into Bitcoin and invest so you can see JP Morgan have bought in Bitcoin and a few other companies I can't remember right now so maximum 21 million bitcoins going to be mine by 2150 I think around that that year so what that means is Bitcoin is not created by just some random people writing on their computer it's actually mined we won't get into mining you can search on Google what is mining it's about its I will just basically say mining is a few a lot of computers getting together and trying to solve mathematic algorithms and mathematic problems and as a result of their so solving the algorithms and problems they get bitcoins rewarded so one block gives around 25 bitcoins so at this rate I'm either when you can calculate how much it makes for work current value I when I was doing it with 6,000 and you can see cap 7,000 so let's watch a little video and understand what is what is Bitcoin bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency bitcoins our default quality they sent me dinner compared to other alternatives bitcoins have a number of advantages the coins are transferred directly from person to person via the net without going through a bank or clearinghouse this means that the fees are much low you can use them in every contact your account cannot be frozen and there are no prerequisites or arbitrary let's let's look at how it works several currency exchanges exist where you can buy and sell bitcoins for dollars euros and more your bitcoins are kept in your digital wallet on your computer or mobile device sending bitcoins is as simple as sending an email and you can purchase anything with Bitcoin by individuals called miners miners are rewarded you'll be generated bitcoins for verifying transactions after transactions are verified they are recorded in transparent public ledger the coin opens up a whole new platform for innovation the software is completely open source and anyone can review the code bitcoin is changing finance the same way the web changed publishing when everyone has access to a global market great ideas flourish bitcoins are a great way for businesses to minimize transaction Peaks it doesn't cost anything to start accepting them as you said there are no charge great website you should check it out if you have any questions they will probably find answers for you yeah when he talked about criminals and they it was used for money laundering and drugs hits bands child pornography and it's true but if you think about it why was it used by criminals I can say maybe it's because of wonderful technology I mean it has been invented this way criminals always use like how do you say technology that has come but not many people use them for example cars criminals used cars as part of their getaway vehicles you know they they try to run away from cops in this case so Bitcoin matured in the dark web deep web when people they had the Silk Road signal got shut down US government seized a few million bitcoins and then they sold them in auction I mean they probably said no but yeah I mean people thought cars were ridiculous back in the day when they were riding horses you know a lot of people are complaining that Bitcoin is used for bad things but it's mainly because we don't have many for much information we don't have the infrastructure we don't have the regulations I mean it's so new it's only nine years old no no and there's no experts you to be an expert you need around ten thousand dollars if you have read this book I forgot the name I think it's out loud or something did ten thousand I don't think there's anybody that has studied Bitcoin for ten thousand dollars so it's still the beginning it's still a very very beginning of a revolution I would say I mean imagine from riding horses to driving cars what people thought you know people thought this is crazy look at this was the wheel you know and then look at what you're driving right now what kind of wheel your car has so Bitcoin is at this stage I think you know maybe evolved a little bit further maybe it's been smooth and a little bit more but actually there's a debate going on not a debate actually it's like fight going on right now it's called segment 2x which is an attack on Bitcoin they're trying to change bitcoins what's it called megabytes so amount of transactions that it can like consensus if you guys and understand consensus so it's try they're trying to change the megabyte size from one to two but by doing that they want to control around 51% of bitcoins mining hash rate so that that gives them the opportunity to actually change the blockchain you'll get to that later it's a little bit more deep I won't go much deeper but you can search segments 2x on Google and find out about so money as all these civilizations you know we use money we use Bart Lee did barters I mean we use gold silver and at Maternity coins be used coins then we turn into paper money paper money start becoming obsolete I don't know how many people uses paper money here I I don't have any paper money on me many people use credit card is a and it's going to change into digital currencies I strongly believe in them because it's called money up to people because nobody controls your money when you go to the bank for example if you ask for two hundred thousand crona's of your money in cash they probably won't give it to you because they will say you need to make an appointment you need to get this you need to tell us why you need the money blah blah blah you know so it's not really your money unless you have it facts about Bitcoin it's digital but cannot be copied so it's quite secure with strong cryptocurrency cryptography sorry no trust needed is all verified by the miners so when you send a transaction it usually if you send a transaction to an exchange where you want to buy and sell bitcoins it's usually takes three verifications from your side by miners and three verifications from the other side by - so these used to be minimal they're getting a little bit more expensive that's why they want to change the structure of which coin it sometimes it costs there are six dollars it used to cost around 1 cent 2 cents 10 cents so it's the fees are getting higher because miners can see there is so much demand so they say if you're not gonna do the small piece because of the big fees it's very easy to use it's decentralized which means no bank no middleman nobody needed to use a Bitcoin you can only have your phone cell phone and transfer money it's your friend between a few minutes actually takes about 20 minutes there's other digital currencies that that are very instant like litecoin or - you can see it from that side this is how the crypto how the Bitcoin transaction worst works you can see someone's has a transaction it's gone through this computer of non hands nodes there's well the tation verified transaction and then goes down to all the transactions create a data block of ledger so it's like a distributed ledger you know in banks they have Ledger's but you can't really see them but with with walk chain and Bitcoin you can see where you sent the money I mean they say it's anonymous but it's not really on this is called pseudonymous so you can't see who it is but you can see where it is going so you can't follow the money and then the new block is added onto the block blockchain basically and then the transaction is completed so you can see up to nine years so I think hunt is currently the blockchain of Bitcoin is around hundred fifty gigabytes of data in there something like that hope I'm not wrong yeah blockchain is like the fourth Industrial Revolution you can call it it's an undeniably ingenious invention the brainchild of a person or a group of people known by the sadhana me Satoshi Nakamoto nobody knows who this person's nobody knows if it's a person or if it's a group or if it's the government nobody knows there is a few conspiracy theories who it could be who it cannot be but we really don't know and what he said in around 2011 I think he was very active until then from 2008-2011 and he wrote last thing he wrote on the internet was I have moved on to other things so and I just dropped it like that and there is still about a million bitcoins in his account you can see it and not touched so we don't know what's gonna happen if those bitcoins in the future and plus a thing with Bitcoin this digital is scarce so like I said is 21 million and if you send your Bitcoin to someone else like I sent to you and then I write your address one letter wrong that bitcoin is gone forever I cannot take it back it's not like a bank that sends the money back to you so when you send a transaction you need to you need to make sure that you have written the correct address so distributed ledger technology that's what it is that's what Bitcoin allows us to do it's incorruptible delicious leather ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but everything of value so what does really everything of value mean I mean we can actually store diplomas so in the future I really believe that you like people I don't know if you've seen catch me if you can where Leonardo DiCaprio was forging his diploma from Harvard to become he showed he was a pilot and he showed he was a lawyer in the future I don't think he can do this because it will all be stored on the blockchain but you will not be able to change it or you will not be able to fake it so it's actually kind of scary when you think about the future you know so the voting systems can be done on blockchain if you do it properly can be done by smart contracts and you have a blockchain proof of ownership if you buy a house you can't put it on the blockchain you can put your passports there's some services coming out soon I think China has this thing called own chain on the New York platform they're storing identities of individuals in China on the blockchain so it's very interesting if you look at this diagram or what do you whatever you want to call it cryptography distributed system governance and economics it all meets in the middle here you can all you can implement all of these the blockchain so you can look at BitTorrent it's actually kind of like blockchain if you think about it we trend when you download torrents online it's on a distributed system so that people give you seeds so you can download it easily you know secure elections can be done through blockchain it's there's so many things that you can look into you can watch this later on YouTube by the way so I'm just gonna pass it faster as you can see this is ten essential technologies of our age comes from 3d printing which your reality artificial intelligence big data and watch-chain so blockchain is one of the most disruptive technologies of our age right now so if we if we understand it better if we work towards how we can embrace it I think we can use it for our advantage so let's get to cryptocurrencies I think most of you are interested in this kind of stuff as well so there are around over 1,200 tokens in the market right now and actually we can see here maybe some more came in the top you can see 1254 cryptocurrencies in the market right now so what do they do so for example districts district o X is a peer-to-peer marketplace where you can purchase stuff fit there on token - its digital cash you can buy and sell stuff in many of the countries in restaurants and things like that Bitcoin cash that's a fork of Bitcoin they have increased the size of the like like I said you know one megabyte two megabyte they increase it to 8 megabytes and they're struggling to fill the orders but I mean they're they're quite good they have China behind them there's a company called bit main in China I think they're gonna be one of the biggest powers in the future it's going to be like Google or something and yeah this is from first of May if you look at the top here hit the red vest of May this is after a few months I bought Bitcoin it was Bitcoin was one thousand four hundred and thirty three dollars and this is 28th of October 5771 what's the date third of what is November yeah yeah so many people think is it the bubble a lot of people say it's a bubble I mean let's just look at the next slide Mike can it be a bubble gum bubble was six point seven trillion dollars when it burst currently I mean this is again a little bit older because it's very very fast 198 billion dollars as you can see current market cap up all cryptocurrencies so just a tiny bit tiny bit higher than that I mean it could be a bubble it could burst tomorrow who knows but I really doubt it how and where to buy Bitcoin this is I get this question all the time all the time so I made videos in Turkish but finally you have something in English as well so Google it this is the first thing I say just write on Google where to buy Bitcoin you'll find a ton a ton of information so many guides and so many web sites some of the websites I can recommend coinbase bitstamp cracking yeah but coinbase is like currently people's favorite because it's so easy to use this like PayPal for bitcoins so what should you create you create an account you get verified what verification means you send your identification and your picture with your passport that's for them to cuz it's not regulated really so they want to be safe so the fee in the future if the government says use your customers they can say this is my customer so some I don't be afraid to share your information with these guys I mean if you want to buy Bitcoin if you're afraid I can't do anything about that [Applause] so let's say you both beat going missing a fee but anyway it's going and now what you need some security so there are a few options to store your bitcoins I'll come to online wallets so there is a few websites that you can go online or you can yeah you can find them on Google easily Bitcoin hardware wallets I would say they are the best ones there is software wallets and there's paper wallets so with paper wallets you can actually print out your private key which is your ticket to your bitcoins you can actually print them out and then you can store them in a in a safe if you want you can store them in your pocket it's up to you to be secure about them how secure you can be with them and software wallets you can download copay for example on your phone and copay will allow you to have your bitcoins on your phone but still it's on their website really and hardware wallets they are like there's one called nano ledger I'll show you in a second it's a really good really good investment if you're buying bitcoins so what is the private key it's like like I said it's your ticket to spending your bitcoins it's a 256-bit leather this top one is your part is going to be your private key sort of like this nothing that you that book so you can store it you need to store it and hide it from everyone and also your secret words so when you open up an account on an online model it will give you a secret word combination like this so if you lose your if you if your computer crashes if you lose your phone or something like this to retrieve your bitcoins you'll need these words to put in put back them put them back in and you'll get your wallet imported into your new software so which one should use online wallets I would say blockchain comm hardware world I would I would say non ledger nano it's the necessary for large amounts software wallets like I mentioned you can use copay and paper bones I I mean if it's up to you I don't use them but you can find them I'll take questions at the end okay trading cryptocurrencies I get this a lot they say how much money do you have how many bitcoins do a man and is it profitable I mean it is profitable if you are smart if you if you know what you're doing I started with one Bitcoin I'm not gonna tell you how much I made but I start with one Bitcoin I made five and then I lost four and a half I mean Rania here knows at one point I almost tried at home because I lost so much money you know I I went to the side of the room I was just holding my head like this I didn't know what I was doing you know it was just it was just a guessing game so make sure you you learn before you actually must you don't want to lose all your money and Tommy knows as well I was I was talking about how much I made and then I was telling him how much others and oh man I lost so much this week he said don't worry you'll make it and both of them did and yeah it's possible and which websites you can use to trade crypto currencies you can use paulownia x you can use bit tricks you can use - and cool coin so I'm using currently violence and bit tricks these are my top two crypto currency exchanges they're awesome - the Chinese company works with around I think five different languages but Rex is only English anyway you'll get the smart contracts at areum so at areum is a platform where you can create smart contracts you can you can you can basically write the law with code if you know how to code it's all dirty I mean they have their own language but there is some new languages coming to make it easier for people so in the future with Java programming skills or C C sharp or C++ you'll probably be able to write some code on ethereum I'm not really sure but at the moment I sold it the only but there is other platforms where you can use like neo allow dotnet a programming language to write code so it enables it enables the ability to create computer protocols that assist authenticate and impose negotiation or implementation of a contract so what that means is let's say you have made a contract with your employer and the employer told you you're going to get a thousand dollars per month for the time that is let's say you work 40 hours a week you're gonna get $1,000 a month and you use a smart contracts to execute this contract instead of the traditional way of writing I'll just show you actually instead of the traditional May of writing on the paper you simply write it on the computer and you upload it into the app they call the centralized apps or a platform that you created and it's automatically execute it's smart contracts can control which institution can access private earth as well this is a very important important part of it so do you want your data to be accessed or not do you want to pay at this time or not I mean it's all up to the smart country is like literally law written in code and where can't be used smart contracts can be used in food in sports financial services energy for mystical health I'm not gonna read it all I mean in logistics you can use smart contracts for doing automatic orders from one company let's say I'm out of coke in my restaurant and let's say the refrigerator has the system and then it's to make the orders the coke from coca-cola you know I mean are you guys writing about this so similar platforms that area you can talk about neo which is the Chinese version arc which it allows almost everyone that knows programming language to write smart contracts and Italian classic it's a for cafeteria basically it's it has what's also value recently I don't know why but it's almost the same thing as a Terry as you can see Floyd Mayweather before his fight they used them as like celebrity endorsements for like stocks calm there's another currency and like for casting platform sort of thing I mean you see a lot of like Mark Cuban backing this eSports company don't don't get fooled by these guys I mean we can these guys offer I cos I am I am going to do a nice year soon but having endorsements like Floyd Mayweather there was for Paris Hilton they don't know what you did they're talking about they just get paid for let's say a couple of million dollars to put it on their Instagram site so that you buy their coins I mean yeah mini lingham he is a he's in this South African shark tank he said not having a web strategy killed a lot of brick-and-mortar businesses not having a decentralized strategy will kill many web businesses at this age so it's kind of becoming a necessity of our age soon what are the risks of owning a Bitcoin or having your company your business implementing cryptocurrencies and becoming centralized there are no regulations in many many countries I mean I mean UK forecast unit UK science pork estimate I think it's called that they did a big report on this I think in May and in February the EU to the report on how they can use blockchain I mean there's a lot of countries are researching on this but they don't know what to do about it they say oh yeah walk change sure and let's look into it but I mean that's the risk maybe you buy bitcoins and they might say it's going to be bent like for example in China I see other bent right now and last month I think they they stopped people from I don't know if you know what ICO is I'll just quickly explain what it is in the in the past no it's still there is companies that go on IPO initial public of so ICO is a similar thing but instead of giving your shares you give the coins the tokens that you created to the public you sell them to the public so anybody can participate basically but China is currently putting a hold on these because they say okay we need to regulate this there is no they don't they can't even text them right now because yes there's nothing on this so unforeseen future of cryptocurrencies I mean is it gonna blow up ten thousand twenty thousand hundred thousand next year or is it gonna go down to one thousand because it happened with Bitcoin before I mean if you look at the back past in 2013 I think let's just look into it Bitcoin here so let's look at here this is okay so it went 900 and down to 800 400 you can see the price on the left of the mouse the indicator for hunt 300 we can see and then you can see 2800 there the price and 2200 I mean it's so the market is fluctuating so much you can't tell what's gonna happen tomorrow no people ask me should I buy now I mean I have no idea really I really have no idea if you should I'm but I have bitcoins and I'm gonna hold them for a while I have other coins as well and another thing if the cryptocurrency market is that a lot of people are amateurs you know like I was an amateur probably still amateur you know I'm still learning there is no professionals as I said it's unforeseen feature of cryptocurrencies and very short period of time there is no experts Forex investors and stock market investors come in and they get shocked they just go what is this no they they're afraid to get into the market because it's just crazy and this one segment Rex make sure you look into it it's kind of complicated but this is a big risk of bitcoins feature it might happen in a couple of weeks so I mean I don't want to go into detail right now because they are almost out of time where can you learn more these are some really good places to look Bitcoin talk is where investors and hang like investors basically mostly hanging out their reddit Facebook github Twitter steam it is a new very very new social media platform actually you guys really should sign up to this place it allows your content to get rewarded by people like us so for example you write a blog on Facebook you write a blog on WordPress you don't get paid for it right you just get likes or you can just get shared on on Steam it let's say you shared a post on Steam it and all of us liked it and we have this certain power it's called steam power you may be able to make $1,000 in a couple of weeks with your post if it gets like enough and if it gets sharing them so it gives the that gives the consumers give the people like us the power you know it's decentralized system basically so instead of Facebook making money from ads you actually make money for your content and you can learn in medium you can learn in YouTube YouTube is an amazing source please look into it YouTube there's a lot of people like me doing this for free doing this just for the love of Bitcoin basically and the centralization and newspapers radio you're here most of the time you'll hear on newspaper I'd like read on newspapers that Bitcoin has crashed and Bitcoin has crashed about a hundred times like seriously and they never put it up like Bitcoin has you know gone up or anything like this so if they say bit core is crushed you should definitely buy it almost finished top let's get the sound up I love this end of this episode I love family a they're funny yeah yeah if you have any questions and I have to answer and if you want to get some articles from me I have a lot of I have like a big library where I can send you like European Union's forecast and you case forecast I have tons of articles that I can send you come down give me your email and I can send tea and yeah if you have any questions I'm ready tense for now and I remember you had a question oh I had no idea I mean spike in interest probably the mass media you know people wrote they wrote about I mean probably the newspapers actually every time Bitcoin went down a couple of hundred dollars they wrote it was it was crashing but people saw so over time it never crashed people saw over time a certain growth so they're like oh okay maybe newspapers are not right maybe we should buy into Bitcoin no and I mean mainly people like myself on Twitter there's tons of people who are tweeting about what's going on and what they what people should do this is also massive influence for sure [Music] I mean yeah currently I don't spend my bitcoins to buy stuff no I have paid for my rent a few times I mean to pay the for the rent I had to sell my bitcoins into that into dollars and then those bitcoins to knock and pay a lot of commission if my landlord accept bitcoins it would be much easier but now I'm sad that I paid with my bitcoins because I probably paid for the whole year's rent like in the last couple of I mean a few months ago you know when I it was around two three thousand dollars so yeah I used to use it to pay rent but no more no I explained a little bit on that okay so let me just know your Bitcoin address or any cryptocurrency address will consist of these big amounts of numbers that you can't really read and coinbase actually allows you to eliminate that they made it like paper so there is QR codes that that stores your address so you can use QR codes to send and receive bitcoins but what I recommend to people is that every time you send a Bitcoin or you sent another cryptocurrency always check the first four letters our numbers and last four numbers so that you don't send the wrong address if you send it to the wrong address it could be my address and I will not know where it came from I will know the address where it came from but I probably say oh thank you no it cannot be revoked that's the virtue of Bitcoin and blockchain so you cannot double spend you cannot send it and take it back so that that stops fraud from happening yes that's right exactly you cannot play told one yeah that's right that's right - bleep the blockchain you need 51% - probably not believe but to change so that's what they're trying to do with sector 2x they trying to hold most of the hash power or the mining power to control the market so at the moment is that decentralized sort of China dominates it yeah at the moment it's centralized but they want to centralize basically it's really up to you how much commission you think I mean do you have euros if you have euros you can buy materials for example on bitstamp the one I showed you if you want to but if you have dollars you can buy with dollars if you have not you can buy but not no coinbase accepts a lot of currencies and in Norway it's mainly used common base and I prefer bitstamp because of the lower fees to be honest so miners actually it used to be able to mine bitcoins on your computer like with this one I used to be able to mine I mean I'd never did but people did but now it's almost impossible to much it will probably take a thousand years to mind one mid-coitus computer so what they did they they built in China in Iceland in some other countries massive forms of computers like with I mean a sick - they're called ESSEC miners so they have this algorithm to solve the problem much faster than any other computer so they are basically dominating the market right now of mining the most so it's basically 20 times more powerful computer than this one trying to mind with let's say 10,000 20,000 computers - all together at the same time and you can do it in a pool or you can do it by yourself but yeah again by yourself won't take you won't be able to make any [Music] so yeah verifications you need to be verified miners what they do while they're mining those they call mining while they're trying to solve the problems they love with every block they find they allow transactions to go through so those transactions go directly into the blocks and every time they found the miners get a fee for how much you gave them basically and they also get a reward from the book it's I mean it's a really really it's it's much deeper you know topic than introduction we can go into it and in private if you want I can you can go online I I can show you how it works but yeah it's basically miners a lot of transactions to go through yeah aunt - yes I I personally don't have an experience but I know people who have experiences and yes what how can I help you with that I mean I know a guy who has nine and miners nine or ten I think something like that and he's ordering more and he makes a couple bitcoins every month but his cost is really high as well basically it eats up a lot of electricity mining bitcoins is is like you will need to pay a lot of money for your electricity bill yeah I mean if you don't have any expenses regarding that that would be awesome yeah that increases your profit margins for sure yeah yeah if you don't have any more questions okay oh yeah forking that's what segment 2 X is actually forking and Bitcoin caches are for completing the chain and creating from this almost the same protocol of Bitcoin but changing a few a few things in the core system so like one megabyte to eight megabytes and in terms of Bitcoin cache and one megabyte two megabytes in terms of cyber 2x so yeah it's I mean google it you'll find a ton of articles it's really good that you've heard about this actually it's a danger to the future of Bitcoin in some cases and can be a benefit as well we don't know really so because we haven't experienced it really anybody else yeah one more how can it be implemented I mean you need your studying logistics are you maybe you can do a research about that and you know find out create a framework how could it implement it I mean there is some papers online I it's there's a few articles on this you'll find there's not many journal articles maybe you might be able to write well first ones you know knows oh good thank you [Applause] okay very happy [Music] you
