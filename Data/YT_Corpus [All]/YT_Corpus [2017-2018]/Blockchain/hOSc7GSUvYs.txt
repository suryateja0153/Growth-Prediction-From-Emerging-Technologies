 hello my name is Daniel Bruno and today is the 27th of August 2017 in this video we're going to have a basic conversation about the Swiftcoin blockchain the Swiftcoin wallet Swiftcoin mail otherwise known as Swiftmail and how it can be of great service to you and your company in the years to come the blockchain technologies have come on to the world stage with tremendous force this year and have become more and more prevalent in the public consciousness and this is a great development that we've been waiting for for a long time here at Team Daniel Bruno where we developed swiftcoin as early as the end of 2010 is when we started to work on this Swiftcoin project a peer-to-peer decentralized blockchain currency which was inspired by Bitcoin and is one of the first proto smart contracts as we will see further on in this discussion we developed at that time virtual scratchcards in different denominations as you can see now on the screen and we have experimented with different methods and systems to bring greater efficiency to our clients and prospective clients so we're very pleased by the developments in the crypto universe and we'd like to offer a basic explanation first of all of how to use the swift coin wallet it's very easy to do just download it there's no registration required it's free to use you don't have to make any commitments and once you have it you need a little bit of Bitcoin excuse me and you need a little bit of swiftcoin in order to make it work for you whether you're sending important messages mails attachments or something of value to both you and the counterparty swift coin is the perfect tool to help you achieve your goals and to ensure your security your privacy and your and lower costs there were no transaction fees for using swiftcoin and there are no commissions there's no catch at all to use this service it's completely open and available to everyone who might want to use it in particular the swift coin wallet can be stored on a USB Drive as you see on your screen and can be kept in storage for safekeeping offline or it can also be connected to another device as you see fit so one of the features of the security is the deep design of swift coin - to enable you to control your data and and in one of the best ways to control it is to to keep it in a secure place so let's have a look at this at this wallet what you see now on your screen is a swift coin wallet and there are wallet IDs you can have any number of wallet IDs in your wallet you just create a new wallet ID with the icon up at the top and those wallet IDs are unique in the universe and on the blockchain and once you create one it is unique to your it's unique to your to your wallet they will never ever they will never ever be another wallet ID with that number as you can see a new wallet in this demo a new wallet ID has just been created and it's been added to the list of wallet IDs what you're seeing now is the yellow and the green the green are the transactions with the higher number of confirmations for example here you can see 53 confirmations of this transaction which is unique in the universe earlier transactions with only a few confirmations will remain yellow when transactions are new they're red when they have zero confirmations so you can see in real time you can see the blockchain in action and you can see that you can see the confirmation that a transaction has been sent or received up at the top the tabs you can see whether you can see your incoming transactions your outgoing transactions your wallet IDs and your solidus bonds which we'll get into in a moment but once you see a certain number of transactions once you see more than five transactions then you can be mathematically sure that a transaction is safe that it is secured that it is confirmed to an extremely high degree of accuracy here we can see one that only has three confirmations and it's yellow it's still in the yellow just like a traffic light yellow is stands for caution and green stands for go that you're good to go basically and it's really very simple to use it was designed to be user-friendly you don't need to be a coder or a tech geek to install this or to use it it's visually and aesthetically pleasing as you'll see we've got the pretty artwork on the left of the different symbols for different solidus bonds which is something that we'll talk about these are dead instruments the blockchain we are the pioneers in this type of technology here you have another transaction with 22 confirmations and a transaction is merely a it's it's movement of or it's a ledger a transaction is a particular ledger a unique ledger on the blockchain the transaction may or may not represent monetary value that depends on the parties involved it may just be a communication or it may be a trivial transaction or it may be an important transaction there's no way for anybody to know of the significance of a particular transaction because it is decentralized not even I know not even we know we the developers of this software we don't know what the users have in mind when they transact with each other that's the beauty of the system and that's the meaning of the centralized system in a moment we're going to talk about the solidus bonds which you see here this is a representation of a $25,000 bond which is on the blockchain the three the three primary functions of the Swift coin blockchain are male money and debt these are the primary areas what we're seeing now is in this demo is sending a mail attachment or attaching a file to mail before sending it this particular tab is a solidus bond tab where in green you can see the the scheduled interest payments for a particular bond here we have the address book which is just like an email address book that stores the wallet ID of different people so you don't have to remember what that idea is it's practically impossible to remember you don't have to write it down once you receive a transaction you can store it and attach a name to it so you'll know who it belongs to so it's made to be very intuitive anyone who was used Windows should have no problem it's available in Windows we're looking at the wallet on linux right now but it's the same it's the same functionality regardless of what kind of operating system you're using him what we're looking at now up at the top left is the are the different options when you click on file you can open up different windows there are different types of options you have with your network or the type of proxy that you might want to use there are different security options and don't forget that passwords are not stored anywhere so you cannot forget your password here we have different views that are available the default view the extended view there are different windows that you can open up to see the transactions that have occurred on a particular wallet and here again we see the extended view on the left with the number of transactions in a certain period of time solidus bond transactions as well as your incoming transactions tab you can see though all of those here here is logging in with your password which as I said cannot be forgotten because there's no way to recover it lost password is tantamount to a lost wallet here our basic starter wallet options there's an icon in the tray that's optional the animated floating gold coin is also optional there's a certain number of minutes that your wallet can timeout and require the password again you can set that here by clicking up on the top left under options and here again we have a select attachment file when you're going to send mail or money you can choose any type of file that's under a certain size and this is closing your wallet confirmation of closing your wallet these icons are representative of different values of solidus bonds you'll find that our wallet is quite unique in its appearance now this is when you want to transfer a wallet from a pendrive onto your new device or when you want to save your wallet onto your device which is backing it up which is an essential thing to do you have to backup your wallet and keep your backup offline on a on an external disk or somewhere so that if you lose your device or your device is damaged you can recover the beautiful thing about the blockchain is that even if there are transactions subsequent to losing your device those transactions will be resurrected on the blockchain because every entry on the ledger is unique it's a very powerful technology Swiftcoin blockchain technology and in a few moments we're going to talk about some more the practical applications of blockchain technology and how it can benefit you www.firstnationalbnak.com is a legacy

or mail back to that same wallet ID when you put the wallet into your address book you can add a note there a name so that the next time you want to send to that person you just need to look for their name you don't need to look for their wallet ID here you can see a message in the mail as well as an attachment that was sent here's the size of the attachment point 8 megabytes only three confirmations there that's why it's yellow yellow color just like red yellow and green on a traffic light and you can see here the outgoing transactions number of confirmations here's the available balance of this particular wallet available balance the sum of all wallets is in this window here's a traffic light green for strong confirmation here on the solidus bond tab you can see the different bonds that were purchased as well as their schedule when using the wallet to send mail with an attachment you select the attachment from your computer just like you would with regular email back to the solidus bond tab you can see the schedule of interest payments into the future and here is the address book once again you can see you can look people up by their name up in the top left of the corner you have a number of options you can copy the wallet and save it that's crucial to back it up then put that wallet onto a pendrive or an external disk there are different user options for proxies that you might want to use this is also at the top left there are different wallet views there's a default view the extended view that shows you different statistical data about your wallet number of transactions in a certain period of time in here is the password verification which you have to remember because there's no way to recover passwords if you lose your password then the wallet will become inaccessible and you have to get a new wallet there are different basic security features as far as the timeout on your wallet for requiring the password to log back in again choosing a different type of file confirmation of closing your wallet here something good to do when you're done logout here is a representation of a $25,000 bond which is denominated in Swift point this verification of a wallet password and here you select where you want to backup your wallet you could back it up to your desktop and then copy that to a USB Drive here you can create a new wallet these are old experimental scratch cards from a number of years ago that we came up with in different denominations these are no longer available but the artwork is very nice don't you think they were in 110 50 100 and 500 swiftcoin bnak this is our old logo from 2010 this is a play on the word Bank www.bnak.tv is the URL and each one of these scratch cards had a particular serial number this is the download page from Swift coin club this is where you can go to get your wallet here's a physical Bitcoin this is one of the many items that's available for sale at oswift.com here is our logo "we will make a way" that's the meaning of the Latin the swiftcoin wallets are easily transportable on a USB or for any other portable device so that your wallet can be backed up this is absolutely crucial so that you can save your wallet contents in the event that something happens to your device you have to backup your wallet the Swiftcoin rewards program is the perfect tool to enhance your customer base by offering digital coin rewards to your best customers and as I mentioned previously at Oswift you can buy and sell there are no Commission's it's Commission free there are no fees to list your items for sale the terms and conditions are strictly between the buyer and seller oswift does not get involved o Swift is just a portal for buyers and sellers you can send any kind of data using the Swiftcoin blockchain that data could be an important communication or it could be trivial it could represent monetary value of a significant sum to the parties involved it may not that is strictly between the parties involved and as a decentralized cryptocurrency there's no way to know without being party to the transaction what exactly is involved in it it's the movement of electrons just as an email and indeed the banking itself is the movement of electrons and the editing of a ledger an electronic ledger of course with a banking and internet banking it's highly centralized and the central authority decides what may or may not happen and it's obviously privy to everything with a peer-to-peer system like this that is not the case here we have the wallet again you've got different choices to either reply directly to an incoming transaction or to end or to add that particular wallet to your address book so that next time you can just look up the person by their name you don't even you don't even need to know what their wallet ID is all transactions are encrypted with 256 sha 256 sha encryption and there's no metadata the only metadata is the alphanumeric wallet ID number there is no way to associate that number with a particular person so even if the network were hacked the hacker still would not know where a transaction originated or to whom it belongs to this is part of the deep design of swiftcoin in the swiftcoin blockchain and why it's a powerful tool for your company and at the end of the day you can send a million you can send a million coins and your secrets to a third party or two not to a third party but to you to it to a counterparty I should say and it's nobody's business rather than trusting and expensive and quickly obsolete antivirus and firewalls and different types of programs you can bypass email altogether when it comes to important communications and you can use Swift mail John McAfee Swiftmail to ensure your security so emails are great for some things but they're one thing that they're not good for is privacy and security well this is the answer another thing about blockchain mail on the Swiftcoin blockchain is that there's no spam whenever you get a communication it's it's intended for you there's no Carbon Copy there's no blind carbon copy there's no spam there's nothing accidental it's it's intentional this can really increase your worker productivity because many people spend a large part of their workday checking their emails checking their messages checking their whatsapp checking their tax texts plural and this is a big distraction with Swift mail you eliminate all of that distraction your your productivity and your workers productivity can be enhanced multiple fold by using this system for important Communications and leaving email for less important communications here again is a desktop where you choose in this case where you want to save your backup wallet or where you might want to open up a wallet that you've backed up if you've backed up your Swiftcoin wallet on from another device and transferred it to this device then you would need to insert the password and to open up that wallet on your new device once that new device connects to the blockchain and it takes a couple of minutes it will configure itself it will it will find all of those unique entries on the ledger just as your original wallet did and it will reproduce them it clones itself the wallet backing up a wallet is making a clone of your wallet so just in case and then once you've done that then you're safe you've backed everything up and you're not gonna lose anything whatever whatever value whatever whatever monetary or a male important males that you had on that wallet that you lost because your laptop went missing or because it crashed or whatever the case may be you're you're okay because you've got the backup it's come again it's completely free to get the wallet there are no obligations there's no email registration you don't you don't need to do anything you can just get the wallet from a number of websites a swift coin Club JohnMcAfeeswiftmail.com first nationalbnak.com and other places where you can get your your wallet well people ask me okay well where do I get Swiftcoin well you can put things for sale on Oswift.com and you can earn Swiftcoin there you can buy Swiftcoin for any other digital currency at first nationalbnak.com or you can contact us where we do have a limited supply of Swiftcoin to give away so you can give it a go and you can see for yourself how it works it won't cost you a penny to try it out the minimum value that can pass through the beat the blockchain is zero spot zero zero one 0.001one one thousandth of a swiftcoin is the minimum that you would need in order to send a transaction through the blockchain that includes mail this is the logo for Swiftmail if you want to send mail your minimum is zero spot zero zero one to increase your productivity at the desk and get away from the obsession of checking your mail constantly to see what may be there checking your spam folder phishing attempts JohnMcAfeeSwiftmail eliminates all of that problem when you use the blockchain for your mail your your your it's like going off the grid okay and this is the logo here be sure to check out the other videos on our channel team Daniel Bruno and on YouTube we have some nice videos that show you how to use Swiftmail here's a diagram of how your email communication travels electronically it goes through a number of parties before it reaches your counterparty including Internet service providers and telecoms we eliminate all of that with johnmcafeeswiftmail you're off the grid you're using the blockchain and furthermore you're you you every mail is confirmed because you can see the confirmations on the blockchain you know that somebody got the mail unlike email if you're interested in investing or becoming our partner we've got a number of materials that we can send your way including a pitch deck and other things that are available at JohnMcAfee Swiftmail.com where again we emphasize that a decentralized peer-to-peer mail network is the best solution to your email security rather than fighting an uphill battle with email with traditional email you can use blockchain mail to send your important communications it automatically encrypts everything and because of the deep design makes security much much easier to handle as far as payment systems Swiftcoin is a fantastic option for your company to accept payments and to make payments to your vendors it's fast it cannot be reversed just like Bitcoin Swiftcoin is far less volatile than Bitcoin we also have patents which is rather unique in the cryptocurrency space so if you're interested in partnering with us and supporting us and do get in touch we have a number of materials to show you solidus bonds are our debt instruments on the blockchain these are bonds that pay the coupon from the blockchain we are the pioneers in this technology it was my idea starting in early 2011 to create bonds in addition to currency which at that time was just Bitcoin on the blockchain this disrupts finance by making brokerages and other intermediaries obsolete when a solidus bond is is purchased it's actually created when you want to earn an interest return on your digital coin you go to your solidus bond tab in your Swiftcoin wallet and you create the bond you can choose the redemption date of the bond you can choose the size of the bond here's the size and the redemption date from 7 days up to 10 years and then the interest payments are formed and sent to the Swift coin wallet that you designate without any human intervention well this makes credit rating obsolete because bonds cannot default a solidus bond cannot default it's on the blockchain it's an algorithm it doesn't depend on the balance sheet of the issuer or the debtor well this has profound implications for the convexity of a bond or the sensitivity of bond prices to interest rates the the global debt securities market here has a 78 trillion dollar market cap okay 78 trillion bonds are constantly defaulting there's been sovereign debt defaults in Greece Argentina Iceland corporate defaults left and right it's constantly in the news well this does away with all of that the solidus bond which is a Bitcoin bond cannot default these bonds are created at purchase but once they are created they could be traded on a secondary market and that's where they could be traded at a premium or at a discount depending on what the market wants to do so I hope you've enjoyed this chat my name is Daniel Bruno don't forget to subscribe to our Channel get in touch with us about your
