 So good morning everyone, I'm a mystery I'm one of the partners at Lake Star and I'm delighted today to introduce Peter Smith CEO and co-founder of blockchain Blockchain is one of our portfolio companies following a very early this year 40 million dollar fundraise Led by next are followed by Google Ventures Lightspeed and many others Peter is the co-founder as well as the CEO Blockchain is one of the world's leading software platforms for digital assets with over 18 million wallets and 100 million plus Transactions Peter will talk a lot more about that, but beyond his day job You know yes Peter is a thought leader in the space and a world economic forum technology pioneer or whatever that means? But he is very interestingly an avid Walker surf skier climber and all-around action, man And he recently told me at one of the board meetings that he has run so far this year over 700 miles So that's London to Edinburgh four times, or roughly 20 miles per week So this man is a little bit crazy So please welcome Peter, and so Peter. Let's talk. You know the market is super hot yesterday the price of Bitcoin hit over seven hundred seven thousand pounds seven thousand dollars Sorry the market cap of crypto is 150 billion Which is more than Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley market cap put together before we talk about this superhot market Tell us a little bit more about blockchain and talk a little bit about this phenomenal growth of the company you're building Yeah, so appreciate it. It's great to be here this morning and Dermot promised that he would introduce me with some Like the professional stuff and then some embarrassing antidote And I think maybe what is embarrassing about that is that I've only run like 700 miles this year Which is kind of a low-low year, and I directly brain that on the company? this year in crypto has been the craziest craziest year in crypto yet and You know as you know like we went from in the last year You know market cap of 10 or so billion to 15 or so 150 or so billion which is obviously been a crazy ride? We do a few things as a company that for we provided data and analytics platform We provide a development platform, and there were probably what most well known for providing a digital wallet It's by far the largest digital wallet and cryptocurrency about now about 19 million People have chosen us to be their sort of passport To the digital currency digital asset ecosystem and out of that product we have millions and millions of active users on a monthly basis and then on top of that we do about the same amount of volume as PayPal's consumer product Actually, just slightly more than them now which is pretty pretty crazy And one of the more interesting things to happen so over the next 12 months We'll probably do somewhere between 70 and 80 billion and consumer volume That is up from you know just a few months ago Where we were doing our volume was sort of measured in the low 1 billion mark on a monthly basis, so The growth has obviously been been quite intense both the industries in our own Which usually outpaces the industries by a multiple or two? I think the most challenging thing in art space right now both for our company and for most companies across the space is keeping up on a Infrastructure level so when your traffic and requests are hitting the platform really hard. It's also very spiky There's quite a lot of challenges that go into making sure that you're extending the same level of quality of service To your customers today as you were to your customers even a week or two ago So I think that's been a pretty big challenge so super phenomenal so similar kinds of volumes to PayPal Which is an unbelievable achievement, so you know let's keep talking a little bit? And I'm sure the audience are interested a little bit more broadly around the market, so where do you think? Crypto in terms of currency is going in the kind of short to medium term, so I think in the short term We're likely to see a significant market correction sometime in the next 6 to 12 months you know Let me Economist my background and one of the things it's like very true is when you have markets that are highly volatile They usually come back down as well, and so I think that similar to how we've seen other Corrections in the past We'll see a correction. We'll see a whole slew of Bitcoin or aetherium or whatever they intend to focus on in the press is dead stories But the correction price will be significantly higher than the price that the run-up started at And people ask me like where is it and I have no idea And I have no idea when the correction will come so I have no no view on those things I just know that they're sort of inevitable but I think what will happen in the really long term is that you're going to see more and more of these assets so at One hundred and fifty billion. We're at about 1.2 percent of the global market cap for global market share for financial services, which is around a 13 trillion dollar market And you know that means that there's still quite a lot of room to grow even when you stack our industry up against something like Gold, you know which has a market cap that's far in excess of ours We're still single-digit percentage of the gold market cap and so there's a really long way to go and I think one of the other things to Keep in mind is that the traditional financial system has only really succeeded in Making about eight to nine percent of the world's assets liquid Whereas our space is trying to take? The remaining sort of 80 something percent of assets that aren't liquid and make those liquid And so if you think about in terms of not just where the market is today But how big financial services will be over a 20-year horizon I think there's a really long way to go and can you talk a little bit about? You know the very hot and controversial topic of icos so people like me gonna be made redundant I don't think venture capitalists or finance people with me remained redundant I think there would be less of them there either be less of them Or there'll be less of them as a ratio to how big the market is? So when I say that like only 8 percent of assets in the world have been financialized You know that's when you think about equities or bonds right but most assets in the world today are not liquid and tradable like Your house is actually not very liquid and tradable your intellectual property as an individual is not very tradable even sort of like shares in a ride-sharing Fleet are currently not liquid or tradable What we're gonna see happen over the next 10 to 15 years is all of these things are going to become Liquid and tradable a big part of that is what we now call icos whose initial coin offer I prefer to think of them as initial asset offerings, so you know there's usually a token or coin? But what's true about all of these is they're secured by some cryptographic ledger? Whether it's on their own native ledger like with aetherium or Bitcoin or whether it's a ledger that they're you know sort of graphed on to like the ERC 20 tokens on aetherium They're on some cryptographic ledger, and what this does is it makes it really cheap to put these assets out You know you can now put assets out and raise money You know on an IPO level with you know a team of five or six people and you know no bankers Okay, and in the last few minutes. Let's move beyond assets and Currencies towards the underlying blockchain technology talk a little bit about that in terms of where do you see? That being applied and used in the short and medium term Yeah, so I think the underlying technology is really good for any environment where you have a lot of Participants in the ecosystem with very low levels of trust, so I'm actually not very bullish on Taking the technology and applying it towards large incumbents like banks or financial institutions, there's a lot of political reasons within those organizations And I think after three and a half four years of seeing people work on this problem We've seen relatively little adoption particularly in comparison to the segments of the market which is much more consumer focused Where we've seen a huge amount of adoption and huge levels of growth yeah, I could be wrong about that in the long term But I think for me I'm really interested in building to where the future is gonna be in 10 or 15 years And when you think about where the world's going in 10 to 15 years Most things migrate towards large public open protocols and systems when technology comes in and disrupts them Okay, thank you very much. Thank you for listening Cheers You You
