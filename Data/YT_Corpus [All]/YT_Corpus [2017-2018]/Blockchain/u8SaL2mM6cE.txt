 this video is supported by brilliant org [Music] I'm old kind of goes without saying that the Internet has changed the world but I actually grew up in a time when there wasn't an Internet I know a lot of my audience has never known such a time and has no idea what this sound means for those who don't know that means that nobody can use the phone for a while because I need to watch them dancing hamsters sorry mama but as ancient as that seems the origin of the Internet actually goes back decades before that because before there were dancing hamsters before there were message boards before there was Netscape before it was peanut butter jelly Tom there's distributed adaptive message block switching I remember that one good times this was back in the 60s the Cold War was in full swing and the US military went away for all their bases to communicate with each other in case of a nuclear attack this eventually led to the development of the ARPANET which many of us have heard of but this was after years upon years of research by uber nerds around the world and programs like the French say Claudia's project to figure out how to get computers to communicate with each other this involved thing out packet switching Datagram switching virtual circuits and a whole word salad of technical jargon that eventually got standardized into the tcp/ip protocol that came about in the late 70s early 80s this technology then dripped down into the civilian population leading to local area networks and eventually wide area networks by the early 90s the internet was a thing that was actually accessible to all but still only embraced by the early adopters which led to new segments like this there is violence at NBC GE com I mean what Allison should know what do you say anyway wait how does what are you write to it like mail no a lot of people use it and communicate I guess they can communicate with NBC writers and producers Allison can you explain what internet is now we laugh at this today because we know now how world-changing the internet would turn out to be but then Internet confusion from 1994 is happening again today with a new technology it's called blockchain a technology that some people think is gonna change the world in ways are gonna make the internet look like a cute little fad [Music] so this is the second in a two-part series on crypto currencies in the blockchain the first of which where I focus on Bitcoin you can check out right here so there's a reason why I started out this video talking about the Manute details and breakthroughs we had to work on over decades to get to the Internet where we are now because truthfully for most people including myself if you were to try to explain exactly how the internet works at its fundamental levels it would put you to sleep it'd be the most boring thing in the world but that's not how we experienced the Internet all those intricacies of data package transfer protocols are what make the internet possible but made the internet change the world was when it became accessible than non-technical people and that's the problem we're talking about blockchain right now is because that's all it is just a mind-numbing word salad of technical jargon that sounds more like a droid language from Star Wars but the lesson from the Internet is that the way we are going to experience blockchain it's very little to do with all the technical details that make it possible and then it's gonna take a lot of time and research to get it there so in this video I'll explain how it works but I'm only gonna go like 10% down that rabbit hole for all the reasons I just explained but also the fact that well I barely know what I'm talking about I mean you might as well ask me to explain quantum physics to you or something like that oh I have oh they do know I'm an idiot right hang on let me check my comments real quick oh yeah they know so I'll cover some of the basics in my Bitcoin video so I'm just gonna take a minute to explain how it works right now the blockchain is a distributed ledger think of a financial ledger like a bank statement except instead of the bank tracking all the transactions that job is handled by all the people on the network every time the ledger is updated it's synced up amongst all the computers on that network which are also called nodes so any inaccuracies in OneNote are clique ly fixed by comparing it to all the other nodes if you use Evernote and sync it up amongst all your computers and devices it's the same idea except amongst thousands of computers in a blockchain there's a set amount of time in the case of bitcoins every 10 minutes that all the transactions are bundled together in what's called a block and each of these ten minute blocks are attached to the previous blocks there's an encrypted key called a hash this forms a chain of blocks blockchain wait if you're brand new to blockchain something that might be confusing you it's something that definitely confused me early on is it's always referred to as the blockchain which makes me think it's like the Internet like one big thing but that's not what it is it's more of a template that everybody uses in different ways so there's a Bitcoin blockchain and a theory and blockchain a light coin blockchain and so on and so on so that's where your head was put your head somewhere else really the difference between the different block chains and crypto currencies is how they incentivize people on the network to keep up the ledger as I explained in last week's video on Bitcoin they offer bitcoins to people who donate their computers to handle these transactions and create these blocks these people are called Bitcoin miners and this is the basic idea different block chains have different size blocks different incentives different structures but you basically come down to there's the ledger which is the blockchain there's the nodes which are the people who host this on their computers and the miners which you know process the transactions did I do it I did it alright alright I'm there's nobody here now being that this technology is basically a ledger and a Ledger's or regular transactions it translates really easily into financial applications like currencies and exchanges in banking actually I heard Bitcoin being called the killer app for blockchain in the same way that email was the killer app for the internet in other words it was the first obvious application of the technology that most people could understand and use wait are you telling me they get it instantly and I don't have to write it out by hand and lick an envelope and pay for a stamp and I get to hear this just as email with the tip of the iceberg for what the Internet can do Bitcoin is the tip of the iceberg for what blockchain can do because block chains are just a regular transactions and when you break it down really anything can be a transaction a thumbs up on Facebook that's a transaction a transaction is just an exchange of values so some people are taking this cryptocurrency paradigm and applying it to other things for example one of the many crypto currencies out there is called steem and it's a currency based around interactions on social media the idea is that Facebook Instagram all the other social media platforms you are the product that they are selling to advertisers and the people who are creating the content the users that are creating the content on those platforms don't get to see any of that money well steam it the social media platform based on the steam blockchain creates steam dollars based off of social media interactions like posts comments and upvotes much like reddit what you see is determined by how many up posts the ten cats instead of by an algorithm and just like bitcoins are given out whenever a block has created Steam dollars are distributed and handed out according to the amount of activity on the site and just like any other cryptocurrency steam dollars can be exchanged for real dollars and so far thirty million dollars has been given out to content creators on their site and there are steam based clones of Instagram Twitter SoundCloud and yes even YouTube beginning away from cryptocurrencies altogether there's a lot of companies out there that rely on Ledger's and directories that could be completely transformed by blockchain technology like logistics and shipping companies supply chains identity land rights and grants insurance manufacturing so on and so on all these industries are examining ways that blockchain can streamline and automate their businesses and yeah I said automate because the next evolution of blockchain is called Smart contracts again keeping it simple smart contracts are sort of an if this then that formulas that automatically generates transactions based on situational triggers say you're running a warehouse and you've got to make sure that your supply of widgets stays above 500 then you can have a smart contract in the blockchain of your business where when it starts to get close to that number it automatically places a transaction with the manufacturer and fulfilled that order and this gets really crazy when you get into the internet of things smart homes that can automatically order milk when you're running out of milk or pay your bills for you or adjust the energy expenditure to make sure that your bills stay in check and so on and so forth oh this is pretty simple stuff but here comes the part that's either terrifying or wonderful depending on your perspective according to Bettina Warburg of animal ventures the real power of blockchain and smart contracts is in the automation of entire businesses if you take an org chart of a company you can use that reductive if this then that approach and break down each one of the jobs into individual decisions that can then be automated through a nexus of smart contracts and this is known as a decentralized autonomous corporation now we don't need to get into exactly how it works because for one thing they're still trying to work that out for the other thing as I've been saying throughout this whole video how it works is not nearly as important as how it will affect us and if you think that the effect it's gonna have is to accelerate the already alarming trend of automations taking over jobs that used to be done by human beings well if it works yeah but the flipside of that is that you can make a ten person company perform with the productivity of a hundred person company meaning small startups could be 10 times more disruptive to industries than they used to be and this could lead to innovations and a scale and pace that we can't even imagine right now so if you're the entrepreneurial type and you've got a good idea then this could be the best thing that ever happened to you now we're not there yet these are just possibilities at the moment and yeah it sounds kind of crazy but let's be honest back when you heard this and this you would have thought it'd be absolutely crazy that you'd be able to watch this video on your phone while sitting on the toilet yeah I know you're doing it so the full promise of blockchain is still a ways off but the technology is advancing at a rapid pace in fact one of the biggest advancements of blockchain is something that's not really blockchain at all it's called tangle Oh blockchain is already obsolete awesome hang on just a second one of the biggest problems with blockchain is that the more people who are on the network and the more transactions that are going through at any given times the slower it works and the more energy is expended there's a bit of a scalability issue with blockchain that's what it comes down to in fact you might call it a road block tango was designed to fix this issue by instead of certifying transactions in one huge block every time a transaction goes on the network you're required to certify the two transactions that came before it the idea is that the more people who are on the network and making transactions at any given time the faster it actually goes so it's not only scalable it works better the more people are on it there's a cryptocurrency called iota that's currently on a tangent architecture also worth mentioning is a decentralized internet platform called substratum by letting the network use your computer to pass website information to other computers on this decentralized network you can earn substrate which is a type of cryptocurrency not only is it a way to make some income a decentralized internet creates more access for people in places like Russia and China that don't have access to the full Internet like the rest of us do and thanks to the FCC you can probably add the u.s. to that list soon in fact one side of cryptocurrencies and blockchain that I didn't talk about in the last video but probably should have is the fact that it's helping out people in developing countries whose national currencies have become hyper-inflated or have collapsed by some means having access to a worldwide currency that they can use literally lets them have a bank in their pocket and it opens up opportunities that they didn't have before don tapscott a blockchain researcher recalled blockchain the internet of value and Jeff Wilkie the founder of aetherium said the blockchain is what the internet was supposed to be it's hard to argue the potential of this technology to transform our way of life in ways that we can't even imagine right now whether it will reach this potential and what kind of things we're gonna discover along the way we have no way of knowing but it's definitely something worth keeping an eye on and staying in for them as possible Scott speed whether you're figuring out how to build the internet or build what the internet should have been innovation relies on problem solving and one of the best
