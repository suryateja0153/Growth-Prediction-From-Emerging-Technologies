 hey what up guys welcome back to my programming channel and today we're going to discuss the difference between proof of work and proof of stake so what is proof of work what is proof of stake and why is a theorem switching from proof of work to a proof of stake algorithm let's talk about it guys so proof of work and proof of stake or allocated algorithms with the same purpose and the purpose is to establish consensus on the blockchain meaning that we want to agree on a certain state of the blockchain all the nodes in the blockchain need to agree on a certain state so guys when a new block is produced it needs to be appended to the blockchain and all of the miners guys all the miners try to mine it so what do we do what do we mean by mining a block what we mean is the following when a block arrives we hash all of the transactions in the block and we get a hash of those transactions then we need to find some some proof or in the Bitcoin blockchain it's called nonsense so the miners receive this hash of the new block and they need to find this other part the proof and so when they append those two together they need to receive a certain answer that and they know what they're looking for so they have the hash they need to come up with a nonsense it's called the nonsense but this basically some random bit and so when they append those two parts together into a string when they hash the string they should get a certain answer and this answer is public and publicly known usually if we talk about Bitcoin blockchain in the Bitcoin blockchain this answer is is a hash and it's need - it needs to start with a certain number of zeros and so all the miners know that they know the hash of the block on the of the new block and they know the answer they should get when they append this hash with their nonsense however the whole challenge is to find this nonsense that when you when you append the hash of the block with the nonsense you should hash it and you should get this answer and as SSL guys in the blockchain in the Bitcoin blockchain this answer is usually a string and we only care about the fact that this string should start with maybe 20 or 40 zeros I'm not sure but it's like it's a number of zeros and so all of the miners know what they're looking for however it's very hard to come up with this nonsense and so what they end up doing guys is trying different different nonsenses they take the hash of the new block and they try a nonsense they append it they hashed this this answer and they see do my do my new hash start with 2000 K then I need to take the hash of the new block and they need to come up with another nonsense and I hash it and I check do do my answer starts with 2009 so you continue doing that and they take millions and billions of times before a miner successfully guy's successfully finds the correct nonsense to get the correct hash and so when the first miner manages to find this nonsense this miner will be rewarded with some bitcoins and them and the block will be appended to the blockchain and all of the other miners will be not even notified that this block is mined and it is appended and so this is proof of work guys I hope my explanation was clear enough but basically let's recap you have the new block you hash all of the transactions in the new block you get this thing and then you need to find this other thing which is nonsense and so when you hash those two together your hash needs to start with a certain number of zeros and it's easy to check however is hard to find the nonsense and so guys this was proof of work and it basically means that whenever a miner mines a block he or she needs to spend a lot of electricity and CPU cycles in order to guess this nonsense so that is proof of work and the downsides as you may imagine is that it it requires a lot of unnecessary electricity I mean we have millions of machines just guessing this problem and trying to find the nonsense so it's very inefficient guys in terms of wasted CPU cycle and it's very expensive as well and it costs it's a high cost so those are the downsides of proof of work and that is why that is why etherium is trying to go from proof of work to proof of stake and another guys another issue with proof of work is the issue that is called the tragedy of the Commons meaning that when the difficulty or when the reward for the miners decrease over time which is which it does in for example Bitcoin the miners get less and less reward as time passes and so when this occurs the decrease of reward less miners will mine these blocks and this opens up Abel Venerable vulnerability to malicious people who can easily acquire or were easily acquired 51% of the hashing power and thus I destroy the network so yes we want to and that is why if theorem wants to go from proof of work to proof of stake so what does proof of stake mean it is it is like proof of work however however it tries a proof of state tries to eliminate the whole the whole issue where we have many miners spending CPU cycles so instead we have the miners who have the most ethers will be most likely to mine the new blocks and it will no longer be called mining I think and so instead of counting how many CPUs you have or GPUs and how how much you've spent on the hardware we instead count how much money you have in the blockchain and we do that because we think that when you have a lot of money in the blockchain you are less likely to to harm the network you are less likely to do false blocks to mine false blocks because by doing that you will decrease the value of your of your tokens of your ethers and so this is the main difference between proof of work and proof of stake in proof of work we the person has the most hashing power wings he will guess the next block easier however in proof of stake the person has the most money in the blockchain will most likely mind the new block and this also eliminates the 51% attack problem because when you have 51% of all the tokens in the blockchain it's a lot of money guys it's lot of money and therefore it is less likely for you to despite this to destabilize the network and to destroy the network if you have so much money invested in it and that is that is a big reason why people are switching the ye theorem is trying to switch from proof work to proof of state and so a theorem tries to switch to a specific proof of sake algorithm called Casper and so a feature of this algorithm is that malicious malicious validators and the validator is the person who validates a block and so the validator will actually lose money if he or she validates a false blog or a malicious blog that is not correct and that is a specific feature of Casper that is not in other proof of stake algorithms so it will be really interesting to follow this whole development from proof of work to proof of stake and okay let's talk about some details in proof of stake so in proof of stake when you validate an algorithm you actually look up a sum of money your stake and you can't get it back until until the block is validated and you can actually lose your money or report or a part of your locked up stake if you validate false blocks in the Casper proof of sake algorithm and so yeah guys what do you think do you agree with the whole philosophy of proof of stake or do you prefer proof of work leave your comments in the comment section below guys and if you are a new viewer guys oh my god and you like and you like cryptocurrencies you like technology app development web development you should definitely subscribe to this channel because you will find this channel interest guys I myself am a software developer and I post videos every single day ice so today we talked about proof of work versus proof of State and I'll see you guys tomorrow
