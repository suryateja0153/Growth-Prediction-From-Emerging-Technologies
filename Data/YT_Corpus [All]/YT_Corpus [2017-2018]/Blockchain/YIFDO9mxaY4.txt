 hello everybody today I will show you how to apply synchronization between two ODOO systems using Waves platform for exchange security information between base systems, such as number of document and timestamp and also how to use big chain database as document storage here we have a local system on my local host also we have remote system on the remote server we have blockchain nodes and not as clear database which is connected to big chain DB that way first we have to set up our connection with Waves platform node address and our private key and here we also can choose model for synchronization in our case it is sales border then we need to set up our models for data importing here we'll put our address for Waves platform first of all we create new sales orders then we go to our synchronization models here we read the button 'synchronize ' as a result we have XML file with our data after this we go to our noSQL database and we can see our data in this database in JSON format in Waves node now we have our information coded by base58 codes let's decode this code here we have our information it is already coded so we can take a look at it let's move to Waves at home node use an API we can see our timestamp and number which were written in waste platform load we have transaction here now let's go to remote of the system as you can see the sales order to know is and yeah and now let's press button 'synchronization' and we will get the same order in remote systems as we have in our local system as you can see it is exactly the same orders also we have transactions in Waves platform moves and big chan DB at the base  thanks for your attention
