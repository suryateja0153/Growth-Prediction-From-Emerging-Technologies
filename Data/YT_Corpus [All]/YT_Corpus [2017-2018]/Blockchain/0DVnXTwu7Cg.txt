 BlockApps was the world's first blockchain-as-a-service company which we launched about a year and a half ago. You can think of blockchain as, sort of, a new kind of database. It allows for the tracking of unique assets in a very secure way. We saw clear demand as customers moved from these POC prototypes to production system. For the ability to launch on other clouds and on-premises. So we had done some bespoke solutions for customers where we put them on-premises, but we were really looking for a more scalable solution and we looked at the different offerings and the best one we saw that allowed us the maximum flexibility was Red Hat's OpenShift platform. One of the ways that Red Hat helped us was with engineering support and they brought in, you know, world-class architects and engineers that really helped us, kind of, both evaluate the platform in a very, very fair and even-handed manner, but also really work with us on the implementation stages and answer the questions quickly when we ran into problems. You know, they really backed us in terms of marketing, sales, and business development to push our solution forward.
