 The project Play4Privacy is all about introducing and explaining the BLOCKCHAIN in an easy and playful manner to reach a broader audience. We are in the basement of the Kunsthaus (Museum of Modern Art) in Graz, Austria as one of two installations in this space. We play the strategy game GO, where two teams play against one another. From the 27th of September until the 27th of October, the game will be played daily from 7-10pm CEST. During those hours, the play board is being projected live onto the “outer shell” of the Kunsthaus Graz. For this project, the strategy game Go is set up in a way to tie in with the blockchain. There is a mechanism to achieve consensus There is a mechanism to achieve consensus When a decision is made, it is final. In anonymous transparency, we only know that a certain move was made, but we do NOT know who made that move. Each player receives a free token for every move that is being displayed. At the same time there is a charity aspect to the game: for every token that is created, a second token is generated and later donated to non-profit privacy organizations.
