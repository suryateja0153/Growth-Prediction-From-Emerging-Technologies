 okay I am Jonas and I'm gonna talk to you about blockchain in geospatial applications and the centralized mindset is pretty widespread actually in the geospatial industry by the way I only have five minutes I'm going to talk try to talk really fast so when you look at that all the data you see on the map they're more or less represent centralized structures infrastructure property borders etc initiative borders and urban planning you name it also the the vast amount of geolocation data that we produce with our mobile devices in our pockets it's often also uploaded to centralized systems you know Facebook Twitter etc and and I did see a need to disrupt that so here's just basically how the traditional geospatial architecture looks like we've got data storage in typically in a relational spatial database and/or repository we've got the distribution which is centralized and we've got the processing which often takes place on on the servers as well let's look at one of the most basic use case or geospatial applications was the transfer of land ownership right so we've got this little geometry here and let's say that I wanted that buy a piece of land from you so I give you some money you give me your piece of land it's just a transaction between two people really but unfortunately unfortunately but I but I need to prove ownership and that's why we end up with these centralized systems where there's a registry for a huge area typically in nation-states and then when this transaction takes place I also have to give them money and then they changed the registry and trans leadership to ownership to me and that's an extra cost it's a single point of failure and it requires universal trust amongst everybody within the area which is essentially impossible impractical practicality so that's where the blockchain comes in with eliminating those that overhead and takes it back to the transaction between two people and it's already happening just last month this came up came out in Honduras they were struggling with with corruption and fraud in the real estate business and they're now implementing a blockchain solutions to that so seen from the from my perspective as a geospatial expert what I need to be able to do on a blockchain architecture is is to rewrite geospatial data on on this architecture and and I need to be able to perform space of queries and operations on it and such as you know check whether this piece of land is not actually owned by somebody else before I buy it that is a is a spatial query with the geometry in it there's a whole bunch of a platform is existing and there's a very strong open-source community actually in the geospatial industry so just to to take the the existing systems what is the spatial database well it's a database that has native support for geometry and George the data types and just a few lines of SQL you can get a lot of useful stuff out of it so just a you know a simple native function like that you can perform a proximity analysis in this case planning all the the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants within 20 miles of this particular highway and that's really handy to be able to do that all the use cases I can imagine that involve geospatial aspects are you know say part go shading Lane Lane space with each other automatically and paying for it or paying for the road that they drive on it could be passengers paying automatically when they travel or the drones negotiating the the use of airspace when they fly over a piece of land there's also alternatives to uber based on blockchain that's and this also has a geospatial aspect and Airbnb also has its own geographical aspect to it so from my perspective and you know I'm sort of a rookie here and I really want to get into blockchain and I just started so this is kind of my requirements just summarize one is one of the work this develop it on architecture that had a native support or a spatial data type and I see a lot of potential users and unmet needs for disrupting this this industry with you know increased privacy and autonomy where people control their own data yeah lots of potential the way I see it so I if you want to know more about it and if you're interested let's get together and and start something and you will find me on on that URL
