 [Music] welcome to coffee with a Googler all the way from Rainey Sydney Australia but it's great to be here because I'm meeting with Fontaine Foxworth and Fontaine you may know was famous for her time with firebase analytics and all the great content she put together for that but now you're here in Australia working on something else time it's all about it something yeah so I not only moved complete hemisphere so moving from California down here to Sydney but also totally changed the product that I was working on I'm now in that in the map and geo org and specifically focusing on the places API so mapping technology is totally new to me which has been really fun to understand how we actually build and create our worlds digitally and then specifically working on API development is also new to me I've certainly consumed a lot of api's while building mobile apps but building API has been really interesting and really fun so I'm working on Places API so having being building apps that are all about consuming API is now you really know how to build one for people to complete yeah yeah I definitely feel like I've sat on the other side of the table quite a bit while consuming yeah I've got a lot of strong opinions about what types of things we should be offering what places the API is already in great shape so I'm looking forward to seeing everything good so tell me places API I'm familiar with it but for the viewers who want to tell us what is it all about yeah so first of all start with words place Google has this notion of places which is basically how we semantically understand the world around us so for example if you're talking about going to the Google headquarters instead of typing in 1600 ampitheatre Parkway in California you can just type in Google into Google Maps and I'll understand what you actually mean so as humans we actually understand the world not just in addresses or latitudes and longitudes but actually categorizations like cafe or gym or trying to put these human qualifiers on top of places in the world and so then if you look at the word API that's really how we are distributing those places to all of our developers around the world so that they can be using and consuming all that place data in their apps for an example if you look at a local rides app a taxi sharing app that type of thing instead of them having to keep track of all of the different places in the world they can just use our API so that when their user ends up typing in Sydney Opera House I want to go there their driver actually knows where where did you like something like Sydney Opera House like a navigation system requires that most likely to be as a latitude and longitude and then he cycle the place into the laptop yeah so a place is so much more than maybe just what a user could input but it actually filters into all these different use cases that our developers could have like navigating you know I didn't actually know Google's address until you just told really everybody knows that 1600 amphitheatre Parkway Airport yeah I like yes there's a couple addresses that if you say them some people know that that's I feel like one of them but that's the classic use of a places API yeah so then sometimes you think in terms of my house you don't think in terms of address so you got a home or work for example I just want to type in my sister's name whenever I'm navigating and in Google Maps instead of actually typing in her address because that's how we think of it is she here in Australia or do you have to drive back when I'm back in California okay I'd like to see how it would navigate you yeah maybe like swim across the Pacific Ocean I guess now I hear your swim event since you've come to Australia lots of diving I have I've done some scuba diving I went up to the Great Barrier Reef a couple weekends ago and did a live aboard there did a whole bunch of diving it was super fun incredible sea life so how is the relocation to Australia being it's been really fun there's been a little rain recently which is actually kind of like California of late and yeah it's a very lively city it's nice that people speak English so I can flip in pretty easily but a very friendly office and great to you know we're building products about the world so it's really nice to be able to see all different parts of the world so you start to understand different cultural nuances that's about how people actually address an approach map oh cool how have you adjusted to being upside down yeah it's pretty weird I get headaches a lot for anything upside down all the time but I'm getting used to it so back on the places API so we like you were talking about an example if somebody was building a ride-sharing app and you know you want to be picked up at a specific place like the Sydney Opera House yeah you know that that's a great example of how the the places in the database of places is available to developers but how would somebody get started with doing that so we've got pretty robust documentation on our developer site where you can actually first start to understand what are some of the use cases how do you actually use it and then what are some of the services and the different products are available are you looking for mapping software are you looking for free stuff specifically what types of metadata about a place are you interested in so a lot of that is available including code snippets and examples on all on our developer site and then we've actually got some good content at i/o so you can look at some of the stuff that shows up at i/o this year cool and we'll have links to the videos in the description below for anybody who wants to see them I'm looking forward to the session yeah me too now in order to be able to do this like to have this great big database of places there must be some way of identifying individual places on the planet yes how do you go about doing exactly so we've got something called any place ID which is basically just an identifier for a place on the planet for a location on the planet and if you think about it the word place I think it's really interesting because it can mean a lot of different things to different people so for some people if you're sharing a location you really just want to share a latitude and a longitude but somebody else who's maybe doing a real estate website they might want an address and then a photo tagging app wants more of a semantic place like a university that's nearby or a weather sharing a weather app might just want a city and so you can continue to think about more developers might want more and more robust or sophisticated data so the great thing about the places API is it's really flexible in time in terms of the types of data that we can actually provide to you so whether you just need a latitude and longitude or an address all the way to really rich robust information about all the details of a place we continue to serve the developers and all their different needs that one identify the place ID can effectively be like a primary key exactly so all gray different data sets great characterization cool so if I want to build something that spans latitude and longitude or addresses places and those kind of things that if I'm working in terms of that identify that's giving me the key to everything that's exactly right and the nice thing about that is of course our world is growing and changing every day so if you consider like a cafe over there that might be there maybe in a couple years it might not be a cafe anymore might be a gym or a laundromat well the great thing about having Google maintain the responsibility for the freshness of the data the developer just really needs to remember and store the place IDs and then rely on us in the API to actually be returning the most up-to-date information right so the address will stay the same and the latitude and longitude will stay the same but what's there it's no longer exact we are responsible for keeping that up today really valuable service if you're building something that needs to find laundromats for example exactly right or you don't want to do if it's no longer cafe you don't want to direct people there who are looking for coffee exactly and it helps us really think in terms of longer horizon so thinking about if your apps going to be around for many years you want to make sure you're serving the most up-to-date data and relying on Google is a good way to do that now one of the things was that you were talking about then being able to pick a place you had the scenario of picking the Sydney Opera House but what about detecting if you're at a place yeah how did the api's work for that so it really depends on what your use case is so you can totally ask a user here are some nearby places which one are you actually at but then in other use cases you might want to actually detect where they are if you have like enough information for example if you have a ride-sharing app and you know where they are and their latitude longitude you can interpret where they are now there's a method called get current place currently in our SDKs which takes into effect a lot of Google's smarts so what I mean by this is we're not just interpreting the latitude and longitude and turning that into an address necessarily but we might actually try to factor in a lot of other variables like opening hours for example so an example I like to use is if there's this two-story building and on the bottom floor there's a restaurant and on the top floor there's a gym they might have very different popular time so if I see a user who is in a place that maybe 7 or 8 a.m. the morning and I know that people tend to be at the gym at seminary in the morning and the restaurant isn't even open I'm going to tell our developer that that users at that place whereas if it's in the evening maybe around 7:00 p.m. at night I can infer that the user is probably at that cafe or that restaurant so we're able to bacon a lot of our smarts and remove some of the heavy lifting from our developers right because it's multiple floors in the same building the latitude and longitude is going to be the same exact just use that with no intelligent neck the address is going to be the same and so but by integrating with the metadata from the places API like popular times and opening hours makind of thing you can get a lot smarter about the time exactly that's really cool so if I'm a developer and I want to start building and I want to start using this kind of stuff what advice would you give to me I think it's important to first start to articulate what it is you're trying to do so certainly there's lots of cool stuff available in our API but think about what problem you're trying to solve and clearly articulate that and then go and match that with what we have in our services - if you really just care about addresses and you don't care much as much about the different semantic places then maybe you just start with some of the basics like geocoding alternatively if you need really rich detailed information then you might find some of our services like the places details service would would meet your needs so definitely articulate clearly what it is you're looking to do and then explore some of our services and how they meet those needs sounds good yeah I think I'm going to get started right away cool there's a lot there I've already built a places based game but there's just so much that can be done I look forward to playing with it so thank you so much funding yeah thank you really really fun thanks for making it down here for this lovely coffee in the room yeah I get to come to Australia and that's event planning and my comments build out this pie pick up being upside down yeah cool thanks everybody and thanks again to Fontaine for being guests on the show if you've got any
