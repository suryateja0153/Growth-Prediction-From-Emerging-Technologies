please click subscribe to this youtube channel so you can get these videos on a regular basis how to influence on the internet what are you talking about and what does this have to do with NLP as some of you know I went to VidCon a few weeks ago in Los Angeles for those of you who don't know about VidCon it's a digital video conference think comic-con for digital video and not just youtubers like me any digital video VidCon brings out all of the stars of YouTube Facebook Instagram vine etc the industry calls them influencers people who attract thousands if not millions of subscribers and followers on the internet companies wanting to sell their products or in on the action and will pay these influencers to advertise on their channels I went to VidCon to learn insider tips on how to promote this channel in NLP gym while there I started noticing famous youtubers who my kids love like Zach King and Dan TDM wanting to score major dad points I would approach them and ask them if I could video them on my phone giving a shout-out to my kids it worked my kids thought I was lit that's hipster jargon for meaning pretty awesome excited about this my daughter requested that I find Logan Paul and get a shout-out from him I had never heard of Logan Paul but knowing this would mean the world to my daughter I was determined to hunt down this Logan Paul and get a video with him this was before I realized how famous Logan Paul is his channel is the fastest growing channel on YouTube clocking over 7 million subscribers since he started his vlog channel about nine months ago when Logan showed up to VidCon I realized I wasn't going to get anywhere near him he was mobbed by so many people that had created pandemonium at the conference sorry sweetie that he couldn't fulfill your request you may be wondering what this has to do with NLP how people are influenced to change ultra behavior or take action is something NLP has been modeling since its inception but it's the Internet right it's not real the Internet is the most massive form of communication in the world right now and everyone is influenced by it even if you don't go on the internet ever which couldn't be true of you because right now you're watching this even people who don't go on the Internet are influenced by the internet because they still live in a world being influenced by the Internet someone can invite you to take an action something as simple as watch this channel or click like and subscribe and you do it that's influence and that's very real did you notice the embedded commands there I couldn't have made it any more obvious being a student of influence because much of NLP is the study of persuasion and influence I wanted to know how this guy could do this especially since he has 1000 times the subscribers that I do so I started watching his videos to find out if you'd like to start a YouTube channel or you already have one these tips should help you grow your following what I'm sharing here though is basic principles of influence that can be used in any context not just the Internet let's unpack the influence of YouTube sensation Logan Paul first and foremost it's important to acknowledge that though Paul's vlog channel is only nine months old he's been making videos for several years now and already had a following by the time he got to YouTube he started on a platform called vine which is now defunct there he got to test what works on video and what doesn't and he was able to hone his craft and his comedic skills it can't be overlooked that he is a talented comedian and actor and it's something he has worked at for years however comedic skills alone won't make you a youtube sensation Paul has created a multi-dimensional character while he looks like the jock from high school he's also a clown and he's sensitive the more dimension a character has the more curious an audience will be about that character Paul is tall and athletic and very handsome and while this won't make you a YouTube success alone he uses it to his advantage by purposefully being silly and not taking himself too serious this adds dimension if he acted arrogant and entitled it would be a huge turnoff his silliness makes him seem approachable and makes his audience connect with him examples of ways in which he pulls this off as he often taunts his roommate Evan who is a dwarf and Evan will hit the six-foot to 200 pound Logan Paul in the face and Logan just takes her imagine the opposite effect of Logan hit a dwarf he will also ask women in his video to marry him and they always turn him down which makes his male viewers identify with them and his female viewers want him even more his videos often start with him waking up and regardless of what time of day the video was actually shot his videos often have a mourning feel to them why is this important because he's waking up and he doesn't go to work or school and spend a portion of many of his videos still in his pajamas it gives the viewer a Saturday morning feel for his younger viewers like my daughter this works on an unconscious level because Saturday morning means no school and fun and as long as it's morning you have the rest of the day ahead of you another important dimension of his character is he's not afraid to show emotions and will often present a range of emotions in each of his videos creating an emotional impact on his audience that draws them in more and creates a connection perhaps even a bond with his audience he takes us further by meeting with his fans and nearly every video and giving away free merch which is jargon for merchandise or showing the camera what some of his fans have sent him like paintings of him are paintings of his bird maverick this cultivates a strong connection with his viewers and gives the feeling to viewers who will never meet him that they someday might Logan has even given his followers a name he calls them the low gang Rome meaning Logan which gives them a identity and something they can feel like they're a part of it's interesting to watch the evolution of Logan Paul's vlogs he has obviously grown as a YouTube artist and the nine months that he's been vlogging and this is likely the result of paying attention to feedback from his audience his first vlog I found unwatchable and didn't make it to the end why the vlog of him going to Burning Man with a few of his friends his friends in the video look a lot like he does young tall athletic and handsome and white the result is Logan doesn't stand out from the group and it just looks like a few frat boys in an RV which is not interesting probably not even two frat boys jump forward a few months and the landscape is the same but the people in the videos have changed somewhat now he has a roommate who is a dwarf a striking contrast to Logan's bigger than average size and there are now more women in his videos he also has a bird named maverick and a Pomeranian puppy if you weren't aware animals on YouTube boost viewership both the new characters in the videos and animals act as foils that help Logan stand out even more though it may seem like his vlogs or spontaneous happenings in the life of a very interesting energetic fun person they're actually well scripted and implement three-act story structure found in Hollywood films one video in particular starts out with an inciting incident a box arrives Logan doesn't give up what's in the box right away he builds suspense by telling you how excited he is that the box arrived when he finally opens it to reveal a pair of glasses he also reveals that he is colorblind by the way just like puppies kittens gamers and pranks are major themes on YouTube so is unboxing this guy uses every tactic in the book revealing he is colorblind makes him seem vulnerable and it also makes us as viewers invest more in the story at this point he takes a moment to ask the viewers to like the video and set a goal of 100,000 likes and tells them how much it would mean to him if he got 100,000 likes because they get to have this experience of curing his colorblindness with him he builds more suspense and emotion by refusing to put the glasses on just yet to see if they work and instead runs around to tell his friends about how excited he is excitement is the first major emotion he uses in this video until his friends put doubt in his mind about whether or not the glasses will actually work the audience goes from being excited for Logan to worried he's going to be let down which creates more emotional investment one of his friends runs him through a color blind test which Logan pre frames saying this test has traumatized him since he was a kid and we see him get frustrated more emotion or just a few minutes in and already we've gone from excitement to suspense to more excitement to and then frustration next he's moved to tears when he finally tries the glasses on and sees distinctions and colors he's never seen before the viewer also gets to see with Logan sees supposedly because the cameraman alters the saturation of the colors in the camera and then the change in his sight when he puts the glasses on this is a brilliant way to get the audience to identify deeply with Paul as they get to see the world through his eyes and then experience his transformation from color blind to normal sight the video ends on an emotional high point when Logan goes up to Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles to watch his first non colorblind sunset he's so emotional he can hardly speak but still manages to tell you to LIKE the video and subscribe to his channel Logan Paul is a brilliant influencer and has mastered the craft of influencing people through digital media everything he's done is transferable to real-life situations especially building emotional impact creating suspense and creating dimension and the way you project your personality I just wanted to say
