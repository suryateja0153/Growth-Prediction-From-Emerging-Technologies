 [Music] hello everybody how's everybody doing day two of i/o good a rounding good from everybody I had this idea I didn't go with it I uh I was going to grab my guitar from my house and bring it onstage I wasn't going to play you a whole song I was gonna play like three chords and then I could say tell all my friends that I you know played shoreline I didn't go with it though so titled to talk today finding the right voice interactions for your app my way of introduction my name is Daniel Padgett and I'm a conversation design lead here at Google I have a very great pleasure of working on Google assistant with a focus on voice interactions across the services that we have Google assistant I work with an amazing cross-functional team that tackling really difficult problems actually I've been working in the language technology space for about 15 years and kind of like everything is coming together in a way that's really exciting for me personally I've just been kind of waiting for this stuff I mean like is that stuff we thought about you know like the sci-fi promise the the stuff that you know Star Trek and Star Wars and all this kind of stuff things I was really excited about as a kid and I know there's a ton of work to do and we're nowhere near where those BOTS happened to be but it's a really exciting time to be in the space and working on a system so a question I get a lot what is conversation design and thank you for asking for me conversation design is a carefully curated back-and-forth between human and artificially intelligent machine it generates a personalized and context-sensitive experience around tasks and content and as content that we experience in a very visceral way it's like an immersive experience filled with things that we can see that we can hear that we can touch and it's contact that we can interact with and control by speaking and scrolling and swiping and tapping even typing as we announced yesterday in the keynote in that way it's a design practice that really puts humans at the center it's one things I really love about it it lets us be us and in the end when people ask what do you do I teach robots to talk to humans that's my gig we're here today to talk specifically about voice only interactions voice in voice out no screens no tap targets no navigation bars just voice now I'm assuming that most of you are new to this space and you're just starting down the path here show of hands has anyone worked with voice in the past ok decent amount decent mouth before we get too far into specifics I just want to say designing for voice is different different than for mobile and for websites uh please take that at face value I'm not I'm making no claims about complexity here designing you know can be a tough thing it's just different voice is different and that's what I'm hoping to unpack a bit for you today so here's a quick look at what we're going to cover I want to cover off the value of voice again voice only right no screens will cover some considerations things that you should be thinking about as you're creating voice experiences and some opportunities really you know some ideas around use cases all right so I'm good good so let's start with the value of voice the question here really is why why voice and for me it boils down to three things speed simplicity and ubiquity alright let's start with speed voice interactions can be extremely extremely fast done well they're even faster than pulling your mobile phone out of your back pocket you know it's like getting to the app you want on a mobile phone you know takes a tap or two maybe even a swipe and when you get to the app you're another cap and maybe even some typing away from a result with voice you get to bundle all that and it's like the ultimate shortcut that's what I think is really cool then there's just the simplicity of use you have users who already know what to do this is language it's conversation and they've been doing this forever well since they were born and there's really nothing for them to learn I mean don't get me wrong I'm the first to acknowledge the challenges around design and technologies and things like that but the promise here is say what you want get what you want and it doesn't really get much simpler than that and finally there's just the sheer number of entry points and a number that continues to grow you can already reach Google assistant and our actions on Google partners on millions of devices and it feels like there are new surfaces and new opportunities popping up all the time all you need really is a microphone and a speaker well that a network connection to actions on Google platform but you get the point the route the reality here is that the numbers are significant the potential here is massive by the way I don't know if anybody saw this thing that we that was launched like a couple weeks ago literally cardboard a microphone and a speaker Raspberry Pi and you're connected to assist say I mean that's really cool stuff did anyone get one no oh one guy get one I have one sitting on my kitchen table it's like the next project with my 11 year old I'm looking forward to it anyway let's do a quick thought experiment let's play how many taps would it take all right simple equation what's 15 times 24 you don't have to pick out your phones or anything but just think about it you took out your mobile phone how many taps would it take you open your phone you navigate to the app you tap the app you type the equation get your answer I think I did it didn't Eitan my my pixel earlier today now how about this one play the latest album by Gorillaz on Spotify one of my favorites I think on my device I did it in 12 caps I think there are a couple swipes in there to go through my pretty lengthy library last one any direct flights to Denver next Sunday anyone I mean right I did stop counting I actually stopped counting so long story short with voice we can get our answers and actions pretty much instantaneously so why voice ultimate convenience it it's really really powerful stuff when done the right way okay let's talk through some considerations like I seemed like a lot of you are didn't raise your hand so you're new to the space the first thing I wanted to talk to you about is the nature of the signal I think it's a good thing to acknowledge fact is voice is linear and it's always moving forward it's ephemeral - which means it's always fading behind you it's you know if you can imagine like the critical elements of your mobile app disappearing pretty much as soon as they appeared the back button the hamburger menu just kind of fading away content appearing once and only for a fleeting moment you know kind of got to catch up with it right those anchors are critical to visual and touching our faces they're persistent they're available so with voice we rely really heavily on the user's knowledge of conversation and what they can recall so some things that think through based on the nature of the signal keeping people comfortable helping them stay in that space and that seeing that they know that the metaphor of conversation use everyday language that users can relate to it's a really important one ask questions that are easy to answer you don't want them thinking too much you're going to timeout anyway with the current technology and structuring information in a way that supports easy recall make it easier for them to remember the stuff you're presenting the strategies around this and I'm not going or deeper strategies around this and I'm not going to go go deep here I would actually encourage you tomorrow there's a talk by a gentleman named James jungle a friend of mine colleague he's given a great talk on what we call the co-operative principle I'll show you some details later but that's going to be some good stuff all right moved on the other thing that you want to consider are is the capabilities of the technology recognizing the words people say is much different than understanding what they mean when they say them now with respect to recognition Google you know already had a low word error rate but we continue to improve apparently I saw in Sundar's keynote yesterday that after applying deep learning to the problem we slashed our word error rate again significantly and now we're down to something like 4.9 percent that's an absolutely amazing result so to some extent recognition is a quote unquote solved problem it's I mean yes there's still room to improve but it's more or less a solve problem but language understanding is a more difficult not to crack so just a couple examples maybe to illustrate the point what's the weather in Springfield so which Springfield are we talking about Missouri Massachusetts some other Springfield I did a Google search in there's I think one in every state I think it's the most popular you know popular name for city in the nation you know maybe the best solution to answering this question for the person who posed it is to apply some contacts like we know that the user lives in Springfield Missouri therefore we provide them with the weather in Springfield Missouri but maybe that's not the right thing maybe it's weird that they're asking the question what's the weather in Springfield when they live in Springfield when they ask what's the weather here what's the weather like today that sort of thing I don't know it's possible they mean one of the other Springfield's how about another one play yesterday is that the song is that the movie there is a movie The Playlist an audio book maybe it's a game who knows right now again applying context and you know the things a company like Google would know about users statistically they're probably looking for the song right but that opens up other complexities well I have no idea why anyone would want to hear that anything other than the original version by the Beatles that's my personal preference perhaps they want to hear the you know dulcet tones of boys two men singing their R&B rendition and the cover that they did in the in the early 90s or some other version I really don't know anyway it's something to consider as you deploy your voice applications I have no doubt that you're going to be running into this some strategies here acknowledge ambiguity when you don't know the answer you can't apply the appropriate context and let users clarify don't be afraid to engage a lot of people I hear them say like well it's an extra step believe me taking that extra step is way better than the correction they're going to have to do if you get it wrong so just keep that in mind and remember their choices and leverage them next time I mean if you can this is the learning part you know keep a record and apply that the next time that they come into your app it's going to be super useful for streamlining interactions in the future last but certainly not least we have our users right always always always we need to consider our users and their context we've always kind of talked about voice only interactions being the hero for people whose hands are busy whose eyes are busy who are doing some sort of multitasking typically in private or at least in a familiar space right something he's sharing with a family something like that it's voice interactions while they're driving in their car cooking in the kitchen that sort of thing and that's absolutely still the case but there's definitely movement outside of that people leveraging voice while they're on the move in public spaces for instance like on their bike you know it's two kids a lot using this stuff on the street but what I really want to cover here is something that we touched on earlier the fact that users are instant experts right there's nothing to teach or at least there shouldn't be again this is language it's conversation it's something that they've been doing forever and because of that they have high expectations and very very very low tolerance for error I mean this stuff should just work right now let's think about that for a second the difference here between touch and text input and for a visual UI and and a voice UI with a touch UI with visual Kappa Balu is reasons for errors tend to be transparent you know like you know when you have a typo or when you've hit the wrong top target you know when you need to course-correct and you're in control you know you know what to do you take the step and you make the correction on the voice side though you know errors are typically the systems fault not the users I mean that is if the user is truly cooperating right you know they're not speaking nonsense it really is then becomes the system the system's fault they have to rely heavily when there's error on the system to get them back on track that said some strategies here make sure you're really really really spending time developing a strategy for exceptions I just can't stress this enough this is the thing that is going to make or break your application you want to make it really easy for them to get back on track and you want to leverage techniques that we use in everyday conversation maybe I could try to illustrate this one so you're collecting a date from somebody right you have some you know what date do you want to travel and somebody says April 14th let's say you needed the year for some reason right actually let's back up you know you guys for the date they say uh yeah April 14th I'm sorry brain April 14th you force them you want you want the year as well for some odd known reason they may be traveling you know a year from now if you force them to if you force them to give you the year that's you know going to that's going to create this loop you're going to throw them in an error there again you're going to say sorry I didn't get that you're going to ask them to repeat the date and you frustrated a user so instead your strategy here should be accept the April 14th and just move on and say what year right just use the type of things that we do in everyday conversation or if you have some sort of recognition error you know an easy strategy is simply you know you know if they say a date incorrectly sorry what's the date and just ask them to repeat it in a very natural way now lastly we're going to touch on some opportunities opportunities use cases now from a user perspective what they're asking here really or what they're telling you really is telling us I should say in the spaces answer my questions right help me get things done keep me on track and give me something to do from a developer perspective I think that means supply quick answers frictionless transactions and give relevant suggestions right so some use cases just taken from some verticals in the space there are some verticals that are out there like if you're in financial some things that you might want to consider it what's my current balance how much do I owe what was my last transaction some things that should be quick and fast I need to make a payment transfer $100 to Joe's account or when does my policy expire maybe some of you are in retail right is my order on the way what's your return policy do you do same-day delivery right maybe it's a stock check do you carry milk our headphones on sale I need to reorder cat food health care actually a space that I came from is my prescription ready can I get a flu shot do you have any appointments available maybe there's a clinic I need to schedule a follow-up or I need to leave a note from my doctor refill my prescription is a really fast one I wonder if there's anybody from Walgreens here anyone hey how's it going and lastly just another vertical that I thought through fun and wellness what's my horoscope got any good dad jokes actually my son I think every morning my son asked Google home that we have in the kitchen he asked him to tell him a joke and then he tries to pass it off on his own he runs into the bathroom where my wife is getting ready and tries to pass it off like it's like it's his some other opportunities around reading stories or you know playing a game or meditation right in the end I think the thing that you really need to make sure is that it's easier than the alternative right if it's not more convenient for your users to do this in voice it really probably isn't worth pursuing and so I can't stress this enough make sure it's easier than the alternative for you now I mentioned some related talks there is one that was done earlier today on multimodal design and that was done by my colleagues Jared strata Minh and Adriana Adriana almost one size doesn't fit all defining multimodal interactions and I would encourage you to go watch that online there's one tonight at 6:30 by Nandhini soccer called in conversation there are no errors and that gets out the strategies that we were discussing a little earlier and then finally the one that I mentioned by James applying built-in hacks of conversation to your voice UI is really all about that cooperative principle and making sure that you are leveraging the rules of discourse and conversation to make your users very comfortable in your speech application and your design I feel like there was a massive chunk of that that has disappeared from my presentation somehow and I am at the end unfortunately here's a URL for you to go to and to check out some stuff by the actions on Google design team and developer team make sure you take that down and go check it out [Music] [Music]
