 [Music] you okay thanks the Arkham so so you can hear me excellent so chatbots as a team assistant uh I'm going to tell your story about how one chat but k and to be and just to be sure that we are talking about same thing that what was a chat but is and what is it it is not a few key concepts but first of course few words about me so I've been in the business for quite many years and done quite a bit different roles during during those years at the moment I honored it for myself most of it with the titles like data engineer API developer d be a project manager that sort of things during doing basically two jobs the momentum they chopped and had a part time entrepreneur through my own business business focusing mainly on mainly on consulting and subcontracting for data engineering jobs and also also chat BOTS tailor-made solutions on that area but about user interfaces to information systems in general there are different given kind of views in the faces of course everybody knows the graphical user interface the most used nowadays I believe of course email is 11 interface which works works both ways SMS and at least all the developers know quite well nowadays also the command line or terminal which is of course almost totally text based in the face and hmm there's an idea chat but for terminal why not and it is of course we each option which can be in 22 different ways from text to speech which can basically an audiobook in the easiest form or stack the speeds to text so you can for example dictate dictate text and machine interprets it it as as a text and focus today is a POS and that's of course one interface to various systems and last but not least there are the newest kid on the block chat BOTS and in this case as a chat but I mean text based in the face does this of course the speed option available but today I'm focusing on the text based chat BOTS okay so what is a Jan but in general chat bot is just any just like any one of us in group chat kinda sometimes smarter sometimes little less basically it's robot automation tool which performs various tasks given to it by other group members answering questions reporting information or alerts from the banking systems and in the end stripped-down chat bot is just a server program or a service technically speaking it has nothing to do with an AI necessarily it can do the last AI but it's it's not a same thing and for example my chat bot doesn't have anything to do with artificial intelligence at the mall let's the future holds so here's some little example how to communicate with a chat bot in a team chat I have divided the communication into two groups which the first one is a simple example for about the comment based interface so you basically given give a gifted chat but easy commands without actual actual sentences just a key words and yeah but does just how it interprets that text and of course the more advanced more demanding alternative is the conversational option where you can actually discuss with the chat but you can be polite if you like jackpots like it if you are polite with them so basically they are they are more familiar to interact with they are pretty much just like kind of an dumb team mate so you have to serve to have to dump dump down your speech a bit but anyways both ways you can get the job done the first one is much much easier to implement parlous this whole childhood thing look like as a systems architecture point of view of course we need an some kinda phone chat service basically can be anything as long as it has some some kind of an API which enables the chat BOTS to interact with the chat service and then you need based on your chat BOTS various banking systems and of course if you have AP eyes and those things are a lot easier than without an actual API but quite simple as you can see nothing fancy here about my own example I was interviewed in TV and finish my tea magazine I believe most of most of you know the magazine couple numbers back I believe the story is still still readable and online and I it was really fun fun thing to be able to tell tell about my own own creation and how are yous chat bots are actually used at the time things have moved moved along quite a bit since then so what does my my slack but Sarah do there are a couple of examples nowadays it does a bit more actually but the basic basic set is it's kind of an DevOps assistance maybe you could call her that it relays some information and alerts from the backend systems to a slack channel so basically before the boat people were sometimes mandated to go the backend systems to look for information read locks or that sort of things yeah there's some legacy behind that but nowadays it's it's far less of that and all the all the relevant information can be seen in slack channel of course it works both ways so we can command the boat for do some basic application installations the backend systems maybe you add hook database backups or restores even that actually worked and when I when I saw saw the restore go live for the first time it was pretty amazing thing there's quite a bit moving parts as everybody knows who has done some backup database restores not as easy as it sounds then there are some administrative tasks which the bot can do I can I can report project estimates and how projects are going and I can can get a report back about the whole project portfolio or from individual projects I can do time reporting and I can get time reports from the from the bottom and last but not least I can I can do the whole customer invoicing through my bot without without unnecessary interaction I kick it kick the service off under the bots collects the base information for invoicing and I then approve the information if it's correct and approve the invoices to go forward which go through an API turn to an company who delivers the actual universe is to bank saw in paper form while I made what's handy and of course there are quite a quite many banking systems and actually in internet too I can I can ask various questions and the bot bot collects the answer from basic various sources and combine some kind of an reports for me to see about the backend systems which are which are connected without going any details there are some bare metal Linux servers and Windows servers also and some cloud services which have been connected to our BOTS so why we chose slack basically it was already in use so it was seen as a feat feed solution for team discussion for a remote team it's an excellent choice on my opinion and slack has an excellent API one of the best I have seen and I've seen quite a mini and also done quite many and slacks API is one of one of the best all time I have seen and used so it enables chatbots and a lot more as many of you probably know so how to get started and actually why why should you start using pots or even developing your own it's it's one way to bring the UI of your app to your users let's say your users are already in some team shut it may be slack it might be some other crude message platform so there are some simple text based tasks which your team members must do during the day so if they have to jump to another browser window or some desktop application to perform the task why bother if the same tasks can be done in the group chat so it's easier for the users you can start and actually I propose that you should start in small scale with a very very simple example and expand as you can see how how the first first case has been solved and learn learn from the experience it doesn't cost much of course depending on the API switch you have abused and you can see quite fast that is it a viable option for your teen or or for your business and it's worth note that the chat box is definitely not a universal solution to everything for example applications that use graphics I believe it for example maps I cannot see how that could be done by a child bottom there are complicated tasks which have a lot of thinking to do everybody know they are really hard for a messy in to complete so I wouldn't start from those and any task but doesn't feel natural to do in text form so if you if some tasks are easier to draw or speak or da do in some other way don't don't try to push it forcefully to a text form it's it's probably not going to work so what else don't try to make one chat but which solves all the problems been there done that the more more beneficial way is to do one chat but which focuses on one domain for example it could be a project assistants or it could do invoicing or it could do DevOps don't don't try to make one but to do everything it's it's quite hard to maintain and train new stuff complexity it's not a good thing in this dis built either of course when you split concerns enables distribution of developments you can use multiple teams multiple developers you can outsource things and a specialization especially if you're both uses natural language so the conversational option to discuss it create improves the accuracy when the boat has only one domain to focus so it understands the words much much better than if you are trying to teach some general language to a 3-1 bottom so basically start small try things out there are plenty of ready-made BOTS for example for slack which you can try out contact me let's make you dedicated one which does exactly what you want add a tryout try things out maybe but you
