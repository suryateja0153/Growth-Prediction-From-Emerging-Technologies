 [Music] hello and welcome to Google i/o 2017 I'm Patrick Brady from the Android team at Google and I'm here with AJ and Chen to give you guys an update on Android and cars we have a lot to cover today and I see there's still people streaming in but let's buckle up and get driving the automotive industry is really heating up I think that's no secret we see cars rapidly transforming from disconnected mechanical machines to powerful connected computers on wheels the controls are shifting from mechanical knobs and dials to software defined interfaces accessible through touch screens and voice controls cars are getting more sensors and screens microphones connectivity and compute power we also see a convergence between the mobile and automotive worlds creating exciting opportunities to revolutionize the way we interact with our cars today through open platforms artificial intelligence and vibrant developer ecosystems Android auto is an effort from Google and our partners to bring all of these advances together and create a safe and seamless experience for drivers everywhere it's still early days but today anyone with an Android auto compatible car can see the beginnings of this vision at work with access to their favorite Android apps right from the cars display we continue to expand the number of Android auto compatible models available through great partnerships with over 50 car brands there are over 300 Android auto cars convey label today compatible cars available today including first launches from Chrysler Renault Volvo in the last few months alone and that's triple the number from just one year ago it's well on its way to becoming a standard feature in every new car but of course we know that not everyone has a new car and so we've also made the Android auto app available as a standalone experience on Android phones this opens up the platform and ecosystem to many millions of drivers no matter what kind of car they drive whether you're looking to stay connected with whatsapp Facebook Messenger or a low or pass the time with NPR one in audio books moddable or the latest album release on Spotify the apps drivers want on the road are available through Android auto and before anyone asks Waze is now hitting beta so we're very excited to welcome them into Android auto as well we're seeing strong growth on the developer front as well in fact we've seen a 50% increase in Auto enabled apps in the Play Store since last year but none of this would matter if we didn't have users right well I'm happy to say that Android auto usage is growing like crazy as well here's where we were at Google i/o 2016 and here's where we are today at i/o 2017 we've seen a 10x growth in usage over the last year alone and the strong trajectory continues but this is really just the beginning and we're really more excited about where Android is going on the road ahead last year at i/o we announced that we're building automotive features right into the Android platform to make it a turnkey solution for cars every bit as much an automotive platform as it is a mobile platform today we're doing this because we believe open platforms are powerful enablers of ecosystems they reduce the cost of development and they speed time to market in a sense they accelerate innovation we're also doing this because it enables us to deliver an even more seamless driving experience with all the information controls and connectivity available through a single system that's infused with the drivers identity their digital life and next we listen and learn from partners who had already brought Android into automotive and we worked hard to solve the challenges they hit along the way a robust and full-featured Bluetooth stack a standard way to connect with the cabin controls for windows and air conditioning and car sensors a system that boots instantly at Google i/o 2016 we showed this all off with Android nougat powering the entire in-car experience of a concept Maserati the windows the doors the air conditioning the instrument cluster and as much as we really loved that Maserati and I'd really like to take it home it was a concept and I think what we want what we think you all want is to see real cars running modern Android powered systems the traction we're seeing in the industry is pretty amazing just a few short months after the official Android new get release several of our partners were demoing Android powered infotainment systems at CES 2017 including Fiat Chrysler's Android powered UConnect system earlier this week the automotive industry heavyweight with a reputation for building some of the most advanced systems on the market od announced that they will build their next-generation infotainment systems on Android please join me in welcoming Alphonse faller head of connected car and infotainment at Audi AG [Applause] [Music] [Music] Patrick and our friends on Google thank you very very much for being here that we have got the invitation to be at the Google i/o for Audi is the third time that we are here at i/o and for Audi the Google i/o is really really a special event a great event we have a very very long term relationship with Google and together portray computing we have been able to launch a lot of really cool services over the last years we started with Google Earth amazing Sirach view i3 few a lot of things and now and now the really big next step is coming if you are looking on the picture on this picture we see as a brand-new Audi internal design this design is based on the best-in-class digital cockpit technology and we see here three absolute absolute automotive high-end displays in the front and additional displays in turn seven in the form based on this digital cockpit we are able to bring it in a really really amazing design and and really straightforward excellent user experience and in this internal design we are doing a seamless integration of embedded and through it and I think that is really really a big step if I'm to a short summary in terms of time what's ongoing automotives we are bringing together this our silicon-silicon partners really really high-end computing inside the car next step is with our friends from mobile communication we are connecting all costs all cars with high-speed LTE and very soon also the safety to the whole cloud ecosystem and now the point is these are embedded Android we are able to provide an open platform for automotive and this enables us to invite you to invite all of you to participate in automotive development and such great so thanks very much and looking forward to see this concept on our show car outside and have one or other for discussion thank you very much thank thank you Alphonse we couldn't be more excited to partner with Audi again to bring Android into their future cars but you can't build an ecosystem with just one partnership right and that's why I'm happy to say that one of the industry's most innovative companies Volvo is also putting their weight behind the Android in-car ecosystem I'm happy to welcome up Henrik green senior vice president of research and development at Volvo car group to tell you a bit about their new system good afternoon and thank you the friends at Google for inviting us here to this great event thank you for the Sun and most of all thank you for the sunscreen I haven't dead looked at the mirror yes so I'm not sure but I'm definitely burned on the right side I mean we have worked with Google for a number of years on a different size of projects and of course the recent Android also is a fantastic success order but today we're here to announce that our partnership is going to the next level we are together with Google team here going to develop the next generation of connected car infotainment and as always for Volvo it's very important for us to create a completely seamless solution where the user experience is at the heart of everybody and that we can provide a better life and a better experience through the integrated use of this infotainment system now the design of au existing place of course an enormous important role but at the heart of it is the operating system and here we strongly believe that together with Google we will develop the next generation based on the Android platform so again it's to you out there you are the developers you are now the people and the brainpower that will bring this experience to life in the future course so be with us here and show that we can make the best connected infotainment system and core experience out there thank you so much [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's pretty cool right I definitely I definitely encourage you to go check out the demos that Audi and Volvo are showing in the Android and iOS Evo's out there as good as the cars look up on the screens they look even better in person sadly I have to say we're not giving out any free cars this year at i/o so you have to make do with a t-shirt but outtie an outie involve our really true pioneers in automotive electronics and infotainment and we couldn't have picked better partners to usher in the future of connected cars we're really really excited about that with the Android Auto app on phones with 300 Android auto compatible car models and with Android built in systems hitting the road soon we're pushing forward to revolutionize the way we stay connected in our cars creating a safe and seamless connected experience for drivers everywhere but a big part of the develop the drivers digital life as Henrik and Alphonse said is the applications and services they use throughout their digital life on their other devices and we need to bring the ecosystem along for the ride so I'd like to welcome up on stage AJ can Bembe from the Android auto UX team to talk about what this all means for developers Thanks thank you budget Thank You Patrick and I everyone my name is AJ and I am the lead designer for Android in-car infotainment Patrick already detailed are we been out at work to make Android the best possible infotainment platform with improvements to Bluetooth boot time car control such as HVAC radio cast and source closers and so on but Android is not only a great platform it's also an entire ecosystem of apps and services but first I would like to talk about why are we doing this so this is natural photo for our field research and this driver is trying to catch pokemon on Pokemon go while at the wheel and you can see the family crossing in the background so don't worry everybody safe and again this is not a stock image and this is our researchers in the car we see drivers out on the road and now if this is happening with our researchers in the vehicle the gist of it is our internal research shows that people drivers want to stay connected and the memories of use their phone to do so and that can link to situation that are fundamentally unsafe we want to observe a stay connected with you in service of safe and predictable select stupid three things here first why is complex to design services for the car what Android is going to help us a platform then and finally what are the various ways that you can integrate with Android also as a developer okay what is making designing apps and services for the car as specific exciting but are too sometimes challenging Android is a platform point infotainment across a wide range of possible surfaces with shades aspect ratio to be different densities Fidelity's the current tire is a meticulously crafted experience everything is optimized for safety of course but also to provide a specific experience for each brain and each price point this place can be big small wide sole interesting cluster or adds up displays Android is a platform that support all of these but along with the output the inputs methods are multiple as well search crews are more and more common in the course but also depart touchpad rotary inputs and many more cut off that as well and some systems or even average of multiple input mechanism and Android is a platform that support that as well safety safety of courses in a variety we are working really really hard to reduce driver distraction visual distraction manual distraction cognitive distraction our internal user research team works closely and iteratively with the broader team to strengthen understanding of beam vehicle and driver interaction and I thought you get our future development our team conduct the four national research the studies the needs assessment usability evaluation quantitative surveys and formal driver distraction testing as well they are engaged in the positive working relationship with external organizations and they serve to date with the regulation standards and we do all that for partners and developers don't have to do it so you can see the our driving simulator is an expensive set up that can obviously simulate driving conditions we use it for many things including the detection response task that is one way that we use to evaluate cognitive load we also use it for eye tracking you can see on the picture KD with the a purchase on your face and we also use the oxygen glasses they are little two that we use to simulate the driver focusing on the road and glancing a DUI they close on the open what I would like to say is it's a complex and expensive endeavor and again we are doing all that our partners and drivers don't have to worry too much about it okay so now also what Android is doing to app developers so let me said earlier we know that drivers want to stay connected and want to have them with interfaces or safe and predictable but the content the context and the inner and 3 nature of modern digital services can make that a challenge the concept of in kind for 10 men used to be more predictable now we've Android we are designing a system that is ready to safely bring into cars services that we know and use on other platforms and as we like as well Android is already a great platform for modern gentle services on phones on tablets on TVs on wearables and now we are bring that in cars as well the key to adapt quickly and efficiently to the wide diversity of women machine interfaces that we find in industry is modularity Android is abstracting away this input and output so developers don't have to worry about screen size or shape or whether something is touch or rotary we take care of that Android also provides in an Enka platform so developers can quickly to innovate and focus on building innovative apps without having to worry about all the details one way Android does the heavy lifting for developers is to template we designed a system that enables automotive-grade templates to safely and relatively perform the most common driving rate attacks those templates are designed to a little wild variety of regulatory concerns surprising for Spotify don't start to worry about what is the tap target size for some screens or on many items can be displayed on one screen in the given country or region we take care of that and another way we make anyway in recovery printable experiences with apps agile powerful the a bridge is not the most suitable metaphor for the amount of automotive space we've identified the key area for the car and that it's easy to switch between them and it's not only in our own and also platform you can see this today for a component in the best-in-class systems designed by our partners Rd and Volvo and be sure to check their demos after in the IOT and a droid and right outside here the most commonly used function are elevated so drivers can quickly and safely switch between them without having to make their way to an average and we also want the experience to feel personal and tailored we work hard to make sure that Android understand when a driver is in the car and can optimize itself to safely bring the drivers up and services Android is already built in with material support it's been a few years now and we are fully leveraging this framework in the vehicle to enable frictionless personalization we want to get to the point where a driver can step into a rental car and have an extra that is personalized and ready to drive now to the last portion what are the different ways that you can bring your app of service into cars Android is a common platform that millions of directors already know how to build for if you are already invested in general and radical system we want to make things easy for you Android as a platform does the heavy lifting and provide a set of tools and api's 2008 very easily with the car our goal is to have one single platform across every car let's look at that in more detail we want to be respectful of the time and resources the repair to commit to bring the app and services to the car that's why there are multiple ways you can integrate with Android also depending on the nature of your service of course and for few of those apps it will require a lot of more effort a lot more design time and possibly more cost as well but for most of the apps it would be less effort and less time that would be involved once we call full apps of services that need full control of what is displayed on the screen our last example here in the great center of the Volvo s90 that is on demo Google Maps is using dynamics volleyball and pinchable maps map tiles bringing a full app experience necessitate a huge amount of Numan and technical resources you have to think about target size type size then nice mode focus based system such as water input on touchpad all of this and required full testing capabilities to ensure that the resulting app is up to formal standards regarding driver distraction Waze is another example of an application that their food pixel control and you can see here presently in our Android also for your car screen version not all the apps on my application though for audio apps we've created a set of templates that safety offer all the misery functionalities in a simple predictable and safe manner here I would like to exempt the example of the OD cuit spot concept that is on demo as well you can see our oddly elegantly implemented the media station API the developer can use to bring their big app onto into house the templates are working on all our surfaces screen densities and inputs and there we go to the state for driver distraction and the great thing is all of the applications that are already working with Android auto for your phone screen or for your car screen will be working here as well without extra work from our developers and you can also see all these really really implemented Media Browser API and here presented with pocket casts we can find your content easily and safely in as well at least immersive and write in place in the car messaging is one of the major use case in the car for SMS but also advertise whatsapp or Facebook Messenger or arrow the insulation with photo is simple and based on Android notifications all that is necessary is to integrate with our external objects with a policy voice centric messages experience for your users this is another example of the Media Browser media stations implemented with appear one but here you can see whatsapp notification or or showing up we've made them working great for safe and profitable use on the phone that is mounted on your dashboard of your car and the great thing is that without it work for whatsapp we can make it work on different form factors here and relative for your for your car screen and that is working for touch but also focus based systems such as rotary input another way to integrate with photo is to the Google assistant assistant with absent services or inherently cross-platform and our voice centric nature make them ideal is rated for in-car use the next speaker is going to talk more about that and so we not explaining to two more details here so that's what we are working hard on to enable a healthy ecosystem in with Android we work hard to abstract away the complexity and provide developers and car manufacturers little robust up-to-date and secure platform now I'd like to welcome Channel stage to talk more about or you can liquid integrate with the good assistant on Android auto thank you then Thank You AJ hello I'm Chen technical lead and manager on the Google assistant on Android auto team and I'm here to tell you about how you the developers can engage with users in the car see if this scenario sounds familiar you're running late for work can you rush out the door on your drive you think back to yourself that I actually lock the front door wouldn't it be awesome if you could talk to your car and say okay Google did I lock the door or maybe on that same commute you're thinking what meetings am I actually rushing to or I better not forget to buy milk before I go home it'd be great if you could talk to your car and say what's my next meeting or remind me to buy milk before I go home these are all things that the Google assistant can help you with and more importantly you as a developer can make your services available via the assistant as Adrienne mentioned before voice input is critical in the car for safety reasons we want to make sure the users keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel while the users are on this journey we want to make sure the user stays connected they can get things done and stay entertained the Google assistant can provide that intelligent and conversational voice as we move from a mobile first to an AI first world we want it to be the ultimate copilot for the user in the car users are spending precious time in the car and we're making the assistant help the user complete the mission and make the journey fun with the feature called my days you can say okay Google tell me about my day and the suspense will tell you about upcoming calendar events reminders commute traffic so you can hit the ground running when you get to work on the road your assistant can tell you about traffic ahead or show you gas stations if you need to make a pit stop if you're bored you can ask the assistant to play that favorite song you've downloaded or listen to a variety of music and podcasts we know that staying connected is very important for users on the road so we make calling and messaging easy with voice actions like call mom send a whatsapp message or read my messages many of these experiences are only possible because developers like you has implemented the write API so thanks you for helping us create that great user experience since the assistant is cross surface will help the users get things done wherever they are in the home and on the go Patrick and AJ have already talked about how messaging and media apps can integrate with Android auto for a seamless and consistent user experience in the car those were the templated and notification apps and a J's pyramid that want to show a UI so there are tons of other apps that don't fall under these categories how can you as a developer get your experience in the car without having to deal with the complexity of building a full automotive app and having to accommodate different screen sizes various inputs and outputs if your service can be voiced centric in the car and you want a lightweight integration for reaching these users then the good and Google assistant is a good option so how do you build for the Google assistant actions on Google is the platform for developers to build for the Google assistant the platform allow developers to reach users wherever the assistant is available the platform uses cloud execution so users don't need to pre install any app when they ask for your service by name you'll be connected immediately many developers already building for the actions on Google when building for actions in Google there are three key pieces that need to be defined by the developer invocation triggers dialog and fulfillment let me illustrate with an example I like coding and I like fortune cookies so I want to build a service that gives me a daily dose of coding fortune cookies so the first step is I need to define my invocation trigger how does the user connect to my service what do they actually have to say in this case I'll make it simple whenever the user says talk to coding fortune cookie then the Google assistant will connect the user to my service the next step is dialogues so once the user is connected to my service how do I talk to them what kind of information am i asking and what kind of responses am I expecting i what are valid responses what are invalid responses in this case I'm going to make you a simple question do they want a Java or C++ fortune cookie so there are only two valid responses in this case so let's suppose that the user picked Java now we can move on to third third step which is fulfillment for fulfillment I have all the information that I need so how do I go about committing that transaction we're executing that action on behalf of the user so in this case I'm going to look in my banks of Java fortunes and I'm going to pick one out for today random one today's fortune says Cody sure says for true happiness prefer interfaces over abstract classes that's when I actually use everyday that's a high level view of actions on Google the Google assistant and actions on Google are coming to Android auto and will open up a wide possibility of these cases agents and services are built on top of the platform will transfer over if you think that users will interact with your agent or service in the car it's a good idea to start thinking about what is the user experience that you want to build for that special context one card specific consideration is safety and driver distraction how can you build a user experience that both minimizes driver distraction and allow users to get things done and stay entertained let's think about some potential use cases for engaging with users in the car what is possible here one idea is reservation it's a Friday night and I'm meeting up with my husband for dinner we pick out a restaurant and on the way there I would love to be able to say book a table and have that table waiting for me by the time I get there what would be even more awesome and magical is the Google assistant and that third-party service can suggest a good reservation time that takes them to account my location traffic and maybe parking availability so I make a reservation for a time I can definitely make another ideas food ordering I'm working late on a weeknight and I'm too lazy to cook on my way home I would love to be able to put in an order at my favorite restaurant and have that food delivered and arrived at my home by the time I get there saves on time saves on cooking like I mentioned earlier how many times have you driven away from your house and can't remember whether you've actually locked the front door be very cool if you could say okay Google my door or did I lock my door just lock it another one is life I'm driving home and I actually hate walking into a dark house because I'm actually afraid of the dark it would be great if from the car I could just say turn on my living room light or turn on my dining room lights and I never have to walk into a dark house again games and entertainment how many times have you and Ron long road trips with kids where you struggle to find a way to keep them entertained would it be awesome if you could say okay Google entertain my kids and have games that are age-appropriate for different kids so they can play whatever they want they stay entertained and I can focus on the road these are just some ideas on ways developers can engage with users in the car I look forward to what creative ideas you come up with please check out the actions on Google site where they're actually code samples and tools that help you build the dialogue and triggers and fulfillment steps so that makes it easier to bring up your service we also have demos at the IOT and Android domes will actually be showcasing some of the use cases that I just talked about including controlling hue lights and auguste door locks directly from inside the car thank you and back to Patrick thanks Jen it's really exciting to see a new way for developers to easily extend their services into cars with conversational voice powered by the Google assistant we hope to see many new types of apps and use cases by next i/o you also heard from AJ earlier on how media and messaging apps can extend into the car through a scalable way without Android Auto templates and notification extensions Android auto and the Google assistant abstract most of the complexity of automotive development so that you can just worry about building a great app and experience for your cars or for your drivers this model has helped Android auto grow to be the largest in-car ecosystem today and it's about to get a whole lot bigger with the Google assistant with 10x growth and users over the last year and new partners like Audi and Volvo building Android directly into their cars we know that developers are going to have plenty of eager drivers out there who want to stay connected on the road so we're excited to continue this road ahead with all of you to build the future of automotive infotainment and create a safe and seamless experience for drivers everywhere thanks and enjoy the rest of the show [Applause] [Music]
