 so it's Salesforce I run our business development team as well as our strategic product alliances team we talk about the customer success platform of Salesforce and really what that means is we're trying to allow our customers to connect their customers and completely new ways people are using tools in different ways they're not working in silos they're trying to work across departments and that's really what you know a lot of the integrations we're talking about here today are helping people to do when we look at where we're headed now teams are focused on Best of Breed applications so i need the best xlendi the best apply to get my job done and i wanted to feel like a consumer experience people want that in the workplace and I think that's trend that started the show maybe four to five years ago and it's accelerating I mean flax a great example where communication mechanism that more reflects how people have really interact in today's world similar to an acquisition that we made last summer with a company called clip where it's the next generation of productivity so the team's goals really are to identify the best technology companies that we can work with to help bring the customer experience to a better place black addresses some of the productivity needs and the ability to have a communication experience integrated seamlessly with Salesforce we have over 1,800 companies already that have started using it we're pretty excited and that's the beginning of hopefully what could be a longer term partnership [Music] I Brad Armstrong iron visit development and partnerships here at slac our partners include the icons of enterprise software IVM Salesforce Google these are our partners in defining the future of work and today we're incredibly excited to be announcing our partnership with SI p one of the most important enterprise software companies for over four decades as the original disrupter and business applications sae helped pave the way for slack and now that we've arrived in the enterprise we're working closely together to bring key work flows from across SATs entire portfolio of applications into slack in doing so we're providing the integrated experience our mutual customers have been asking for I'm very excited to bring on stage with me David reganes group vice president of products at successfactors and John given vice president of platform that concur to tell you more about the partnership [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] gentlemen thank you for joining us thanks for evidence yeah they so from concur to success factors to HANA cloud platform SATs building on the slack platform let's get into what that means Dave let's start with you at successfactors tell us about what you're building yeah so as many of you know success factors grew up in the talent management space and cloud in web in mobile so what's next one area that we've been really intrigued about is this idea of conversational interfaces you know imagine if interacting with success factors was like having a conversation with your HR business partner right you could ask questions the software would take actions powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence we call this conversational HR and when we thought about this really the best way or really the first way to bring this to market we of course thought about slack so I'm excited to show this to you guys today this is our first spot from successfactors let me keep this up before we go into the demo so what you're going to be seeing this is our new continuous performance management capability so this is all about conversations driving better performance within your workplace it's not about annual goals anymore it's about those rich collaboration that you want to be able to do in slack and other tools so why don't we jump into the demos everybody did they have to look so what you're going to be seeing here this is Samantha she's in slack she's going to be adding a new activity she has a board meeting coming up so she's able to add that activity directly within slack associated with a goal that's been success factors and then two weeks later when that activity is complete she's able to market complete it becomes the achievements that shows up on her annual performance review so in the end it's the review that's writes itself you don't have to write your in a review anymore it's all about those rich collaborations that happen in flac updates between you and your manager while you're getting work done yeah this is this is so interesting and you know it really just underscores the way that you're changing how performance management software is is done and how it works right you're making it more actionable more iterative more immediate for the end user yeah i mean one one trend that we seeing in the workplace is a move from top down HR driven processes and performance is much more about those ongoing conversations that you're having whether it's with your manager with your team in in the course of getting projects done you want to be able to have those conversations directly in the tools that your working day to day you don't want to have to go to the success factors web app or the success factors mobile apps you want to be able to interact with success factor directly where that work is getting done and then we're lack kind of the backs platform for that yeah I mean flax is the best platform for that because it's where that work is happening right so you're you're collaborating in the moment you're working with your team so why wouldn't you want to also interact with success factors at the same time it's great you know I can't wait to see this one get rolled out I know the Dave you've also been close to the HANA cloud platform team can you tell us a bit about what they're working on yes so you know we like to talk at fape about the best run businesses Ron ASAP software so so John and I've we both represent application businesses that sa p but one of the things that we're deeply invested in as well as this idea of platforms and our platform as a service is called HANA cloud platform our tool for developing rich applications on that is called the ASAP web ide it was built by SI p developers for SI p developers and what we're proud to announce today is a new slack plugin for the web ID it's all about enabling those rich slack channels in opening those up in the tool itself so you can have those interactions while you're building software and at the end of the day it's all about creating better software through slack as their CEO likes to say it's a beautiful thing I think it's a beautiful thing too so we have HR performance management we have chat ops John you're the head of platform at concur tell us about what your can crap does well sir sure so we'll talk a little bit about I like sir talk a little bit about the chicken crap so basically can go in and you can look at an itinerary see when you're flying out you once you're in trip you can go and put in an expense you can upload a receipt and then once you're done with the trip you're back in your day to day you're working in flac you can check out the status of a given dispensary work so we're trying to bring concur to where people spend their lives and increasingly more and more more people in the enterprise of spending their lives inside slack so the natural fit so expensive management is something we all have to do now that I work at a startup back to do a lot more of it myself it's impersonal it's complicated concurs got a long way in addressing that but how does this absolutely help me balance management and travel it's not super sexy is that what you're saying Brad it's what I hear it all in the eyes beholding I appreciate that I hopefully a concur we don't have the hubris to believe that people wake up in the morning with a bounce in their step going to their expense management tool we're trying really hard to bring to make it an easier for people to get in get their expense and their travel done effortlessly and they can move on to their job creating value for their company creating value for their customer move on with their lives right and increasing more and more people are spending their time their job in and slacks let's walk through a little bit and see what the capabilities you can do so let's say the first thing you want to do is Samantha Sam she's an engineer she's spending her life in slacks but she knows she has a flight later in the afternoon she wants to check that out she goes and she typed puts in the the flight emoji and just to remind yourself exactly what our tinner areas what her flight is so there's Sam puts in identified emotion she sees that what what time our flight is so great now she's in in transit she has a meal she decides to remind herself for that expense to put that that that expense and to concur travel and expense so she quickly is in slack she can type in an expense to remind herself that's what a certain amount of money she spent on a lunch upload that she's done and then she can upload a receipt right inside slack as well she's still in flax she has receipt she uploads that she can attach and later they can put that together and travel and expense so in the same way that you can interact with a valued colleague you can interact with concur right it's personal it's immediate is right there yeah gets the job done and we're trying to bring that right there so now Sam's back at her desk she's working she's doing some more work since she wants to know the status of a certain expense report so she can quickly go and just see the status of an expense report she doesn't have to go and remember a password and login and go to concur and understand where it drop down menus and all that stuff we're trying to bring these services where people spend their lives where they're working and we think that flock is some place where people spending more we agree we see it every day you know this is this would be really valuable to our end users and to our mutual customers you know the diversity of these applications you know from from chat ops 2 HR to expense management really demonstrate to thank the the breast of s ap's business I think it also demonstrates the flexibility of the slack platform that we're able to provide value for all these and it also shows that working with us is not really about pulling users away from your software rather it's about creating more engagement for them right another place for them to engage with their software with your software to create more value for everybody yeah I'm an amazing listen we're all enterprise software guys here up on this stage I think that enterprise software in general we were four years where we behind the consumer space right mobile and social these guys to consumer guys did it much more quickly and much better I think companies like ASAP ASAP becoming really more cloud software companies buying companies that are application cloud companies building HANA cloud platform around all of our core assets this allows us to do more innovative interesting stuff more quickly so when we go and find interesting cool new companies like slack that are really innovating in that space we get to integrate and we bring that value to our SCP end-users much more quickly so that's super cool so all this great investment cloud and class software that's happening across SI p allows us to more quickly in a base when you with crazy new innovative platforms like slacks we're super excited about that yeah we well we welcome the partnership now taking a step back as you allude to we've all been in the industry for some time and we've seen your the evolution of platforms SI p has really been a leader in every major platform right from from mainframes a client server to web and mobile and now SI p is making you know a big bet on messaging and a big investment in slack I'd like to hear your perspective on why ICP is making that investment now yes so so SI p we you know we sell to the largest companies in the world we sell to Fortune five under global 1000 companies and when we sell to the head of IT or we sell to the head of HR or the head of finance once they're telling us more and more is it's really all about engagement right it's about engaging their employees when they're doing the work in their day-to-day work so it's not about going to an essay p application anymore it's about those SI p applications going to where work is getting done so that's why flak is so powerful in the end as grid is so powerful because this is what our customers want so it makes a ton of sense for us to to work closely with you guys yeah bringing bringing our services our array of services or larger racers Ness AP world to where customers are spending their lives and increasing their lives inside slack makes complete sense well today is a seminal moment for slack we're launching our enterprise grid product it's designed for our largest and most complex customers with whom I think you have some familiarity so having you here today to usher us in to the largest enterprise customers is something that we really value I want to thank you guys for being here today i want to thank SI p for your partnership we're super excited about Fred Fred [Applause]
