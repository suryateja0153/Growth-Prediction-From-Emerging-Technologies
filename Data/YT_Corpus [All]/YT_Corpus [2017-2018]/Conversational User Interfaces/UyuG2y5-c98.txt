 Thank you so much for having me here I just got in this morning, and I think somebody asked us yesterday But I just got a sense of who actually lives here in LA all right great I Actually used to I went to art school here. I want to Otis so I lived here for four years It's an amazing city. I'm really happy to be back. I actually used to live right by MacArthur Park Which at the time? you never went further east MacArthur Park is two miles west and at the time you never went further east and He certainly didn't get further east two miles further east to hang out with a bunch of designer So this is really kind of amazing to be here, so thank you for having me As we said before I work in Adobe my title is principal designer I I work with designers. Who are our customers folks like you guys who are on the front lines of today's creative problems? I also work with the designers back at Adobe who are evolving Photoshop and illustrator the apps that you know and also you know I'm focused on Adobe XD which is our new and in UX UI design tool I'm not gonna spend any time on that I'm here to talk to you today about two things first Careers and also I'm going to talk about design writing And I'm actually gonna cover some of the same territory that amelie covered in terms of talking about critique or criticism Actually she and I just met even though we both live in New York were both designers and she works, New York Times I used to working our times, and we actually showed up with decks that actually cover the same territory But completely coincidental, and hopefully I will Add to what she had to say rather than boring you with the stuff that she had to say so eloquently Some of you may know that I have been writing a blog at subtraction calm about design and technology For a long long time almost embarrassingly long. I've written thousands of posts there, and it's actually been a great Platform for me. It's been a great way to get my ideas out there to meet other people too get new opportunities I'm really thankful for the blog and for the audience at some point The like the I wanted to take the the original Inspiration for the blog which was in my love of writing and actually turned that into a book and in 2010 I wrote this book called Ordering disorder a grid principles for web design in which I tried to take what I had learned as a print designer the rules of of Typography and layouts and grids and try to translate them to the web in a in a native way in a forward-looking way And the thing about writing books is that they're really hard and even though I had written these thousands of blog posts I Really froze up when it came time to write the book and my ambition was to write this This book that might be you know kind of a timeless classic that would really talk about great design principles not just what was on the web and ultimately I think I really missed the mark for a lot of reasons because I think I'm just maybe not a great book writer also because It's genuinely hard to write a book. That's that's interesting and substance 'iv about design, and there are a lot of reasons for That if one is design is really not very well understood And it's hard to to grow the audience for design I actually think that's what writing about any art form should be about it should be about Growing that audience and getting more people to understand what that art form is about Yeah, but I did I didn't really give up on that idea of writing a really sort of timeless book a couple of years ago I wrote this book called how they got their interviews with digital designers about their careers and the inspiration for this book was One it was kind of the book that I wanted to have Or I wish I'd have had when I was just starting out in my career a book all about How people got started how they got their first big breaks how they got Over there their you know their biggest challenges how they dealt with failures how they turned their passions into sustainable careers and ultimately really successful careers and so I Talked to you 14 designers folks from Kind of all over the spectrum folks in the first decade of their careers folks who had been doing digital design for longer folks from startups late stage tech companies agencies Independent studios, I also talked to this guy who you may remember from yesterday and He had a lot of really interesting things to say and I hope I don't embarrass him when I quote him a little bit later so the act of writing this book Was interesting to me because I'd had so much trouble writing the first book and so I said hey I'm just gonna talk to 14 people. You know I'll talk to them on skype I'll record what they have to say and then I'll upload it to the service I used called rib comm which which charges like a dollar a sentence or something like that to transcribe it and Then and then I'll have a book what could be easier than that right? But as soon as I got the transcripts back I realized that like the missing step was you really have to edit it every anytime you engage in Writing about design or writing about anything. I mean and even Transcribing interviews and turning them into a readable form is a form of writing you have to apply Like a kind of critical analysis you have to put on an author's hat and try to Make all these interviews work together in a way. That's enjoyable and readable and and valuable to the user and Just transcribing what they had to say was just not working out because like what you have to say Conversationally doesn't doesn't translate to the page in a very elegant way So I'm gonna spend a little bit of time talking about what these 14 designers told me And I'm gonna get back to this idea of writing whoops so The first lesson that I want to share with you is That there's really no straight path in design careers And this is maybe the most obvious lesson and also It was something that really underscored for me the idea that a lot of what we want to know about Careers is already obvious to us, but we only understand it academically, and we don't yet understand it emotionally or Really truly have been able to internalize the lessons because we haven't experienced it for ourselves And we can get a little bit of a jumpstart on that by hearing stories from others because it human these abstract lessons so this lesson is Really about the fact that Everybody has misfires everybody has meandering paths. They hit dead ends, but ultimately they they get over it This is a quote from erica hall Who co-founded mule design in san francisco? She said I love looking back at the things I tried that totally didn't work out things go horribly But somewhere down the line that thing that went horribly is going to totally help you do something really Fantastic and that really underscores the idea that success is really the latest iteration of a series of failures Self-taught skills can matter as much as formal education. I'm gonna Talk a little bit about formal education later, but this is actually something that Alex said, but Alex. I'm really sorry He said that The act of consuming design looking really closely at designing and trying to understand what it is and teaching teaching him Through that that learning act was really valuable to him at a certain point if you look at enough good design over and over again You can't help but try to consciously or subconsciously replicate what you see The next lesson is self-doubt is a frequent companion and actually hearing this Was a bit of a relief to me because throughout my career I've often felt like you know like I really didn't belong there. You know they call it impostor syndrome it's actually quite well known now but It's really worth hearing it from folks. Who who you really admire, and I really admired and cedar home co-founder of dribble he actually has Convened this amazing community of people who are all pushing the craft forward And he says he still feels like a fraud frequently he says even though. It's a cliche. He says. It's true. I Think it's that it's also healthy and that it keeps you on your toes. It keeps you wanting to learn more so basically this idea of Not always feeling like you deserve the success you had is very common But it's really powerful to be able to use it as fuel to get you further in your career At some point you have to take a leap of faith What I heard from a lot of these designers was they had achieved certain levels of success, but that level didn't really Comprise the totality of their vision their ambitions and so they they decide to just go and push themselves off To another to another level and take a big big risk. This is a quote from ignition against Barska, who? Went to Cooper Union in New York And then got a job at funny garbage which at the time is one of the best places to work Anywhere where the best design studios? She said there's just came a point when I felt like I had grown as much as I could grow in that particular environment It was a five year job I started out of school, so I just said okay, what else is there, and she had no idea What was next and she went exploring and it led her to form her own studio? It's called kiss me on polish, and they've done incredible work, and they're still going strong It's the last one I'll share is the idea that there's really no getting around being a business person And I think this is something that a lot of us struggle with especially early in our career Jim Reagan Gore is a co-founder of a startup called branch they did really well. They were acquired by Facebook He said throughout that whole experience the toughest thing about being a designer co-founder is Not managing a team or contending with the co-founders but there's a tension between being a maker and a businessperson, and we've all experienced that we go into this into this field because We are passionate about design We think we can just if we can just design all day long everything else is going to take care of itself but at some point we recognize that in order to Do the design that we really want to do we have to engage with? the rest of the world with the business side with the marketing side with everything else so Looking at the 14 designers that I interviewed I Tried to step back and try to understand some of the bigger patterns They're trying to understand where they came from and this process actually helped me get a little bit of a more nuanced understanding of this this sort of truism in the field that digital designers can come from everywhere and I think this started because our field is still relatively new and Especially in the first decade when nobody had really built a website nobody had really built an app That works on your phone or or is a surface that spans multiple platforms before People really did come from everywhere to to figure out how this stuff would work But what I found is it's maybe not as true as it's been repeated over and over I mean if you look at these 14 people and what they recently started out doing it at first glance you might? Believe that you know they really didn't come from traditional design backgrounds they came from computer science or architecture or film or philosophy And then of these people only about five of them really had quote-unquote proper design education but if you look more closely a Lot of what they studied you would you could say is sort of adjacent to design or put another way? It's there were fields where it was almost inevitable that they would run into design encounter or the world of design and actually At least dip their toe into it, and then if you think about what people did after they discovered design a lot of these folks went off and got proper design education so What I the conclusion that I came to is that it's true that successful designers can come from any schooling But design schooling is most common. It's still probably the most valuable education that you can get to to make it in this field The thing that really links all these careers together though is Adaptability and curiosity and these are traits that are incredibly valuable When you're digital designer because you're effectively working in tech you're dealing with the volatility of An industry that is constantly changing Generally every five to seven years the whole new platform comes along we have to readjust our Thinking of what design is and it's worth taking a look at that that macro pattern for a moment in the beginning when you worked in digital design you pretty much had the modus operandi of a An analog designer in that you said you know I'm going to design how this looks how its organized and how its presented and The software that you use and even the mode that you worked in was fairly single user you might go with a team To a meeting and capture the requirements, but then you would come back And you would work individually on software that wasn't really optimized for workflows or for sharing and the work that you that you delivered was Mock-ups or static output it was not Like multifaceted, but over time as the people that we work with As the people that we work with in the design process Engineers and marketing folks and and clients and stakeholders as they became more Savvy about design and as design became more important to them our processes got a lot more collaborative Also the design problems got more complex. We started thinking more multi-dimensionally we started thinking about responsive design and working across screens And then you know it was it's no longer good enough to just present a static mock-up. You have to really Prototype in some form so that you can give a sense of the behavior or the motion of what you're doing And so we went from I design how it looks to really saying we together design How it works, and that's a really fundamental shift over a fairly short span of time And and it's this change that has imposed upon designers work in this field This need to be adaptable to be flexible and you think about what's coming You know Josh was talking about about AR VR all that stuff is is also a whole nother paradigm shift Some of you have echoes and Google homes and who knows what Apple's gonna announce with a series speaker These are interfaces that really have nothing to do with Typography with grid layouts with anything. I mean I actually happen to believe these will eventually integrate with screens But even then you're gonna have to think about something you never had to think about before all you have to think about conversational design about the personality of the app about the pacing about About just entertaining people just just in the way that you asked for input So change can be really frightening when you're thinking about your career arc And so I'm sort of gonna close out this part of my talk Quoting Karen McGrane who is co-founder of bond art and science? And she said you she's been working 15 20 years, and she feels like she's got another 15 or 20 years to go I've seen lots of change happen I feel very comfortable that some new change will roll along and then I'll be able to adapt to it if I want to That's a great feeling it actually lends a significant amount of confidence to my work to be able to look back on Challenges that I've had rough spots in my career and say I got through that I'll get through the next one too and So actually this is where I sort confessed like there's 14 interviews each one was kind of like a little mini therapy session for me Because I'm also in the middle of my career And I was actually kind of astounded for her to say that she Doesn't worry about this next generation of people coming in and mastering the latest technology like that because the fact that you said you Persevere through these five to seven year changes over and over you're picking up an invaluable skill In in learning how to adapt and to change and that's it's an advantage, and I think we should should all Take a moment to appreciate that Unless you're brand new and you're better at everything than me in which case I have no advice for you So I want to get back to to this idea about writing about design, so I put out this book in 2015 and It got some some some nice reviews some kind notices But then I actually got sideswiped by some really very real criticism that Completely surprised me and kind of embarrassed me if you look at this cast of characters Really only about a third of them are Anything that you would you would say is close to you know being diverse? there's a few women and and not to me is a He's from Malaysia, so it doesn't do a great job in terms of underrepresented minorities at all and I was I was really embarrassed by this because I Fully believe that when we put stories of success out there We're actually giving a model for other people to follow especially people who are thinking about their careers And if you if if those people can't recognize themselves in these stories Then it's a failure on the part of people who are telling these stories So I thought about this a lot and in retrospect. I was really writing in a bubble I had this ambition to write a book that was gonna grow the audience for design And it didn't really do that because just under the surface I was really just thinking about the designers that I knew and writing for them and it's really hard to get context and perspective inside of a bubble and part of this is because This is sort of the default posture of writing about design. You're basically writing for other Designers and and the things that are important to us are important to other designers on the one hand that's good But it's really an echo chamber As a result I really do feel like the bar for writing about design is pretty low like most of what's out There is not that great on the one hand It's great that we're we're also Willing to share our thoughts and our learnings and and write about them, and and and create a really collaborative community But the other hand the fact that it's only designers. Who are writing for other designers is a real problem It's not good enough like we need something more than this To go a little bit back into history - when analog design was at its peak we had these fantastic outlets for great writing about design and great writing In the mode of design criticism actually have a slightly different take on the word criticism Then Emily did I feel like criticism is actually a kind of an art form? We had Emmy grey we had ID magazine we had a magazine called critique. Which was about looking at graphic design really In really deep way. We still have ienaga zine. Thank goodness there They are doing terrific work out of the UK, and I encourage everybody to read that magazine, but everybody else is gone And what we have now is Medium calm and there's some terrific stuff on medium but for for better for worse if you're gonna write about design particularly product design or Digital design or UX UI you're gonna put it on medium. This is where we've all decided that it should go And if you look at what gets bubbled up as popular on medium It's there's some good stuff. There's stuff about careers there You know there's there stuff that is helpful to us, but it's not really great design writing, and it's ER not good design criticism a lot of what you see are articles about techniques about how to Get better performance in your app or how to learn to do better better animation that stuff is great And I don't I don't take issue with it per se But then there's also stuff. That's fairly superficial surveys of what's fashionable in design trends that don't really look closely at the why of it And there's also just just rants like people like with an axe to grind who are just you know just it's just out to Let you know how strongly they feel about this or that which you know I mean take it or leave it Same is true for designer news that don't get me wrong. I visit designer news every day I end up reading a medium article almost every day as well, and there's some great stuff on there this is a leaderboard of what we're all reading right and Almost none of it is like good design writing almost all of it is about selling you on something They're selling you on an idea here I got this great new take on the way the way you should do motion or something or Selling you on a product selling you on An open position I'm trying to hire for It's not about critical analysis. It's not about looking deeply at what we're doing and in the context And this is because the people who are writing this stuff. You know God bless them. I mean it's its Designers working designers and what we need is a class of knowledgeable professionals whose job it is to think critically about design, but but who don't make a living by doing design and I Realized that may sound a bit unrealistic, but if you think about other art forms That's exactly what they have and that's part of the reason Design is sort of like this junior varsity art form compared to like the varsity players like architecture, New York Times has for many years had architecture critics writing columns really penetrating Pieces about the the context of architecture the why of it and in the implications Michael Kimmelman like nearly one appealed surprise for writing about architecture Can you imagine somebody winning a Pulitzer Prize writing about the work that we do I mean? It's it sounds outrageous, but it should be true because of how impactful our work is You know more Populace vain you know Siskel and Ebert Like they basically turn us all into film lovers they came into our homes every week and told us About the latest movies and about their ideas and and taught us the language of film criticism So practicing design and our practicing and writing about the same heart form it's not inherently bad But it is a conflict of interest because of all the relationships We have as employees as people looking for new opportunities as as As agencies looking for clients as somebody who might be looking to partner with somebody, and it doesn't allow us to Talk independently and independence is essential for worthwhile design and I mean worthwhile writing and criticism So I'm running out of time and I have so much left to tell you so I'm gonna try and speed through the rest I'm just gonna try to answer this question first. Why is design writing important? Why is criticism important if I think it's worth worth asking even though? I've told I've told you all this and I think there's there's a lot of arguments that can be made for this But I'm just going to talk about one today And the the reason I would offer is it's because we asked for it to be We as a profession have been fighting this battle for a long time to get a seat at the table and we were always saying we're just as Valuable as engineering or we're just as valuable as marketing we want to be a part of the conversation we want to be there taking responsibility for What for what gets done and and and setting the vision? So we do that, but we talk mostly about the success of design we don't talk about Failure we don't talk about designs roll when things go wrong. I mean I'm going to give you a few quick examples Think about Twitter and its cultural impact it IPO at stratospheric rates and then over the course of several years It just you know lost all that all this market cap At the same time Twitter hired tons of designers produce tons of design. I don't know if that's just Correlation or there's actual causation there, but I think given the impact of Twitter, I think that's worth asking I'm sorry that my remote went out Facebook you all there problems with fake news and with keeping people inside of their bubbles These are design problems, but the way they're portrayed in the media I mean literally this headline treats this problem as almost an algorithmic problem and almost as if it's not it hasn't been mathematically Engineered right, but it's a really a user experience problem This is a particularly painful example because I voted for Hillary I was a big supporter and a friend of mine Jennifer Kenan was creative director for Hillary for America She did amazing work. I couldn't imagine anybody else doing a better job than she did she and her team but because of the how consequential that that election was I Think it's really important to ask the design play any role in its failure And I think it's fair to ask this question because in 2008 when Obama won design was taking so much credit for that beautiful logo and that that wonderful corporate ID that wonderful identity system and all the Communications and now like there's no question about about what role design played here So you know design has ways this multi-decade campaign for for greater credibility And to get to the next stage, I think we all need to embrace more rigor and more accountability And so my career advice for designers is really next to being good at design Maybe the most valuable skill you can have is being a good writer and being a good critical thinker So I'm just gonna skip ahead a few slides, sorry Just to close with this thought often people say when they hear People actually trying to think critically about design that why is this person just trying to take down somebody else Why don't they just go off and do some good design work and show the world by doing good design work? I mean There's this impression that if you think in a critical mode that you're basically a crank right you're singing around taking Taking pleasure on other people's failures actually think you know to some extent that might be true for some critics, but on the whole I think criticism is actually a contribution to Any art form and it can particularly benefit ours. I actually believe that criticism and thoughtful writing these are inherently optimistic modes of thinking because they imagine a better world and I believe that if we all try to embrace this and and and ask for it and push for it that it's going to help get us as a Profession as a craft to another level of success and credibility, so thank you so much for having me
