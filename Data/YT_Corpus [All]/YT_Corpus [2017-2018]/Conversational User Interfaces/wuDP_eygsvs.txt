 [Music] hi I'm James jangula from Google's conversation design team and I'm sure I'm here to show you how to apply the building hacks of everyday conversation to create cutting-edge effortless frictionless voice user interface designs or Luise now a hack is a good thing in the sense of a creative quick thinking agile clever shortcut but I looked in the dictionary and the dictionary says that hacks are in elegant solutions so just so you know because this is how I roll I'm going to be offering you a feast of hack like but elegant solutions all courtesy of Mother Nature that said the title of this talk could have been are you getting down great you're all sitting down but think about it in a conversation are you sitting down is a mental hack isn't it a shortcut if you're on the phone and your friend or your whoever asks you are you sitting down they're not just asking you how your body is physically positioned in space they're actually telling you something they're telling you brace yourself for some heavy news you see we have this amazing ability and we take it for granted all the time with this amazing ability to look beyond superficial meanings and instead we seek out deeper hidden ones based on the expectations of how the world and how our culture works this ability is a reflex of what's called the co-operative principle so I'm going to talk about our instinct to behave cooperatively in a conversation not just to behave cooperatively ourselves but also to expect the same from others including software including virtual assistants which is why you're here today first we'll explore the co-operative principle human to human then we'll turn to different areas of conversation design where there are opportunities to apply the principle in order to create a superior user experience I'm going to show you how to make your actions more intuitive more comfortable more relevant and more likeable for your users and I'll show you how mastery of this principle will see you and your designs from some of the amateur pitfalls that make buoys so frustrating to use I'm going to show you a lot of before an example before and after examples redesigns so that you get the hang of it so let's begin what do you guys think of the following exchanges and what do you infer about the personality of the speakers Leslie and Max in particular how likable are these people let's listen do you know who's coming to the party yes can you play a song for me yeah so what's strange about these exchanges grammatically these are yes/no questions they're looking for yes/no answers but there's something uncomfortable about the literal yes no responses themselves what is it max and Leslie don't sound cooperative why does it max just go ahead and tell Leslie who all is attending the party what is the reason I want to know the reason why Leslie can't indulge max with a tune based on these brief exchanges would you want these people to represent your brand would you endorse them at all for employment probably not these examples show that conversation is more than just the literal exchange of information according to the co-operative principle we humans naturally assume and expect there to be an undercurrent of cooperation between participants or interlocutors of a conversation this applies to the truth of what we say the amount of information that we provide the relevance of what we contribute and the way in good faith we try to communicate clearly without obscurity without ambiguity in the 1970s the conversation theorist Paul Grice stated each one of these in the form of a rule known as Grice's Maxim's but for the sake of simplicity let's just call it the co-operative principle that's a nice umbrella term for our purposes so today I'd like to focus on the Maxim's of quantity and manner these are the two that will give you the biggest bang for the buck in the limited time we've got the maxim of quantity gives us a principled understanding of wimax and Leslie's yes and no responses were uncooperative you see according to this rule of conversation a speaker provides as much information as is necessary to advance the perceived purpose of the conversation but not too much and I'm going to show you lots of examples of that as well since Max and Leslie's answers didn't provide enough information to fulfill a purpose or to meaningfully move the topic forward they violated the maxim of quantity and that's what's wrong with those conversations despite good grammar you can find the maximum quantity in the supermarket in the condiment section doesn't the word tomato seem uninformative or redundant on the labeled tomato ketchup after all isn't all ketchup made from Tomatoes in fact the phrase tomato ketchup was once very informative since the tomato was an innovative substitution for mollusks in other words oysters mussels etc likewise when people say lady doctor or male nurse or white trash they're informative ly revealing their prejudice that doctors are supplying quotes supposed to be male nurses are supposed to be female and trash is not supposed to be white and insidious racial slur not funny this is an incident insidious racial slur that most people don't even realize so what's going on here people obey the maxim of quantity and they tell you what they think you need to know for better or worse and so often this happens automatically unconsciously this next example is really key pay attention I really need to drink have you been to the Eagle the answer is a question but Alex must be cooperating with Sammy this can't be a non-sequitur right assuming a cooperative principle we can actually make five inferences from the answer which is a question have you been to the Eagle One the Eagle serves drinks - the drinks are probably alcoholic let's hope so three the Eagles open for business is operational for the Eagle is nearby it's in driving distance it's not in Fresno or Nova Scotia and the Eagle is a place that family that family would probably like think of how important the co-operative principle must have been in terms of the evolution of the human species we wouldn't get much accomplished if we had to spell everything out unpacking each and every thought as if we had to explain how things work - aliens are unfamiliar with our terrestrial ways what Alex just did there on that last slide is an example of conversational implicature that is the speaker has just said something that leads to listener to make an inference in this case five of them speakers make implicatures and listeners make inferences all the time and these shortcuts are the fallout of the co-operative principle acting on a library of shared world knowledge knowledge that we share with our interlocutor in the next example we can make an inference that you probably take for granted so the sentence is last night I saw Chris at a restaurant with a woman obviously the woman was not our friend Chris's wife even though biologically his wife is a woman how do we know it's not his wife well if she were his or her wife the speaker would have said so in the interest of providing a satisfactory amount of information to move the conversation forward the maxim of quantity next example how much longer will you be fix yourself a snack notice how the superficial invitation to go make a sandwich actually indicates in the amount of time that the listener is probably not happy with what if the listener had said I'm putting my shoes on right the first listener would have been a lot happier the next example is already familiar but absolutes add some more context hey what did that letter from the IRS say are you sitting down and here's a speaker who appears to be uncooperative but she's actually being very nice hey how did the interview go with that guy from Dunder Mifflin well he was on time and he was wearing a beautiful tie we could be confident that the speaker cannot recommend this candidate for employment the primary piece of shared world knowledge that makes this implicature possible is our familiarity with the saying if you haven't got something nice to say about someone we write let's compare two answers to the same question how much did you pay for that shirt don't you love it I gotta get Vinnie vintage versus how much did you pay for that shirt don't you love it sure expense five letters and five is my favorite number and glad you laughed why is one okay and not the other neither one answered the question why is one good in the other bad it's because the first one has a basis and shared world knowledge which is it's not cool to ask people how much their stuff costs the afflicted your here is I won't tell you how much my stuff costs but here's where you can go and find out yourself now let's see how we can apply the co-operative principle and conversational implicature to really design here's an example of a conversational click ature from the Google home timer application a timers going off and the user says thank you what should happen next the assistance should infer that this is an expression of gratitude is only superficial drawing on her store of shared world knowledge the assistants should understand the half-light nature of thank-you in this context by implicature the user is really saying ok you can turn it off that will be all besides drawing inferences a good assistant should also observe the maxim of quantity show me pictures of the state flower of California the state flower of California here you go by the way it's called the California Poppy here the assistance infers that the user does not know the name of the flower otherwise they would have used it so she provides that extra info the quantity to fill in the likely gap in the users knowledge in this next example the user needs a ride so they asked their assistant to speak to drew her drew her answers and here's what happens next hello drew Verdier unfortunately I don't see any drivers within 20 minutes of you but you can try again another time and the interaction just comes to a halt cooperative is that cooperative here's one possible redesign of that application that would advance the users intent cooperatively and informatively hello drew burr here the nearest car is 20 minutes away does that work for you no I can check again in 2 or 3 minutes are you still interested alright seems more cooperative more likeable doesn't it I think so now this next example is a voet adaption of a real GUI the interaction isn't conversational either again it just dead ends comes to an abrupt halt at the end the context here is the powering a power user knows that the delivery charge is usually $4.99 yes ready to pay for this hour the delivery charge has temporarily changed to $7.99 due to the high volume of orders received it tasty noodle house would you still like to proceed to checkout no and the interaction just stops we can approve on this how can we make this apps persona more appealing more socially intelligent well here's my idea for a redesign yeah ready to pay just so you know between eight and nine tonight the delivery charge for this particular restaurant is $7.99 do you want to go ahead and place your order no in that case there are some other options in that areas that are pretty similar are you interested sure why not okay here are two other noodle places nearby noodle and doodle in Melbourne and there's Rosco puffin Valley Street so we've seen examples of informative assistance now let's turn to our users who can't resist the instinct to cooperate to meaningfully advance the conversation as if they were interacting with another human and how many people are going ah it's my wife and myself unfortunately cooperative informative contributions like my wife and myself will likely be rejected by the recognizer which is often built to expect superficial literal responses like the number two so that's so-called error that you just heard is actually an example of verbal cooperation if the recognition grammar can't handle cooperative responses then use the rapid reform strategy in the first level no match prompt for instance sorry how many was that compare up nice conversational prompt like sorry how many was that with typical buoy speech which would be something like I'm sorry I didn't catch that please speak the number of people in your party you can say for example to everyone seems to prefer the conversational version which happens to debunk the myth that conversational means long-winded and verbose in this next example the buoy offers the possibility of paying right now with either Visa or MasterCard but notice the way the user is prompted to respond great you can make a payment right now with Visa or MasterCard so would you like to pay now the bully seems to be offering an either/or choice but then serves the user a yes/no question so the personas intent feels ambiguous the recognition grammar was designed to accept only yes/no and synonyms so cooperative users who said things like yeah Visa were served in arrow prompts you see if you know about the cooperative principle you don't need to find out about this stuff after the fact you can spare yourself time time-consuming and expensive user research or the damage control of having to make major tuning changes to your recognition grammar after the fact on the next slide we have a no input prompt that exemplifies a longtime industry standard let's listen I'm sorry I didn't hear anything what is your account number a no input prompt when the user hasn't said anything at all so put on the defensive a cooperative user would be justified in explaining a you didn't hear anything because I didn't say anything yeah it's likely that a user hasn't spoken because they haven't heard the question maybe they were distracted they weren't paying attention here a couple of more socially appropriate read prompts to get started tell me your account number yeah just paraphrase it and ask as if they never heard the question to begin with here's another way you could do it your account number is ten digits long and you can find it on your bill it's in the upper right hand corner just under the day in bluie design this reef prompting strategy is called escalating detail but the more general design term in other areas of design outside of hui is progressive disclosure think about it if I ask you a question and you don't answer and then I come back with you say I didn't hear anything that is so freaking rude that's bad parenting you can't do that stop it thank you this confirmations or wit but we've been doing that for 20 years or more yeah we have to stop this confirmations are when a user answers no to a confirmation prompt this confirmations are a particularly gnarly problem in Hui design and we can understand the challenge in terms of the co-operative principle in particular the maxim of quantity so here's an example of a confirmation prompt let's listen let me confirm that that's from Boston to New York on July 15 at 6 p.m. did I get that right now when the information is correct users say yes or some synonym everybody's happy but when it's wrong that's the dis confirmation uses elaborate and those cooperative details generally elude the recognizer as we can see on the right obviously it's not practical to put each and every one of these in your recognition grammar you're going to dilute the recognition accuracy as Tolstoy said in his novel Anna Karenina happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy each in its own way right that's what's going on here so here are some possible Reap prompts sorry with that right sorry did I get that right usability studies have shown time and time again that people just need a brief second chance to recover from a Mis recognition error this conversational approach stands in sharp contrast to industry cliches like this one if this is correct say yes otherwise they know when I hear this prompt I don't imagine a friendly face I see a flowchart I see arrows springing from boxes going from box to box this style is inconsistent with the assistant metaphor and so it undermines the integrity of the design of the assistant metaphor the assistant user experience unfortunately GUI users have had so many bad experiences with speech recognition technology and with amateur GUI designs that they've been trained over the years to say as little as possible they'll also take prompts at their literal superficial reading and they will not provide additional information that would be considered naturally cooperative they're worried that this might trigger a Mis recognition error and that's understandable we should design we should our design should accommodate for these cases as well for these users as well ok I said 1 your driver John should arrive within 6 minutes in a black Toyota Prius in the meantime do you have the address for your destination handy yes great what is it thank you 50 Charleston Road you notice I didn't serve an error prompt at that point I could have but I didn't I just like when a little kid falls in summer camp right you just pick the kid up brush them off they shiny over there all right don't make a big deal out of it just move along smartly so here user a is more cautious with speech technology or simply prefers a step by step approach as a matter of preference maybe it's something to do with their personality then there's user B who moves the conversation forward with the address right away as you can see on the right right they just give you address compare my easy breezy conversational proposal on that last slide with a popular alternative approach let's call this the neater flowchart approach in the meantime feel free to tell me your destination address if you don't have it handy you can simply tell the driver when they arrive go ahead and say the address now there's too much going on in one step for everyday users there's too much going on presumably this design is to satisfy the probe rep the programming metrics of economy and efficiency the design is neat it's just a single dialogue state a single turn with a single piece of information to collect but what if I don't have the address I have to wait through a timeout to hear the next prompt first we can't possibly know what a user what a user's timing out means B timing out for any number of reasons we can't ascribe Nats and NLP interpretation to a timeout we don't know what it means also making people wait in silence is disrespectful of their time it's abusive that's why I hate using who leaves for customer service because I don't like to timeout like wait through these timeouts my time is really valuable so this design strategy of having people timeout in order to signal some meaningful response is antithetical to what conversation and cooperation are all about the bottom line is that this type of design is alien to the true and natural way to manage information flow and turn-taking and this is the product of hundreds of thousands of years of this design just doesn't cut it if you're thinking that this slide is a cheap trip a treat a cheap trick a straw man think again design solutions paralleling this one frequently arise when economical and efficient appearing flowcharts are developed and deployed as Louie's with little regard to conversational expectations so start designing your conversational app with best path sample dialogues and then flowchart that the goal is to create a superior of conversational user experience not a flowchart that's meant to impress users don't care what your flowchart looks like give people their turn that's conversational so making users way through a timeout is one of my pet peeves as a GUI designer the next few slides feature yet another annoying feature of lots of Louie's another pet peeve another bet moi another Bugaboo I'm talking about applications that teach users what to say as if the buoy were a touch-tone application like for technical support press one for billing press two to talk about your plan plus three you know those applications so let's look at two ways to prompt users is way one for more options say how many more for more options say more options for more options they continue and here's way number two want to hear a few more choices do you want to hear some more choices now here are those same two approaches applied to a messaging app let's see which one you prefer here is your first new message from amber gomez received today at 553 p.m. hi I'm here you're not where are you to hear the message again they repeat to reply to it they reply and to move on to the next one they next okay thanks for bearing with that Q's way number two applied to the same messaging app here's your first new message it's from amber gomez received it 553 p.m. hi I'm here you're not where are you play it again reply or go on to the next one I think it's safe to assume we all prefer Hui number two right the implicature in buoy number one is that I don't know how to use English to get to the next message or to get someone to repeat why do I say that the persona wouldn't be giving me the instructions otherwise it's like last night I saw Chris at a restaurant with a woman or tomato ketchup person telling me that because they think it's informative to me so assuming cooperation to say repeat not to repeat the message say repeat is supposed to be informative the subtext is proceed with caution this interface is not intuitive your existing mental model of how English works will get you into trouble here follow my instructions or else basically the user experience is a linguistic straightjacket so avoid teaching commands in the Willing if you have to explain a command something's wrong go back to the drawing board this ain't touch tone the whole point of offering the public of lui is that speech is intuitive speech doesn't need to be taught a lot press 3 to do that or press the star key to do that this is cognitive load that's inherent to touch tone applications because no one was born knowing what 1 or 2 what pressing 1 or 2 would do but in the bully universe that inherent burden is now superfluous its unjustified changing gears a bit we've seen in the previous examples that saying too much is a violation of the maxim of quantity too much information implies irrelevant and buoys are despised around the world because the designers seem to have forgotten that buoy users are not reading they're listening and there's no way to fast forward in a boolean think about your own experiences and customer service applications calling the bank to the airline your cell phone provider there's no way to fast forward in a buoy there's no way to skip ahead of irrelevant messages irrelevant options irrelevant menus intrusive upsells legal disclaimers we've really users are at the mercy of the auditory signal will help captive to the linearity of the speech signal so many buoy designers have forgotten that buoy uses inextricably linked to the passage of time but irrelevance which is practically a defining characteristic of woo use is not inherent to the technology it's just bad design now we're at the forefront of an exciting new wave of redesign smart phones personal assistants talking robots and we use these devices voluntarily we pay lots of money for them now compare this with the first wave of who we design which is all about customer service customer service isn't voluntary so we consumers have have been a captive audience so to speak we've been at their mercy so I want to now look back into the history of buoy design and I want to look at what's been so frustrating about vou use particularly with you to relevance when I look at what's been so frustrating about buoy use historically and let's try to analyze our frustration in terms of the co-operative principle and hopefully we won't repeat those mistakes because nowadays we cannot afford to the audience is no longer captive in the new wave of really design from a technical perspective what exactly is uncooperative about please listen carefully as our menu options have recently changed the message you hear all the time a customer service it's irrelevant to pretty much everyone who listens to it and of course it would be absurd to try to fix it with the truth the message would read something like this please listen carefully one if you've called before - if the menu options have changed since then and three if you happen to remember what those options were the translation is please listen carefully because this interface is not not at all intuitive am I wrong by the way it's not conversational to introduce a reason with the conjunction as that's for literature this feels like a letter written by a bureaucrat a bureaucrat this is not a likeable person in contrast a good conversation participant keeps track of the conversation I'm going to repeat that a good conversational participant keeps track of the conversation they have an operational memory of previous contributions and therefore a contextual awareness of their interlocutor and this is what's wrong with please listen carefully as our menu options have recently changed its brashley in your face unaware of your context and this message never bodes well for the quality of what follows here's more irrelevance in another staple of the bui kits john raw please say or enter your 10-digit telephone number one digit at a time starting with the area code followed by the pound sign punishment if I work for those companies here's how I would design that experience what's your phone number for 300 980 and the area code nine one seven right Nandini's talk yesterday conversation there are no errors right I could have played an error prompt here but no no look shiny over there swipe your stuff off you're fine you'll be okay easy breezy bike ride through the park likewise on the next slide not everyone has to be a convenience with having to listen to this largely irrelevant message stop my service on what date would you like to stop your service this can be any weekday in this other than holidays for example June 25th please tell me the dates now I was offended I this is a real prompt from a real system i rerecord I played it in text-to-speech right now for you but when I heard this prompt I was actually offended why was I offended because it sounds like the personas accusing me of trying to steal from the utilities company she's implying that I might be trying to stop my service in the past who would do such a thing not me yeah it sounds like she thinks I'm trying to pull a fast one on the power company by trying to stop my service in the past that sounds like stealing I resent that here's what my regions my proposed redesigned for that application would be stop my service starting what date today actually as soon as I can self-service is tomorrow is that okay yes that's fine so I'm respecting the users time keeping my messages short and contextually relevant I avoid the off-putting implication that my user is trying to stop service in the past in other words they're trying to steal and this is an easy breezy lightweight interaction it's very conversational and my strategy here keeps the dial on on track here's another example from a utilities company more irrelevant you have reached the interactive outage recording system to report an outage please speak your responses when prompted at any time you can say help to get assistance in completing the current task if you are calling in regard to a natural gas issue say yes otherwise say electric the verbosity of this prompt is presumably to help users from getting into trouble with the recognizer but none of this preoccupation is necessary at least not yet and it sounds like word for a rough ride anything irrelevant here for users who are not having problems with this app well pretty much everything here's my redesign hello this is Sundance County's automated service for reporting power outages to get started are you calling about gas or electric I used to hear this voicemail recording pretty much every day at a company I used to work for the message was the following three new messages have not been heard nice to choke on that have not been heard part if a message is new doesn't that mean that I haven't heard it yet it's a little bit like hearing this Libre has stripes don't all beavers have stripes for me a new message by definition is a message I haven't heard in the same way that zebras have stripes but in this system a new message is one a message that has not been heard yet or - a message that has been heard but not to completion or three it has been heard to completion but you have an archived it yet seems like a bit much for everyday people to grok I bet they have others other things on their minds my colleague Margaret urban coined the term tech splaining it means giving overly technical information that's lost on everyday users like the following through your messages have not been heard so here's the message from a pretty popular voice only assistant she says I'm sorry I didn't understand the question I heard from everyday user it would be enough for her to simply say that she didn't understand she could even say she didn't understand the question why does she have why did she say that she didn't understand the question she heard she can't read it's only voice well the message can be paraphrased you ask the question I might have missed recognized what you asked be that as it may I tried to make sense out of what I heard which might not have been what you actually said but I couldn't figure out what that meant either so sorry for everyday users this technical nuance thinking distinction between automatic speech recognition and natural language processing new ones thinking that underlines the message is lost and the persona just ends up sounding a little bit weird and otherworldly so in these last few examples we've seen how an excess of quantity can lead to some of skew expressions which brings us to Bryce's maximum of manner which is in a conversation speakers avoid obscurity of expression and they avoid ambiguity so speaking of obscurity ambiguity I want to look at to you eyes whose technical use of language doesn't seem linguistically cooperative I'm talking about how technologists understand the prepositions NIR and in on Tripadvisor we see that near is used as a synonym a synonym of in but I'm a conference goer I'm looking for hotels in Washington DC not near Washington DC I don't want to stay near Washington I want to stay in Washington for everyday folks these words are not interchangeable but this novel use of near seems to reflect the technologists concern for a geographical radius a range of distance this unfamiliar unclear use of language causes cognitive friction now hold that thought if I'm in Mountain View California and I asked the Google assistant for movies nearby she tells me here is some movies near Mountain View well near me and near Mount View were two different things because I'm in Mountain View so she tells me here's some movies near Mountain View but the movies she shows me are in Mountain View so there's a couple of levels of mismatch here this might make sense to an engineer but to an everyday user it feels like above so this is something I'd like to see change and the solution is to just change near two around movies around Mountain View around Mountain View is pretty loose we understand it means in the vicinity of and rough informal conversational terms so instead of redefining words for users what about leveraging conversational language conversational language is itself a metaphor and what is a metaphor it's something familiar that helps us understand unfamiliar be unfamiliar so layer language is itself is itself a gesture of cooperation let me give you some quick examples and then I'm going to wrap up the email for this contact is invalid okay leveraging the conversational metaphor bin assistant actually there's a problem with the way their email is listed in your address book you might want to fix it later on okay here's another before-and-after example the bulb limit has been reached the rewrite it looks like you need some more time okay few more examples your payee list currently contains the following payee oh come on does your shopping list contain peanut butter I don't think so sure here's how you can pay okay last before and after the transaction was requested is now complete my conversational rewrite done or and that went through or okay you're all set so to sum up the co-operative principle is that the gut of conversation it perverts person perverts sorry about that it's pretty easy for me to say it pervades every turn and I did that every time I rehearsed it I made that same mistake it pervades every turn in a dialogue it's not an optional feature there's no override so imagine two types of talking primate one group communicates with the co-operative principle and the other one doesn't which group do you think has the evolutionary advantage also ask yourselves why is legal language so hard to understand so dense and so frustrating because the language of the law leaves nothing to inference the language of the law assumes that you're going to act out of self-interest and take advantage of any potential loopholes so it suspends assumption of the co-operative principle the difficulties that you and I have with legal language are evidence of the practical necessity for the evolution of the co-operative principle in human cognition and this in my opinion has been critical to the development of human civilization so the main takeaways from this presentation is that people are naturally cooperative we expect cooperation to and this principle prevails over literal interpretations and the rules of logic I've shown you the perils of irrelevance and conversation design it disrespects users time it challenges their patience and it reinforces frustrations with Louise in general but good Willy design optimizes for immediate relevance so sharpen the users focus and direct their attention by reducing auditory clutter respect the limits of short-term memory the advantage of offering of looy is that everyone already knows how this so leverage the inherent intuitiveness of buoy you don't need to teach touch tone style commands three recognition grammars should be constructed as much as possible to anticipate verbal cooperation and let's please be more humble about what the industry calls recognition errors this adjustment and attitude is sure to have an effect on the tone of the messages we write in response to so called miss Rex for personalization means more than saying welcome back Pat truly satisfying personalization should begin with at least being informative and relevant from the users point of view so we haven't had much time today for a topic this big once we start delving into the complexities of conversations design you see how vast this field really is but if you found this talk worthwhile we've got some great white papers online at Chico /dev actions design written by myself and other people on our design team there's quick reference guides this checklist there's videos for however much time you have one minute three minutes an hour a lot of great resources there on that site I believe we are out of time getting a signal phone Monika's there yes we're out of time Thank You Monica I'll be in the sandbox outside if you guys want to talk [Applause] [Music]
