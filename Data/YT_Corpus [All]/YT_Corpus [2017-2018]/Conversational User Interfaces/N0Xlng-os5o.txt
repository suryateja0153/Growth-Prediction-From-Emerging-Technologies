 - Over the last two months, sales and marketing teams have been using LeadBot, and it's been a total game-changer. They've used the LeadBot to capture emails on their blog, qualify leads on their pricing page, up-sell to existing customers, and ask visitors why they're there in the first place. Now this month, we've given LeadBot even more superpowers. First off, you can replace your forms. Now, with a click of a link, you can trigger a LeadBot conversation. So replace those buttons or share out links. It's super easy, and you don't have to be technical at all. Next, we made one-click answers. So now, if you have a default set of answers that you want someone to give, they can see those and click on 'em, and it goes right to the next question instead of asking them to type out an open-ended response. Last, but not least, depending on how someone answers a LeadBot, you might wanna classify them as different things. So for example, small business, enterprise, and premium leads. Now, you can create goals with the LeadBot, and when someone reaches that goal, meaning they answered the LeadBot a certain way, they get automatically tagged with that classification and then you can create segments to follow up with those people later. There you go. We're super excited for you to try this stuff out. Drift is totally free to get started. Go ahead and sign up today. Thanks.
