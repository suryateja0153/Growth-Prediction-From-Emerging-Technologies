 [Music] hi everybody how you doing there we go there we go welcome to day 2 at Google i/o I'm Senator Jordan I'm a developer advocate here at Google and you know last January fabric joined forces with firebase at Google a firebase helps you build better mobile apps and grow your business and fabric helps you build great apps understand your users and grow your business so you can see there's some overlap here and yet we've still been getting some questions from developers about this move and so with that hey let's get some people on stage who are familiar with all the details and trying to answer as many of those questions as possible so I'd like to introduce the panel first over there we've got Jason Titus VP of engineering at Google hi Jason everybody we've got rich Perret general manager of fabric like and we have Andrew lean co-founder of firebase good morning hi y'all doing good okay happy to be here so right very much so I think there's a I didn't throw me in there I hard-hitting question so well we're going to spend some time just on a few questions that I had that I've heard from developers over the last few months will probably cover some of the things you might have wanted to ask and then I have lists of questions from social media and hopefully we can take some of those and some of your questions as well when we get to that point there's microphones in each of these aisles I'll let you know you don't need to stand up now sound good ready great so Jason let's start with the big picture why have fabric join Google uh what if you heard yesterday it's actually really important to us that Google is working with the broader development community and that we're really making the best tools we can to help developers be successful and when we looked at what we've done at firebase were like really happy with with sort of a cross range a number of the things we've built there's areas you know and we looked across the over all developer tooling space there were certain things where there are other part other players out they were doing amazing work and and fabric was one of them where when we saw at the level of love that crashlytics and answers digits users had he said this could actually be something we're free brought these two teams together we could really be the best in and really be solving people's problems as well so it also it's very very worth noting to sort of Timothy's point earlier when we first got these teams together and we were going out to Cambridge to meet everyone and we were putting together slides to talk to the teams about hey we're all going to be working together it was literally okay we're going to have the mission statement of one team and the other and I'm like I'm not actually sure which one is firebases and which one is fabrics because it's they're really the the DNA the focus the passion of the teams is the same it's around helping you guys get your work done and and sort of relentlessly focusing on let's get feedback what are we doing well what are we not what our areas that are really hard for developers that we can make easier awesome so maybe taking a even one more step back and a bigger picture which is why is Google investing in mobile development at all well it turns out this mobile thing is a thing right i there is so much it's one of the really exciting things about mobile development right now it's just a level of innovation the pace of innovation I mean if you look we all take it for granted but if you look at almost everything we do like whether it's how people get around or cook food or meet their friends or take photos or whatever it's it's been changed and it's been changed by folks like yourselves it is and in a really short time window and so what we see is this opportunity to accelerate the ability of people who see a problem and say like here's something that really you know gosh waiting for a taxi really sucks this is really such a pain I wish there was a way you know you things like that you can actually use technology to solve but so much of the work probably 90% of the work ends up being sort of infrastructure at that nobody wants to deal with it is not about the problem you're solving and so we think if Google's is helps as part of that and helps you that we can be whether it's helping you on the backend with you through Google cloud or we can help you get users in the future as you grow with advertising I think it's a good thing for for our business long-term awesome all right let's get to some specifics rich means start with you okay um what's changed since fabric joined Google and what can developers look forward to sure I would I'll take it from the team's perspective I think the teams are really highly aligned as Jason said as you said the missions are so similar that we felt at home right away from the product side you saw a lot of things that we just launched right so crashlytics is going to be the default craft reporter for both fabric and firebase going forward we had a great digits launch where we're going to graduate that product into firebase own authentication and then on the going forward side something I'm really excited about crash insights which is a product that takes crashlytics beyond like the line of code that crashing your app to what are the root causes of those crashes we just announced that that went into beta and I'm really excited for everybody to use that and give us feedback so that's like a looking forward thing awesome all right Andrew what about on the firebase side so if you stopped by the developer keynote yesterday you probably saw a number of announcements from us we added phone number authentication to support both the digits customers but everyone who's using firebase off we launched a brand new performance monitoring product to let you time things in your applications we open sourced our SDKs we have better swift support we connected hosting to cloud functions if you don't know about cloud functions the product we launched in March that's been a big success we have over a billion functions have been executed in the last couple of months and there's a whole bunch of more announcements around analytics and gains other things so it's been it's been a busy time awesome okay so let's talk a little bit about the collaboration though how a firebase in fabric been working together since joining Google how did the team's meshing I think getting us sitting together in San Francisco was a big start right so that was a good one I think that you we did a lot of collaboration on the digits to our basic phone authentication and I've already seen we announced that yesterday and people are already using the automated workflow to link their digits accounts and their fabric apps to firebase and do a seamless migration it's like really important for us because it means that you're in customers don't have to do any work right and so I think that that's like the kind of care that we've been taking to when we work together make these things really seamless no no yeah I think has been a tremendous amount of collaboration even in things that maybe aren't visible so for example many of the fabric folks helped with the kind of the last few weeks getting ready first with a cloud functions launch and I helped with some of the hosting stuff that we did and vice versa so the bringing in kind of that new perspective at a new set of eyes to help us really polish our products has been really helpful as well awesome okay let's talk a little bit about some of the rough edges is there always a few so let's name them and talk to them I what are some of the rough edges that we're working on say the highlights that you have which sure so a really customer guided and we talked a lot of customers including ones that use firebase and fabric today and they're really leading the way in terms of how we're thinking about this integration and they say like listen I already know I've signed up for fabric I'm signed up for firebase I use the best of both platforms in order to build my app understand my customers and grow my business and from their perspective and from mine the rough edge here is they have to toggle between two dashboards in order to do that right so they might do one activity in firebase and they say okay well now that that's done I have to go open up fabric and understand something like the stability of my app or retention of customers etc and I think that we can do better there I think we can bring a unified dashboard experiencing so that's a rough edge that I'm excited about smoothing out awesome okay and this is a next question is for everybody let's talk about what's next now there's a lot that we can't talk about as far as future features and that kind of thing but what is it that we're working on the were excited about that we can share sure I can I can start with that so I keep talking about cloud functions but it's really very cool it lets you respond to events with code and do you know things that otherwise would have required you to stand up a back-end service with just a few lines of code you can get up and running a few minutes and we have a few event sources already you can get events from hosting as a guest today you can get events from your database but there are 16 products in the firebase there's a whole bunch of things over in in fabric and across Google that don't emit events yet for cloud functions to consume and I think we can do a lot better there and I'm excited to work on that Oh rich yeah I think I'm just going to build them up this is such a great answer I think that was one of the things that we were most excited about coming into Google was cloud functions and it's a minute launch and then when it did go out and we have a lot of customer data locked up in crashlytics locked up in answers and wouldn't it be great if we can take some of those events and link them up the cloud functions now no promises right in terms of like when you might see something like that but something that we're talking about a lot internally okay yeah I would actually on the data side to me that's like one of the one of the largest opportunities we're both from answers and from firebase analytics or now Google Analytics for firebase we have a huge amount of data we think it's really valuable for developers and making that available available and really easy to use through things like bigquery so saying you know we're going to give you a bunch of useful information and charts that are pretty good for everybody but if you want to go in and look at your users data to understand their your your usage data and such to understand like what are your users doing put together predictive models using machine learning or whatever like that is a really really valuable source of information for you to be able to to mine and and and work with in a bunch of different ways and we actually think that's something that as a company we're pretty good at and that we can provide a whole set of tools around that so I would say but whether it's meeting the events to do functions or giving you the tools to analyze data in lots of interesting ways or do machine learning on it I think those are going to be exciting areas for us awesome ok so now it's time for specific developer questions that we've been getting on social and from the audience I'll have you guys get in the mic with just a few minutes but I'm going to ask some of these first and let's start with a question for me for you two guys did you all know each other before joining Google it feels like so there would be some professional camaraderie there we we actually had never met so I had met the founders of fabric but I never actually met rich that's right I'm based in Boston Massachusetts so I don't get out here a - terrible amount but yeah the first time we met was actually in Cambridge when you came out after the acquisition rent nope yeah no we do have something in common though we shared when we were crashlytics before it was acquired by Twitter and then harvest for was acquired by Google we had a UH Co investor yep and that's how that's how I met Jeff and Wayne and I understand that you guys got a ski trip out of the deal and we didn't that's right yeah I turned yes it's if it bends on who's on your board I guess but now that we're together we can do a ski trip like a joint once an awfully yeah it's Jason approves it West Coast skiing yes oh okay all right and now that the teams are together you guys starting to share culture from the two companies you know now might actually be a really good time yeah I brought you a present Oh awesome so every year on June 27th is an important holiday in firebase land and it is bring your pineapple to work day okay so I just wanted to help you be prepared oh my goodness so that's for you thank you so much it's a very own pineapple yeah what is the origin of bring your pineapple to work that you know one day I just bought a pineapple to work because I wanted to for lunch and Jim said hey what's up with the pineapple I said bring your pineapple to work date he said that's not a thing that's that's my real holiday it said yeah it is when I put it on the calendar and I put it on repeat and then I forgot about it and the next year after we actually hired some employees we showed up at work and our employees it brought pineapples come instead was Hein apples knew like I don't know what's on the calendar got it so that's the thing that's awesome well I have a thing that I'm known for and I thought like you know I heard that you might be giving you those gifts and so I've got something for you and it's a little all green ice very nice we got to see this do you think I put it on yeah and I would take me over photo okay oh wow you look great dad that's a crime yes okay an evolution right before your eyes it's very good okay let's get to the questions all right first off is what will happen to answers Wow what will happen to answer it's a great question so answers of you don't know is the underpinning of what makes fabric fabric in terms of the real-time understanding of how your app is doing power is everything from Mau and VA you on the fabric dashboard to things like velocity alerts and crashlytics it's a really important part of fabric and something that we hear from customers all the time that they really love and value and so it's important for us to take that experience forward into a unified firebase and fabric experience very cool all right so I'm going to ask a few more questions but I'd like to invite you all to start lining up at the microphone so you can ask your questions as well they're very nice and informative with their answers so what about digits in China will it work got it so let's see so digits is a phone number authentication product that we announced yesterday is going to become firebase phone authentication and what's going on behind the scenes there is we're moving our back-end infrastructure from Twitter where it is today to Google and we expect this to be really really good for customers however if you didn't know how SMS authentication works you have to do deals with SMS providers carrier bike carrier country by country and as a result digit has worked up to this point sort of not intentionally in China and going forward it most likely will not work again sort of through circumstances not entirely in our control okay I think I think what we're talking about China I guess I want to just note that we do have a lot of customers that have a lot of end users in China and we've heard from you that it's really important like hey I need to understand how my app is performing in China and so message received and we're working really hard to make sure that those that that aspect of work and Google Analytics for firebase doesn't go away okie-doke so we'll get back to these let's take some the audience questions starting over here okay hello Michael um question to Andrew how do you feel about the mysteries that data spiking database database usage analytics like their article from the home automation from yesterday and we experienced that as well in our product that's basically the data usage spike in mysterious way and this key you solved it on let's say one-to-one basis and there is a no origin to that problem and that's organ we had this problem a year ago and currently dozens of other companies have as well so either any less a work in progress on that ok so I'll repeat the question here so I understand you're you're asking about the blog post that was published yesterday where there was a developer who had had a much lower bill and then there was a spike in the usage of that of the price of that bill and I can I can speak to that so for some context this customer had a number of IOT device Dell in awhile that we're pulling the firebase database and we we made a couple of changes that change their bill one of the changes that we made was that we actually started enforcing quotas on our flame plan we have a fixed price $25 month plan which up until very recently actually gave you sort of unlimited levels of usage even though we listed certain amounts because we actually haven't built the quota enforcement infrastructure yet and so we actually started applying those photos and requiring people that we're exceeding the limits to upgrade to our our pay-as-you-go plan so that was one of the reasons and then the other thing that happened the same time is there was a bug that we'd introduced laughs late last year that had miscounted the the network uses to the database so people that were doing a very heavy SSL negotiation traffic with us but otherwise using small data usage could see large changes in their day usage so the vast vast array of customers saw very small changes but a few cases and this was one of those cases where the vast majority their traffic was the handshake because they were polling and usually there was no data returned so it was this SSL handshake over and over and over again that was ringing up a lot of data use and so we're working to develop her directly and actually if you look at the blog post they've updated the blog post with some of that information and if you're having sort of similar things that you're running into I'd have to talk to you outside afterwards generally I'd encourage folks if anyone is seeing things like this we should we should talk it through so if you have a follow-up question maybe the Status page would be very nice for you to have maybe I think if I tell you that did you ask about the Status page yeah we we have a status page it should it should be like for our website if it's not well we'll check on that just have you have you it is if you go to firebase at Google calm and click on support' and can we for the next question can we either boost the mics or boost the monitor it's kind of hard to hear them up here yeah hi you said you were planning to merge of the book interfaces from fabric in firebase and I was wondering maybe there's a way now and I'm not aware of but in the future if there's a way to merge generate takes of firebase with the question takes five cents I could see for example for all my users that add to item in the cart that there's a specific crash in kind of one unified dashboard yeah that the question was about seeing crashlytics and analytics data to get it yeah and particularly I think like what you're talking about it's like an audience right that you can build and Google Analytics for firebase and then understand their stability yes absolutely that's something that we're excited about the possibility for that integration to happen you need time frame ah yeah we're working on it I think we're we're not going out with time frames right now not because we're not working hard at it but we want to be really thoughtful about how we bring these things together people use both our base and fabric to run their whole business and so we want to be makes you know cognizant and putting out really high quality stuff and being thoughtful thank you thank you back over here hey guys is that loud no yep awesome and so fabric has the suite of kits which is pretty comprehensive and just wondering what is the future of kids in Google and they're still going to be other partner organizations providing kits and is there anything you can say about that yeah it's a great question so we launched third party kid support directly integrated into fabric about a year and a half ago and it really exceeded our expectations I think coming in I think there's a desire to do some kind of integration here but it's really early and so I would heard you nothing about those integrations are changing today for fabric and we're looking for ways to bring for bring it forward but I don't have like a comprehensive strategy to share with you today I don't know if you want to talk a little bit more about that yeah I think there's one of the things we like about the the kit model is the idea that we can have best to breed solutions for different parts that maybe we might not spend as much time on and it's certainly if you look like I feel like things like cloud functions we would imagine that there's other areas where we might be able to allow third parties to provide sort of plug-and-play solutions right into the system but we do want to we want to merge it in thoughtfully and and I think some of the kids are more just co-marketing things of saying hey we're going to make let everybody everyone be aware of other products and I think we would probably be more thoughtful around what are the areas where we could actually provide developers with something they wouldn't be able to otherwise have through an integration thank you thank you and over here Hey I was wondering if you guys are going to plan on merging fabric beta and the alpha beta programs for Google Play yes hi really good question I think that is definitely something we're looking at that we feel like we have two great solutions in the space and you know these certainly if you look at the amount of investment the play team is been doing on improving the alpha and beta I think we it makes total sense to say the two things for the line and work well together yeah and the beta was the second product we ever shipped after crashlytics and we've seen a ton of investment both from play and then on the iOS side from Apple which has flowed and we've actually when we talked to beta customers Dave change how they use beta they're using it more for internal testing so we're actually talking to a lot of customers there are people over in the sandbox right now that work on this product and I encourage you to give them your feedback on how you'd like to see it evolved to sort of be more harmonized with both test flight and and play yeah because you use it internally and oh yeah the beta stuff for the Alpha Google Play stuff were external and I want to kind of like graduate that smoothly out to people that's we're highly aligned absolutely awesome I go here I say to you I was wondering that now part base and the catalytics are joining is there any sense for merging crashlytics and our base cut reporting great question yeah so we announced yesterday right that crash crash lytx is now the recommended crash reporter for firebase and for fabric and so if you're looking to decide which craft reporter to use you should be using crashlytics now we talked about rough edges a little bit here that does require you to use two consoles today our goal is to make that a simple single unified experience okay and there any guide for Migration I believe so but you know what come up and talk to me afterwards or go to the sandbox and we can walk you through it yeah and is there an existing firebase crash reporting user and you're happy bit tight yep will be providing materials to help you move over when the time is right but for now there's nothing you need to do are they thank you I actually have two questions the first question you guys talk a lot about merging the dashboards of the two platforms together which is great I have difficulty using Google cloud platform dashboard and the firebase dashboard and then the crashlytics dashboard and I was also wondering in terms of design they're totally different like fabric looks visually different from fire raised what are you guys thinking about how you're designing that for consistency so that customers come from both platforms feel comfortable with it look as you might imagine this is a very active source of discussion internally actually yeah we just actually had a design sprint bringing the designers from both teams together in New York City last week and it was very productive I was pretty inspired by the results and it's way too early to share but I do think that a lot of the visual elements here are going to converge in a way that feels right for both firebase and fabric customers and as far as the but I think we'll have a very clear sort of merged experience that I think will be both understandable and also sort of bring the best elements at each I think as far as integration with the overall Google cloud dashboards where we were looking very solidly at like where are the most common touch points between them now do we make those as smooth and straightforward as possible okay and then my second question you alluded to having bigquery support do you have any idea around the timeline I would love to be able to use bigquery to query some of the crashlytics stuff because a lot of the information we're getting is already predefined and preset and just having the granularity to be able to control that data would be awesome yeah I you're not alone lots of people would like that the team is really excited about that what with full candor of what we're trying to trade off is how much can we migrate crashlytics into Google owned and operated infrastructure and provide a continuity of service for the whole product and then how much engineering resources go to that and then how much go towards doing an integration with firebase console how much does that go into cool features like bigquery and so it's a balance we have a portfolio approach so I don't have anything to share in terms of like one you can expect that but that's something that the team is really excited about and we're looking at it is that it is definitely one of the things we view as as where we can provide a bunch of value typically saying we were you're generating a bunch of data using our tools about your users and your application and how can we then let you do great things with it great thank you awesome I'm going to flip then a couple questions here as well one of these that I've been hearing a lot is will Fastlane continue to be open source great question absolutely yes Vaseline was open source when we brought it in so fabric-like year and a half ago we've only grown the open source contribution we have core contributors Fastlane that work here at Google we also have a significant community of core contributors who work outside of Google so yeah we're definitely committed to maintaining the open-source aspects with a flame embrace I want to add to that so firebase in general is is committed open source as well and we're open for us our SDKs as you saw yesterday and this is an incremental thing it's gonna take us well to kind of get everything out into the open but that's we want to move in the direction of more open not more closed that's great and it's not too far distance from that is this question will fabric continue to support iOS oh yeah absolutely we have a really strong and loyal a tribe of developers that love us on iOS and on Android and we're going to continue to support them yeah it is really one of the things that was important to us when we were we were looking at fabric was saying you know we firebase has been from the start cross-platform and it's it's really important to us that folks recognize that and seeing the amount of positive feedback and attention from iOS developers for fabric was one of the great things about it okay let's go back to questions over here so do we expect Krusty to require groups based ivory suits one day it's a great question no plans at the moment I don't know yeah we're definitely looking at what the best way to get the SDKs working as broadly in the in the ecosystem as possible so that's thank you so you can also use Knights profiling tools yesterday for firebase either plan to integrate crafts age data with those profiling tools like a finding uh like the some traces like other than just their the stack trace but like memory states and Network States when a user crashes so Atticus yeah so this is definitely something we're looking at I don't think we have any particular plans we're prepared to share but one of the big value propositions of firebase is supposed to be that the products work well with each other so you know when you authenticate you get access to resources when you hook things up to cloud functions you can pass data back and forth you can export stuff from hopefully crashlytics to bigquery etc and this is I think a very obvious integration for not just Christ Linux but a whole bunch of products that we'd really love to know you know how is how is your database performing for example so we're definitely looking at that yeah I would I would say one of the great things about these two teams coming together is sort of conversations like that that are happening between the teams like hey here's what we're doing and wouldn't it be cool if we could hook these two things up so we could tell a more comprehensive story about the performance of your app so it's definitely something that seems we're talking about yeah this is it is it's important to note that a you know the firebase performance offering is it's this is sort of the one point I out the door but there's there we think there's a lot we can do with it across and giving really good performance analysis across a wide range of things and we have people are very passionate another space well we acquired a small company called pulsed IO that was just focused on this a year and a half ago or so and those folks were very involved in building that so we're really we do have people who are passionate about looking at performance as a problem overall and I think if you look at what we've been working on with the play team overall the Android ecosystem you'll see you can get sort of basic information on all these different issues that might be happening if your app in production and then you can go in and get more through firebase and my expectation is we'll do that more broadly across other parts of the company thank you thank you so five-eighths in fábrica but great products for mobile is there any plan to sort of do JavaScript era tracking and anything for web so I don't I don't think we have anything particular to share on that front right now in general the the web platform and the mobile native platforms have different requirements so like the types of things you would get out of a crash reporter are quite different the types of performance you might want to measure are quite different and so it's not it's not that we haven't seen interest it's it's that you know we had to start somewhere and we focused on the area what we thought was most critical but we're definitely discussing it and there are things that you can do with firebase on the web today yes absolutely so we have we have a full suite of the developed products is actually available including things like cloud messaging and and posting authentication and so we're looking at what else we should maybe bring over for sure yeah I think that performance one is one of the ones it's a little bit trickier that ya determine I actually had an added conversation with the developer last night who is very interested in getting support across all smart televisions which are all doing JavaScript space things but on different engines and it's it can it could be very tricky and so we'd want to make sure that if we were going to do something it would provide clear value and wouldn't just lead to the next question of oh sure it works on this browser but what about this embedded view kind of thing yeah thank you sure okay some more questions from my list this is this is one we've gotten it a little bit today is will you start charging the fabric question yeah so you had a really good story about like how you're thinking about monetization and you answered that question do you want to give a little bit of an overview about like how firebase is charging right now and then we can go into like fabric sure yeah so so firebase has products kind of across the spectrum from helping you build your app to addressing app quality issues to growing your application and many of the products that we offer are free and they're sort of intentionally free if they are in the app quality space which one to help you improve quality or if they're things that really tie in to how your app is performing and growing because Google has interests in those areas and the area that we charge for is the areas where we're helping you build your app so we help you store data we help you store videos and images we recharge you for cloud functions and I think the way this affects crashlytics sre fabric going forward is that we'll do the same sort of thing so the phone number authentication we support we have in firebase off we will be charging for but the the core crashlytics offering and the analytics offerings were will continue to remain free right and I think when you look at the view like line the products up side by side in terms of like what you're hiring them to do a lot of the stuff that's coming in from fabric has analogs and firebase today that are free and even digits the phone number off that's going to be free for about 90% of existing business customers that are going into to that product to so we try to only charge where we can in terms of volume and then again of course we hope you use the product like odd functions like real pen database and story to it would be charged for and this also does it come it comes from also I think an interest that I've heard from many developers you know some talks with people all around the world saying hey we've had some developer platforms in the past that we kind of depended on that companies just gave gave up on or walked away from or whatever and that's actually been pretty painful and so it's important to us that from the beginning firebase is a sustainable business for Google like if you're doing huge amounts of compute and firing functions all the time and storing vast quantities of images or doing massive database queries we will build that as a as a as a usage based thing and I think it will end up being much less expensive than it would be to do probably any other way but it ends up being something it's that makes sense for Google as a business if you know your company becomes the next snapchat that that's great for everybody involved and then on the things like app quality obviously we care a lot about having the mobile ecosystem be very successful we have very strong interest in that and certainly when you want to start doing things like growing and doing advertising to get new customers and things like that as a company we have a huge range of products around that so we want to say the things we do actually drive value both to you guys and to Google as a business and that should be visible to you so that you know that five years from now what this will all still be running and you'll be happy that you built your business on it I think you answered my next question we'll see if you have anything to add to it it is a will my stuff break it some date and feature yeah if you do not introduce bugs which we all do so yeah our goal is to be a good partner for you and that's actually you know one of the reasons why we have put more and more focus on creating a a clear strong supported subset across you know Google in the past had done many things sometimes done well sometimes not as well for developers and so we've said you know we have areas like Google cloud where as a company where we're behind it and I would say in firebase we're committing to you that this is something you can build your business on that it's going to work well together they should be be clear and and as I just said and you should hopefully be able to say oh I see if we do really really well I can see how Google is happy to have us as a partner and hopefully you've actually seen that with what we've done so far so firebase came in as an acquisition two and a half years ago the folks that were running apps from before that acquisition but it all still runs that use the same SDKs so I think we've demonstrated an ability to do that and we're hoping to do that again for fabric I believe with digits we've been working very hard to take this some digits customers as well that's right all right we have just a few more minutes left so real quick if I could ask you all what's your vision for the future what are you most excited about in mobile development over the next months to years start with you Andrew let's kind of look around yeah that's a big question um I'm very excited about the kind of server list space that you've probably heard about I think the bar for the sort of technical complexity to get an app running is getting lower and lower and with things like cloud functions and all the client accessible resources that we're building and other folks are building it's getting a lot easier just to build things I'm also excited about the proliferation of Internet connected devices we have you know light bulbs of Internet in them and the type of things you can do together with a mobile app at a light bulb and the system that you can talk to and integrated goes together I think is going to be a very exciting space as well you guys want to add to that yeah I think so I started working in this space about five years ago with crashlytics and I was really struck by the fact that they're like oh yeah your app can crash and developers just they have no way to know right and I was like boy it's like the Wild West right in terms of like zero infrastructure capabilities we've come a long way with things like firebase and fabric where we're doing a lot of the heavy lifting so that you guys can focus on what's value-added about your app and not having to recreate all of these things I think we're at the point now where I'm excited about hey now that I have laughs and I understand my customers like what are the tools that I need to really grow my business and how can things like machine learning help me understand what my customers are doing in my app and help me make a better app that either you know is more touching the customers or helps me engage in retain the customers I already have and there are a lot of things that we have in that space there are a lot of other things that other people have in that space and I think it's like an exciting direction for mobile yeah I think the overall the machine learning piece and the capabilities around that to me are how do we make it I feel like we're doing a reasonably good job taking away some of the lower-level infrastructure like just grunt work that folks have had to do and we've been bit by bit raising the bar but if I look at to the future like I would love actually I had I had an interesting conversation with somebody from the press who's from Montreal and I'll butcher it but I think they had this he was saying there's apparently some kind of meat that is the like maybe a hot dog kind of thing or something in Montreal that everybody does and he's like I was always talked about machine learning and I'm not really a programmer but I thought I would make an app that would let you take a photo and recognize whether the thing was the real Montreal hot dog type thing and and it was like wow that's great that somebody feels that we're almost there like I think we're still little ways from that but I the the power of that idea that we can't I don't think it's that far and I think we can start to say if you have something that you see as a problem even if you're not tremendously technical you could actually go solve it and if you are really strong technically you can do amazing things we can give you magic powers like I was I was at Shazam for three and a half years and one of the things I loved about it was for that moment in time it was making technology that felt like magic and machine learning is that again and so I think for us what we can do is give you guys tools that allow you to incorporate that into your applications in meaningful ways and just keep adding layers of really useful and powerful infrastructure so you guys can go after whatever problems you see we also have a whole talk on firebase machine-learning tomorrow morning oh there you go all right I think that's an excellent note to end on thank you very much for being on the Stan and thank you for your great questions thank you [Applause] [Music]
