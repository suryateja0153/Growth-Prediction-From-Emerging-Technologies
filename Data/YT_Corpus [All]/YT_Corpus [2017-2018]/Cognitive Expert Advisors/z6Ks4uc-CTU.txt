SUCH AS TONIGHT'S SPEAKER, MARITA GOLDEN WHO WILL TELL US ABOUT THE WIDE CIRCUMFERENCE OF LOVE. TONIGHT I FEEL AM SURROUNDED BY THAT CIRCUMFERENCE OF LOVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] TONIGHT WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE MARITA GOLDEN. A WRITER WHO HAS DISINTEREST HERSELF AS A MASTER OF FICTION AND NONFICTION, MARITA GOLDEN HAS SAID, FROM THE CENTER OF MY EXPERIENCE AS A BLACK WOMAN, I KNOW THAT STORY SPEAKS TO EVERYONE. AND IS UNIVERSAL. GROWING UP IN WASHINGTON DC, GOLDEN'S GIFTS AS A WRITER WERE RECOGNIZED WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD AND ENCOURAGED BY HER PARENTS. HER MOTHER TOLD HER WHEN SHE WAS 12 THAT ONE DAY SHE WAS GOING TO WRITE A BOOK. FROM POEMS AND ARTICLES IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE NEWSPAPERS, GOLDEN MOVED IN HER 20s TO FREELANCE WRITING FOR PUBLICATIONS AS DIVERSE AS ESSENCE AND THE NEW YORK TIMES. BUT SHE LONGED TO MOVE BEYOND JOURNALISM AND WRITE STORIES THAT ONLY SHE COULD IMAGINE AND TELL. MARITA GOLDEN'S MARRIAGE TO A NIGERIAN AND HER SUBSEQUENT EXPERIENCE LIVING IN NIGERIA FOR FOUR YEARS FORMED THE BASIS FOR HER DEBUT NOVEL, MIGRATIONS OF THE HEART. AND NOVEL I FIRST BECAME FAMILIAR WITH AS AN UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY WHERE PROFESSOR GOLDEN WAS ONE OF MY ADVISORS. BECAUSE OF ITS EXPLORATION OF THE ISSUES OF CULTURAL IDENTITY AND THE IMPACT OF THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGES IN THE 1960S, MIGRATIONS OF THE HEART HAS GAINED LEGIONS OF PASSIONATE FANS AND IS ONE OF SEVERAL OF GOLDEN'S BOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND CAMPUSES AROUND THE WORLD. THE THEME OF THE INTERSECTION OF THE PERSONAL AND POLITICAL , THE BOND OF FRIENDSHIP AMONG BLACK WOMEN, AND THE STRESSES ON AND RESILIENCE OF THE BLACK FAMILY FREQUENT THEMES IN HER FICTION AND NONFICTION. TO DATE, SHE IS THE AUTHOR OF 14 WORKS OF FICTION AND NONFICTION. HER MANY AWARDS INCLUDE, THE BLACK CAUCUS OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. AWARDING HER AN HONOR AWARD FOR GUMBO. AN ANTHOLOGY OF FICTION BY AFRICAN IMMIGRANT WRITERS WHICH SHE EDITED WITH THE LATE E LYNN HARRIS. IN THE LITERARY AWARD FOR FICTION FOR HER NOVEL AFTER. HER MOST RECENT BOOK IS THE WIDE CIRCUMFERENCE OF LOVE. IN THIS WORK SHE TAKES ON THE QUESTIONS OF , WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR SPOUSE OF MANY YEARS HAS ALZHEIMER'S? WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR MARRIAGE, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR OWN SENSE OF SELF AS THE DISEASE ROBS YOU, YOUR LOVED ONE OF WHAT IS HERS OR HIS. WHAT SHE UNCOVERED WERE THE HARD NUMBERS THAT WILL IMPACT US ALL AND THE INTUITIVE TRUTHS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO LOVE THROUGH THIS CHALLENGING TIME. IN THE END, THE NOVEL IS A MEDITATION ON LOVE, AND AN UNFLINCHING LOOK AT THE WAYS IN WHICH IDENTITY, HAPPINESS, AND THE FUTURE ARE REFORGED IN THE WAKE OF A SINGLE DIAGNOSIS. MARITA GOLDEN HAS GRACIOUSLY OFFERED TO SIGN COPIES OF HER BOOK AT THE END OF THIS TALK. THERE WILL BE A RECEPTION IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING. SEVEN LUCKY WINNERS WILL RECEIVE A COPY OF THE BOOK THEY CAN ALSO HAVE AUTOGRAPHED. PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING MARITA GOLDEN , A LONGTIME FRIEND OF MONTGOMERY COLLEGE, WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE HER WITH US THIS EVENING. APP -- [APPLAUSE] I AM REALLY HONORED TO BE HERE. I VISITED OTHER CAMPUSES, SO I AM FEELING LIKE I AM HOME. I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE ASSOCIATE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WITH PEOPLE OVER 50, WITH OUR GRANDMOTHERS AND GRANDFATHERS, IT'S REALLY A DISEASE THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US. AND IF YOU ARE A YOUNG PERSON , YOU MAY HAVE A GRANDMOTHER OR GRANDFATHER WHO SUFFERS WITH DEMENTIA OR ALZHEIMER'S. YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER MAY AT SOME POINT DEVELOP ALZHEIMER'S OR DEMENTIA. AND YOU IS A YOUNG PERSON NEED TO DEVELOP NOW THE LIFESTYLE, THE DIET, THE MENTAL ATTITUDES THAT CAN GIVE YOU THE BODY AND MIND TO HELP YOU ACTUALLY FIGHT THE ONSLAUGHT OF ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA. --AND DEMENTIA. DURING THE QUESTION-AND-ANSWER PERIOD WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. I HAVE BEEN ASKED HOW I CAME TO WRITE THIS STORY, I WAS COLD TO WRITE IT. IT IS ACTUALLY --IT HAS POSSESSED ME FOR THE PAST FIVE GOING ON SIX YEARS. AFTER I SPENT FOUR YEARS RESEARCHING THE BOOK, I THEN SPENT ANOTHER YEAR WRITING AN ARTICLE , RESEARCHING AND WRITING AN ARTICLE FOR THE WASHINGTON POST ABOUT WHY AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE SO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY ALZHEIMER'S. I THOUGHT I WAS THROUGH. NOW I AM WORKING ON AN ANTHOLOGY. COLLECTING ESSAYS AND MEDITATIONS BY CAREGIVERS, FAMILIES AND FRIENDS. CALLED , LOVE IN A SILENT STORM, UNBROKEN BONDS. WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS READ SOMETHING THAT I HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT WHAT SPENDING THIS MUCH TIME WRITING ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S MEANT TO ME PERSONALLY, EMOTIONALLY, I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE WRITING PROCESS. THE RESEARCH. AS WELL AS THE DEEPER SPIRITUAL LESSONS THAT THIS JOURNEY AND THIS ASSIGNMENT FROM GOD GAVE ME. THE FIRST TIME I SAT IN A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, I FELT FEAR. I HAVE AS I WRITE THIS TRAVELED SO FAR FROM THAT EMOTION , THAT RESPONSE, THAT I WRITE THE WORDS WITHOUT ANY SHAME. IT WASN'T ANXIETY OR NERVOUSNESS THAT HAD MY HEART BEATING A BIT FASTER, ALTHOUGH WHAT I FELT SHIRLEY RELATED TO THE KIND OF UNCERTAINTY PRODUCED BY THOSE RESPONSES. NO NO I FELT FEAR. I FELT SHAMELESS ADMISSION NUMBER 1. THE MEN AND WOMEN WHOSE AVERAGE AGE WAS IN THE MID-70s WERE RESIDENTS OF THE MEMORY CARE UNIT IN AN ASSISTED LIVING RESIDENCE WERE I WAS DOING RESEARCH FOR A NOVEL. ABOUT AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN DEALING WITH THE IMPACT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. I WAS SITTING IN ON A LATE MORNING SESSION WITH THE RESIDENCE LISTENING TO THEIR STORIES, REMEMBERS HIS AND MEMORIES, HAUNTED BY GENTLE QUESTIONING FROM A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT. THE SESSION WAS DESIGNED TO STIMULATE MEMORIES ESSENTIALLY OF WHO THESE MEN AND WOMEN USED TO BE. THE QUESTION WAS, TELL US ABOUT THE WORK HE USED TO DO. THE FEAR I FELT WAS , I NOW KNOW, LIKE MOST FEAR, IRRATIONAL, EGO DRIVEN, AND LARGELY BASED ON HYPOTHETICAL , WHAT IF'S. IT SEEMS WE ARE ALWAYS PERFORMING AND ALWAYS EXPECTING OTHERS TO PERFORM FOR US. SO SOME OF THE FEAR I KNOW WAS INSPIRED BY THE EXPECTATION THAT THIS GROUP OF MOSTLY CALM AND GENTLE WELL-DRESSED SENIORS WOULD DO SOMETHING , SAY SOMETHING, BE SOMEONE THAT MY ARSENAL OF RESPONSES AND REACTIONS HAD NOT PREPARED ME TO HANDLE. THERE WAS ALSO THE EXPECTATION THAT I IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE LABELED AS DIMINISHED AND INTELLECTUAL THIS INTELLECTUALLY INCAPACITATED WOULD DO SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING, BE SOMEONE AT ODDS WITH THE VISION OF MYSELF AS CAPABLE AND IN CONTROL IN THOSE SITUATIONS. THEN THERE WAS THE OTHER FEAR. THE ONE HAUNTED ME AS I SPENT HOURS AMONGST THESE PEOPLE WHO HAD LIVED LIVES OF CAREER AND MATERIAL SUCCESS , ALLOW THEM TO BE CARED FOR IN A RESIDENCE THAT DID NOT ACCEPT MEDICARE AND COSTS $5000 PER MONTH. THE FEAR THAT WAS WRONG AND CHILLING IN THE EARLY DAYS OF MY RESEARCH, THE FEAR THAT ALZHEIMER'S WOULD AS IT HAD COME FOR THEM, COME FOR ME. BUT PERHAPS THE DEEPEST AND MOST AWFUL FEAR WAS THAT THESE MEN AND WOMEN WERE LACKING BECAUSE OF ALZHEIMER'S. POOR , AND ESSENCE THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO TOUCH THEM AND BE TOUCHED BY THEM. TO HEAR THEM AND SEE THEM FOR WHO THEY HAD BEEN AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR WHO THEY WERE NOW. I KNEW I COULD NOT WRITE A NOVEL ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S IF I COULD NOT IMAGINE MYSELF AS LIVING AND BREATHING INSIDE THEIR SKIN. DURING THE FOUR YEARS I SPENT RESEARCHING THE NOVEL I DID NOT GET OVER FEAR. IS MUCH AS I ALLOWED THE VIBRANT LIFE-GIVING WISDOM AND HUMANITY OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN TO CHIP AWAY AND DISMANTLE IT. IT HAPPENED BECAUSE I WAS WILLING TO HEAR AND LISTEN. WHAT I HEARD AND LISTENED TO WOVE A CONNECTING THREAD BETWEEN ME AND THE PEOPLE THAT I WAS "STUDYING." AT FIRST , AND THEN I CAME TO RECOGNIZE AS MY SHADOW. IN WAYS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ALZHEIMER'S. FROM THAT DAY I REMEMBER THE TALL CLEAN-SHAVEN MAN WHO SAT IN THE GROUP WITH HIS LEGS CROSSED PERIODICALLY SHIFTING HIS BASEBALL CAP AS HE SMILED WITH PROUD SATISFACTION AND TOLD US. "I WORKED FOR THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND KEPT OUR MONEY SAFE." THE DESCRIPTION OF HIS JOB SOUNDS SO ELEMENTARY AND CHILDLIKE. AND YET, ISN'T THAT WHAT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT DOES? KEEP OUR MONEY SAFE? THE PLUMP PROPER COLORED WOMAN IS JEEPS WERE SMEARED WITH ROUSH AND WHOSE GREAT CURLS WERE TOPPED BY A FELT HAT POLIS THAT SHE HAD BEEN A TEACHER IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONING SHOULD NOT RECALL WHAT GRADE OR THE NAME OF HER SCHOOL. BUT I WATCHED HER EYES SPARKLE IN THE MOMENTS BEFORE SHE CLOSED THEM TIGHTLY . AND FOR 15 MINUTES, TWICE RECITED A POEM HER STUDENTS HAD TO MEMORIZE. PERHAPS THE POEMS ENABLE THE PASSING OF STORIES BETWEEN GENERATIONS. THINK OF THE ILIAD, OR LANGSTON HUGHES , POEMS CAPTURE RIVERS -- EXPERIENCES IN A NEW WAY AND COMMUNICATE ONE SOUL TO ANOTHER. LISTENING TO A POEM'S TITLE IS NO LONGER REMEMBERED, WATCHING THE FERVOR WITH WHICH IT WAS RECITED, I KNEW HOW MUCH THAT WOMAN'S STUDENTS HAD MEANT TO HER. AND HOW FOR HER TEACHING WAS MORE ART THAN SCIENCE. THAT POEM WAS A FRAGMENTARY -- FRAGMENTARY MEMORY OF HER WHOLE LIFE. AND THERE WAS THE AGITATED ONE SITTING BESIDE ME. WHO DURING BREAKS IN THE SESSION, RESPONDED TO MY STYLE THAT'S SMILE WITH A SCREAM OF REPETITIVE FRAGMENTS ABOUT BEING A STUDENT AT HAMPTON UNIVERSITY. HER EYES WERE ABLAZE WITH LIGHT. AND SOMEHOW SHELLSHOCKED THAT SHE REPEATED OVER AND OVER THAT SHE HAD LIVED ON CAMPUS AND HAD JOINED THE A.K.A. SORORITY. CLEARLY THE SISTERHOOD , THE SENSE OF MISSION, THE BONDS THAT INSPIRE LOYALTY AMONG THEM GAVE AS MUCH MEANING TO HER LIFE AS SHE SAT BESIDE ME AS IT HAD DONE 40 OR 50 YEARS EARLIER . THAT THEY I LEARNED ALZHEIMER'S DOES NOT PROMISE OF MEMORIES AS MUCH AS IT SHIFTS THEM AROUND IN THE HOUSE OF OUR MIND. SOME GET STORED IN THE ATTIC. AND ARE RARELY TOUCHED. OTHERS, ONCE CONSIGNED TO THE BASEMENT ARE RETRIEVED AND GIVEN A PLACE OF DOMINANCE. AS I READ MORE ABOUT THE DISEASE, I CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS WHEN ONE CAN NO LONGER REMEMBER , RECALL, OR EVEN LEARN ANYTHING NEW AS A RESULT OF THE GRADUAL FAILURE OF THE BRAIN TO ACTIVATE AND SPUR THE BODY TO FUNCTION THAT THE DISEASE BECOMES FATAL. THE ABSENCE OF MEMORIES KILLS US. WE DIE WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO RECALL WE HAD BEEN, WE ARE. WHAT I WONDERED, WHAT I REMEMBER IN THE MIDST OF APPROACHING DEATH WOULD STUBBING ME WITH GIVE ME LIFE? I SHOULD'VE EXPECTED THE REQUEST . IN FACT I WOULD'VE BEEN SURPRISED IF IT SOME POINT IT HAD NOT COME. STILL, WHEN IT CAME HAVE A TENDENCY TO OVERTHINK AND OVER PLAN AND OVER WORRY, IT TOOK ME HOSTAGE. THE DIRECTOR OF THE FACILITY ASKED ME TO DO A READING AND DISCUSSION OF MY WORK WITH THE RESIDENCE. MUSICIANS, ARTISTS, JOURNALISTS, THEY HAD BEEN GUEST SPEAKERS AS PART OF A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO KEEP THE RESIDENCE CONNECTED TO THE WORLD OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATED. I KNEW THAT I WOULD SAY YES AND I DID. WITHOUT HESITATION. EVEN AS I WONDERED AT THE MONTHS I SPENT EMBEDDED IN THE LIVES OF THE RESIDENCE , SITTING IN ON THEIR EXERCISES, EATING LUNCH IN THE CAFETERIA, TALKING TO THE CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT, WOULD NOT SELL -- WOULD NOT SOMEHOW BE COMPROMISED IF I SHOULD DO THIS. BUT OF COURSE IT WAS SOMETHING MORE. SHAMELESS ADMISSION NUMBER 2. I AGREED TO DO A READING BUT WONDERED, WHAT EVERYTHING WOULD MEAN FOR ME? HOW WOULD MY WRITER'S EGO BE FED BY AN AUDIENCE THAT MIGHT NOT COMPREHEND EVERYTHING I WAS SAYING? WAS THEY ASKED THE QUESTION I COULDN'T ANSWER? ODDLY I NEVER WORRIED ABOUT THAT WITH OTHER AUDIENCES. THE TRIVIAL CONCERNS WAS CONTINUING EVIDENCE OF HOW FAR I STILL HAD TO GO. BEFORE I WAS WEDDED TO THESE MEN AND WOMEN, BEFORE I SAW THEM AS MY BROTHER, SISTER, FROM ANOTHER MOTHER. IS PEOPLE WHO I DID NOT HAVE TO STRIVE TO UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE , ALTHOUGH I DID NOT FULLY KNOW IT, I ALREADY UNDERSTOOD THEM. BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD MYSELF. A DIGRESSIVE NOTE ABOUT UNDERSTANDING. --UNDERSTANDING ONESELF. FREE WILL AND INDEPENDENCE AND IN CONTROL. SINCE COMPLETING THE NOVEL, I READ MORE AND MORE ABOUT HOW AS HUMANS WE ARE BOTH BURDENED BY THE RELIEF THAT FREE WILL AND INDEPENDENCE AND CONTROL ARE THE ENGINES OF OUR EXISTENCE. IN REALITY WE ARE ANIMALS. ACTIVATED AND CONTROLLED MOSTLY A BRAIN SYNAPSES, HORMONES, AND JEANS. SEX, HUNGER, AND AMBITION , CREATIVITY, LOVE AND FEAR. IT MAY ALL BE A BUNDLE OF URGES , THAT POSITIONS US IN A GRUELING LIFELONG POSITION OF SUBSERVIENCE TO THE WHIMS OF OUR INTERNAL BIOLOGY. BUT AS I PREPARED FOR MY READING , I WASN'T AWARE OF THAT. I STILL THOUGHT THE BEST PLAN WAS TO HAVE A PLAN. EVEN WITH AN AUDIENCE OF PEOPLE FORCED TO IMPROVISE EACH MOMENT. I HAD TO HAVE A PLAN. I HAD TO KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. I KNOW WHAT MAY HAPPEN. SITTING BEFORE THE RESIDENCE -- RESIDENTS THAT AFTERNOON I HAD A PLAN. I SCRAPPED MY ORIGINAL PLAN WHICH TO --WHICH WAS TO READ FOR MY NOVEL AND TAKE QUESTIONS. NOW I KNEW MY AUDIENCES ATTENTION SPAN WAS MORE HOPE THAN REALITY. THAT IN FACT I HAD AT BEST 20 MINUTES TO ESSENTIALLY ENGAGE AND DEPART AND THAT RATHER THAN A SUMPTUOUS SEVERAL COURSE MEAL, I WOULD MAKE MY OFFERING IN THE EQUIVALENT OF APPETIZERS. I TOOK A DEEP BREATH. WHAT I HOPED NO ONE COULD HEAR, AND BEGAN BY SAYING I AM A WRITER AND I GROUP HERE IN WASHINGTON DC. WRITING HAS TAKEN ME ALL OVER THE WORLD . THEN RATHER THAN TALK ABOUT MY WRITING PROCESS, AND THE SUBJECT I CHOSE, I SHARED HOW SATISFYING, WONDROUS AND WONDERFUL IT HAD BEEN TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN A GIFT THAT I HONORED AND THAT LITERALLY BECAME THE VEHICLE FOR MY DISCOVERY OF SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND PEOPLE. I SHARED THE EXPERIENCE OF TRAVELING TO JAMAICA TO WRITE A TRAVEL LOG. AND SITTING ON THE BEACHES. SERVING AS AN OFFICIAL WRITER REPRESENTING THE U.S. IN TURKEY ON A CULTURAL VISIT TO THAT COUNTRY. ATTENDING A WRITERS CONFERENCE IN LONDON. THE NAME OF EACH CITY OR COUNTRY INSPIRED SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE TO CALL OUT, I HAVE BEEN THERE. THAT WAS WHERE OUR HONEYMOON WAS. I WENT THERE FOR VACATION. MEMORY AND MEMORIES, THE INSPIRED RESIDENCE -- RESIDENTS TO RAISE THEIR HANDS , SEEKING MY RECOGNITION OR STAND UP AND CLAIM THEIR STORYTELLING SPACE. WHAT THEY SHARED WERE MOSTLY HEARTFELT FRAGRANCE --FRAGMENTS OF THE JOY OF DISCOVERING A NEW AND. NOW I SAT BACK AND LISTENED. LISTENING AND OBSERVING , HEARING AND SEEING ARE THE FOUNDATION. WORDS ONLY GET ON THE PAGE BECAUSE I HAVE LISTENED TO MY HEART AND BECAUSE IMAGINATION INTRODUCES LIGHT TO THE POWER AND REALITY OF THE UNSEEN AND THE UNKNOWN. SO ALLOWING THE RESIDENTS TO TELL ME THEIR STORIES AND THE BORDERS THEY CROSSED, IT WAS PART OF MY CONTINUING EDUCATION. I THOUGHT I HAD COME TO TELL THEM STORIES. BUT THEY FORGED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE TELL STORIES TO ONE ANOTHER. THIS READING WAS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER. AND THEN A RESIDENT RECALLED VISITING PARIS AND BLUSHED AS SHE SAID, "I WAS THERE IN APRIL WITH SOMEONE I LOVE. " WE WERE SHUTTERED WITH APPRECIATIVE LAUGHTER. THERE IS MUCH WITH THOSE THAT ALZHEIMER'S FORGET. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT THEY REMEMBER. LOVE, DESIRE, FRIENDSHIP, HOPE , DREAMS, I WAS NO LONGER SCARED ME TOOK A DEEP BREATH. ONE THAT SIGNALED MY SURRENDER TO GO WHEREVER WE WERE HEADED. AFRAID THE BEAUTIFUL TAPESTRY WAS WOVEN IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES FROM SILENCE , I DID NOT RUSH TO FILL. AND MORE FRAGRANCE --FRAGMENTS, PEOPLE AND PLACES TOSSED INTO OUR MIDST. THEN I REACHED FOR THE BOOK I BROUGHT. MY NOVEL, LONG-DISTANCE LIFE , SIX YEARS IN THE LIFE OF THE FAMILY HEADED BY A WOMAN WHO MIGRATES FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO WASHINGTON DC IN THE 1930S. PART OF THE GREAT MIGRATION OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS FROM THE SOUTH. THE BOOK WAS INSPIRED BY MY MOTHER'S LIFE, YET A VASTLY DIFFERENT STORY. I CHOSE A PARAGRAPH TO READ. IN THE QUIET MOMENTS AFTER THE LAST WORD, THE WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN IN PARIS WITH SOMEONE SHE LOVED, STOOD UP AND POINTED TO ME IN WHAT I INITIALLY THOUGHT WAS AN ACCUSATORY STANCE AND SHOUTED, "I KNOW THAT WOMAN. " THOSE ARE THE WORDS THAT EVERY WRITER LONGS TO HEAR WHEN LISTENING --WHEN A LISTENER OR READER HEARS IT. I KNOW THAT STORY. I KNOW THAT WOMAN, THAT MAN, CHILD. WE UNDERSTAND THEN WE HAVE DONE OUR JOB. WHAT IS KNOWN IS KNOWN LITERALLY , SPIRITUALLY, OR METAPHORICALLY. AND SOMETIMES ALL THREE. AND THAT IS WHAT THE WOMAN WHOSE NAME I LATER LEARNED WAS GLADYS MEANT. SHE KNEW THE CHARACTER IN THE NOVEL. AND WOULD IN SOME SENSE TAKE HER WITH HER WHEN SHE LEFT THE SMALL THEN WERE BESET. WHEN GLADYS ANNOUNCED I KNOW THAT WOMAN, I FELT A LONG- AWAITED MOMENT OF ANOINTING THAT I FINALLY KNEW HER AND THE OTHER MEN AND WOMEN WITH US. I BEGAN TO FEEL I COULD WRITE THIS STORY. NOW I KNEW I COULD CREATE AND IMAGINE THE STORY. BUT HOW WOULD I DO IT? WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN , LOOK LIKE AND FEEL LIKE TO ME IN MY CHARACTERS? ALTHOUGH I CONSIDER THE WIDE CIRCUMFERENCE OF LOVE LARGELY A STORY OF HOW MARRIED LOVE AND SELF-CARE ARE TRANSFORMED BY A CRISIS, IT IS GROUNDED IN THE EXPERIENCE OF ONE MAN. GREGORY TATE EXPERIENCING AND LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. THE NOVEL OPENS ON THE DAY THE GREGORY'S WIFE DIANE IS TAKEN TO A MEMORY CARE UNIT BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH EARLY ONSET ALZHEIMER'S. IT'S THE STORY OF THEIR 35 YEAR MARRIAGE, THEIR SON AND DAUGHTER. I RELIED ON EXPERTS WHO READ THE VARIOUS DRAFTS AND HELPED ME ACCURATELY PORTRAY THE DISEASE AND HOW IT MANIFESTED IN THE BODY AND MIND OF THOSE WITH IT AS WELL AS ITS IMPACT ON FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. THE EXPERTS INCLUDED RICE -- THE WIFE OF A RESIDENT. A SOCIAL WORKER AND STAFF AT THE CENTER. AS WELL AS EIGHT SENIOR HEALTH CONSULTANT WHO HELPED FAMILIES CARING FOR THOSE WITH DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S. ALTHOUGH OFTEN THE ACTIONS OF THOSE WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND OTHERS WITH DEMENTIA APPEAR CRAZY, THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE NOT LOST THEIR MINDS. THE WRITING CHALLENGE WAS TO DRAMATIZE BOTH THE STRANGENESS OF ACTIONS PRODUCED BY THE DIMINISHMENT OF COGNITIVE ABILITIES, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY CAPTURE WAYS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS POSSESS AND BOUND THEM TO US. AFTER READING AN EARLY DRAFT IN WHICH I WAS ATTEMPTING TO WRITE FROM THE POINT OF GREGORY, FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF GREGORY, THE STAFF SOCIAL WORKER INFORMED ME GENTLY THAT, I STILL HAD WORK TO DO. REMEMBER SHE SAID, IN WRITING ABOUT A PERSON WITH THIS DISEASE, NOTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE IS OFF-LIMITS. NO MATTER HOW ODD, OR INEXPLICABLE . DESCRIPTIONS OF GREGORY WERE TO SAFE. AND LACKED THE EDGE INTENTION BUILT INTO THE EXPERIENCE OF ALZHEIMER'S. THE KIND OF EDGE INTENTION THAT I HAD FEARED AND HAD ME ONCE CREATING A WALL BETWEEN ME AND THE RESIDENTS. SHE THEN TOLD ME ABOUT THE RESIDENT WHO OFTEN URINATED IN THE POTTED PLANTS IN THE HALLWAY. BECAUSE HE IMAGINED HIMSELF WATERING HIS CROP. AND THE RETIRED FIREMAN WHO EACH TIME HE HEARD A LOUD NOISE THOUGHT IT WAS A FIRE ALARM AND BANGED ON RESIDENCE DOORS -- RESIDENTS DOORS AND TRY TO EVACUATE THEM. ULTIMATELY I WROTE A SCENE THAT CAPTURED GREGORY'S VALIDITY THIS VULNERABILITY. HIS FEAR AS WELL AS HIS ALL TOO NATURAL AND RECOGNIZABLE YEARNING TO FEEL A SENSE OF CONTROL. IT IS A SCENE EARLY , IT IS MIDNIGHT, AND HE IS WALKING THE HALLS MAKE. NAKED BECAUSE HE'S NOT ONLY STRIPPED OF CLOTHING BUT INHIBITION IN THE SELF HE WANTS NEW. HE IS NAKED WALKING THE HALLS. FLEEING, HE KNOWS NOT WHAT, BUT SEARCHING FOR A WAY OUT OF THIS PLACE AND BACK TO HIMSELF. HE WANTS TO GO HOME AND HOME IS WE --WHO HE USED TO BE. IN THE MIDST OF A SCUFFLE WITH A NURSING ASSISTANT, WHO WANTS TO GUIDE HIM TO HIS ROOM, ANOTHER RESIDENT, A WOMAN WHO HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM OPENS HER DOOR AND OFFERS A SHEET TO COVER HIS BODY. IS ANYONE IN LOVE WOULD DO, SHE JEFFERSON PROTECTION. THE WRITING OF THAT SCENE WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE I MIND MY OWN VULNERABILITIES AND USE THEM LITERALLY AS A SPRINGBOARD INTO THE EXPERIENCE OF A 69-YEAR-OLD FORMER ARCHITECT WITH ALZHEIMER'S. A MAN WHO WAS A FATHER, A HUSBAND, FRIEND, BUILDER, AND WHO REMAINED ALL THOSE THINGS IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST MASSIVE UPHEAVAL HE HAD EVER KNOWN. HOW DID I FIND MYSELF IN THIS PLACE? NO ONE IN MY FAMILY HAD ALZHEIMER'S? IS A TOPIC I PREVIOUSLY HAD LITTLE INTEREST IN. YET WRITING A NOVEL ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S WAS AS UNDERSTANDABLE AS OTHER TOPICS I HAVE EXPLORED IN FICTION. THE DEATH OF A CHILD IN THE WORK OF A COMMITMENT AND A CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST. I HAD KNOWN LITTLE ABOUT THOSE SUBJECTS BEFORE THE NOVELS I WROTE PLUNGED ME INTO A WORLD OF IMAGINATION THAT POSSESSED ME IN EACH CASE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I AM DRAWN TO WRITE ABOUT WHAT I DON'T KNOW . AND WHEN I WRITE ABOUT WHAT I KNOW, I WRITE TO DISCOVER WHAT I DON'T. THERE IS A WORD FOR THAT. INSPIRATION. BUT FOR ME, A MORE PRECISE DESIGNATION IS THAT I HAVE BEEN CALLED. BEING CALLED MEANS FINDING ANSWERS AS WELL AS BEING SWEPT AWAY BY A TIDAL WAVE OF QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS FOR MY CHARACTERS. AND QUESTIONS FOR ME. FICTION CREATES IMAGINE THAT LIVES, AND EVADES MY OWN. WATCHING FAMILIES WRESTLE AND LIVE WITH THE BURDENS, CHALLENGES, AND SOMETIMES GIFTS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE FLOODED ME WITH QUESTIONS. WHO WOULD CARE FOR ME? WHAT KIND OF CAREGIVER WOULD I BE? THESE ARE NOT QUESTIONS ANSWERED EASILY. OR ONLY ONCE. UNLIKE MANY QUESTIONS, THEY HAVE MORE THAN ONE ANSWER. I SET OUT TO WRITE NOT ALZHEIMER'S STORY, BUT A LOVE STORY. AND I DID. I NOW KNOW WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WHO OPENED THEIR LIVES TO MEET KNOW. THAT LOVE, THE KIND THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE ONSLAUGHT OF THIS DISEASE, AND EVEN LAWSON IN ITS HARSH GLARING LIGHT, --AND EVEN BLOSSOM IN THE HARSH GLARING LIGHT, RESILIENT, PATIENT, SOMETIMES CONFUSED, -- THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] GOING TO READ A LITTLE SCENE FROM THE BOOK AND THEN WE CAN OPEN IT FOR QUESTIONS. I THINK I WILL READ THIS. BECAUSE MUCH OF THE BOOK IS A STORY IS ACTUALLY DIANE'S STORY OF HER JOURNEY, THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF ALZHEIMER'S WITH HER HUSBAND, SHE IS A FAMILY COURT JUDGE IN WASHINGTON DC, THEIR DAUGHTER IS ALSO AN ARCHITECT, AND THEIR SON HAS BEEN KIND OF DISTANT FROM THE FAMILY FOR MANY YEARS. HIS FATHER'S ILLNESS BRINGS HIM BACK. BUT A LOT OF THE STORY IS ABOUT DIANE'S JOURNEY INTO ACCEPTANCE AND THEN FIGURING OUT HOW TO BOTH CONTINUE TO LOVE HER HUSBAND, REMAIN LOYAL TO HIM EVEN AS SHE CREATES AND SHAPES A NEW LIFE. MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO MY RESEARCH URGED ME TO WRITE THAT KIND OF BOOK. BECAUSE SO MANY CAREGIVERS, FOR MANY MANY REASONS , HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULTY DOING THAT. CARING FOR THE LOVED ONE AND ALSO CARING FOR THEMSELVES. HONORING THE LIFE THAT THE PERSON WITH ALZHEIMER'S HAVE AND CREATING A LIFE FOR THEMSELVES. THIS IS ACTUALLY A SCENE WHERE , IT KIND OF ILLUSTRATES THE KIND OF PRESSURE THAT CAREGIVERS CAN FIND THEMSELVES UNDER. THIS IS BEFORE GREGORY HAS BEEN TAKEN TO THE MEMORY CARE UNIT. THIS IS AFTER HE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED. AS THE MONTHS PASSED DIANE DISCOVERED NEW FORMS OF AGITATION. AS NEW TYPES OF BEWILDERING NONSENSICAL ACTIONS COMMITTED BY GREGORY CREPT INTO THEIR LIVES. ONE NIGHT ONE OF HER DRESSED PUMPS WENT MISSING. AN EMPTY HANGER BORE NO TRACE OF THE SILK WHITE BLOUSE. SEAN'S GRADUATION PHOTO WAS GONE FROM ITS CONSPICUOUS SPACE ON THE MANTLE ABOVE THE FIREPLACE. HER FAVORITE UMBRELLA , AND AUTOGRAPHED COPY OF SOLOMON , THAT SHE STOOD IN LINE FOR HALF AN HOUR FOR 20 MORSE TO SIGN. ALL MISSING. FOR ONLY A FLEETING MOMENT THAT SHE SUSPECT CECELIA, THAT IS THE WOMAN WHO COMES INTO TAKE CARE OF HIM, LOOKING IN THE MOST UNLIKELY PLACES SHE FOUND HER BLOUSE BEHIND THE DRIVER. THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THEM WITH SEAN BENEATH THE SOFA CUSHION. SONG OF SOLOMON PROTRUDING FROM EIGHT PLASTIC BAG OF TRASH. --A PLASTIC BAG OF TRASH. GREASE STAINED WITH PAGES TORN OUT. NOW SHE COULDN'T FIND THE NECKLACE AND MATCHING EARRINGS SHE BOUGHT IN NEW MEXICO. ALL WEEKEND SHE HAD SEARCHED THE HOUSE. HER FURY RISING. GREGORY, I DON'T HAVE MUCH ANYMORE. SO LITTLE. WHY CAN'T YOU LEAVE ME AT LEAST SOME THINGS THAT I CHERISH. FEVERISH WITH PARANOIA, SHE WAS CONVINCED THE ACTIONS WERE NOT RANDOM. GREGORY'S MIND , SHE WAS SURE, WAS BRIMMING WITH MALEVOLENCE. STEALING LIKE THIS TOOK CUNNING, PLANNING, FORETHOUGHT. DIANE STOOD BEFORE HER HUSBAND, HERSELF THE KIND OF WRECKAGE, SHE NOW BRUSHED HER TEETH OR CHANGED CLOTHES , ALL SHE WANTED WAS TO FIND THE JEWELRY. ALL SHE WANTED IN THE MIDST OF THIS WAS TO HOLD ONTO ONE LITTLE THING. EVEN IF IT WAS MATERIAL TIED TO VANITY AND PRIDE. IT WAS HER LITTLE THING. AND HE HAD STOLEN IT. JUST TELL ME WHERE YOU PUT THEM. I WON'T BE ANGRY GREGORY. THIS ISN'T A GAME. THE NECKLACE AND EARRINGS, WHERE ARE THEY? GREGORY STOOD UNMOVED IN A WINTER SWEATER AND CORDUROY PANTS HE HAD FOUND ALTHOUGH IT WAS AUGUST, THE HOUSE WAS SWELTERING BECAUSE HE AIR- CONDITIONING WAS FAULTING. 'S ANSWER WAS NONCHALANTLY, CASTING ONE LAST LOOK AT HER, THE PROMISED, HE WOULD NEVER REVEAL WHAT SHE WANTED SO DESPERATELY TO KNOW. TALKING TO GREGORY LIKE THIS SET HER ON THE EDGE AND MADE HER HYPERSENSITIVE. THERE IS NO PAST, NO FUTURE, ONLY NOW. THIS ETERNAL MOMENT. NOW, LIVING THE EXTREME. A NEON PRESENT TENSE, EACH WORD FROM HIM OR HER, A POSSIBLE PRECIPICE. SHE KNEW NOT TO TOUCH THEM FROM BEHIND. IF SHE DID THE INABILITY TO SEE HER, SAID GREGORY HOWLING AND RUNNING FROM HER. SHE GRABBED HIS ARM ANYWAY SHOUTING, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THEM? PULLING OUT OF HER GRASP HE CLAMPED HIS HANDS OVER HER EARS AND STOMPED IN CIRCLES AROUND THE DINING ROOM TABLE. I DIDN'T DO IT. THEY DIDN'T DO IT HE SAID. HAD BOWED FORWARD HIS HANDS SQUEEZING HIS EARS. YOU DID AND YOU KNOW IT. TRAILING HIM AROUND THE TABLE, SHE HEARD HER VOICE, YOU DID, YOU KNOW YOU DID. THE DOORBELL STARTLED THEM. SHE THOUGHT IT MUST BE THE AIR CONDITIONING REPAIR MAN. BUT WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW LAUREN INSTEAD, DIANE COVERED HER MOUTH WITH HER HANDS AND REACHED FOR HER. HOLDING HER SO TIGHTLY, LAUREN NEARLY CLAWED HER WAY OUT OF HER MOTHER'S ARMS. THEY STOOD IN THE PORTAL WELL GREGORY RAGED IN THE LIVING ROOM. NO. IT WASN'T ME. [APPLAUSE] I THINK WE CAN TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTION ABOUT WRITING THIS BOOK REX WRITING IN GENERAL ? THE ARTICLE WITH THE WASHINGTON POST? WHATEVER. --ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WRITING THIS BOOK REX WRITING IN GENERAL? THE ARTICLE WITH WASHINGTON POST? WHATEVER. I'M GOING TO START. MY FATHER-IN-LAW WHO WAS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY MEMBER FOR OVER 30 YEARS IN THE BE CCS HAD EARLY ONSET ALZHEIMER'S. WE THINK IT WAS BEFORE HE WAS 60 THAT HE WAS DIAGNOSED AND HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME GOING TO HIDE THE SYMPTOMS. YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AT WORK. YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE IN YOUR CHURCH TO NOTICE OR YOUR FAMILY TO BE WORRIED. AS IT BECAME PROGRESSIVELY WORSE AND HE HAD MOMENTS OF SANITY, HE WOULD TALK TO MY HUSBAND AND CONSTANTLY SAY, MAKE SURE MY DIGNITY IS INTACT. IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR HIM. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS A GENE THING OR A BLACK MALE THING, IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO MAKE SURE HIS DIGNITY WAS INTACT. I THINK HE RETIRED BECAUSE OF THAT EARLY. HE WAS SO AFRAID. I WONDER IF THAT IS SOMETHING YOU SAW IN SOME OF THE POPULATION WITH THE PEOPLE YOU SPOKE WITH , IS THAT A WAY THEY TRY TO HOLD THE DISEASE? THAT IS IMPORTANT. DID NOTE. --DIGNITY. I KNOW SOMETIMES YOU TAKE A PERSON TO THE DOCTOR WHO HAS DEMENTIA OR ALZHEIMER'S AND THE DOCTOR WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT THEM. AS THOUGH THEY ARE NOT IN THE ROOM. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I LEARNED FROM THE PEOPLE , THE SPECIALISTS, THE PERSON WITH ALZHEIMER'S NEEDED TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT. AND DIGNITY. AND PEOPLE REALLY DO FEAR THE LOSS OF DIGNITY. BUT I WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU MENTION IN YOUR STORY. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT , EVEN FOR THE CHILDREN OF PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S TO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE MAKE IT SAFE FOR THEM TO SAY THE ALZHEIMER'S WORD. BECAUSE THE LONGER YOU DELAY GETTING PEOPLE TO THE NEUROLOGIST, IT HAS SOME IMPLICATIONS. THERE ARE DRUGS THAT WILL DELAY THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ONSET. AND THE MORE YOU DELAY GETTING A DIAGNOSIS, BY THE TIME YOU SEE THE DOCTOR, THE MEDICATIONS DON'T WORK. ALSO BECAUSE ALZHEIMER'S IS SUCH A MASSIVELY INVASIVE DISEASE, IT AFFECTS THE FINANCES OF THE FAMILY, IN A SERIOUS WAY, THAT ASKS SO MUCH OF THE FAMILY IN TERMS OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE, RUNNING FOR THE POSSIBLE DEATH OF THE PERSON. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THIS EARLY. SO PEOPLE IN THE FAMILY CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO GET EVERYTHING IN PLACE. TO WRAP THEIR HEAD AROUND WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND THEN TO START PREPARING FOR WHAT COULD BE A DECADE OF LIVING WITH A PERSON WHO HAS THIS DISEASE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS OFTEN , IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THAT PEOPLE WAIT TOO LATE TO TAKE ONE TO THE DOCTOR OR THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE THE SYMPTOMS AS DEMENTIA IS ALL THIS OR ALZHEIMER'S THEY THINK IT'S JUST GETTING OLD. --OR ALZHEIMER'S THEY THINK IS JUST GETTING OLD. IT'S NOT A NORMAL THING TO DEVELOP ALZHEIMER'S EVEN THOUGH IT'S PREDICTED THAT BY 2050 HALF OF ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE 80 YEARS OLD OR OLDER WILL HAVE DEMENTIA OR SALT --OR ALZHEIMER'S. --OR ALZHEIMER'S. WHICH I THINK AS MUCH IS LIFESTYLE AND ARE POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE AS GENETIC. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT , IF YOU ARE THE DAUGHTER OF SOMEONE, TO HELP THEM FEEL SAFE TO SAY THE WORD. BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF RESISTANCE. THE LONGER YOU WAIT, THERE'S NOTHING GOOD THAT COMES FROM THAT. THANK YOU. --TO VISIT A TYPE A CONTINUING CARE COMMUNITY WHERE A COUPLE CAN MOVE IN AND HAVE AN APARTMENT AND THEN THEY HAVE A SEPARATE FLOOR IF THAT PERSON SHOULD GET SOME TYPE OF MENTAL LIKE ALZHEIMER'S. I DIDN'T VISIT BUT I HAVE HEARD. NOT THAT I WED -- AT THE TIME I VISITED PLACES LIKE THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. WIFE STAYS IN THE APARTMENT OR THE HUSBAND IS THE CASE MAY BE, AND THEY CAN STILL GET TOGETHER EVEN IF ONE PERSON NEEDS FULL- TIME CARE ON THAT FLOOR, THEY CAN GET TOGETHER FOR LUNCH AND DINNER AND STILL MAINTAIN A MARRIAGE OR RELATIONSHIP. BUT NOW HAVING READ THE BOOK, I AM WONDERING, IT'S ALMOST AS IF THAT BOTH GREGORY AND DIANE WERE ALLOWED TO BE FREED AND HAVE A NEW LIFE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T LIVING TOGETHER. I WONDER IF JUST BEING IN THAT PARK SIMILAR TEST PROXIMITY /PROXIMITY WOULD'VE MADE A DIFFERENCE. HE WOULD NEVADA FREEDOM -- I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A PRESCRIPTION. I THINK THAT WITH ULTIMATE DECISION FAMILIES MAKE AND SPOUSES MAKE IS VERY INDIVIDUAL. IT IS DICTATED BY FINANCIAL RESOURCES, BY TEMPERAMENT. AND BY THE PHYSICAL HEALTH OR ILL HEALTH OF THE PERSON BEYOND HAVING ALZHEIMER'S. I THINK IT'S A VERY INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. I THINK IT'S INDIVIDUAL. I DO KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IN THE RESIDENTS I STUDIED, THERE WERE COUPLES LIVING TOGETHER. BUT IN THAT CASE, BOTH OF THEM HAD DEMENTIA OR ALZHEIMER'S. IT WASN'T LIKE ONE DIDN'T. BUT I THINK THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THEIR BOND WITH ONE ANOTHER, I THINK THAT CAN BE A VIABLE RESPONSE. I THINK IT'S VERY INDIVIDUAL. ONE MORE QUESTION. I JUST FINISHED READING THE WIDE CIRCUMFERENCE OF LOVE AND THEN STILL UNSETTLED BY THE ATTITUDE TOWARD MARRIAGE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT. SEEMS TO BE AN AMBIVALENCE TOWARD MARRIAGE. WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT IN THE NOVEL, AND THIS IS, THIS IS A SPOILER TO SOME EXTENT, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO READ THE NOVEL OR YOU NOT. IN THE NOVEL, GREGORY DEVELOPS A RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN IN THE RESIDENTIAL FACILITY WHERE HE LIVES. AND DIANE DEVELOPS A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER MAN. AS I WAS DOING MY RESEARCH, I TALKED TO MANY SPOUSES . I DID A LOT OF READING ABOUT THIS. AND SPOUSES COME TO DIFFERENT DETERMINATIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO WITH THEIR LIFE. IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR PEOPLE IN THESE FACILITIES TO BECOME INVOLVED SEXUALLY AND EMOTIONALLY WITH NEW PEOPLE. I GOT AN EMAIL FROM A WOMAN WHO WAS EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT THIS SAME THING. SHE WAS I THINK COMING FROM A BIBLICAL TYPE OF JUDGMENT. AND I THINK HER VERY MUCH FOR HER EMAIL. --AND I THANKED HER FOR HER EMAIL AND DIDN'T SAY THAT UNDER THE DESK IN THE BIBLE EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN HAPPENS. ALL I'M GOING TO SAY IS THAT MY RESEARCH , TALKING TO MANY SPOUSES AND FAMILIES AND SITUATIONS, REVEALED THAT PEOPLE FIND MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO MAINTAIN WHOLENESS AND HEALTH. MY QUESTION WAS, THE WRITING PROCESS. MY QUESTION TO YOU WAS, DID YOU CHOOSE GREGORY'S PROFESSION AS AN ARCHITECT AND ESSENTIALLY BUILDING STRUCTURES AND EDIFICES TO BE A CONTRAST TO THE DISINTEGRATION THAT ALZHEIMER'S CAUSES IN TERMS OF THE BRAIN AND MEMORY FUNCTIONS ? OR WAS THAT A COINCIDENCE. IT WAS A COINCIDENCE. [LAUGHTER] AND ACTUALLY WHEN WE ARE WRITING , THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT BY THE TIME WE HAD FINISHED WRITING SEEM ORGANICALLY BUILT INTO THE STORY THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER CHOICE YOU COULD'VE MADE. I MADE HIM AN ARCHITECT BECAUSE I WANTED A PROFESSION, I WANTED HIM TO HAVE A PROFESSOR THAT'S A PROFESSION I HAD NEVER WRITTEN ABOUT. THAT IS ALL. HE COULD'VE BEEN A DOCTOR, AND THERE COULD'VE BEEN METAPHORICAL SYMBOLISM AROUND BEING A DOCTOR AND LOSING HIS HEALTH. I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT. THE BOOK, HE IS AN ARCHITECT WHOSE FINGERPRINT IS ALL OVER WASHINGTON DC. AS THE CITY IS COMING TO A NEW PLACE, HE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE IT ANYMORE. THERE IS A TENSION BETWEEN AS YOU SAY, THE ARCHITECTURE, HE WAS AN ARCHITECT, THE ARCHITECTURE OF HIS LIFE RUMBLING AS A CITY THAT HE EMBEDA --IMPART BUILT IS RISING. --THAT HE IMPART --IN PART BUILT THAT IS RISING. ANY OF THE DEEPEST MOST POWERFUL THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE STORY COME FROM JUST WRITING AND WRITING AND WRITING, LIKE THE TITLE. WHICH I LOVE. IT CAME TO ME ONE DAY, I WAS WRITING ABOUT DIANE , I WAS NEAR THE END, AND WHAT ALL OF THIS HAD MEANT FOR HER. AND HER FAMILY. AND I WROTE THE SENTENCE, THE WIDE CIRCUMFERENCE. IT CAME ORGANICALLY OUT OF SEVERAL YEARS OF LIVING AND BREATHING THE STORY. GREAT QUESTION. THANK YOU. I WAS INTERESTED IN RECOMMENDATIONS YOU TEASED ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND DIET THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE MIGHT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. SOME OF THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE BUILT. FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT ALZHEIMER'S IS. ALZHEIMER'S IS A FORM OF DEMENTIA , IT IS THE MOST COMMON , YOU CAN DEVELOP IF YOU HAVE A STROKE OR CONCUSSION, --PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S GRADUALLY, NOT JUST FORGET THINGS, BUT THEIR MEMORY IS IMPAIRED. THEY FORGET , IT IS NOT WHERE ARE MY KEYS, BUT WHAT ARE KEYS FOR? OVER TIME WITH ALZHEIMER'S, THE BRAIN STOPS TELLING THE BODY , I'M HUNGRY. I WANT TO WALK. I NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. AND OVERTIME, BECAUSE THE BRAIN STOPS TELLING THE BODY HOW TO FUNCTION, THE BODY DEVELOPS AN INFECTION AND BASICALLY SHUTS DOWN. MANY PEOPLE DIE OF PNEUMONIA. THE BRAIN FORGETS TO TELL THE BODY WHAT TO DO AND YOU SIMPLY DIMINISH , ITERATIVELY THIS LITERALLY AND FIGURED. PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA HAVE MEMORY PROBLEMS BUT THEY CAN READ A BOOK AND STAND UP AND NOT KNOW WHO THEIR DAUGHTER IS. THERE DIFFERENT. ALZHEIMER'S , THERE IS SO MUCH THAT IS KNOWN AND A LOT NOT KNOWN. WE KNOW THERE IS A GENE THAT CAUSES ALZHEIMER'S. IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT JEAN GIVES AFRICAN-AMERICANS A GREATER PROPENSITY FOR DEVELOPING ALZHEIMER'S EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T KNOW WHY. IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMITTEE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS THERE --THAT THERE IS MORE OBESITY, HIGH CHOLESTEROL, DIABETES, ALL THESE VASCULAR DISEASES, OVERTIME KILLED THE BRAIN IN ADDITION TO IF YOU HAVE THE GENE IN YOUR FAMILY. SO THAT, NOW IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION, OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS THE RESEARCHERS ARE DISCOVERING IS THAT EATING WHOLE HEALTHY FOODS , HAVING A LIFESTYLE THAT IS ACTIVE AND A LIFESTYLE IN WHICH YOU ARE DEEPLY CONNECTED TO SATISFY RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE AND IN WHICH ACTIVELY HANDLE STRESS CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. THEY HAVE DONE STUDIES WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR 30s WHO HAD EVERYTHING, DIABETES, HIGH CHOLESTEROL, ALL THOSE THINGS, AND IF THEY DEVELOPED A REALLY GOOD LIFESTYLE , THEY HAD VERY LITTLE ALZHEIMER'S WHEN THEY GOT INTO THEIR 60s AND 70s. EVEN IF YOU HAVE ALZHEIMER'S IN YOUR FAMILY, IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP ALZHEIMER'S. VERY INTERESTINGLY, WHEN I'M DOING THE RESEARCH, I ASKED SOME OF THE RESEARCHERS, WOULD YOU RECOMMEND SOMEONE TAKE A TEST TO SEE IF THEY HAVE A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION? THEY SAID NO. THE TEST IS NOT FOOLPROOF. SECONDLY, IT MAY AFFECT YOUR CAR INSURANCE. YOUR LIFE INSURANCE. THAT IS, EVERYTHING IS ON THE COMPUTER. NOTHING IS SECRET. THEY RECOMMENDED SIMPLY LIVING THE HEALTHIEST LIFE YOU CAN LIVE. THAT'S WHY I SAY YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT IT. MY MOTHER DIED AT THE AGE OF 63 OF A STROKE. IT WAS HER SECOND STROKE. SHE HAD ONE WHEN I WAS 12. SHE RECOVERED. BUT SHE DIDN'T CHANGE HER LIFESTYLE . IN THOSE DAYS, NO ONE EXERCISED. IN THE 60s, NO ONE EXERCISED. SHE SUFFERED FROM BEING OVERWEIGHT AND NOT HANDLING STRESS WELL. I LOOKED AT MY MOTHER AND SAID I'M NOT GOING DOWN THAT PATH. IN MY 20s I STARTED YOGA, WALKING, VEGETARIAN, EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF. NOW I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU MY AGE, BUT I AM 10 YEARS YOUNGER , --AM 10 YEARS YOUNGER THAN MY AGE WHEN THEY TEST YOU. THAT IS EXCITING. THAT IS WHY I REALLY DO THINK THAT YOU PREDICTED HALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 80 BY 2050 WILL HAVE ALZHEIMER'S, MY GOD, -- THEY HAVE EVEN FOUND THAT EXERCISE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEMENTIA CAN CONTROL SOME OF THE MANIFESTATIONS. THERE IS A SAYING THAT WHEN YOU WALK OUT YOUR TWO LEGS ARE YOUR DOCTORS. APPARENTLY IT'S TRUE.  HAS ANYONE  YOU INTERVIEWED EVER TOLD YOU I LOVE YOU BUT I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE? I THINK YOU MEAN IN TERMS OF LIVING WITH THE DISEASE ? NO. BUT I WAS WITH SOME PEOPLE LAST NIGHT AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS. ONE OF THE MEN WHOSE MOTHER HAS ALZHEIMER'S , HE SAID SHE HAD TOLD HIM, YEARS EARLIER, THAT IF SHE EVER --THEY WERE VISITING A FRIEND WHO HAD ALZHEIMER'S. SHE SAID, IF I EVER GET LIKE THAT COUPLE A GUN TO MY HEAD. OF COURSE HE IS NOT GOING TO PUT A GUN TO HER HEAD. BUT IN MY RESEARCH I FOUND THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THERE WAS A CLUB OF SENIORS IN GREENBELT MARYLAND -- GREENBELT, MARYLAND WHO HAD MADE A SUICIDE PACT. IF ONE SPOUSE ALZHEIMER'S, THEY WOULD BOTH IN THEIR LIVES. IF ANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE , STILL ALICE, WHICH IS ABOUT A WOMAN WHO DEVELOPS ALZHEIMER'S, WHEN SHE DEVELOPED THE DISEASE SHE HAD PUT AWAY PILLS BECAUSE SHE SAID IF IT EVER GETS SO BAD, THE TIME SHE GOT SO BAD, SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO USE THE PILLS. I THINK ALZHEIMER'S MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT THESE KINDS OF LIFE AND DEATH --WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE? HOW DO YOU WANT TO LIVE? YOU WANT TO DIE? THE DEEP QUESTIONS. I THINK FAMILIES NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. WE HAD ALREADY MADE A WILL, BUT DURING THE RESEARCH FOR THIS BOOK I SAT DOWN WITH OUR GROWN CHILDREN AND TALKED ABOUT THIS, THIS IS WHAT WE WANT AND DON'T WANT. THESE WERE IMPORTANT ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.  [APPLAUSE] [ MUSIC ]
