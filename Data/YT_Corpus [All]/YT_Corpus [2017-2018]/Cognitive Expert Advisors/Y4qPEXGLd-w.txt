 so good evening everyone and thank you very much for being here I am delighted and privileged to be able to share with you some of my thinking about relational and collective leadership tonight and thank you jennifer for this invitation and for organizing this so I thought I would start first by asking you to think for a moment about a time when you experienced the leadership that expressed and think about a word that describes good leadership one word sorry I know that's hard but one word okay hopefully you have one word now please raise your hand if you thought of an adjective describing an individual characteristic of a good leader authentic courageous listener alright so I about one third I would think so raise your hand if you thought about an action or an activity like listening engaging others influencing others alright so verbs actions that's about another third okay and what about if you thought of a some kind of relational conditions like collaboration group work engaging others alright that's a smaller group but still there in fact what we have here is exactly the government of possible ways in which we can think about leadership and it is because we are going through a transition from thinking about the individual dimensions of leadership which are in fact incredibly important for leadership to happen but moving towards also thinking and considering the collective dimensions of leadership and so we're moving from heroic to post heroic leadership so I try to look for some words some images about leadership in Google image this is what I found most of the images are like this but I also found images like this right and so in fact we have kind of like both of these kinds of ways of thinking about leadership in our heads because what we are going through is we're a change in our mindset but it's really quite revolutionary and like all revolutionary changes it creates confusion because we're in the middle we're not there we're not here so in fact we have very clear that we need a new type of leadership for the type of work that we want to do and nevertheless we continue to operate under the expectations of the old frames and molds that keep us back as we try to move forward but change is inevitable because the world is changing and more importantly at the core of this transition in leadership mindset is an acknowledgment that addressing wicked problems especially in public services is something that we cannot do alone in a shared powered world no one single person no one single organization will be able to solve the type of problems that we need to solve and in the verbatim in our times here's how Management scholars talk about a shared powered world you may be familiar with this I'm sure as a share part well in the context of public service I just let you some time to read it it's a very turbulent time as you can see and notice the shared car world is not that everyone has power if the power is fragmented it's in different places and each group or person has a little bit of the power that may be needed but nobody has all the power so in that sense we really are in a confusing time we're once left command-and-control and then when we try to do this we want we also want less dependent to be less dependent on positional Authority and then when we try to do this we face the some of the obstacles that all of you are facing as we go as you do your work here so this is what leadership is about right now so this is the way it looks like this is the way it feels like an existential moment that I think we're all sharing at least many of us including myself feel it this way and you can consider this in the context of the work that you're trying to do here in Scotland to be the best place to grow up and bring up children that's a big aspiration and when you think about it or I read in the in the website you want a child centered approach but you really do not want a leader centred approach you want a collective approach you want a system centred approach and that easier said than done right so if you think about getting it right for every child you're doing really interesting and innovative work I was very impressed when I looked around when I discussed this with Jennifer and what I realized is that you're actually doing work that is collective leadership but you haven't named it collective leadership and so I thought it would be interesting and fun to bring some of those Network frameworks to you to name some of the things that you are already doing and think about what that does for you what what kind of insights does that bring for you the real point I think if we look at this from the lens of collective and relational leadership is to think about what kind of leadership do you need to go from here to there to getting it right for every child because we know you're not there right we're not there right so what you want to think is about a type leadership that helps to create the conditions for a system to be full of leadership some colleagues and Barbara has written some chapters with the with a one of these colleagues talks about what we needed leader full environments environments that are full of leadership and so the question really for you is how do we engage all people who are stakeholders in making sure that we get it right for every child so how do we make sure that politicians public service managers the children and the parents the social workers that are proposing decisions about the children the solicitors lawyers who make those decisions how do we bring all these together to really engage together in this kind of approach rather than each of them thinking about their own so this of course is not a simple question but it is very much worth considering and so what I want to do is to kind of like walk you through some of the frameworks that allow us to think about that question so with that in mind then I've done most of the framing I have one more point I want to make about the framing what I want to do in the rest of the presentation is talk a little bit or have a presentation about why do we need a different kind of leadership you you know it in your gut but I want to articulate it more formally and why relational leadership represents an answer to that need and then take some time to talk about a specific example that I know well because it's part of my research about how relational leadership has been used in a particular context and here and ask you to think about how how does that connect to the type of work that you're doing here but I do have two caveats that I want to make sure that I put on the table for you the first caveat is that I will not be able to give you formulas about how to do leadership effectively or answer the big questions that you have because relational leadership is contextual it is about making meaning in the moment in the context and with the system that you have and so there no formulas and when my students ask me give us some formulas I'm like no there are no formulas and of course in this world of marketing and packaging and it's hard to not say so we've created four C's and a couple of things here and there that I'll show you but really my my deepest belief if there are no formulas it is about getting yourself on the ground and thinking about this in the context of the urgent matters that you have in front of you and I would suggest it's about being in the world in a particular way that allows you to move through that so that's my first caveat the second caveat is I don't think I'm going to say anything here that you do not know or have not experienced in your own work so I'm not going to pretend that I'm an expert in child services and policy I'm not I'm actually learning now I have a doctoral student that wants to do care policy and so I'm learning more about this but what I would like to try to do for you is to place your ideas and experiences in a framework that helps you think about this differently that helps put you in the balcony and look back at some of the work that you're doing and then perhaps unleash your imagination about what are some other things that come up as you think about your own experience in the context of these this ideas so my goal here is to name some experiences that you've had and see what happens with that so with that in mind I'm going to start with the first part of the presentation formally which is about thinking about why new leadership and why relational leadership so there is a shift about how we're talking about organizing right now and we have said it's a situation that has moved us from a world characterized by fixed and order rules compartmentalize functions theoretical structures where management is supervisory and evaluative and where there is really an a symmetrical influence of the way we have thought of and understood leadership and this is shifting to a world where there's a lot much a lot many more interdependent space holder's working in teams trying to figure out how to do it and in this context management is a facilitate mutual adjustment is less has less authority and scholars talk about this say or the diagnosis they bring is in both sectors private public and it actually there's a decline of traditional managerial authority and a parallel emergence of alternative forms of authority this is happening out there right in fact in the new reality in public service it's about collaborative governance this is a new way of thinking about this where again we're pushing for these ideas they haven't completely come up but you will recognize some of the work that you're doing in the context of collaborative government I want to read to you the definition of collaborative governance by this is from Emerson Nabatean below they say collaborative governance is the processes and structures of decision making in public management and policy that engage constructively multiple actors and cross public agency boundaries jurisdictional boundaries and boundaries between the public private and civic spheres to attain a purpose that otherwise would not have been possible to produce so this idea of collaborative governance is very much in in our new way of thinking about and there and in fact you will recognize some of the examples that are typical of collaborative governance around the world and perhaps here the idea of more information coming out of government open government participatory budgeting deliveries dialogue around some of the issues we have service delivery networks co-production of services we have lots of formal collaborations happening to try to address particular issues we have coalition's and networks of social actors perhaps in partnership with some of the of the public employees who are also wanting to influence public policy and in general we have also the private sector entering with new ideas of share value in your cities etcetera so in this new context of collaborative governance there are three or there are two issues that I want to highlight the background to the work the to the points that I want to make here the first one is that in this context public service delivery requires managing complex configurations and systems so it's really a lot about the system and the second one is that the state and its representatives play a different role than they did before they play more of a broker in role and these demands more collaborative and inclusive and inclusive public management as such so we have this idea of the status of broker and when you are a broker you need to develop different kinds of capabilities here and so when instr and more talk about the need to develop the capacity to analyze and understand interconnections interdependencies interactions this is all about whole system's thinking creating the conditions for others to be able to take up their own leadership because your understanding is that each of these interconnections interdependence and interaction requires obviously more than yourself in the picture right it also requires a new public leadership and what is interesting is the argument is these new kind of leadership needs must persuade stakeholders to accept that they themselves are part of the whole system and therefore they're part of the problem and I would say therefore they're part of the solution right and so the idea here is how do you bring all those potential stakeholders into into this work now it's very important to think and realize that these creates a paradox for for people in public service but on the one hand you have the demands of the bureaucratic model that are impact they're all there so you have the need for clarifying rules and roles preserve the public interest the rule of law and it's all about vertical accountability so you have to manage that on the other side you have to manage demands with an open and network model that is happening with the networks as soon as you get partnerships and an alliance with others who are different from the bureaucracy you're there and in that model you want to take risk take risks you want flexibility you want a DAP tation you want collaboration it's all about horizontal relationships of accountability it's all about wearing this together so here you have these two energies that kind of pull you in two different directions and you need to figure out how to honor both of them how to live with both of them how to bring them together in a way that about the result it's about the children at the end right so managing paradox becomes a really very important part of this kind of work and if you think about it then that's what the new leadership is all about so what we're talking about here is an environment that is about facing the unknown and so we have situations of rapid change and turbulent competition over scarce resources we have the idea of the shared power world we talked about we have diversity which is about different disciplines different jurisdictional levels different types of social identities all trying to figure out what they can bring and how can they bring their different logics to work here and then we have the idea that the expectations from younger generations but even some of us in older generations that we want our work to make me to mean something we want with the purpose we want to be able to control some of it that's also there and this idea of participation and meaning and finally the idea of pirates which I just mentioned before so all this really is about complexity and in this context a leadership scholar Ron Heifetz and his colleagues have explored what are the implications of complexity thinking for thinking for leadership and for different kinds of leadership so I'm going to tell you a little bit some of you may actually be familiar already with heifetz model of adaptive leadership but basically what I think is interesting about the way it is framing this as the beginning of a conversation about relational leadership is really that he makes an interesting distinction between when you have technical problems that you have to and you have adaptive challenges so the technical problems are for example an open heart operation where it's complicated it's sophisticated you need to do all these things but it's predictable and and solvable you know what are the steps you must follow you know what the problem is and you know what is expected to happen you know you know exactly the steps and you know it's the you know like the surgeon is the leader and he's going to do the work and everyone else is working or she and everyone will else it is working support one two three we're done this is a technical problems we're highly sophisticated highly risky but technical you know if we manage everything well it happened adaptiq challenges on the other hand is something different adaptive challenges examples of these of adaptive challenges here our children's malnutrition poverty inequality right when you have an adaptive challenge you don't know what the problem itself is and there is no agreement about what the problem is and so part of what needs to happen is that meet people need to figure out what and agree on what kind of problem we're talking about and only by a bring on the type of problem will we be able to agree on the type of solution alright so when you have an adaptive challenge there are no tools there in fact some of the tools that are there may get in the way when you try adaptive challenges you not really know about them because you've tried things and they haven't worked right so solving it requires changing your assumptions thinking about what are new methods and new tools you really need to figure out how you can change your internal mental models and those of other people outside to be able to think differently about this and so adaptive challenge really requires a different kind of leadership it's about supporting people to be able to make this change in their own mental models and to be able to figure out how to be together as they jump into the unknown right and so leadership is less about influencing others but more about working with others to figure out together how to address these adaptive challenges little thing is that leadership is therefore a type of activity a type of collective activity it's a type of work collective work that mobilizes peoples and organizations around the adaptive challenges that they are facing it's about creating a supportive environment for for people to be able to change their model and engage in different ways of acting and some people have talked about this in specially people who do complexity theory that today's environment in today's environment the most creative and innovative work happens at the edge of chaos so what does this mean it's a time a place of placing the wave where order is on though you're not doing this in an orderly fashion and in fact if you stay with order and predictability you're stocking on creative it's not either at the other extreme where you enter into chaos and then nothing can be done and you're lost right so it's at the edge as you're entering into pail that's the moment where something interesting is going to happen and so helping me people move to that edge of chaos becomes a different kind of leadership and it requires a leader that will accept that he or she will lose some of the control they have because it really is about getting in there into the hard work with all together and so here are some of the characteristics that some people from complexity leadership Theory talk about that are needed for a leader in the context of leading at the edge of chaos so you can see it it's about process orientation it's about boundary crossing you need to be completely under it you need to be very resilient you need to just keep going over and over you need to be committed to the idea that diversity is good even though it creates a lot of problems for you but it's good as long as you have figured out how to work it and you need to be committed to continuous learning and finally you need some self-awareness maturity and authenticity because this is not for the faint of heart right this is hard work and it's hard work that you're not doing on your own you're doing with others who are carrying also that anxiety of leaving dropping their mental models and moving next so really leading at the edge of chaos demands different kinds of capabilities but if you look at these our education system isn't really training us to do this this is really more about an industrial model of leadership this I'm sorry the way we're thinking is more in terms of an industrial model of leadership while this is more of a post-industrial model of leadership right and some people have argued you know the the industrial model of leadership which came up at the moment of the big transformation of the Industrial Revolution really was rationalistic technocratic quantitative linear scientific in language management oriented goal achievement dominated cost-benefit driven and utilitarian now all those words are there for us still a lot of this thing is still happening and so part of what we're trying to figure out when we think about relational leadership and more collective forms is that in a post-industrial society we must balance the important orientation that we have in the left side of our brain which is what has dominated the pairing that has dominated our educational system and our leadership and then it's equally important to start bringing in this orientation from the right side of the brain to some extent post heroic leadership is about bringing the whole self into the work so with this in mind then we can look at the evolution of leadership theories and you will see here a move from an industrial to post-industrial model of leadership theories gradually you know trade behavior contingency transformation we gradually moving away from the exclusive focus on individuals towards a more collective perspective leadership schools focus more on seeing leadership not as a trade towards the behavior although it is also a when it is and accident people there are traits and behaviors that help to do it but it's not just that there is much more happening here so post a roid leadership emphasizes relationality defines leadership as the work to create conditions for more collaborate behavior for stronger horizontal relationships with accountability for stronger bonds among stakeholders with very very different perspectives and you will be familiar with lots of adjectives new adjectives that now get added to the leadership theory to leadership Theory expect that help will become an industry in itself right so you add a new adjective and now you're going to become famous right and so these are always different ways in which we're doing it and some have called it right and so it's this is about leadership in the pura right what is common to all these is that in all these emergence approaches what you have is the idea of the visible leader as just one piece of the puzzle and that under the water there is all this stuff happening and there are all these other people who are important in the work of leadership or you can also think about it as part of a larger whole where what you have is a visible leader that's working with others but the real point here is that in both cases leadership is defined as a collective activity it's the whole system approach to leadership because now it's not an individual but it's an individual in relation to others who are in different parts of the system and that you have to identify well so so Systems thinking becomes really important and with system thinking comes some of those right hand side of the brain the capabilities I'm going to read you a couple so that just to illustrate seeing the big picture understanding the circular nature of complex cause of relationships finding meaningful collection connections between and within systems valuing multiple perspectives considering how mental models affect present and future seeing the value of process rather than quick conclusions and seeing the importance of context all these are capabilities that we need to develop if we really want to lead in the context of a whole system approach one last point here to make if we add something is this way of thinking about leadership really represents a shifting paradigm from a leader centered approach to a system centered approach and our colleagues from the center for creative leadership with whom I worked in the past they push this paradigm a lot more say that leadership is really a collective achievement it's not something that you're carrying around and exists out there it's something that emergent emerges as a group tries to figure out how they are going to get up there the requirements for collective action Direction alignment and commitment so leadership emergence as the group makes sense of the problems that they are dealing with to find the right direction to the work so it's not the leader here this is the direction I'm giving you the vision is where what are we doing and how do we figure out what's the best way to move forward then once you have the direction it's about aligning the contributions and the flow so that everyone knows exactly what should have to be happening and will do the work at the best and then it's about making sure that people stick and commit to each other and to the vision of the future so basically what this approach to leadership says is that leadership is an intentional work that brings that into existence it brings Direction alignment and commitment into existence so is there a role for the formal leader here yes there is is to create the conditions for people to be able to find that together so you see this idea of creating the conditions is starting to become like a mantra that that are so very quickly I thought I'd give you a little story that shows how that gets created how many of you have heard about this much house and movement in rock rather than okay so I don't have as much information about it I read it I thought this is fantastic this illustrates very well what does this what the story's about so there's a small group of public managers working with different vulnerable populations start talking about the first rate that they have that are associated with the fragmentation of the services they start talking about this and at the heart of the conversation they realize there's this moral outrage about the fact that the system itself is creating the obstacles and creating the problems that it's trying to solve in the first place right and they say this is unacceptable so they're making meaning about this they're pushing a different way of thinking about this and they're actually saying also you know we're being pushed for just more efficiency and sometimes that happens at the expense of clients who are falling through the cracks right and that is unacceptable by making visible and engaging in conversation about this frustration together they are naming what is intolerable to them and public servants and they're finding a new direction to the work that they're going to be doing together so they agreed to support each other in ensuring that every client of every one of them of the ones that are part of this group gets appropriate services and they would not say no to each other as they reached for support when they needed to do something in the system and so they said we're not going to break the law but we're going to go beyond the rules whenever it is necessary and so they agreed to meet six times to tell stories about how they're dealing with these problems to help each other support it and to tell stories of success mostly and in the process they develop a strong network that gives them more information about the system that gives them more access to other relationships that they didn't have before and suddenly they have a much more robust set of resources that they can use to do their work so some scholars have talked about these are setting up chains of cooperation at the smallest scale of collective action required for the client and this help this is very it's very locally contextualized but the people from different part of the system are coming together to help and support you know each other so so what has happened here they found direction to do the work and in an integrated manner they've aligned their work as a group so that they add flexibility and resources and support each other and telling the stories they also help people realize that they can make a difference this can happen something different can happen and they encourage other people to join because they start hearing the stories and they want to come and hear too so and people from different parts of the system actually join so they've created Direction alignment and commitment for a smooth integration of systems for their clients at the local level faction so obviously this is a working progress but it gives you a sense of how leadership is emerging and how leadership becomes this collective activity where everyone plays an important role so with that in mind so a new relational way of thinking about leadership would be to say that leadership is what happens when a group of individuals are able to coordinate their actions to achieve something that they see as desirable for human will be and I would say it's when people see their individual efforts and they convert them into collective action that then is perceived by the group as collective achievement when that happens leadership has emerged this is what a good leadership looks like and of course there's a leader there are always leaders a leader is someone who intentionally creates opportunities and engages others to facilitate these contributions so leadership can happen everywhere in the system so with this in mind then let's go to the promise of relational leadership in this last part we've basically come full circle to the usefulness of a relational approach with big shifts happening in society and in public service and thinking of the formal visible leader of playing a very different role and noticing that leadership may emerge in different places in the system so what I wanted to do is very very quickly and then you know like I can talk more about these in questions and answers if you want to but talk about the work that I've done that Jennifer mentioned about leadership for social change where we worked with organizations in the United States who were really trying to figure out how to break the systemic barriers other clients had and so the question that we were asking using a relational approach and collective approach to leadership is what does the work of leadership looked like to produce change when organizations that have scan financial resources but that have a strong conviction that change must happen to ensure the well-being of communities so how do these organizations which actually have very little resources produce extraordinary work and how does that happen and so we developed a series of frameworks that I'm not I don't have time to share them a lot or with you but what I will say is when I started thinking about does this apply is these are social change organizations in civil society does it apply to the public service and I've spent about five years thinking about this and writing a little bit about this and what I would say is that tackling adapted challenges in public service requires the same systemic approach and we can learn from these organizations and bring some of these stuff to the work that we're doing and so in terms of thinking about whether these this was the case my colleague and I Erica and I Erica foldy and I looked for other research that have happened there and asked well are there any commonalities that happen in different context and we came up with this for meta practices or conceptual buckets so this is one of our four C's for marketing as you can see right where in fact lots of people in different contexts doing research were documenting something connected to cognition so this was about changing mental models so words like visionary leadership sense making and visioning catalyzing we call it reframing discourse and I'll tell you briefly about it in a moment so also there was something about connection which is about dealing with diversity and figuring out how we use that diversity and so there was relating representing and mobilizing member organizations in networks promoting group learning boundary spanning activities we call it bridging difference and the third one the third kept C's capacity which is really about making sure that people who want to do leadership have the capacity do it that they have actually that they know how to do it it's not just wine to do it it's about getting the capabilities are needed we call that baby they talked about continuous learning and soothing and empowering members of a network we talked about unleashing human energies and then the last one is consciousness is this up self-awareness self-reflection caring about your own footprint in the world being conscientious about how you interact with others we didn't give it a name but we say it's leadership as a new way of being and relating in the world which is what the only formula that I'll give you is to think about how can you be differently in the world and relate to others differently in the world and so with this in mind here the social change leadership work framework that we created no time to go into telephone on this one justifies it to say that what these organizations do is to figure out what kind of strategic work do they need to do to leverage the power to change something out there in the world and if you think about it you'll see on if this works I will try it now Sound running against time but what you see is a lived problem of the in terms of systemic exclusion that creates a vision of urgency for the well-being that gets translated into a vision of the future which is the change the long-term outcomes that you want to change and this is nested in a world who you that defines the type of Powerman actions that you would bring in it defines the types of activities that are permissible or not it's about the values of the group it's bringing together and all that nests the type of work that needs to happen to create the collective capacity for people to be able to leverage power outside and so what we've discovered is that the you know you have to manage the nonprofit organization so you need to deal with the technologies of management strategic management all that stuff you also need to deal with the core organizational tasks it is resource or hospital it would be about health managing and managing and curing patients in a school it's about education and in social change organizations it's about organizing and advocating and helping to produce community and so it is what we try to do in looking at this is how does leadership happen in this context so how does that process move from one side to the other one and so I thought I very briefly some ways in which this particular organization the young women stream Center from Oakland does it so here's what they're trying to do this is from there and from their website and just so that you have a sense of what are the kinds of actual work that they do as they're critical tasks they work with young women who are in the juvenile system so the juvenile justice system so prepare them when when they leave the system so they do training in jail they work with young women in the street prostitution drug sales gangs to help prevent them ending up in jail and so they do internships and organizing with them they also have a 12-week reentry peer support for young women and girls who are being released from custody and they work with them and also the young women who have been part of the programs are groomed to be hired by the organization to do some of the peer work and actually several of their executive development executive directors have been women who have come out of the system so with this in mind we identify these three types of relational practices we didn't make them they make them up from the data we didn't enter with them intern to us and so let's an example of each of these to close these presentation the first one is reframing discourse which is about challenging the existing mental models that contribute to makeup or reinforce the problem so here the issue is that you cannot change the world with the same mental models that helps create the problems that you want change you cannot use the same language that helps to reproduce the problems you have to create a new language and this in itself is already creating change alright and then you have to convey it to others so you have to figure out how you help produce cognitive shifts in all those other important audiences that are connected to you so it's not about framing not about marketing it's about reframing challenging pushing the angles so how do they do it this is a lot of stuff like to tell you but notice in this slide the idea of women who have been misunderstood right so what does that already say about how the reframing what this is all about this is about women who are growing up in poverty who face tremendous challenges who end up in jail because of these issues and then are treated like criminals or young women who need corrective because they've been misunderstood by society and continue to be misunderstood by society all right so they're trying to survive at all cost under conditions of poverty and then they do mistakes we don't need to punish them we need an opportunity to grow and heal that's what we need and so the intentional message is to bring in a new language in a new way of thinking about it and once you think about girls this way the whole reframing has happened and now you have a direction that's very different and so examples well intentional message right so language notice the word freedom in the title that's really making reference to the civil rights the idea of oppression the idea of liberation from oppression the peer advisors are called self-determination coaches right so that already tells you it's something different than them right it's sleeping the idea of who's responsible for the problems that these girls with these women are facing it's not their parents it's not themselves is assistance is the poverty itself that's doing this so it's a systemic problem and we need to attack it as a systemic problem so that already helps you a different way of reframing so I thought I'd stop for one second and it'll take three more minutes here what must be refrained to make Scotland the best place to grow up and bring up children what are some of the mental models that you have to challenge to be able to think differently about the specific work that you're doing I'm not going to ask you to tell me back but I thought I shut up for a moment that you think the second type of leadership work is bridging difference this one is easy to grasp because we're all trying to do it but the key point I'll make here is that it is about valuing the importance of diversity and difference and understanding that when the social workers are doing their work here and are arguing for some stuff and when the solicitors are doing their work here and are arguing for something different that there's a logic and a value in each of those two and what you need to do is not to get rid of the difference it's to bring and bridge the difference so that people can see each other and can figure out from their own perspectives what can happen now that both of you know that you can keep being who you are but now you're in this together and you equalize yourself in the context of others right and so a brief example from this organization it's so first of all you have to do bridging towards the outside so this statement tells you that this is a problem for everyone it's not just for these girls this is really we must invest now in improving our tomorrow it's everyone who has to be part of this some internal bridging that happens well Latino black and white young women think of themselves as having very different experiences in fact they may have belonged to gangs in the street where they're killing each other and they get engaged in storytelling sessions about their experiences and they start realizing but they're more similar than different right so there's this whole process by which they start seeing the humanity of each other in a different way so that's really important more over equitable mechanisms that make sure that everyone starts to see themselves in the same way and so what we have here is for example that the Board of Directors of this organization is all made of young women they're all young women some of them who actually have gone through the experience itself right and so you've created already a different place from where people are connecting and they're bringing the their difference what makes them unique to help the problem right and bridging with outside outside audiences is about connecting with others who care about these young women and so they don't demo nice governor officials when they have problems in fact they congratulate them when they work with it and they actually reached out to the germinal justice public officials and said to them you know what you don't have the resources or the capacity and the knowledge to figure out how to help the girls who are coming out into the world to be ready we can do it let us do it and they managed to convince of it officials so now they do training inside the jails and who are the teachers the piers appear peers are the ones who are doing some of this work so you see they're reaching out to the system itself so important to ask whose perspectives must be reached and how to make Scotland the best place to grow up and bring up children again a systemic perspective will give you a sense of what are the different places where you have to do these collective work and to finish unleashing human energies which is really about if we want to be leaders how we create the capacity for us to be leaders so it's about learning and unlearning and so here the emphasis is really on actually the people who are experiencing the problem and the perspective that developed here is the need to develop self efficacy and confidence that you can control the self acts pixies confidence that you can control over your life and have capacity to figure it out and so this is something that needs to happen with social workers who are treated very badly in our systems for example how do we develop their self efficacy and self-efficacy is about the face that you can actually change the system and control your own life so with the young woman's freedom sense notice what they say in the website we lived through adversity survived by our ability so this is about understanding that knowledge is power there are various forms of knowing that can marshal power personal experience is the legitimate source of knowledge Authority and expertise and there is abundance of knowledge and expertise in the group of people who are actually engaged in the problem itself and in the frontline employees who are engaged with them so it really is pushing down the leadership and distributing the leadership down to the point of more of the most micro level points of it so the last example about them is this idea of participating in a City Commission on prostitution of young women and so the girls were the young women who are part of it have to prepare themselves have to learn about policy and then they go and tell their stories but it's beyond their stories it's about making suggestions and solutions and so they end up being are having an influence in what public officials are thinking in terms of creating policy for the city so again both whose energies must be unleashed and how to make Scotland the best place to grow up and bring up children becomes an important point so with this I'll let you thinking about how can we move from this kind of leadership to this kind of leadership and to think about the most important picture implication of thinking about the post to the promise of relational leadership is that with heroic leadership you have to go through repeated efforts to influence others one follower at a time with relational leadership you have a more sustainable approach it's developing an ongoing learning community that takes that growth by itself and that develops different source of leadership that go beyond those that are in the heads of the the visible leader now process become sources of leadership conversations become sources of leadership so you expand the opportunity of sources of leadership and then you bring that down all the way to the bottom of the hierarchy and let those ideas and those capacities to lead from the bottom up so you have both from the bottom up and from both down so I'm going to stop there and I'm sorry I took a couple of minutes [Applause]
