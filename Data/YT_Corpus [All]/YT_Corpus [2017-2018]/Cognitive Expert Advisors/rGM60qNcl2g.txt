 Okay, I think we got everybody a seat. We're looking good, awesome well let me introduce to you our wonderful panel today. First we have Dr. John Ryan and he is the most VCU  person you can meet he tells me. He has a variety of roles. He's a professor in biology, he is also an associate vice provost of research and he oversees the office of post doctoral affairs in that role and so that's part of why he is kind of our expert because he hires postdocs and so well yes he had a postdoc and in fact his postdoc was at the NIH. He did his PhD here at VCU and he postdoc at the NIH, and then he came back as an assistant professor, he's been here a long long time. He has a lot of wisdom, so he can speak kind of from both sides. And then, next we have Molly Eyre, and she is one of our erect fellows, which is a postdoctoral program really focused on refining your teaching skills, and she'll probably tell us a little bit more about that. She's been here for a little over a year and she came to us from the University of Maryland College Park where she did her PhD in neuroscience and cognitive science, and she was nearby as an undergrad at Randolph Macon a while back, so welcome back to central Virginia. And then we have Kalila Robinson Johnson, and she is joining us as a postdoc with iCubed. Have you guys heard of iCubed? So it's the Institute for Inclusion, Inquiry, and Innovation and she joined us this year. She finished in December of 2016 her PhD in occupational science at UNC Chapel Hill and she did her undergrad, dual degree and masters in occupational therapy, at the Women's College of Brunai University in Georgia so she has an interesting perspective. And then we have Jonathan Lindsey and Jonathan has been here at VCU just since this summer as a post doc and he came to us from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville where he did his PhD in biochemistry, and his undergrad was also there. And then Morgan is going to be joining us but she's running a little bit late, so she should come sneak in on the end but you'll know she is when she comes, and she finished her PhD last year in social psychology and so she's continued on as a postdoc in that role. So the variety of perspectives today and I'm gonna ask them to start by answering it. Now a number of you have submitted questions and we're gonna get to some of them, but if we don't get to the question you submitted be brave and ask it okay. So we're going to ask a couple of questions to get them started but this is really for you so feel free to raise your hand at any point and ask a question that you have. So let's start with what do you think trainees should consider when they're looking for a postdoc? I think your first choice if you can make your first choice, you may have other considerations, but your first choice should be the very biggest thing you can attach your career to and I think a lot of people undervalue having received a PhD in the United States. The vast majority of applications that even the very biggest names get are from overseas. They really don't get that many American applicants, they're always excited to get American applicants, American trained applicant . You don't have to be a citizen but American trained applicants, and in my own experience, having the biggest name in your field the biggest one you can attach your career to opens a lot of doors. There are other considerations if you have a spouse and for some reason you can't leave Richmond or you're geographically restricted or like that, then you need to you need to think about that. That's my narrow niche would be start with who are the very biggest people in your field. Make a list of the 10 or 15 biggest names you see in nature, science so whatever the top journals are in your field and just write them. We can talk about that later. I would second that and even more specifically I think the postdoc should be a more practical decision in a lot of ways than in a graduate position wise. So from a practical standpoint, I think you should find someone that has money. So multiple grants is a great idea. Grad school you can often be supported through a TA ship or some other means of support. But you're going to be the postdoc is supposed to be shorter you know one, two, three years and so you don't have a lot of time to fool around with trying to get an F32, which is the grant application for postdoc fellowships, which I'm sure we can talk about that too, but you want to be pretty practical with funding so that you can kind of get in and hit the ground rolling, because you're gonna have finished your PhD so you already have a good background in research and so if you learn in a place that has money you can roll quickly in that direction and I have some tips on how to find people that have money as well. Alright so I'm also going to co-sign what they have said and also add that you know the postdoc positions that you prioritize, make sure you are also in universities that may potentially have a position for you when you finish because if you are geographically bound and you do a postdoc in university then having to face the situation of picking up and leaving may not be you know something we want to deal with necessarily, so like I am married and my husband has a great job in Raleigh so you know focus on post-ops on the southeast worked for me thankfully I ended up at VCU, but also consider that only the funding available at the institution, but on the industry side as well especially if you're in allied health. So if there's a way to partner both consider those as well. I think it's something that I can add to that also is certainly not the highest priority on the list, but once you've narrowed down all of your potential places that you want to go, start picking out those labs that you really show  interest in the field. So those things that you really can see yourself staying and doing work for a long period of time, because essentially the work that you do in post doc is the work that you're going to take with you for the rest of your life. So let's kind of zoom back for a minute, that's a great start and think about alright so these are great tips of what you should be thinking about but even before you get to that practical piece, how do you know if you even need a postdoc? And so, part of that question might be a little bit about what your career goals are and how you thought about your postdoc as being a tool toward those ends and maybe Dr. Ryan you can kind of start with the bird's-eye view of how do you know if I need a postdoc? I know you have some excellent statistics there. So how many of you are in the like the biomedical realm in your PhD studies? Okay, so most right. That's that's what I would expect here on the medical campus, but in other places in the biomedical areas probably consider life sciences and then we could roll engineering into that if you want. The vast majority, at least 70% of PhD graduates, will do a postdoc in that field. The length of time is typically three to five years right now which is longer than it was two decades ago. But I would say you need to plan to be there about three years and I think the obvious question would be if you haven't answered to the question do I need to do a postdoc is well what are your job opportunities, do you really feel qualified to do that, is that what you want, how's it going to affect your advancement? I don't want to monopolize conversation so very short version is in 92, so a long time ago, I was finishing my PhD. I had thought at the time I wanted to teach a primarily undergraduate research institution of P Y and I did have an offer from James Madison University that sounded great, and then I came to the realization after doing a couple of interviews and spending time thinking about that A, they could get me really cheap and that was one reason why they wanted me and that I think that that was pretty obvious after doing the interviews for a while and B, I realized I just did not know what I was doing to be honest with you. I mean, I knew how to do experiments and I sort of knew how to run a project, but setting up a lab from scratch and running it at 26. I was just not ready to do it, and that was really when like, "I got to do a post doc", because I'm not I was standing there in this empty lab and going, "yeah, don't know what I'm doing, sorry, I never might have, my bad". So that I don't know that that may not be your situation but I think I realized wow I really do need a few more years of polishing and working on my independence. How do I know how to run things on my own. I sort of had a similar thing. I actually applied for a range of jobs outside of my PhD. Many postdocs and faculty positions, and some non-academic positions, and part of it for me was geographical restrictions because I have a fiance and he was part of this mix but I had kind of a I've gone back and forth about where I wanted to be at what time and I don't know if you guys have noticed but grad school is really stressful so I was really stressed out during my PhD especially at the end I wanted to quit, wanted to leave but I was too far in. So I stuck it out but then I was kind of like well I don't know I still really love research and teaching but I'm not sure where I want to be or how much I want to do and what it's going to take and so the postdoc was a really good option for me to be in the research and academic environment without the stress of grad school. It's still stressful but it's stressful the postdoc is stressful and I think better ways. So it's more just like the stress of like "oh I'm working with students at home a research project" there's no stress of like "oh my god am I gonna pass my qualifying exams, oh my god am I going to pass my dissertation". So the stresses are very different and so it's kind of given me that breathing room after the PhD stress to kind of figure out where I am and what I really want for my career. As Katie Beth mentioned, I have the institutional research and career development which Johnathan has also. so we have this fellowship from NHN, as Katy Beth mentioned, a three year three years of funding that supports postdocs that are interested in an academic position and incorporates teaching which actually all of them do um but as you may know many different schools prioritize how much teaching the research and teaching ratio that you have. I know that I want to teach undergraduate students or graduate students I don't know med students again I'm going to do that this fall we'll see how it goes um so that fellowship that's giving me time to also experience research but the funding comes from NIH so I have the time to do the teaching so my P I is only funding part of my salary so that way I'm allowed to allocate my time a little more in these two realms which is actually a more accurate representation of what academia really is. That was a really long answer, sorry. So post doc was not something I was thinking about when I started my ph.d program. I worked as an occupational therapist for six years before going back to school, so in allied health postdocs are relatively new like something that's been happening in the last ten years. But what I quickly noticed when I was ready to apply for faculty positions there's that little like nine point font at the end that says post doc preferred. So I was like alright well I guess I better check this out um and not to my surprise, post docs are few and far between. Just last year in the American occupational therapy foundation I've got a call for post docs for the entire nation and there were only seven positions for about the 25 to 30 of us at the time that we're looking for postdocs so they're not they're not readily available. I'm sorry just lost my train of thought, so yeah allied health post docs are not that available but if you are going into an allied help position the Academy where there most of them are situated in schools of medicine where the tenure expectations are going to be high around research less on teaching they're probably even less on service and that's fair to say. You know it's gonna be critical to start looking for either something that I regularly related to your to go a light help though or something thats related relatively soon cuz it is not my goal to teach but the reality of it is most of our programs are teaching insensitive so my ph.d program did have teaching component but but yeah you know it's it's a little trickier hearing OTP team they're seeing rehab counseling for those jobs because although we're now switching to the doctoral level as a terminal degree buying a postbox want to be a lot harder so I think when you and you decide whether or not you need to have largely based on what you plan on doing after you get your PhD so are you planning and going that female there's not really a stepping stone that can put you in the right direction career-wise without kind of getting into that post office unless there are some positions I think an industry where you have normally think of postdoc is required but they do have industry folks as well so I think kind of if you if you're planning on taking your your PhD and going so you know let me kind of pick up on that I think it's a good point at Jonathan's brought up so there are jobs that do not require postdocs and so really I think the first question you need to ask yourself is what is your goal and part of it may be I'm not sure yet and that's okay and if you're not sure yet probably you need a postdoc because that's really the only thing you're qualified to do unless you prepared otherwise unless you're clinical right and you're gonna practice clinically but if you know you're interested in doing some of these jobs like in science writing or in policy or some positions in industry and you want to start making those plans I would suggest like your second year and we can talk more about what those are that's a different program you absolutely can get a real job when you finish your PhD without having a postdoc so that's you just kind of shove that but that's not what we're talking about today so now if you are looking at a postdoc usually it's because you're interested in an academic position you want to run some kind of a research facility whether it's an industry or elsewhere or you haven't figured it out yet or sometimes it's because you want to diversify your skillset like maybe you want a different model to practice on I know one thing with undergrads like you might not be able to have a mousseline so you need to learn to work with flies or whatever and so you can talk about the science behind that more specifically you might want to get your teaching skills up to snuff so really you need to do like a gap analysis right yeah if I want to be here and currently I'm here like what do I need to do to get from A to B and there's a huge number of different kinds of postdocs and that's important for you to know so I'd love for you each to talk a little bit about how you actually found your postdoc you know one of the questions that was submitted is is there some website we're all postdocs or both no olive oil the answer now but I think dr. Brian Edwards as an interesting perspective as a supervisor and he can talk a little bit about what he likes when people apply for postdocs with him and what strategies he seemed to be successful then I think each of you are fresh off of your searches and you can tell us what worked and what didn't work so okay so I'm in a position where I max a really good University I'm mostly trained graduate students so I'm looking for something specific with online or postdoc that's different than the advice that I gave you so so I'm good in my field I'm you know but there are mi the top ten names my field no I'm not I wish I could say I was I'd love to play that but I'm not I know who those names are we're friends for colleagues we send up public so when I'm hiring postdocs I am looking for people that have a reason to be here that I feel like we're going to be happy training at the ECU living in Richmond will fit in well with my team we do a lot of team-based projects so we'll have multiple people working on the project at once with an established project manager that's more like an industry setting and because of that I have to have people that are collaborative and so the things I'm looking for an interview are did you look like they work well as a team do they have pretty good writing skills what kind of skill set do they already have especially they have something we don't have that would be great but it's not necessary we can always learn new things but for coming you know we don't do mass spec they're coming to us already knowing how to do mass spec might be really cool I mean we could we could add that but typically looking for a specific thing and the one that has already been touted here that I'll mention again as a racked up I'll train to Iraq doe fellows and those people came to me said I know I want to go to an undergraduate institution but I need to really get great research skills so I can run my own mouth and be great in fact I left here you and I go so collaborate I'm probably in the environment where I don't have as much funding but I know how to write I can write the funding that you can't write for sort of Pui you could write for a say r15 grant I can't be for I can be a kowai on it though so I was like okay this this works and the cool thing about that is that hopefully whoever you're gonna work for will care tremendously about your professional success and there's a reason they should because we all keep a training table we have to email people all the time this is here's everybody I've ever trained and what they're doing now I don't want any holes on that list I want all my people to be very successful okay but more than that hopefully they just care right so I'm looking for people that I know I can launch to whatever they want they want to go to industry I know I can do that cuz I've done it if they want to go to academics I'm more comfortable with like an errata because the are active programs if you're looking to do a Pui type position hyper-competitive some of the ones I've trained they don't even finish training its but you're supposed to say three years they start getting snapped up in year two because they've already got to the background there's these P wises look so to me I'm like guys it's like I'll bring those people um I think I probably better stuff there was tons more stuff I can say so I just want to give out two websites for starting positions so the National postdoc Association National Post org they will have job listings also any professional societies that you are a member of society neuroscience is the big one for me but there's many others almost all of them will have postdoc listings on their job listings so check for those you can usually and then other like Chronicle Vinay is a just like an online thing that's pretty general many may infer that they have really good articles about academia if you haven't seen it it's not the Chronicle of Higher Education its Chronicle Fateh it's a little different um but they have a job posting listserv that you can get regular weekly emails to convert I read probably those too and you can get postdoc you can select postdoc the postdoc level on those searches and get those regularly and then back to my at the beginning when I mentioned finding people with money NIH reporter this is being a little biased towards the sciences of course because that's my field so this is my expertise but NIH reporter if you guys haven't experienced dinner check to that it's really cool because you can look up topics you can look up people and it will tell I mean it's federal information so it's available to the public you can see exactly how much money they have for how long who's listed on it another really cool feature if you're more ambiguous is there if you go to the it's like the second or third tab and it's like a text you can insert you can copy and paste an abstract from one of your presentations and publications into the full text box and it will link all work like math word matching to your topic so this is a good way to find people that well the big names are excellent and you should totally strive for if you want to diversify your applicant your applications just copying and pasting your abstract and will list every single grant that the NIH is funding that has words related to your field so I found a bunch of people that I applied to that way that I would not have otherwise found because well I was similar I you know my graduate advisor I was wanted to continue on that work I was interested in some other things that she necessarily I originally started my search by looking through NIH but honestly what worked best for me was for an amount yeah um you know graduating from UNC Chapel Hill you know premier research university has its benefits you know big names in my field are literally right down the hall for me and so being able to walk in their office and say okay this is what I would like to do who can you connect me with with really how the ball about growing for me most of those were related to occupational science and occupational therapy but also was able to many connections folks and like special education only issue is it's been maybe go outside of your field making the case for why you with your particular area of expertise and that's a little bit harder but yeah I mean it does work especially your strategic about who is petition thundercat so for something like a find some occupational therapy I knew to ask for dignity of the country for all of the eifs work and autism and intellectual disability I knew to make sure Brian Boyd make contacts remember of my recommendations but what does that work I think is maybe cold emailing but never following up it's great to reach out to your top spin your top 15 but harass them and I mean that ended early they get tons of emails and things from everybody all the time but you really want that position be persistent show up to their conferences go to their table call their office email them I'm not kidding multiple times you know even if you have to put second 3210 in the subject line do that cuz you know yeah so I had two approaches for me I would say adding on to pestering it's really important but a lot of times it's it's really hard to stay I guess positive if you're trying to keep emailing professors and not getting responses back from a lot of them what you should do is meet them in person go to conferences meet them at their posters tell them you are looking for a postdoc are you interested and just discussing within your project and grad school that you're currently working on how that aligns with their goals in the lab look on the websites of schools where the faculty are listed make sure you know exactly what they are doing before you talk to them if you are introduced I've been introduced to people where I I didn't even know who they were and tried to have a conversation with them and it was embarrassed I felt really bad afterwards but at the same time they were very nice about it it just is kind of an awkward conversation so make sure you know who these people are before you talk to them because you don't want to make that mistake in addition to that there are programs available I'm going to again top up the arachnid program so something that I decided that I wanted to do career-wise is work at a small University and apply teaching to my career and so the Iraq program was a really good choice for me and our website I believe is on the NIH website it lists every program that is involved in Iraq duh there's 20 to 25 programs around the United States if you want to use teaching I highly suggest you take a look at those programs they have typically the each of those websites that are associated with those schools that are Iraq - sponsored programs they will list very specific things that they want to see from you in terms of your application and I found that really helpful because I completed one application for one program a lot of those same things perhaps from other programs so it was a lot of work at first to be able to write down all of that application information but then as you go along for program the program you're kind of are just adjusting what you're putting in your application to fit that particular program on top of that make sure what you are looking for in your career aligns with the mission statement from those programs that is very important good afternoon everyone I am a VC students who pass VC students and when I saw my Barre immediately ran over there but I just wanted to piggyback off of like alia mentioned earlier it's really important that she leverage her pre-existing connections I got my postdoc position entirely my mentor and it happened in a really interesting way I worked with another colleague who was well in the search committee and when they were looking through applications she remembered working with me prior and then asked my mentor hey do you think Morgan would be interested in this position and she called me asked me if I was interested and that's how I got this position and so it's very different than a lot of the other pen ELISA pondered but it screams the importance of networking and really doing this job about connecting with your mentor going to lunches with talking to them just about their life in general makes them more connected and invested in and so you'd be surprised about the degrees of separation between your mentor and the mentor that she might want to work with they might not know them directly but they might know two or three other people that can make that connection so now you don't have to make that cold email and board like that cold phone calls you can ask hey do you know anybody that might have a connection to this person call them and then they might know somebody else so just don't write off your mentor as somebody who might not be able to connection you'd be very surprised to find that they might have the pathway so that's my story it's very unique really speaks to the importance of conferences connect you never know and always talking about your research what you're doing because they might remember a post-op position that was just posted I received mention that I magnin because the statistics not really exactly we actual statistics but our hazard a guess and say probably half or more of PhD students and their pies are not on the best terms I have that I guess just against meaning that that is future 50 percent meaning that a lot of PhD students will not be able to get that connection through this year and I have also heard that it is the best connection you can get could I know people who had pushed that through the api's and it is easy it is convenient it is fast and all of that but those who will not be able to access that code emails stuff like that will be important right but I am personally experienced in something which I guess a few other PhD students may also experience it if you're interested in emailing the top 10 15 people in your field because you don't have a connection through someone they if even if they are interested in your email I can imagine that they would probably go online to PubMed or whatever and search your name just to see who is this guy right if you're not a public because you're not published how'd you go from there so the I I will second what they said that the network is very important because while I did do a lot of my own searching found the Iraq to program on my own the actually ending up here at VCU in the Iraq to program that there was a pretty significant network connection to facilitates that so I did have that but I can speak a bit to what your concern is and that you can you you probably already have a bigger Network than you think you do so you probably also have other faculty that you can connect with and use them as a resource you have Katie Beth who is a resource here at VCU that aren't well not necessarily and the whole Curtis Career Center yeah and the whole Career Center well not necessarily your academic adviser it is still a significant resource for you you can also you will it will be harder I mean I'm not going to sugarcoat that but you can put yourself out there more directly so going back to what Jonathan the same about speaking to people in person and going to their conferences and calling them and you know sticking your hand out there and saying hi this is Who I am if you don't have publications that will be a challenge and actually one thing this is just general unsolicited advice but I am on an advice panel so try to finish all of your publications from your PhD before you start your postdoc because it really really sucks I am speaking from personal experience to try to finish your publications when you've already started your postdoc dividing your time is almost impossible so that's just so you should try to finish whatever publications you can before you go on to the postdoc market and depending on your field I don't know how important and how many publications you need that you can also gauge that compared to other applicants in your field in neuroscience if you don't have at least one first author publication applying for a postdoc you're gonna fall pretty far down the ladder unless you already have a networking or a specific skill set that matches you straight in so those are some pieces of advice I have if you're struggling with your relationship with your advisor and that network is not there you can also go towards your undergraduate advisors or faculty because they can also be selected two quick things one Jonathan's idea about conference networking is great yeah my suggestion because what I do I go to come I can't keep people's names of science straight I make a cheat sheet I always have a notebook I'm taking notes in a meeting it's in the back I'll see somebody go hey man I love that Connect for anything use did well cool stuff so make just a very short list of the things people you feel you're sure gonna get the conference and write a one-sentence description of their latest paper yeah and then you have a starting point for the conversation secondly it's not efficient but it will work email them before the conference and say hey you can be the I I would love to chat with you maybe we can meet up it's not the coffee they may not answer I can't go explain my day but I'm gonna come looking for your poster I'm someone so I'll I'll be sure to look you up so just try to make that connection that it works so much better in person second thing I wanna say okay here's a graph for you y-axis is emotional state x-axis is time okay if you're during your PhD or any other long term project it's the same shape okay it goes hope and confidence okay in the middle is misery or insights if you're positive now talk about your relationship with your mentor we know you're doing that because we did it and every other training you've had did the same roller coaster ride okay so when it sucks for you and you hate your mentor he or she does not eat you back we're cool we understand where you are we're trying our best to get you out of that Valley and back up stuff about the door we actually want that to happen it's a really big deal to us I've written this write 40 times in the last 20 years let's tell my wife this weekend would you like to wear all my students are now good I can crack okay so the reason I bring this up is your mentor doesn't age you today be your mentor is almost certainly going to do a phone interview a phone reference yeah don't give a written reference everybody knows we can't write bad things about people we're not ever gonna write anything bad about you that's why they call so they always call and they say okay now what's the deal if someone said like is she gonna kill it I guess you have fantastic hands is she nice you know does he does he mind working evening as if he has to is that a big deal so they're asking for these sort of intangibles some of the mechanicals but they know that you'll say things on the phone that you'll never write down in an email or a more letter because you can be helped responsible for those things love so we are we won't write this thing so they always call it as the person might come up in seriously am I gonna be glad I took this person and if we know them they can tell with the straight face I can tell what I'm lying or they can tell when I'm just not going to answer the question and they'll move on okay because I'm not I'm not gonna stick one of my colleagues I want to collaborate with with a bat trainee all right so it would be best you feel all what your mentor but you probably go on better you think okay get your somewhere in the miserable part of that curve it's okay you come out of the mentor knows you're coming out of it there they should have more patients than you think Jonathan you make it a nugget and it's so establishing networks outside of your mentor is something I had to do not because I had a bad relationship with my mentor but simply I wanted to go into a different field and circadian rhythms because that's where she was Network that you can form when you go to conferences it's just people that are graduate students into those dogs that you know people at their institutions they know the people that are looking for postdocs and they are extremely extremely helpful resources and they had tremendous network to form to because as you're going into that anyway you already got like four or five friends at least and oftentimes the postdocs and grad students are who make the initial decisions not like the hiring decision but oftentimes the PIO in medicine so you've probably been asked by your mentor hey what do you think of this potential student or what do you think of this potential postdoc and you contribute to the interview process so there's many times where if you know just another grad student or another postdoc you okay I really like your mentor or I really like this person at your institution can you network me network with me to get to them so that's why I said like your network is probably bigger already than you think maybe you might think of this don't have at least one publication or a long list of publication like if you knew at conferences you have abstracts for those posters you know if you have manuscripts in progress you know you had the abstract for that like make sure you're also putting that information on your leads in your Google whatever because that information is searchable as well so whereas we may not be able to find you come in of your potential mentor at least where you access that information so that they see you are working on something well let's take time for other questions and let me say that if you have a specific person to whom you'd like to address the question feel free to do that we'll probably let one or two people answer each question so we can get a bunch in what would you all like to know you gonna drop another bomb on anybody else don't let them go there there are not a lot of postdocs available in my field because most people in my field don't do postdocs so I'm interested in branching out and doing something that is not directly related to my PhD but similar so um and I am geographically bound or camera 20 what everyone says so I am what it was recommended to me to just reach out to some people who didn't have anything posted and say do you have money and or would you like to let me be your postdoc so um do a lot of people do that if I mean is that is that strange it's just send an email and just say do you have money and can I be your patient and so mortgage is asking for money I made sure I I stated exactly how my research and my research interests like be on my PhD aligned with what they were doing because just ask this like hey do you have money like you know it's gonna be an automatic so yeah I I do recommend reaching out to to other people but also making sure that you're very clear and it's listed on how your area of expertise you know whatever your other your skillset is that like for me with IQ like yeah it was great that you know doctor-patient scientists but another added value was that now I have to live in years clinical experience working with people with complex medical issues no community say you know this is the community engaged research group so making sure you highlight those things you're looking at special education you know how this my work and I special disabilities and autism related to you know the mission and goals of these grants a compromise yes so making sure you are very specific as well and your final statistics right so I think you could find a connection to a life and come up with a way where you can bridge your research with that mentor so if you have already identified like a small micro grade but hey maybe we could apply for this together I could support your statistics oh I saw you're developing an intervention maybe I can do the statistics with like really figure out where you can fit and not just say oh how our research is aligned but how you plan to work alongside that mentor because one that demonstrates your ability to think ahead about how you see your skills being utilized within their lab and additionally it shows that you can also develop some type of project or contribute to the team if you just say hey this is my research now I need you to figure out how I can work it's like okay I want you to go ahead and tell me what she brings to the table and not only what she brings but how you plan on the client that was in my lab and I think that's the difference between a normal cold email and an email that you're going to follow good Morgan I think you bring up a really important point and one of the questions that was submitted is how our projects identify for postdocs like do you come in with the project does give you the project and I think one thing to keep in mind is that the point of a postdoc well there's there's a couple right but mainly it's to help you become an independent researcher right and so you've got a million balls you're juggling as a PhD student and one of them is this research project but also there's your coursework and there's your comms and there's this that the other thing right and so your postdoc is really in a lot of ways dedicated to whatever you need to do to become an independent researcher but the person who's librarian wants some benefit from that so you have to think about the mutuality anyone else oh yeah I'm in on that on those notes make sure when you talk to your potential future advisor that there is a project for you to take with you in your own career because sometimes they your your advisor you may not make it clear that this is something that I want to take with me this project that I'm working on if you don't make that clear that could be something that they have states it they have a grande con you don't want to even want to compete with your with your mentor for any reason unless you are collaborators that's so make sure you make clear that I would like to work on this project and I would like to develop my career from this because otherwise I miss a question for Molly and Jonathan specifically about Iraq duh so what's the actual timeline for the application process like when did you apply and then did you identify your p.i before actually applying for the program what Digger activities yeah Lauren Lauren okay thank you so I so Institute Iraq as institutional research and career development award IR a CDA so I found a racked up first and then the PI second but I did identify my PI with Iraq so I fact so I said that I wanted Gretchen I as human and I wanted to work with her and that was because I had a network connection she and my PhD advisor went to grad school together so that was my network connection that I had there as far as my timeline went I actually applied so I started applying for a postdoc stuff in I think February maybe February March and applied to a couple applied to one Iraq to program at University Boston that I didn't get into it was mainly it was a funding issue so that's why I keep harping on the one that talks about money all the time because I got burned because a few times actually because of that and then the next erecta the release of you I applied to the interactive program I want to say in maybe gay chrome and then interviewed did a phone interview in probably May or June and then did an in-person interview in July and then was accepted like the next week right after the in-person interview um but then my PhD got delayed by three months surprised friends and so I was supposed to start at the end of August but didn't end up starting until November so that so that is a pretty long long situation but part of it was my own PhD being delayed so I would say for to order to five months would be in my personal experience I did not have my mentor selected so this is actually different across different institutions that some of the erecta participating institutions will require that you've already talked to your mentor and already have formed some sort of plan with them and some institutions will we get or ask you to use three potential mentors and then you will enter on your in terms of timeline I started I knew as soon as I knew that I had a graduation date I started applying even when I did its I would get yourself here before you know when you're graduating just start writing applications that way you give yourself a large enough window to be able to I think crunch time sources or write limits like anyone's mentioned it yet but something that someone brought in my attention was making sure you notice the fine credit some of these postdoc positions required that she had her PhD prior to interview yes so just making note those things because I was leaving a bunch of grit month delay of how keeping that in mind your graduation of course that's so much trying to apply and you I know a lot of people will end up post docking in the same lab where they get their PhD for a few months for this very reason and they kind of do that finish up papers and then do two applications was that true for any of you I personally didn't but I have many friends that did and it will not be I mean maybe it will not be detrimental to you so if that's something that you're considering or might be an option for you and you're kind of worried about it I would almost recommend doing it because it gives you time to finish up those papers and also this is just like a life balancing if you can take some time off after the PhD I took no time I literally defended submitted my dissertation a week later and on Friday and then started my postdoc on Monday and I really really regret it really really regretted so second for two weeks it was a weird thing in this was something I was going to suggest to you guys this is a totally alternative route but also along the lines of nepotism my best friend she was a year ahead of me she got an assistant professor position well we figured out a way where her startup funds she used them to hide of me as a makeshift post up so that's something people normally don't use their startup funds for that so a lot of her colleagues were looking at her like how are you a second year with a post that she's like well she hired me for some hours to work so it allowed me to have some space between actually having a post up and also graduating and it just worked out perfectly and so I don't know if that's something that you guys can potentially look at as well people tired that has some startup fun so it might not necessarily be a brand but hey you can put me or maybe 1520 hours a week doing some research allow you some time to also apply for I didn't even apply for postdocs while I was finishing up my PhD so it allowed me time to take a step back one but still continue to publish alongside of her as well I'm so that way when I finally did come on the market I had a pretty significant education list so it's just a alternative way so we have a few minutes left and what I'm gonna do is ask them each to give us the one thing they really wish they had known when they were looking for a postdoc or thinking about their postdoc and then I know I think someone has to leave immediately which is fine but I know a few people probably stick around for a few minutes if you had a question and you didn't get a chance to ask so you each have one minute Morgan you get to start we're less than 30 seconds just about the insurance and moving they don't really take those chances with them you're not faculty so you will not get a spare that package so you were thinking about applying and we're in California yeah I only moved seven hours something I wish I just just that the timeframe is it's it's not a huge factor like as long as you are able to make like if you have time off as long as you're kind of still hot have ties with your previous lab that time off I think so if you don't find something right away don't freak out so don't never really freak out I think I don't have any my keys do that so just really sort of I'm gonna be frank I mean you know just plan makes make a plan and postdocs the NIH guide line is $47,000 a year if you'd like to know what she's talking about which sounds like a lot compared to what my tip is - I mean I kind of already gave it and I really can't emphasize enough like finish as much of your PhD stuff as you can but before you start your postdoc like I can't I've had I mean I don't I don't have any time to think about my PhD stuff during the day none whatsoever and so it's it's I don't know how busy are in your daily labs but I have a pretty big lab I work with a ton of graduate students and undergraduate students as the postdoc Becky I travels a lot she has a lot of grant money and a lot of collaboration so she's gotten a lot so I'm running the lab a lot of the time which is amazing experience because that's what I'm here for and I'm really happy about that but my PhD advisor has been like hey let's work on this paper and I'm like and I'm also trying to have more of a life outside that because my PhD was there was no light there so um I'm trying to have I'm trying to be more conscious of that so I'm kind of limit time out of work hours and it's been it's been I'm able to do it but I it just means that my day is my day today is pretty long and pretty hectic but then later evenings and then you know the weekends are a little bit more manageable so I just finished finished the PhD stuff book research because I do it can be summarized um take a vacation but you're gonna be poor don't freak out there's a lot to do finish don't like your work before you go make good relationships I think the one thing that I would look back on the best doc I wish I knew back is just exhale it takes a couple of years because remember every project you've done at least then I think I feel it's like two years start to finish the time to get the first piece of data where you look like okay there's a project the time you send it to the publisher is about two years so your postdoc is gonna take a couple of years because it's supposed to just yeah exhale okay and I would plan to write your own grant even it's got a nice where you can compete forever tattoos there are so lots of foundations be ready to write your own grand illusion at the ground go to your mentored say I really want to write on Grant what can you help me with because if man doesn't look good on your resume and that's the other reason to work for a really big name because it turns out there on the bunny committees no I got my grandma nother story but that's how you get your money is because these people know people some people they know have money so it really does help you that's one of many ways that come to you but anyway it's really fun to be a postdoc to it really it's way more fun to grad school okay wait one it's like you actually get to go home at night or not so you just watch TV companies are president every day there are supports here for you okay so all these folks I'm sure happy to answer questions I take one-on-one appointments with you also with post Docs so if anyone here is already a postdoc you can still meet with me one-on-one if you need another kidney and outside of your lab thank you all so much for coming thank to the library for co-hosting thank you to our panel for their advice
