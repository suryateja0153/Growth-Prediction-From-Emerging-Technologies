 Florence Sylvester Center they have one room that's looped and that's the lip-reading class a lot of the audiologists and hearing aid dispensers have a loop in their office that you can try with your hearing aids that's a good thing you still need a microphone even though you have a hearing because I know I have a hard time understanding people because if they talk the hearing loop works hearing loop is connected to a PA system a sound system an audio system so it's hooked up like here anytime you come in this room there are other meetings that happen in this room if they're using this microphone the hearing loop is automatically on so okay so I want to introduce you to four Reba for Ibanez from Cusco in a reminded hearing aid dispenser and she brings the cookies every week and so let's go to yeah okay everybody's getting okay what's a good idea if you could turn your so an Mandel know well she is the audiology advisor for the hearing world club she's been with me almost from the very beginning and we work away from the meeting so we have meetings of our own to help set up these these meetings she will when she's here at the meeting she will talk to you you can she'll answer your questions so that's why we invite you to come a little early so that you can you can ask her questions okay let me we have some microphones I'm not sure for taking questions now are you

don't each one officer already have it because quite often microphone doesn't work thank you so much I really appreciate she's talking about the t-coil she's wearing the headset with the coil so if anybody is not hearing well in the meeting we have a couple more headsets so if you're not hearing Tony well we can get you one so Rick would you please so rip using loop installer installed the loop in this room he installed the art room he is still clubhouse 2 and the towers I forgot about the towers yes the towers in their activity room there and and we want to put more loops in the village sometimes 5 is a good place clubhouse 7 it's up to you you got to ask for it talk to the clubhouse supervisors and tell them that your just said that I'm I'm going to work with management and try to get some movement Rick though he also did Geneva Presbyterian Church Church of the Masters so he's doing all the looping in the area several members here also have their TV room looped when you experience how crystal clear this is would it be wonderful to listen to your TV at home crystal clear and not bothering your neighbors you don't have to turn that the TV up really loud and Rick does that so there are cards and he's here to talk to him he provided the loop listeners today and so he's just been a wonderful sponsor time okay thank you I also have to talk to you about caption called CAPTCHA code doesn't have a representative here but caption call regularly pays for her court reporter or uh who's sitting over here and so we appreciate caption call a lot of people in this room know me because I installed their caption called phone years ago I haven't worked for them for four years so I I'm not in play now caption call it actually captions everything the caller is saying requirements you want to have the internet you have to have a landline phone and your hearing loss has to be certified by a hearing healthcare provider or it could be a medical provider and I have those forms here if you're interested there is absolutely no charge for this phone and the service is paid for through a program with the federal government or the ABA so we have professionals in the room if you're interested in getting this phone the first step is to get this form signed on your behalf and also I have a little application form and if you do it on your own just tell them the hearing world club sent you so that they will keep paying the bills here nice okay do we have any other professional advisors I'd be a professional hearing aid dispensers no nobody else here okay we usually get one how many people are here for the very first time okay good good hearing loss is leading public issues by age 80 70 75 to 80 percent have some level of hearing loss the National Institutes for health actually says that aged 75 and older 50 percent have hearing loss so that means 50 percent Laguna Woods residence has some level of hearing loss yeah that's not surprising okay so hearing loss is the daily challenge but it can be overcome and that's what we try to do here so you don't have to face your hearing loss alone it's a lot of people say what's your hearing loss what

words speech pathologist audiologist and hearing aid dispensers board and I heard somebody called that the slap-happy board sometimes it's that way ok so that was the hearing aid dispensers that were was that their convention they were calling it the slap-happy board okay so Paul is here he's going to be talking to you I'm sure you read the advertisements that we put out about licensing of professional education continuing education he has some things to tell you that I'm not even aware of so I'm just gonna let him get started publish you come on up here and I go to the computer and get your thing going once I get it going okay the devices that you're using are only good in this room it's working because it works with the copper wire that's on the floor here thank you Tony hey good afternoon everyone my name is Paul Sanchez let me see if I as I get situated here I see that you're all getting Amber Alerts and one of the reasons that we're here we're here to see oh sorry one of the reasons we're here is to see all of you talk about what we do but we were also here to actually visit one of my sons who is playing soccer in Southern California when he got back to Santa Rosa went to bed thought it was going to be a normal evening and get ready for his every day weekend routine and calls us we're at the air hotel to tell us there's these horrible fires in Santa Rosa so you know Phil for all these people all over Northern California Southern California that have just lost so much so much devastation so our hearts go out to those people right now let me Tony is very technological probably but more so than I am because she figured this out right away so let me go ahead and get started to talk about why I'm why I'm here back in 1992 during the vice presidential debates Admiral Stockdale asked a question he said Who am I and why am I here and I always think about that whenever I get up in front of people who am I and why am I here the interesting thing is while they were asking him questions people thought he was aloof because he couldn't hear the questions and if you recall one of the reasons he couldn't hear the questions was because his hearing aid wasn't on and he said I'm sorry can you repeat my hearing aid isn't on so a couple of reasons that I'm here is to talk about hearing aids now I never thought growing up I thought I dreamed of being a lot of things I talked to you Daniel Boone earlier and I watched a lot of television so you said fantasize about being The Lone Ranger an astronaut a baseball player I never thought I would be running a licensing board and overseen the profession of speech-language pathology audiology and hearing aid dispensing but as I became more and more involved in consumer protection issues I began to realize how incredibly important it is what I do for a living I'm married to a this lovely woman here Lisa Sanchez my wife actually her job is really interesting as we're driving through here she sees a lot of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities Lisa's job was to inspect and enforce the those facilities were safe and up to code for their residents so somehow we both ended up in the consumer protection business and that's what I do so we're responsible for regulating hearing a dispensing audiology speech-language pathology I'm going to go through some statistics just to kind of give you a background but I don't want to bore you with a lot of information so be sure not to do that our board is made up of professional licensees and public members we meet four times a year and we exist for consumers that's why we exist we're not just a government agency taking people's tax dollars we actually get our money from licensee registrations the licensees that are here they send us a fee we put that money to work and we run a very tight ship we have 20 Berrien who I appreciate everything she does she's very involved in consumer protection issues from another side and we've seen this very kind woman come to our board meetings and remind us you are you are about hearing and you don't even have a hearing loop so that people that that have problems here can hear what you're talking about so we've got a ways to go but we're very grateful for the input that we've gotten from from Tony some of the issues that she's raised to the board and our board members are very interested in pursuing those issues our board oversees you'll see later about 27,000 licensees in California we license 27,000 people yet we only have ten employees that work in the board office so we have a big job ahead of us and and we were very busy we work with law enforcement agencies we have sworn peace officers we have the Attorney General's we have district attorneys in different counties that we also work with what does the licensing board do well obviously it licenses and you know I hear a lot of sometimes there's some negative sentiment about regulations and licenses we have too many regulations we have too many licenses well one of the things we do is we keep people safe we want to make sure that people are protected that people are able to live a life happy avoiding problems for for seniors two of the greatest expenses you're going to have is probably buying an automobile and purchasing a hearing aid so it's really important that we make sure that that's done properly so we promote standards through the legislative process the regulations we make sure that the laws are there to protect people and we also have enforcement someone when licensees or people that are not practicing by the law are abiding by the law we enforce the law and I'll give you an example of something that we have done recently there was a large hearing aid retailer in Northern California some use some bait and switch tactics advertising a $600 hearing aid come on aided by the $600 hearing aid when people would come in to buy a $600 hearing aid they wouldn't be told they were told that's not the right hearing aid from for you so a none we had a nun that was one of one of the victims of this case walked into one of these places you know she was not able to spend her own money she had to take an invoice back to the diocese and while she was there she was pressured into buying a more expensive hearing aid she said in her Irish accent no no I can't even do it like she did it but she said I I've only been authorized to spend $1,200 she was told she was gonna spend $1,200 to bring the invoice back to the diocese she was pressured into a credit transaction where she had to sign on for credit she ended up spending 10 times that amount of money for hearing aids that didn't work for her now that was a very unfortunate thing for us she was so distraught that she stayed at a motel right outside that she was afraid to go back to the diocese that those are the kinds of cases that we investigate I will say this out of the 27,000 people that we that we licensed most of our licensees are very good dedicated committed people but there are those few that we have to watch a little more closely and sometimes take action against in this particular case the the company had to give restitution to all of the people that made refund claims because there are some laws that protect you when you're buying the hearing aids some unique and special laws that were written and just for hearing aids and I'll I'll cover that a little more as we go along why do we need a licensing board we have licensing boards for for contractors we have licensing boards for free dentistry you probably all have heard of the Medical Board we have licensing boards for for many many things and the reason we need a licensing board is because the legislation state of California decided that certain professions affect the the overall public health and safety of California citizens and these professions need to be subject to regulation and control one of the big ones is a contractors state licensing board if those contractors are not regulated then then maybe the contractors aren't doing things to code and do anything safely so these things these same laws apply to hearing aid dispensers audiologists and speech-language pathologists so that's why we exist that's why we have to license people i I would never want to be in a country where there were no regulations or there were no licenses and people who are victims of unscrupulous actors in these cases so I'm very glad that we had these laws in California now when the board was established the board was established with a main priority and that priority wasn't to collect money from people the priority wasn't to to do anything above consumer protection so that's what that's what we stand for everything that we do we think about it from a consumer protection standpoint if we don't agree with something as a board as an organization we go back to that why are we here who are we why are we here we're here to protect consumers license your authorizes an individual to practice their profession it's governed by state laws and regulations licensees are required to maintain a minimum standard of practice and it's a privilege that must be earned or maintained I talked to licensees all the time and they don't understand why are you coming down so hard on this why are you why are you doing this to us you know I paid my dues maybe they they get arrested and they commit a crime and I tell them as a licensee you are held to a higher standard than average Joe or average Jane citizen you have to maintain a higher standard to keep your license so that's why we have these laws now it's really important whenever you go to a to buy hearing aids or or wherever you go that you know exactly who you're talking to when you walk into a hearing aid dispensing retail location know who it is sometimes the person helping you are they hearing are they a licensed hearing aid dispenser are they an audiologist are they a trainee because you have a right to know who's who's holding that transaction with you who's helping you and what their qualifications are one thing that we can do one of the one of the great things that the Department of Consumer Affairs has is something called license verification and many of you may have already used that you may know about this but any time you're dealing with a licensee you can look them up on our on our website and you can find out if they have actions disciplinary actions have been take it against them and that's something that Senator Hill brought up in in these and these reviews of boards when the legislature reviews the board every four years he wants to know do consumers know if they go see a doctor that this doctor has had disciplinary action against them do consumers know when they go to to purchase a hearing aid that perhaps this hearing aid dispensers had actually take against him so that's something that you can do and one of the booklets that we've left you here there is information on how to look for license verification this is just something you can look at our own this just shows you how many licensees are in state of California and just to confuse you more we threw out more numbers in a box and these are this is interesting data for you to know the number of licensees we have in California and the number of complaints that we get as you can see out of almost 28,000 people who get it we get about 200 complaints not all of those complaints are valid complaint sometimes they're just people that are angry about the way they were treated we're here only to actually actually enforce the laws that exist so it has to be a violation of the law we step in what the attorney asked me to talk about is the the education that the requirements for licensure so two types of people can dispense hearings in California now that may change somewhat but there are still laws that say that to fit to create an ear mold oppression and to to sell a hearing aid you must be licensed in the state of California we have some we have some of the most strict licensing laws in the country when it comes to that so two types of people an audiologist as license to dispense we call them dispensing audiologists or a hearing aid dispenser other there's other types of temporary licenses but they must work under the supervision of an audiologist or a hearing aid dispenser now in order to become in order to to become an audiologist you must have a doctor a doctorate degree so audiologists go through extensive training they earned their their doctorate of audiology degree they have in addition to that 12 months of supervised experience before they become licensed and a minimum of 375 hours of clinical experience now they actually get a lot more than that that's just a minimum that's required by law then they have to go and take a national examination they come to us and they said now I want to be now I want to be able to sell hearing aids what do I need to do well we make them take a written exam and after they pass the written exam then they all come to Sacramento and we given my hands-on practical examination that's what a dispensing Audiology has to do before a dispensary audiologist has to do before they sell hearing aids a hearing aid dispenser is a little bit different hearing aid dispensers are licensed to fit and sell hearing aids their educational requirement is they must have a high school diploma the lawdness have required them to have any particular type of experience but many of them do work as trainees as apprentices I know at Costco they have a program where they actually train them that's not necessarily the state's requirement that's just something I think that they do I know I'm talking to them but before they become licensed they have to take that same written examination and a practical examination so this is why I say it's important to see who you're talking to do your homework look at their reviews find out what kind of service they give to people and most importantly check their license on the Department of Consumer Affairs website find out for yourself has there been any action taken if you don't get your answers on there give us a call send us an email and we can help answer your questions in those areas are there any questions so far regarding the educational requirements or indeed you are license verification yes I think this is a very important part of what we do so I want to make sure everyone understands we're going to be able to buy hearing aids over the counter would that be people I'm sure like hearing aid dispensers or would it be an audiologist okay so that's a very good question I'm going to talk a little bit about the changing landscape of hearing aids and I'll talk a little bit about what I know towards the end of the the presentation was very good question and the other questions yes original form of Great Britain and by the lineage of the clashes maker agent off the wall um the same question about over-the-counter over-the-counter hearing aids tipped off the alcohol like 99 changed or glasses we just go to 99-cent store and get your amplification hearing eight or nine dollars I'll talk about the changing laws again the law that was passed by I think it was senators Warren and Grassley we'll get to that any other questions about license requirements or license verification okay go on to the so in addition to getting licensed a hearing aid dispenser or a dispensing audiologists must continue their education now this goes for all licensees my wife is a registered nurse so every two years she has to continue her education and if any of you hold a professional license you know this you have to go back and you have to continue education and make sure that you meet these requirements in dispensing audiologists yes but because there's more information that I want to include on I want to talk about the whole topic okay I will over the county hearing aids have have come they're happening but there's there's a lot more to talk about there so the dispensing audiologists must have twelve hours of continuing education every year that means that every year that to make sure before they renew their license I think they've had 12 hours of continuing education an audiologist has have that doesn't dispense has have twenty-four every two years and hearing aid dispenser is same thing twelve hours a year so in addition to getting their license every have to have a minimum of 12 hours a year I know many of them do more than that every year to maintain their license now let's talk a little bit about advertising because I want to just kind of stick with the topic of enforcement and consumer protection before we into the changing landscape of hearing aids advertising is I did answer the question that the line had changed I answered the question a lot of change I didn't answer the question I'm going to talk more about it that is a really interesting question and he is going to cover it he wants to get through this part of the presentation so I think right now it'd be a good idea and please hold all your questions until he's done okay thank you okay so we go to when we start talking about advertising this is a big this is a major issue with with a lot of areas of retail not just hearing aids but it is a major issue when it comes to hearing aids because there's a lot of misleading advertising some fraudulent advertising and that's something that is a real challenge for our board we again as I mentioned we have ten people and you have newspapers major newspapers all over California people still actually buy newspapers people go online to read these advertisements and these advertisements sometimes sell something or they purport to sell something that is different from what they're actually trying to sell you so you know today I say buyer beware the business and Professions Code 651 forbids the dissemination of public communication containing false fraudulent misleading deceptive claims now I just put this as a foundation so that you I know that all of you probably have a pretty good any of this we've all lived through the the going-out-of-business furniture sale advertisers who live through the the advertising used cars and then doing a bait-and-switch technique so these are some of the same kinds of activities that happen a false and misleading deceptive statement is a misrepresentation of fact that's likely to deceive so when we say we have a hearing aid that is going to it's a world smallest and most potent hearing aid unless you can somehow quantify that then that's a misleading advertisement so there are a lot of a lot of examples on how that happens it an advertisement that makes the claim of professional superiority without objective and scientific evidence that's what I was just talking about now I don't know if any of you ever saw this movie it's a movie about this elf that is walking through New York and he walks you there he sees he's from obviously the North Pole in this story he's never been through these the city streets and he sees this sign that says the world's best cup of coffee so he comes into this coffee place and he's just ecstatic he says you did it congratulations you created the world's best cup of coffee great job everybody it's great to be here and the people in the coffee shops are looking at you totally not understanding where he's coming from but these are the kinds of claims that are sometimes made there's misleading testimonials we actually had a case where sometimes you have a great personality a radio personality or news personality and they're advertising about how great a hearing aid has worked for them when maybe they don't use hearing aids or they're not telling you I'm actually getting paid to do this the law says that they have to actually tell you that they're a paid spokesperson they can't compensate them without telling you that so I included some bulleted information near materials so you can understand that so beware of these these advertisements that are out there in addition to the advertising laws that protect you we also have something called the song Beverly consumer warranty act how many of you ever ever heard of the California lemon law that's that's something that's somewhat unique to us now another booklet that we've included is a booklet called lemonade and it talks about the lemon law and how it applies to purchasing automobiles this is a special law that's in the California Civil Code that has to do with with appliances with it has to do with cars and what it is is it makes sure that there that there's an implied warranty in these laws well the legislature thought that hearing aids were so important that they actually included a law that just applies to hearing aids in this consumer warranty law and what it says is all new and use hearing aids sold in the state will be accompanied by a retailers sellers written warranty it even tells them the size font that that warranty needs meaning it needs to be in at least a size 10 font and the reason they did that was because I don't know if you remember the the Willy Wonka contract as he's reading the contract the letters getting smaller and smaller and he says I can't even read this it's too small and he says that's a point sign here sometimes those things happen to business so the legislature wanted to make sure that it's at least in a 10-point font so you can see that with your reading glasses and when it says is if this hearing device is not initially fit for the buyers particular needs it may be returned to the seller within 45 days of the initial date of the buyer if you returned the hearing aid the seller can adjust the hearing aid without a charge and in a reasonable amount of time they can replace a hearing aid or they could just promptly refund you the whole amount paid when a sale is rescinded under the sexual law no charge or penalty or other fee may be imposed in connection with a purchase fitting financing or return of the device this is another area that we've actually had to enforce we have cases where a hearing aid dispenser decides you know you need to if you're gonna buy this hearing aid we're gonna take you on a patient journey so you're gonna sign up for this great plan and it it lasts a certain amount of time for weeks 60 days whatever that is and it's beyond the warranty period so by the time you decide this doesn't work for me you're outside of that warranty period and they're no longer legally obligated to refund you your money so be aware that you you know there's specific laws that cover you when it comes to hearing aid warranty now if you oh yes yes so the state law is 45 days right that's correct but there are some places that say you have 60 days 90 days six month warranty if they put that in writing is that good yes they can they can they can extend the warranty as long as they want but they're just by law they're only legally required to refund your money within those 45 days thank you and and I'll tell you from talking to hearing aid dispensers most of them that the reputable ones that I know would say why wouldn't I want to work with my with my clients or my customers so most of them do that oh I'm sorry so so most of them are reputable and we'll then we'll provide good service any other questions on that before we go down so if you feel that there has been a violation of the law in any of these areas I want you to know there's a way filed a complaint and we have this is our website that's called speech and hearing see a govt and the first thing we have on our website right up at the top under quick hits is filing a complaint against the licensee it's not because we're against licensees and because we think they're all bad it's because that priority that we have that we've been mandated is consumer protection that's why we're here so we want to make sure that if someone has been wronged has been legally wrong that they have a way to come and file a complaint with the board this this kind of guides you and takes you through the pages of what to do when you do file a complaint there are several ways to to file a complaint form we have an English version a Spanish version a way to go online so you don't have to print a piece of paper and send it to us or we have a specific hearing aids complaint form and the reason we have a specific hearing aid complaint form is because there's specific information that we're trying to get when you file a a claim a complaint against a hearing aid dispenser now these are the kinds of violations that we will investigate sexual misconduct conviction of a criminal offense any practice outside of the scope of speech-language pathology audiology or hearing a dispensing anything below their standards deceptive or misleading advertising unlicensed practice the violations I mentioned include violations of the warranty act these are the things that we do not investigate we don't investigate fee or billing disputes now the only time we really get into the the billing is when someone violates the actual warranty Protection Act so if you say I request a refund they will not refund me money it's you know I'm I've tried to work with them then at that point we will step in we don't investigate personality conflicts you know the receptionist was really rude this this person just is not very nice anything outside of our legal jurisdiction we don't investigate just real quick if you have has anyone here ever filed a complaint with the board against the licensee if you do we open the complaint this is just kind of the process it's a lot of information but you can read this on your own basically we open the complaint we review it to see if it's within our jurisdiction if it is that complaint can go many directions sometimes it's a simple you know there's no violation here this is outside of our jurisdiction sometimes it's a it's a dispute that we can have helped facilitate we call the dispenser they give these people their money back what's going on here and sometimes I that has happened sometimes it's more complicating that and we need to actually involve an investigator or a subject matter expert we go to our licensees sometimes who act as subject matter experts and we'll look at the records and say is there a violation here I have a question that gets do you can a patient file a complaint against a hearing aid dispenser who has signed themselves up as an audiologist I'm yellow number one that they put down that they're an audiologist but they're only a hearing aid dispenser and then the second question the current advertising a luminol dispenser is saying that he is a hearing aid engineer changing the title is that no how do you work with that well the first one is is very simple and that is yes if they're if they're claiming to be an audiologist and they're not that's something that we would investigate this is the second area I think we'd have to look into that a little a little more but you can't mislead people into thinking you're something that you're not or if it's a protected class or licensed I can't say I'm a doctor if I'm not a doctor I can't make you think I'm a doctor if I'm not a doctor so the those are the different routes we've actually been very successful in prosecuting these cases one case in Northern California involved five counties we we were able to get restitution that's the most important thing people got their money back going all the way back to 2011 there's going to be a press release out of that that's going to be coming out shortly it is public information but people going all the way back to 2011 are gonna be able to go back and get their money back from these people that basically rip them off now there are some changes that are happening in hearing aids and the reason for this is because there's a problem as as Tony mentioned here alone we can assume that 50% of the people in this community have our hard-of-hearing so what you said so so this is a great need in our country and hearing aids have not always been affordable it's it's a tremendous expense and some people are covered some people are not covered my wife will work for medi-cal she always kind of tells me explains the loss to me I don't always quite understand it completely but but it's a big problem and I think this was a bipartisan bill by Senator Warren and Senator Grassley that was signed by the president in August as part of the FDA reauthorization Act and what this does is this this directs the FDA to create regulations to create a new category of hearing aids that would be over-the-counter now the law is directing the FDA to create regulations so that has not happened yet but there will be over-the-counter hearing aids and those over-the-counter hearing aids are going to be for people that have self-perceived mild to moderate hearing loss there is still going to be a need for for health professionals for people to go to a a licensed hearing aid dispenser or an audiologist that can do a test and a professional feeding but this the feeling is that this would still help a lot of people get some really get some improvement in their hearing now we don't know how this is going to affect California we don't know how they can affect a lot of states because the regulations themselves have not been written I've been in communication with different agencies and Washington DC trying to find out how is this going to affect us what we're going to do one thing I do know is that we we have laws in place right now that say you have to regulate this this profession and we're going to continue doing that until we know otherwise we know that there are going to always be license hearing aid dispensers and licenses on colleges that dispense hearing aids the other thing that's in the law that's important is that it's called the effective state law that no state or local government can restrict or interfere with the over-the-counter I act the part of that law so we can't write a new law that says you can't sell over-the-counter hearing aids in California because this federal law supersedes the federal law trumps state law no pun intended there the effect on private remedies is that nothing in law shall affect the individual's right to legal action under any state or federal product liability tort warranty contract or consumer protection law what does that mean that means that a private citizen has a right to take legal action even after this odd legal action enforcing their warranty contract or consumer protection rights so the question we have is will this affect our California consumer warranty Protection Act and that's something that we don't know yet I think that you'll probably find out because Tony is involved in some of the things that we need so she'll probably know and she'll probably pass that on to you we invite you to connect with our board we we webcast our meetings we're gonna do a better job of getting making sure that those meetings are available to people that need closed caption or other other requirements and we meet in October at Dominguez Hills we usually have a couple of meetings in Northern California and at least one or two weeks in Southern California every year we have a web address that's included in your materials we have an email address feel free to send us an email and you can call us we're working on getting more staff to answer those phones a little bit faster so please be patient with us and bear with us Sarah now are there any questions thank you any questions one thing I can say is that it's kind of difficult to wade through all other rules and regulations but if you find advertising that you think is a little suspicious I'll bring it here to the beatings let's take a look at it and I can always run it by Paul by the way I think I don't why did mention it I first caught a glimpse of Paul when I was on Capitol Hill when I was speaking before the assembly Committee in favor of a new regulation to regulate to require t-coil instruction so that when you buy a hearing aid the plan was we buy a hearing aid the audiologist and her name dispenser would have to tell you about it that's all not that you have to have one but that you would be informed about it and it to use well that's when I first saw Paul I didn't actually talk to you that day I was scared to death and one of the board members scared me to death and that's okay I'm not afraid anymore and I have seen him subsequently because I do try to go to the board meetings and I will be at the board meeting in Carson on the 26th and 27th and I requested accommodations so there will be captioned for me at that meeting and so I'm really looking forward to that I will bring back new information whatever that is you know that board meeting so I thank you and a couple of board meetings and that you have a audiology meeting I think I may have met you and a hearing aid dispensers meeting so anyway so our paths have crossed a few times which made it possible for me to invite you come and talk to you so so anyway so anything that is questionable in your mind and if you don't want to go right to them and talk to them and you can certainly talk to me and we can write it out and get a message to Paul Sanchez so your questions about over-the-counter hearing aids how's that been satisfied for right now everything that was saying answer the question answer the question because really there's it's up to the federal government to write the regulations before we really know what else is going to happen I get him on eBay particular the piece I guess six of them they come and they're good for tonight they're good for independent they're good for no more than an increase on helping you ten decibels and they're called hearing amplification they're not hearing me that they they sing this go to your doctor for Hindi but this is this will help you ten percent or ten decibel at least about peace ups personal sound amplification products that's what's called a peace out they're not allowed to call the hearing aid but eventually hearing aids that are manufactured that comply with the federal the new federal law will be able to be called hearing aids Tony can I say something about going over the counter here against my hearing loss can I add something that Tony okay sure you know you're really fortunate to have an audiology advisor here too and I think one thing to really find out is what best meets your needs because obviously getting something out of a catalog or online may not be for everyone so I think it's really important to consult with the even its economical if it isn't sometimes it's just like flushing it down the toilet it doesn't work sometimes you think you know what you pay for yeah well I've been following the nab that comes in the paper every week it's called an empty hearing aid and it has a picture of it quote doctor whether he is or isn't he doesn't mention the price he doesn't mention whatever has any bottom or any other controls and I'm wondering if that you guys are so smart that too if you might know is that worth trying because there's money-back guarantee or not I've just been every week I see this in our paper that comes in a full-page ad I will tell you my experience from looking at numerous ads is if it's too good to be true it's probably too good to be true I mean I hate to sound so skeptical but there are a lot of good reasonable options out there for hearing aids and I would just be aware of those those no risk money-back guarantee type deals just be careful and the hearing aid sounds like a mail-order place he calls himself a doctor and there's a website you have to order the website or do you make an appointment to see him go to the website maybe find out more or call on the phone my hearing losses is really the severe and the profound so that definitely wouldn't work for me yes is there any time I've been told different things I've been told that the FDA is that it's going to take up to three years to get the regulations in place but I've also been told twelve months so I would probably guesstimate it somewhere in between there by the way that's starting with the previous administration so I don't know what there's a lot of administrative changes that are happening so I don't know how that affects these regulations okay here it is for me have been very expensive said though either missing or losing and I just wondered you think you know the prices will ever come down but because I know these new ones these over-the-counter that's something to work for me because I have severe hearing loss so I'm wondering is there something in between I mean we're seniors I'll let me I know the expert has them to say but can I just I know one thing though that I've heard it's likely to happen is you have a handful of companies manufacturers have dominated the market and there's a sense that with the over-the-counter hearing aids with more companies getting involved that that may affect the price and eventually long term bring the prices down in three years a lot of the points have been made number one with the over-the-counter they are working with the regulation but it is made for mile / moderate hearing loss most of you in this room would not qualify for that over-the-counter hearing aid because it wouldn't meet your needs and over-the-counter hearing aid means just that over-the-counter you go into Walgreens or wherever and you buy it and you put it in your ear and that's it nobody's gonna adjust it for you nobody's going to take your audiogram it is a beginner type of hearing aid so some of that amplification systems that you're talking about they have not legally been able to call it a hearing aid even though it does amplify the sound it's now allowing them to call it a hearing aid the other thing is the reason hearing aids are so expensive we know is research and development but it's because our insurance companies don't pay for eyes ears and teeth Medicare was set up to be a major medical insurance it was not originally set up to be everyone's everyday health insurance it has transpired into that but that was not the original cause or reason for Medicare so that's why it's so expensive because it is an out-of-pocket expense what we need to do is we need to write our senators and congressmen and tell them that if they would be proactive in helping with hearing loss we could have I think paula was said at the CI a meeting 13 point 1 billion dollar savings in senior health care because there would be less Falls less attention better cognitive skills hearing loss affects all of those things and with seniors being so affected we need to be proactive in trying to get that covered no one says oh my hip replacement was way too expensive my shoulder oh my goodness no because your insurance pays for it it's because you're feeling the pain of an out-of-pocket expense I can appreciate where you're coming from but it is not that the hearing aids when you when you entail the training and the therapy and everything else that you've given a hearing aid how they're properly fit that's not this year the issue is that we need to go back and try to get hearing aids covered we have had hearing aids now cochlear implants are covered five years ago cochlear implants were not covered by Medicare now that medicare covers them other insurance companies are covering them and because of that now it's just a degree of hearing loss right now it's severe so now they need to start bringing the standard down to cover moderate and severe and they would save a lot in other health care areas sorry we've got get off my soapbox she wanted to know how much a hearing aid cost well you can go anywhere from 39.95 on the internet all the way up to three thousand four thousand dollars a piece right they'll vary and that's where education comes into play and as Paul was saying you have to know what you're getting for your dollar right what is that technology doing how does that person fit what kind of therapy are you getting there's a whole way that a hearing aid needs to be fixed and I like to equate it as being a physical therapist if you got a knee replacement would you think that you could just walk out the door on your own with no a judge no therapy no physical therapy afterwards your body knows how to walk why do you need a physical therapist if you just had a knee or a hip replacement the reason you do is because the therapist knows your body and they know how to push you to the point of accepting the new device and then getting used to it and teaching your body how to use that device properly that is the purpose of an audiologist or a hearing aid dispenser after you have gotten fit is to retrain your brain on how to hear how to accept sound how to apply it and how to use it to the best of your advantage for what you have left a hearing aid does not give you normal hearing a hearing aid is an a it's not a cure-all but it is a fantastic device when it's placed in your ear properly and fit properly and that's where it is hearing these are getting smarter because they can detect the difference between background noise and speech but it's still up to the brain to do the work your brains are doing all the work the hearing aid is only giving your brain the cleanest clearest signal to process so when you talk about the cost of a hearing aid you're talking about how is that device separating the words from your background noise to give me a clean signal you could buy a radio at Radio Shack now all denied own business anymore are they you could buy a radio online for $4.95 or you can pay $15,000 for a beautiful stereo system they both are giving sound but the sound fidelity and clarity has to be appreciated and that's basically what you're paying for in the variety of hearings so does the Medicare help no not yet okay so what can we do right to our senators because I think Medicare's s event writers v the Medicare is our federal government right now Medicare in theory excuse me right now Medicare will not pay for a hearing test that will done right now Medicare will not pay for a hearing test if it's for the purpose of fitting a hearing aid or if there's not a medical issue behind it meaning an ear infection well how do you know if you don't get tested right we don't so we need to push that guideline and we need to contact our congressman and our senators and tell them we need help with this and we can change but we need to hear the voices as pulses from you know when you make a complaint then things get changed cochlear implants worked on the the scope five years ago and now they're paid so we can do it okay thank you thank you you go girl and Paul you want to tell people about what you brought them yes please there are some there there are some booklets in the back that we were able to bring from the Department of Consumer Affairs from some of the other agencies with the board there are a lot of consumer protection boards out there that are there to help you so want to be a service to you please take a look at these thank you nice to give you a little gift and we want to take a picture it's a little gift somebody must have told you it's a gift card from Starbucks Starbucks you borrowed this big device please turn it into the door monitor we also have if you've learned anything today we have a donation jar please please give to the best of your ability any amount counts our next meeting is in November and I will send you an email if you've given me your email address if you live through the woods and don't have an email address I'll send you a postcard but I I need to have that information thank you very much while I learned a lot
