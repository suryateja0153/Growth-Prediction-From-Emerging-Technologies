 we launched who pioneered our donor-advised vehicle Akash Charitable Trusts back in the 1970s and in recent time about the last 12 months media interest in donor-advised giving vehicles be they don't advise funds or other alternatives has really grown so we thought it was time that we took a look at the market and decided what it is that would be driving this and how we think it should impact giving going forward we're also particularly excited to be partnering with the UK Community Foundation's who have such a fantastic footprint locally in their play space giving in their dark vehicles the trend for donor-advised vehicles donor advised funds is really growing so 10 billion pounds is gifted by UK people every year to charity 370 million pounds of that came through donor advised vehicles we've got three hundred and seventy million two hundred and eighty million went out to charities and social enterprises to really make a difference in the next 10 years 1 billion pounds in a year will be going through donor-advised vehicles - to charitable causes which would account for about 10% of charitable giving in the UK which is an extraordinary number I always think that the best philanthropy happens in partnership and for us the best partners we have in helping clients with their philanthropy is the trusted advisors lawyers accountants wealth managers and planners who are talking to their clients every day about their wealth so what we think this means for advisors is don't be afraid of having that conversation don't be afraid of talking to them about charity and philanthropy it will only help to deepen the relationships that you have with your clients we see the growth of this of marketing as being something that's going to continue and what we'd like to see is that professional advisors working with private clients begin to see or continue to see donor-advised giving vehicles as a key part of their philanthropy toolkit and we'd be happy to work in partnership with them as a philanthropy specialists the more we can work with them to be the experts but enable them to know more to open up those conversations the better it will be to drive much greater impact going forward you
