 welcome everybody thanks for joining us for today's webinar our topic is low code revolution drive faster Enterprise transformation I think it's going to be a great webinar i Before we jump into it I want to let everybody know we'll be chatting on twitter at hashtag a paean chat and we've got some great speakers here today first and foremost we've got Neil word Dutton he's an industry analyst in principle and mwd advisors he's a co-founder of mwd with over 20 years of experience as an IP industry analyst he advises IT organizations and vendors worldwide on topics like digital transformation IT strategy and architecture and BPM business process management we also have bill Reis ik bill is the director of business process improvement at the OCC which is the options Clearing Corporation the world's largest equity derivatives clearing organization and over there Bill's responsible for the strategic direction of OCC's at the in Platte forum and he helps drive organizational improvement across the organization through analysis process innovation and technology deployment support I myself am Kevin's burway I'm SVP of marketing here at Appian I want to thank both Neal and Bill for joining us here today and thank all of you in the audience as well so with that let's let's just jump right in a recent survey of global 2000 executives showed 87% reporting that they had a digital transformation project in the works for 2017 and 47% of those surveyed reported that digital transformation was in fact their number one corporate priority so there is a really significant energy and major investment happening probably as we all know behind digital transformation right now effectively companies really have to transform in order to be competitive in today's market at a basic level digital transformation is powered by software of course companies have always used software but what's really changed is that software has evolved into a weapon for companies to differentiate themselves to adapt faster than their competition and to build engaging customer experiences so to excel in this new world every company really needs to become a software company but becoming a software company is is not always the easiest thing to do and it has its challenges and first and foremost of those challenges you've got agility is your organization really agile enough to move quickly to attack new software projects how well our business and IT working together does IT have the tools the methodology and the experience for agile development and is business tied into that new paradigm of fast rapid iterative iterative software development second of all silos same old story around silos you're effectively at the mercy of existing enterprise applications you can't get data out of them very easily they aren't talking to each other they're very very difficult and expensive to change so that makes evolving business processes and building new business processes very very difficult scares developer resources talented developer talented developers are increasingly hard to hire and extremely hard to retain a recent analyst survey found 83 percent of respondents CIO respondents agree that there's a shortage of software development professionals out there so you know it kind of makes sense when every big company like GM which you see here in the article is hiring hundreds of thousands of developers you get an imbalance between supply and demand and that that drives up the price of development talent and then finally you have the old 80/20 rule so this has been kind of a truth of enterprise IP for a long time on average organizations spend about 80% of their budget maintaining existing systems which leaves effectively about 20% for new projects and innovation just about every organization has these challenges and that's really where a low code platform can come in and be a game changer but not every low code platform is created equally when it comes to building enterprise grade software so to expand on this I'm going to turn it over to Neil work dutton and I think Neil's going to kick things off with a little bit of a survey question Neil thanks so much Kevin I really appreciate the opportunity to be with you here today and yeah I'm going to start things off with a cheeky poll because we've got a really good audience here and I want to figure out what you are actually doing right now though the poll question I put in here is what is the primary area of focus for your organization in its digital transformation efforts though you know often organizations are doing many things but what's the primary area of focus as you can see here you know is it really primarily about improving the efficiency of your operations are you mainly in your org trying to create new products and services that are digitally powered is it all about CX customer experience or is it all about the workplace and employee engagement maybe particularly for mobile or field workers what do you what is it that's really driving what is it is really driving what you're doing so I'll leave that up for a few moments and get your takes on that the reason that while we're just waiting for results to come in the reason why I asked this question is over the last two years me and my team have been doing a lot of research with organizations trying to figure out exactly what's going on and we do see an awful lot of variety in what's really driving digital transformation and certainly when you ask you know 10 companies you probably get 10 different answers about what the focus really is that makes it complicated but as I'm about to explain there are some really important kind of invariants that sit beneath these priorities though so you know regardless of the priority there are some really important kind of underlying things that we'll we'll dig into ok let's see what we got from the poll here all right so this is pretty interesting around half of you guys who responded I said you're really primarily focusing on the operational efficiency in your org and then second up just under a quarter is all about CX and then actually around 1/5 creating your products and services and the remainder really focusing on improving the workplace now that is interesting because more more widely we that organizations are primarily focused on driving customer experience but operational efficiency comes up as in second place in in a kind of wider census of organisations so that's that's very very interesting but you know as I said regardless of where you're starting or where your primary focus is there are some really important things to realize about this and in fact Kevin already touched on a couple of points very well so let me skip over my my little opening chart here and get to the get to the meat which is really as I said it's it's like the kind of invariant piece underneath all those priorities so yes we see many many organizations pursuing digital transformation to drive better customer experience but we also see many focusing on operational efficiency and we see many focusing on products and services and so on those are all different perspectives and but no it's not the question that one person's right and another person is wrong in all those cases the underlying truth is that digital technologies enable you to coordinate resources more effectively now depending on your focus and your interest those resources might be more around people and what's in their heads and what they want to do all those those those assets and resources might be more around kind of tangible things like materials like like assets like vehicles like infrastructure so you know there are different ways of looking at this but the fundamental piece is how digital technologies enable you to coordinate resources and assets more effectively and the other piece that's really important is that fundamentally this is not about a destination you don't transform to digital and digital being about okay yeah we're using the cloud or we're using mobile or we're using big data analytics it's not a one-and-done thing fundamentally what we're seeing from the most mature organizations and those organizations that are kind of digital native is that fundamentally they see that this transformation is about enabling a new way to change okay so it's really about it's not about going to somewhere it's about changing the way that you change in your organization and Kevin talks about becoming a software company and I think that's a really nice way to look at it fundamentally what we see in the most mature olds is that they realize that the power of this transformation is about creating platforms and practices that enable much more agile working much more use of data and a virtuous cycle so on the right hand side here which is really a little cartoon about what this journey looks like it's about realization that digital platforms give you an instrumented view an instrumented kind of underpinning of how your products are performing how your services are performing how your processes are performing and they also allow you to drive agility based on that data so it's not all about the highest-paid person in the room the hippo and their their idea about what's going to drive your business forward it's about real understanding of what works what doesn't work what customers like what they like you don't like what they want what they don't want and it's about that kind of virtuous cycle of platform and insight now that's all very well right but and in fact as Kevin also just alluded to it's not always that simple it is certainly the case and we've seen this over the last 18 months that there's a big shift in mindset in the CTO community in the CIO community across how those people are trying to drive the agenda forward you know when we did some of this research around eight years ago we asked people to kind of share with us their stories of how they're driving they're trying to drive innovation how they're trying to drive improvement they would really be modeling themselves on the big kind of enterprise tech giants you know they would be talking about sa P they'll be talking about Microsoft IBM Oracle those guys and when we looked at who it was who was really driving the agenda fastest it was typically financial services and it was and now when we've been doing this research over the last 18 months it's a very different picture actually we find that people really pushing their gender hard and modeling themselves and organizations like Netflix like Amazon like Google organizations that are really kind of nailing this idea of change being part of business as usual we don't have business as usual and then change being something separate those two things are completely integrated and this idea that change is just part of the way we run our business and really embracing that and we also see that the organization's pushing the agenda further furthest fastest aren't necessarily financial services and telcos yes those guys are in the mix but it's also retail its utilities its government and public sector its travel and transport its consumer packaged goods and pharmaceuticals and utilities and all kinds of places we didn't see things happening before as we already know and I'm sure you guys feel this every day and Kevin also alluded to this a moment ago it's it's not an easy situation that most people find themselves in so we recently carried out survey it was May time and we asked a whole bunch of CEOs to give us the kind of tape we were taking their pulse understanding what it was they were trying to do the relationships they had with different parts of the business where the key items on their agenda were and one thing we found that came out very strongly was that there's you know around four-fifths of them expect to be taking more active roles in digital transformation and innovation initiatives over the coming 24 months and that's fantastic right because for sure it's not sustainable position for digital to be driven just by the marketing team that's that's a fair place to start sometimes but it can't only be about that so that's that's a really positive finding but at the same time though we found out that 69% also said that they are struggling to keep up with demand for new technology capabilities and if you want to find out more about that survey there's a link at the bottom except that this free download you can get access to if you want to so what we're really seeing through the research we're doing is that IT teams are you know that they have this task this item on their agenda which is to try and get more involved in driving digital innovation they're also trying to meet existing demands today which have been driven by increasing adoption of SAS offerings by increasing demand for mobile front-ends and for you know indeed supporting new mobile channels and enabling field service workers in more effectively and of course there's this 80/20 thing it's not always exactly 8020 of course but huge gobs of money being swallowed up by just business as usual keeping the lights on so you know this is not a happy situation but it's also where this idea of low code application platforms fit in let's talk a little bit about at a high level what those things really are and what they do with apologies to people who are like really technical I've tried to keep this pretty high level and really focus more on the business value piece fundamentally low code platforms employ three different strategies to enable you to move fast they employ visual design tools so when you build an app you are dragging things typically around on a canvas you are you're specifying behavior by visually linking things together by working at a conceptual level so that's number one also backed by this idea of model driven development and that really that's all about enabling people to specify application behavior through configuration rather than by detailed coding and then that is backed off by code generation or interpretation so we're using visual design tools to create these abstract models and then the models are interpreted or compiled but to actually drive a running application so you know actually for any one of you who's been around in the industry for you know certainly you know like 15 20 years at a high level this concept is not new you know back in the 1990's we talked about for GL's 4th generation like late fourth generation languages and we talked about rad tools and we talked about you know model driven rad tools and at a very very high level we're really talking about the same ideas but really recast for the digital era let's have another look at one level deeper at what you really get with a modern loco tool well you know what we talked about model driven development and design so what does that model look like well in many tools there are fundamentally three layers and again any one of you with the kind of architecture background will will be very familiar with those three core layers right there's UX at the top there's the user interface piece in the middle there's a business logic layer where we're defining the the kind of functional behaviors that are core to how the application operates and then underneath we're defining a data management layer so how the application essentially persists data how it how is it protects data and how it ensures that referential integrity happens and all that good stuff stun platforms go further and they are create they do provide an extra layer which is around workflow so fundamentally layers of specification that are about how do we coordinate the work that gets done by people and my systems and we enable that coordination to happen in an instrumented way so that we can understand what's working and what's not working and then also right at the back they provide integration technologies integration layers that again a model driven so we're not having to code integration by hand but we're able to assemble and configure integration services so the more sophisticated tools out there and an app ian is definitely part of this category they don't just focus on UX and business logic and data management there's a work obviously given up in heritage a very strong work flow story and an integration story as well it's not just about those three basic layers all right so with that in mind you know let me just recap quickly so local platforms they drive speed because you're not having to code in detail they allow collaboration because you're actually using visualizations of what you want to happen so you don't have to have technical people just working in isolation to fulfill so I'm going to spec you can actually work in front of and with your in quotes customer whether that is a real end customer or whether it's someone internal you can have blended teams co-located working together regardless almost of how detailed those people's skills are in terms of technology so you can have business analysts you can have subject matter experts you can have technical people all collaborating around the result and that's a huge win right if you want to move fast you need that collaboration and lastly you get that agility because because you're developing models if you need to change you can understand where you need to change and you can change with confidence okay so fundamentally speed collaboration agility and they're all goes without saying really super super important if you if you want to drive a new kind of relationship between business and technology and get further towards having kind of software as part of a DNA of how your company works so with all that in mind how do you choose now if any of you guys have looked out and done a bit of a market survey and looked at what's on offer you depending on how how long you took to do that little survey you might have found kind of five to ten tools but you know actually if you dig a little you'll find 20 30 40 50 there's so many tools out there how do you choose well you know we really advocate choosing by breaking the problem down and it's very easy to kind of think of digital transformation as being one thing but actually what with what we're finding is that there's three core use cases where it's profitable and useful to use these kinds of tools and so for me the really key part of your your process has to be about okay which of these use cases are important to us and how are we going to fulfill those use cases and tools so let me lay this out for you as I said three distinct but related actually types of use cases for these modern low code platforms in relation to transformation initiatives right so let's look at these three use cases and we'll go through them one by one the first one is application prototyping now if any of you are familiar with lean startup ideas you're familiar with the kinds of techniques that are used by many kind of web agencies digital agencies specialists in this area they really make prototyping a central capability of what they do it's all about working right in front of the customer or the user so so prototyping is really about creating something that may end up being thrown away actually but what you're doing is you're kind of working out loud you're working transparently in front of the user so low code application platforms can can really help developers here working it out loud in front of stakeholders building and demonstrating features visually and quickly right so key here is that to serve this use case platforms don't have to be super sophisticated actually but they do have to be quick you have to be able to move really really fast that's the application prototyping piece the second use is slightly different and although it may seem sometimes like you're doing the same thing it's really important to realize that this is a different kind of use case with different need so this is really about the creation of standalone departmental applications so where we are finding that to drive further improvement to really support maybe a new promise to the customer we need to enable teams within our organization to work together much more effectively much more quickly and not drop the ball and have a consistent view of information and you know have a mobile app that allows them to be in front of the customer all that good stuff at the scale of a standalone department so that might be for example a use case that is around complaints management or it might be around it might be specifically around onboarding for new clients or it might be around problem resolution so you know really something that has applicat departmental scope and and the second that's the second use case and local platforms here can help relatively non-technical people build relatively straightforward apps quickly so they have a slightly different kind of value here they don't have to often offer integration capabilities here you think back to the model I just showed you that that five layer application model the most important characteristic is ease-of-use though how quickly can we enable a spectrum of people a spectrum of of citizen developers to start to build solutions that can be used in anger at a departmental level and the third use case is slightly different again this is really about creating applications that extend existing processes though what we find it in in reality is that many of these are about creating new mobile apps that that handoff to existing automated processes in some way so they're either about enabling new groups of staff to participate in automated workflows in new ways or thereabout just creating an alternative channel for interaction so key here is that you tend to have blended teams right because you have a team that's responsible for the core process that is probably at least in part automated already and you have a team that's responsible for the new extension or extensions and you need these people to be able to work together effectively and again you need to be able to work well in front of user teams and stakeholders so to support this use case effectively we need to really add in integration capabilities those things are likely getting on for as important as as capabilities that help you to develop fast and deliver fast so three subtly different use cases and they need different things from tools is the wrinkle though all of these things I actually connected these use cases do not exist by themselves and very quickly I'll just explain that so looking at the red arrow here I've called hardening application prototypes when they lead to successful propositions you need to kind of harden them or industrialized them so that they can become part of your business as usual' operating environment so you move from prototyping and you have to then take that into core operations right looking at the the integration arrow if departmental application development exercises are going to deliver sustainable business improvements then you'll need to actually integrate those even if they were initially built standalone you can only integrate them with other things at some point and that that point may come quite quickly and third looking at the bottom arrow they're engagement when you're extending core operations to address new opportunities it will often make sense for you to use model excuse me modern digital innovation practices that promote rapid iterative prototyping and user feedback so really yes these three use cases are different but they are all connected and over the life of a transformation initiative you will need to move between those and that's really really important so when you think about how to select and use technologies bear that in mind I'm going to leave you with one more chart where I'm not going to go through this in super deep detail but I just want to call out some of the key capabilities that kind of fall out of that that analysis so if you are only looking at prototyping you'd really care about the lightest green of these blocks so right you know the ability to do rapid prototyping really really easy to use tools and that's great as far as it goes but then if you also want to serve the departmental use case you're likely going to need a nother mobile app framework and you're definitely going to need some features that really promote effective team working and scalable team working and tied in with that of course change management facilities in the platform but you can you can chain drive change with confidence and then if you also want to address the third use case it's around extension of core processes you need to go a level further right you need integration you need open API s you need to be able to scale you need to have effective security that's that's open and can integrate with existing mechanisms you really need ideally support for automated testing and you get into a whole other set of capabilities that that land on the table so as you think about the kind of loco platform you need if you're really looking at this in a in a true digital transformation context you need to think beyond just this idea of how do we move quickly how do we get things done quickly all right well I hope that's been useful to you I'm going to hand over to Bill now Bill thanks for your preciate it as mentioned my own story Zacks director of process innovation with the OCC our headquarter in Chicago so it's a little bit after 12:30 if there's a noise from my stomach instead I'm getting close to lunchtime in what I promised not to rush through this talk but today I want to share with you a little bit about how we leverage a pians low code platform to help us transform our processes here at OCC alright so most people may not be aware of who we are someone give you a little context OCC is the world's largest equity derivatives clearing organization it support about fourteen options exchanges for futures exchanges 115 members we maintain a little over a hundred billion dollars in assets day in and day out with within our regulatory terminology were what's known as a system which is a systemically important financial market utility what that means to us is that we're under pretty heavy regulatory scrutiny our core business is really centralized in providing risk management to the markets we serve through trade clearing and settlement and we also act as a guarantor in the marketplace and we also operate a stock loan market kind of wrap-up all that our motto is that we are a foundation for secure market hopefully it gives you a little bit of a background of what I'm about to share with you so moving up next we've got the challenges that we faced so while we deliver our services quite effectively each day we do face a multitude of challenges we must adhere to a very rigorous set of regulatory expectations we need to deliver our services each and every day to ensure secure functioning marketplace and also providing timely and accurate processing of our data so as our markets are ever-changing in our regulatory environment server changing we need to become a lot more agile and at the same time maintain sound practices so we really wanted to become a little more process and risk focused we need to continue to provide daily excellence while initiating an organization-wide effort to become more efficient and increasingly mitigate risks that we faced in particularly those risks stem from manual tasks within our processes so you all have them those those processes that you might be a little bit embarrassed to admit the process that you asked kind of out loud why do we still do it this way well we set out to address a few of those types of issues we took really good note we put some tangible improvements in place right from the start and as we were all too aware that nothing is ever perfect from the start so we really endeavored to improve our processes and our practices with with every step with every effort with with every sprint and we learned a great deal from those efforts and we adopted a very agile development process as well as an agile management process so that we could learn and continue to improve with with every effort so we took a look at our challenges in particularly how we're going to use the load code platform that we had in a paean through the lens that that Harvard professor Clayton Christensen really popularized that's the concept of jobs to be done so it's really helpful mindset to look at any product or service and so a good example is like is your phone so your phone is the tool to be productive away from the office or sometimes even in the office for those of you in the work world but that phone serves a very different job for your teenager and you know that's going to be about connecting with friends Netflix and in generally ignoring the world around them so we looked at a peon in the terms of jobs to be done in order to really ensure that each stakeholder was being delivered value and this is what we came up with this little chart here that highlights the jobs to be done we looked at automation through our stakeholders eyes so for our senior management they needed more transparency from our processes in addition to added efficiency and risk mitigation our control groups which include internal audit compliance enterprise risk they needed to have more reliable and easy accessible documentation now the individual department heads need a better control of their areas their enforced control adherence and also the approvals of those key controls that they could be quicker and easier and better documented now my team in process innovation we were really endeavored to deliver value while improving each areas risk profile throughout the organization now my partner team on the IT side which is known as enterprise technology solutions you know they needed something that was going to deliver solutions quicker make use of agile it also build modules that could be reusable so a lot of those are items that that Neal referenced earlier and we've been able to leverage a pians low code platform to get each of these jobs done so for every project we focus on delivering key outcomes the application must first mitigate an own risk but also deliver an easy method to demonstrate control adherence the management must be able to be aware of the status of processes that they're accountable for while also presenting useful data the records and reports finally each application must support the policies and procedures of the department in each application we built the teams needed to update their procedures just to keep up with the the level of transformation and risk reduction that was becoming apparent with each application so in this graphic which kind of refer to as our our automation solar system we we depict the various applications we've developed since around mid 2015 and we're still building we're in fact working in two efforts right now they can deliver a total of three applications that's the work that we're currently undertaking but on this chart what we show is the applications around onboarding and business expansion and even new products applications they're supporting our organization's growth the regulatory filing and regulatory request applications they help us manage our relationships with our regulators and the remaining applications help us manage day-to-day operations so as you can see we've covered a lot of ground in a fairly short amount of time and we wouldn't have been able to do that without using a low code platform like a peon there are a few things we learned along the way and I want to share a few of those things with you as well and the first one is around data records really and so we've optimized our practice to focus first on records so this allows us to ensure that a common taxonomy is established and the data identified captures all the critical information for the teams to get their jobs done additionally this enables us to avoid rework as key users they can ensure that all the data they need is identified upfront and won't come in piecemeal later on this approach also enabled us to look at reporting from the very beginning and not as an afterthought so we also work with our audit teams to make sure the data we're capturing meet their needs at the end when we finally deliver the the application so that when that team gets audited the audit group will be able to find everything that they need very easily very simply we've had a few recent successes on that part and the business units really appreciate that kind of focus so this records first approach has been very beneficial to each of our efforts next we start going into the benefits that are gained by focusing on risk so we found that through focusing on risk that there's some side benefits that we really didn't anticipate but they're very beneficial with documentation being in a single location the time to respond to an audit or an exam is greatly reduced oftentimes we have to turn around requests in 24 hours so being able to jump to one place reliably and be able to pull that data is is unbelievably handy and by walk walking through each process we can identify those efficiencies as we're going through the automation phases and it helps focus the team to determine why steps are even being done in the history of those and you know often times we run into processes and I'm sure many of you have as well where you start asking well why do we even do this I don't remember why we did this or even it's just the way it's always been so we can start uncovering those and start applying some solutions some automation solutions and leveraging the tool to get those done and there's even times we're measuring improvements from an application just from a risk perspective can sometimes be a little cloudy but when we're seeing real process efficiencies put in place as well that success story for the application just grow stronger so next can I touch on throw away so while we do focus on undated first there's times where we build screens that we know are only to be temporary and that they're gonna be plate replaced by workflow steps that are to follow the governed flow but this approach allows us to ensure that the data being captured is complete and can be maintained while the other elements of the system are being developed so by having agreed upon naming convention within a day repository allows us to do screen development that much quicker it's a lot less arguing in in pushback on screen and field names because they're already set in stone and they've been agreed upon and thought through so the user story development is a lot easier too because the data everyone's familiar with it everyone knows we're calling terms and there's just a lot more agreement from the get-go now another part of this picture is is measurement and so we try to get measure results out of every effort we start from the very beginning with the existing process measurements if we have them and then blend in the goals for the new application as well as any assumptions and we stop frequently after Sprint's to ensure that we're still adhering to our original goals in at the process metrics begin to show the improvement that we intend to we do allow a little bit of time after we put an application in place to allow the department to get used to using the application to get to play with it to understand its how it's going to work day in and day out and so we don't kind of hold back on measurement during that time but once they're comfortable we revisit the the measurement effort we can see the PRU improvement from before the automation effort even took place in we also make sure that we're consistently delivering on the metrics that we had set out to to improve and so far we had a pretty successful history thus far in the applications we've rolled out we are converting manual controls on an average of over 70% in the the processes that we've addressed so have in summary a few takeaways by using app viens low code platform we've been able to refine our automation practice based on the following key concepts to to look both up and down the value chain to identify features that are key to each stakeholder group next we focus on data first helps reduce some of the rework and and thrashing if you will and lastly we measure and a number of times along the way and Ross prepare to change course if for some reason we're seeing that we're getting off track so I hope that some of this information has been useful it enjoyed sharing with you and I'm going to throw it back to Kevin who may have some questions and the answers and so forth all right thanks Bill I'm going to talk a little bit about Appian and then we'll go into the Q&A session at the end so we talked a little bit about how low code addresses the challenges of agility and developer shortages and resource constraints and some of the process issues that that arise around building applications and deploying them low code by itself though isn't always enough and it's important to consider a low code platform that has really the power to produce Enterprise great software that means applications that are you know beyond departmental that can solve big problems that can support mission critical business operations and when you peel back the onion that kind of means that you need applications that support very sophisticated data and process management together and the only thing that's going to give you the ability to develop applications that covers cover this really that's that's what's going to give you the ability to develop a wide variety of applications with a full range of use cases that run in a variety of different industries and different enterprise IT environments and then you know of course on top of that it's almost a given that you need enterprise-grade security and scalability and availability and reliability so you bring these things together you know the sophisticated data the process management the low code speed as well as those enterprise grade characteristics and basically what you have is a platform for digital transformation so you can get to market faster you can be more responsive to change you can drive more innovation in business in your business models and your business processes and that's really what we're we're striking for and appian it's probably worth mentioning that we're the only platform out there that's been rated as a leader in both low code application development and business process management so with that being you're going to get that that blend that mix of speed and power together the speed and agility of low code and the power the data management and process management capabilities of a BPMS so and of course as well you know we're running on the industry's most reliable scalable available and secure cloud service so that's kind of that's kind of what a paean is all about I wanted to talk quickly about some of the use cases that that we typically support on this slide here the boxes represent in probably the most simplest way your environment of enterprise applications when you boil it down a peon basically does three things the first thing is building meaningful significant new applications fast that's pretty straightforward if there's a need for a major new business application and you know packaged alternatives aren't the right direction you can certainly build the app using a peon directly and you can do it much faster up to 20 times faster according to some analysis that we've done because you're maximizing developer productivity with low code your leveraging the citizen developer in the process and incorporate incorporating the business directly into the into the actual development cycle which improves of course business and IT collaboration the second thing you can do with a pian is basically fill white space extend existing systems with new processes so these are a paean apps that can bolt on to existing enterprise applications to handle a related process that your core system doesn't currently support so for example you may have a special exception process for claims management you could also have less mission-critical applications that are useful but might not get built on their own because they fall too low on the priority list this is where a paean can kind of help to fill in that white space it's probably worth pointing out that no matter how you use a peon it's always effectively kind of a layer of future proofing for the applications you build so anything you build in a peon instantly is mobile and it's available as a native application on iOS and Android there's no incremental work that you need to do to actually deliver that that native mobile application and happening also makes it really easy to plug in transformative new technologies whether it's IOT or predictive analytics a IR PA whatever it is a peon is effectively a delivery vehicle to insert these capabilities into your operational processes and to make it even easier with some of that we offer an integrated ai designer so you can leverage machine learning directly in the applications as you build in your applications as you build them and just last week we also announced a new product at the NRP a with blue prism which integrates blue prisms industry-leading RP a robotic process automation solution directly into the appian platform and we're excited to add that as an extension of our capabilities the third use case here is basically orchestrating between applications connecting and unifying existing applications here appian operates as a layer that basically is capable of abstracting away the complexity the old user interface the old user experience of existing applications which may be legacy applications and you know basically creating a more seamless and productive work environment for for users so you're breaking down silos here without the cost and complexity and delay and pain of rip and replace traditional system consolidation you're effectively amplifying the user experience and you're enabling those cross system processes so you know as a result we're kind of solving a variety of different problems a wide array of different use cases for our customers we categorize these into three broad categories the first is improving the customer journey so enabling our customers to deliver a better customer experience and sales marketing and support clearly highly aligned with with digital transformation initiatives as you traditionally think about them but as we saw from the poll result earlier today digital transformation isn't all about the customer journey and the customer experience it's also about improving business operations and operational efficiency maximizing employee productivity making better decisions and this is really a fundamental aspect of digital transformation because you know if you're not on a path to improve the agility and the efficiency of business operations it's really difficult to maintain a superior customer experience over time even if you put a lot of work into the front end of how you're delivering your business the back end has to be flexible to support the front end as business conditions change and market demand changes so business operations is another major category for us and I also had governance risk and compliance here as well because it's a big segment typically very complex and as I mentioned earlier a paean is pretty unique when it comes to handling complex data and processes together so whether we're talking about applications like pharmacovigilance or anti money laundering or any other compliance application appian can be a real accelerator so just a few examples here quickly Enterprise this is their own words and end-to-end operating system for their for their rideshare business at the end built an app to support this brand new business model for them took it live in eight weeks DFW Airport they're building a digital airport of the future and we've built 36 applications with them delivered in 18 months so you're seeing this mix of enterprise grade power complex applications together with that speed of low code application development and delivery Bendigo and Adelaide Bank another example their goal really is to complete has been to compete on great customer service that's their number one mission and they used a pian to transform how they engage customers they built a whole array of applications 26 applications ranging from ATM management credit card management mortgage origination merchant services a whole lot more in 18 months really revolutionising that entire customer experience so just to kind of wrap things up low code can be an enabler of rapid digital transformation but in and of itself it's not enough you know you also need that enterprise grade power to build significant game-changing applications that have that transformative power so with that let's kind of move on to the Q&A section we have a poll question we're going to kick off as we as we move into QA so which of these low code platform use cases is most important to you application prototyping departmental application development extending existing processes or altogether and we'll give that kind of a minute or two to run I'll leave it up here on the screen and in the meantime we've had some other questions come in so why don't I want to kick off one of those other questions and I'll I'll ask pass this one on to the needle actually Neil how do you see the low code market and the products in the low code market evolving over the next three to five years um okay great question Wow so these days is how to how to have an opinion for anything that's kind of more than a couple years out so not sure about five years I might be a robot in five years I guess but really that I think what we're going to see is more and more tools generally applying these same principles so and we're seeing it not just in the kind of the core app dev space or even the business process space we're seeing it in the integration space we're seeing in all kinds of adjacent spaces where there's a drive to deliver tools that are accessible and usable by broader populations of people so that's absolutely a trend this kind of low code trend is kind of pushing out across a whole swath of of different kind of technology areas so that's one thing the other thing that we're absolutely going to see I think which is part of that is more features and capabilities in those tools that are actually kind of kind of in quotes intelligent or or AI assisted if you want to kind of use that term so we're tools will actually kind of configure themselves and suggest things based on historical understanding of what other people have done in certain situations right so if you're old enough to remember the the often hated Microsoft Clippy you know that little kind of clip guide they used to pop up and say it looks like you're writing a letter well if you imagine that but actually useful in the context of building applications building out integration scenarios and so on we're going to see more and more of that driven by AI yes but also driven by cloud platforms which can aggregate metadata across many many different customer scenarios though actually driving digital kind of innovation within the tools themselves great thanks Nell let's go with a question here for bill bill what are some of the considerations and initial steps you recommend when starting your first low code project no that's a great one you know it's funny I look back our first one and there's so much I'd have done different but probably one of the first considerations is is getting the users and really the organization around the concept of envisioning what's possible in getting away from what has always been or small incremental steps start thinking a little bit bigger and then trying to address those that did bigger picture in smaller chunks in fact we move to a one-week sprint in order to kind of move along quicker and get that adoption at a quicker rate great let's shift it over and take a look at the the poll results here all right so we see a consensus that local platform is important for a variety of different things so most people have answered all the above to the question and a couple people focused more in on departmental application development and application prototyping expending existing processes seems to be the the lowest answer here but general consensus that low code is being looked at for a variety of different things Neil do you want to you want to add any thoughts to this or comments well only to say Kevin that um you know if that's what you're looking at doing you know that's of it that's a really really important thing to to have in your mind as you look to to select it tool because if you want to do these things like as I presented those use cases are all connected so you need to think about the kind of super set of capabilities you need to serve each of those use cases so yeah that's the only comment but very very interesting thanks a lot all right another question here for for Bill it seems that in most projects you have many stakeholders who over time realize benefits that you've delivered by a low code what impediments to acceptance of a low code platform did you find when you first introduced it at the OCC so comments very similar to my last answer the the tough part was getting users to envision the future and in making use of low code by by cutting back to the one-week sprint that that helped a great deal other impediments though really came in from getting a really good idea of the kind of reporting and data they wanted out at the end of at the end of a workflow so that specimen shifted towards that record first concept what we are finding is there a lot of as a kind of at the end of a process we had a lot of people asking can I have a report that does this or shows me that and you know in the end or a couple things in elements of data that we didn't capture so we shifted shifted back and so it's really kind of I hate I think the word is a somewhat overused but the journey of a project the users have to be brought along and kind of shown the path as opposed to letting them chart the way and getting away from projects as usual all right Neil I have another one here for you I may take a crack at this one myself but here we go how is this a revolution exactly low code generation and BPM have been around for decades that's a great one and I I have a get out here that actually if we were to go back and look at the beginning the title of the the webinar that I kind of originally put forward for this the is kind of the R is in brackets I think so you know and there's kind of a bit jokey but the whole point is that actually what we see is a lot of companies who are new to this whole game who haven't really been through the BPM technology wave in any serious way do look at this as being revolutionary but actually many organizations that have really embraced the possibilities of platforms like a paean I mean it's not the only platform it's important for me to say that but anyone who's really embraced those possibilities would see this really as evolutionary it is actually it's about making the tools easier to consume it's about May easier to start quickly easier to get to a result quickly and so it's it's really kind of incremental improvements and kind of really kind of slightly different ways of packaging the technology looking at jobs to be done in a slightly different way to enable us to to start small to scale faster and so on so for some people it does feel like a revolution but for many people who have already lived with this technology and its capabilities for a while it really is more of an evolution yeah great answer and I think I I completely agree with that I would just you know maybe add that a couple things I think I think in in parallel to the the evolution of the technology itself which obviously has continued to improve over the last you know 10 years or so to the point where low code is is gradually approaching the point of almost no code where really the business can be directly building applications themselves you know we've we've also seen the the process for application development changing too so you know we've moved it we've moved from approaches in the past which were more waterfall oriented to much more agile approaches today we're you know effectively business and IT are working side by side on an intraday basis building applications iterate iterating them in real time and that's a pretty significant paradigm shift and that tends to have driven you know results which I think 10 years ago would have been you know even today they're pretty remarkable in terms of the speed that you could actually build and deploy a sophisticated application in and I showed a couple of examples in in my presentation so you know it's it is a revolution and an evolution I guess depending on on your perspective to to agree with Neal there um all right I guess one more question here let's see here find the question the long list of answered questions here all right maybe I'll target this one if bill does effective use of a peon assume a maturity level for target customers with regards to data management business process modeling etc so as the customer as the user bill may be getting your perspective on this could be pretty interesting yes so typically we haven't seen a lot of maturity in those kinds of realms we spent a lot of time educating in teaching and in particularly showing the users and the power of not only the tool but of implying employing efficiencies and so on and so forth so that we bring them along and you know we acknowledge that we're probably going have to come back and make some improvements later on because they're still kind of the education phase but we we're not going to wait and try to educate everyone first so we've been taking pockets and bring them along with us so it's not sure if that's always the best route but seems to be working pretty well for us great well I think we're actually a little bit over time for the the webinar so I think we're going to bring things to a close I'd like to thank everybody for sticking with us through the webinar I hope it was useful for everybody and thank you again to the bill and meal for for joining us today as guest speakers I really appreciate it and and with that thanks again and have a great day
