 Good morning. And welcome to the Illinois end to Global Issues forum Health in smart urban environments.  It's so nice to see you here I'm William Sullivan I'm professor and head of landscape architecture at the University of Illinois and adjunct professor in horticulture and Landscape Architecture at NTU. And I'm speaking to my families here, my academic families here, it's really nice to have us all together in the same room. You know we met for the first time in September of 2014 at NTU. When thirty two of us got on an airplane and and flew to Nerita and then to Taipei and we spent a couple of days with our chancellor and provost and vice chancellor of research and deans and faculty members and we came together to discuss ways in which emerging technologies and ideas about health and big data and Supercomputing come together to possibly create healthier places for individuals and families and communities and we had a robust discussion for for a couple of days. We met in breakout sessions and we ate and ate and ate and ate. We all came home several pounds heavier I think. In that forum we had six thematic areas and today we have six thematic areas too, air and water quality, biomedical and cancer research, the built environment and human health, Healthy Aging in urban ecosystems, mobility autonomous connected vehicles, urban agriculture and food security. We're going to take a deep dive into these areas but one of the things that we learned from our experience in 2014 is that we when we came away we felt a little too siloed, we felt as though the aging folks could have talked more to the built environment folks and the air and water quality folks had think to say more generally about health and well being and the smart folks had things to say to all of us so we've redesigned this a little bit this this time so that tomorrow morning we're going to we're going to step back a little bit we're going to hear from Antoinette Burton in in the introductory comments in the morning at eight fifteen and then at nine o'clock are going to break out into these cross-cutting thematic sessions in which we're going to get a chance to take a deeper dive across these areas with respect to some really important issues. I just want to make a note on a personal note that it's such a delight for me to participate here today. For a number of years I've made trips back and forth to to Taipei and to NTU I think this summer one when we were there it was my seventeenth trip to NTU and it's really quite a joy to to be with all of you here on this campus as we as we grapple with some of the most important ideas that we face in society today as we fulfill our mission as really world class research one institutions. And as we as we embrace not only the challenge to conduct and pursue pathbreaking research but in which we also embrace the imperative to share that research to reach beyond this ivory tower to go into communities and engage deeply with communities to make the ideas accessible and the innovations of available so that we're not only coming up with brilliant new discoveries but we're finding ways to engage with citizens. To turn those innovations into into healthier lives and better places for people to raise their children, to go to school, to be employed, to retire and live healthy wonderful lives so that's that's the real basic reason that I'm so happy to have us here together is because we're in pursuit of these really high high minded ideals. We're oing to have a couple of introductory comments from our leaders and then we'll move to Jeff's keynote address this morning so let me introduce Professor Robert Jones Professor Jones became chancellor at the University of Illinois one year ago this week and it sure was a happy week one year ago. He came to us with a great deal of experience from his years as senior vice president at the University of Minnesota and as president of the University of Albany in New York State. Since he's arrived in Illinois we've come to admire his grace, his enthusiasm for his work, his willingness to make tough decisions, and his capacity to take public stands for science based facts and for justice those of you from NTU, you may not know the discussion that's going on about alternative facts in our society right now but we appreciate having champions for science and for truth. We also admire Chancellor Jones we also admire your unwaving commitment to our most basic principles, excellence in teaching, excellence in research and in public engagement. We often describe ourselves as a research one university and whenever we say that, I notice that we stand up a little straighter a little taller we say research one university for Chancellor Jones, it's not enough. He's pushing us further he brings us back to our roots. And to this is so important in our one hundredth and one hundred fiftieth year we're celebrating our Sesquintennial this year. He's committed to helping make sure that we are a university that not only generates this new knowledge but that we take serious the moral act in our commitment to reach beyond these walls and engage with communities and boy we appreciate that and we appreciate your continuing to say how important it is and we continue we appreciate you being here with us today to reinforce that sense of purpose so please join me in welcoming our chancer Robert Jones. [clapping] [clapping] Thank you Professor Sullivan and good morning everyone. It is indeed an honor and pleasure for me to be here this morning and as the chancellor it is my distinct privilege on behalf of the entire University of Illinois community our faculty, our students, and our staff to extend a very warm welcome to our distinguished guest from the National Taiwan university and while I was not here at the time I've heard many stories including the one bill provided today about the hospitality extended, it seems like that wasn't the only thing that was extended some waistlines were extended as well, to members are they have annoyed delegation by you and your colleagues when you hosted the first forum in 2014. I hope that your time here with us produces such lasting goodwill some good memories and productive collaboration's and that the heart and the soul of very good collaboration is a strong and sustainable friendship our international co-operative initiative with National Taiwan University ranks among the most important and I would say the most prestigious programs at this university but it's more important than that potential research will rise in that open up through this joint endeavor that will make this relationship between these two universities so special to us here at Illinois, not only do we share similar reputations as preeminent public research universities and our respective nations and globally we're also proud of the many and to the NTU faculty members who have spent part of their career as visiting professors studying at this great university so they feel a very strong sense of connection to this huge university community and many of them consider this place their academic home. President John was sharing with me a few minutes ago that a number of the faculty members from this university that are part of the faculty so I'm going to let him give you that number I knew it was large but I didn't know it was such a profound percentage so I won't steal part of his rmarks by telling you but I think you're going to be as impressed as I was. Because we have one of the largest alumni population in the world among American institution, one of the largest international bases but I don't believe that there is any university in the world outside of Urbana with such a concentration of graduates among the faculty these lasting connections I believe from former students, advisors, mentors and peers have been the foundation for our research and scholarly collaboration that ties our two universities together and that span the entire spectrum of disciplines and folks I can tell you as much as administrators like to try to forge collaboration's, nothing happens that's sustainable or that will impact that's not driven by faculty faculty connections. I've learned that over my almost thirty nine years in higher education if I haven't learned anything else. It is almost certainly this legacy across continental collaboration that has led to these global forums and they offer us a chance to build on our foundation of individual connections to the scale that really help drives this dual partnership between our institution and provide their opportunity for us to find solutions to problems that are being presented to a growing urbanized population in a urbanized world. Our nations and the entire globe I believe are looking to great universities like both of ours to translate knowledge and research into innovation, ideas and invention, and policies that fundamentally and measurably improve the lives of our of our citizens. I strongly believe as many of you have heard me say many times the grand society challenges ahead of us do not recognize geographical or political borders, food security, health, environmental stress, economic disparity do not speak with a single language or impact a single culture we are all in this together in this increasingly interconnected and interdependent world we all share and of responsibility of creating a sustainable future and the best university of this century and I think we will be judged not only by our ambition but by our ability to create networks and relationships that may be rooted in Champaign Urbana or in Taipei but truly has a global impact. In many ways these forums are kind of an experiment, perhaps proof of concept, of the possibilities then the potential and I will add the power that comes together and is created when we convene our resources and our intellectual capacity of two great universities that are thousand of miles apart but so closely linked in their mission and their commitment to solving grand society challenges. That experiment got off to an auspicious a precede beginning with the inaugural forum in 2014 at NTU and we are proud to contribute to that continued success here today. So let me conclude by saying how excited all of us are here at Illinois to welcome new and returning friends, research partners and collaborators to our university we are deeply honored to have you here were enthusiastic about the new ideas and 166 00:13:39,409 -- 00:13:44,089 collaboration's and affronting Is that where the merge from conversations and presentations at this global forum and we're certainly pleased to be here and I can tell you my first interaction with NTU deep interaction was during the time when I was the president of University at Albany and one of the great things that happen out of that collaboration was a jointly sponsored research program for NSF I think you know where I'm going with this, I certainly hope that alternately that's one of the outcomes of this forum that we have the ability to put together a strong collaborative research focus what is across one of the sixty areas we're focusing on today or some other great idea that comes out of this forum. Because at the end of the day I think we clearly have the intellectual academic capacity to create that really deep academic relationship with some jointly sponsored research and so far as I'm concerned that wasn't in my speech but that's one of things you get to do is the chancellor you can just put your opinions out there and see what happens. So thank you very much for allowing me to be here today it is now my great pleasure to formally and my esteemed colleague president Ching-Ray Chang take the podium and offer his perspective on this historic event. The president is both an accomplished scholar and recognized leader and international leader in higher education and before assuming- his role in NTU this past summer he served as the executive Vice President for ministrative affairs since 2013, prior to that appointment he served for two years as a dean of the College of Science and he is a physicist by training haven't earned his undergraduate degree in the field from NTU and his Ph D. from the University of California San Diego he is certainly a prolific author and scholar with more than two hundred forty papers to his credit and he's an equally renown inventor and innovator holding more than twenty patterns. So Mr President it's our great honor to welcome you to the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign to launch the next phase of this critically important partnerships between our two University thank you and again welcome. Thank you. Thank you Chancellor Jones. And. Yeah good morning Chancellor Jones and other distinction members of the University Urbana Champaign and the colleagues of NTU. It gives me tremendous pleasure to say a few words of the opening NTU global public forum. First let me say thank you for the long work you have shown us. The Illinois team has worked very hard to make this event possible. Let us give all Illinois colleagues a round of applause This time I am very pleased to lead the forty one and NTU colleague to visit your lovely campus. It's great to see my many old Friends reunited today for the second Illinois and NTU global issue forums. The main topics of this year for this year's forum is held in smart urban environments or is the brilliant minds of NTU and the Illinois colleagues we will be sure to have a food for our company. Allow me to talk about a few numbers and mindset. This year the University of Illinois celebrate one hundred fifty years anniversary a truly beautiful milestone for your commitment to public engagement and to the great help for shaping the future. The other milestone shared between our university this year is the NTU and Illinois celebrate twenty years of partnership. We establish a university partnership in November 1997 for the past twenty years there have been ongoing active collaboration. We owe this wonderful partnership to faulty, the staff members, researchers and the students. NTU as you know Chancellor Jones just mentioned we have eighty six factor member who received the degree from your university among, actually I think the faculty number is a little bit less than 2100 so it's about four percent, that is a really amazing number and the high is the number as I learned from our office of the faculty in our university faculty and much higher than other university including in my own. Yeah so actually Lacey is the benefactor. You know for the very successful collaboration between Illinois and NTU and we hope with the blessing of the Chancellor Jones, we definitely can have more joy in the futures of collaboration. And their list is a really remarkable number of the sheer the talents in particular from the Illinois Urbana Champaign. So research allowed a university our mission are to enhance the life of people and to take charge in leading and deliver advancement on technology to do so we need to work together in order to integrate the expert from various research area and to create a conversation and discussion. We proposed to host the global issue forums together in 2013 Professor Leon Chichen the current Minister of the ministries of science and technology in Taiwan. Actually the forum was initiated by him. So I definitely believe he was suppose the joint research collaborator Chen among the most that and NSF I used to serve as a international affair of office in most, so I know they have a larger joint program between most and NSF so definitely we can try Los possibility also beyond the university funding. Yeah so anyway professor NAME, NAME, and NTU faculty member to Urbana-Champaign opened a conversation on strategic partnership and proposed it and NTU host the first the global issue forum. The first NTU-UIUC  global issue forum happened in 2014 at NTU with the over arching scenes and small city. As a city we brought together over a one hundred faculty member from both Illinois and NTU to discuss the challenges of the grobal civilization. 30 of the Illinois professor flew all the way to Taiwan to enhance collaboration. And then now we have seen the initial outcome of close discipline, cinematic based strategic partnership. This year the Illinois team carefully design forum on gender to tackle the scene. Help on the smart urban environment on top of the close discipline sematic base structure we expand our network of collaboration to Government in the true representative my NTU colleague and I look forward to walking with our Illinois friend and we believe this second forum will evoke innovative thinking and ideas tracing global challenger. To conclude my warmest wishes and thanks again to all the hardworking member from Illinois and NTU for our commitment and dedication in preparing this forum. With our on-going conversation and close friendship this forum would not be possible. Unhappy report that layer is final director fright between Chicago and Taipei since last year. Now we expect easy Trevor and the most face to face interaction between our teens Thank you and let us begin a fruitful forum. THANK YOU. [clapping] Before I introduce Jeff Moore our keynote, I just want to say a couple of thank yous. First, I want to shout out to Mark Rude who is the co-chair of this enterprise [clapping] Mark has provided enormous intellectual energy and insight into how we bring this together. Professor vice provost Rhi Tu Mocabella and her incredible staff. Have had been I don't want to say that she got the whip out but she was so encouraging and insistent that we keep making progress every week until we made this made this happen and so thank you for your leadership and for your and your for your grace in pulling all these cats together and herding us and into one one direction and my boss said at NTU Professor Jun Yin-Zhong who is head of landscape and horticulturalist. So now it's my pleasure to introduce Professor Jeffrey Moore. Moore is the merchants and mallory chair in the department of chemistry and he's also director of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology the building in which we sit right now he's hosting us and giving us his keynote. Professor Moore is a superstar. He's a member of the National Academy of Sciences a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences fellow in the American Association for the advancement of Sciences and a fellow in the American Chemical Society. He's published over four hundred peer review articles, this is what makes him a star. What makes him a superstar is that he's an incredible teacher as well. He received our campuses Award for Excellence in undergraduate teaching and he's been repeatedly recognized as a professor ranked excellent by their students please join me in welcoming Professor Moore. Thank you. Thank you very much Bill that was an introduction that there's no way that I possibly could ever live up to so. Please don't expect more than I could possibly be delivered by that introduction. First, I'd like to start by welcoming everyone. President Chang and Chancellor Jones thanks for the introductions this morning and welcome to all of our NTU delegates it's really great to have you here on the campus and especially at the place that we like to call our home away from home we like to think of ourselves as a family and anyone in the family can use the space in the Beckman Institute as you would your house so please feel welcome here and enjoy your time in this building and we very much think that it is a building that fosters collaboration that encourages people to come together from across disciplines and I'll have a little more to say about that during my talk because the talk I want to give you this morning is really a talk that I think has been very much inspired by maybe two decades worth of research that's gone on in this building and what I would like to do is to try to tell you a little bit about some of the lessons that we've learned in collaboration. And athen how those might translate into what I believe are even more challenging collaboration's when we don't reside in the same location. I also want to give you one incentive to begin to think about seeding some of these ideas and it's through our post doc fellowship program which has just opened up and it is an opportunity to send talented people here to the Beckman Institute and collaborate here and as well as collaborative from afar so I'll mention that during the talk as well so with that in mind try to imagine a future in which the materials that we're used to that there are in our environment that build our urban environment are much different than the materials that exist today this is certainly going to have to be the case as we move for example to things like autonomous vehicles where the vehicle itself will have to see and some maybe way that's invisible to us the sensors and road itself might be communicating with that vehicle but even in other ways I think that the materials of the future will have more of a life to them in a way that we think about living things and what I mean by that is you'll hear me talk about the health span of materials in the talk today and I think that as you see there's very close analogies between the health span that we're used to thinking about for human health and the whole span that we think about for the Healthy Aging of materials and how there is a lifecycle to those materials and that we can build sustainability and impact our environment minimally If we think smart about those materials and so the final thing I have to say is way of introduction if if we think about periods in civilization that are tied to materials the Stone Age, The Bronze Age, the Iron Age, many have thought that this is the age of materials Aleck tronic materials to make computers and maybe materials that even are more functional than them than that and that's what I'd like to try to invite you to learn about in the lecture today. Let me again a little bit about the Backman Institute and how this is research that very much has been inspired by what's going on in this building and it started with this building began with Ted Brown who is pictured here back in the late eighty's when this building was being built and the idea really was especially what's at the bottom of this text box and that is it was intended to be a place that would foster diversity of thought and in fact if you when you walk around during the break you'll see a plaque on the wall that has this quote from Ted Brown in it and he calls it a dramatic experiment because in the late eighty's at least in academic settings it was unusual to bring together a very diverse group of scholars from across the campus from engineering and from life sciences from physical sciences together and he describes that diversity of thought in that scholars from diverse fields of inquiry working together will advance the frontiers of human knowledge and help us gain a better understanding of the world around us and of ourselves and so I think that this idea of diversity of thought and a little bit different than interdisciplinary and we think about interdisciplinary as the place where the problem resides between two areas but it is diversity of thought that brings solutions to those problems and I think that that's one of the things that we have learned and so diversity of thought leads to long lasting and productive collaboration's I hope I can convince you of that and so you might say how so how is that the diversity of thought can lead to productive collaboration it's very much what we will all encounter over the next couple of days. It is sharing common goals and this next line is the key if we come together with collaborators that are too similar to us I think will fail as collaboration will become competitors rather than Problem Solvers whereas if we come together with different parts lists we each bring different expertise to the problem that's the diversity of thought that leads to solutions and I think that has been borne out in the research we've done here and we'd like to expand that and take it elsewhere too across the globe a lot of what I just said was embedded in the name of the Beckman Institute and so let me tell you how our building through its bringing together these diverse scholars really promotes this idea of diversity of thought pay attention closely too often we just say the Beckman Institute but we are the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology and if science is about knowledge that stands the test of time through hypothesis testing, analysis, and understanding then technology is about inventing, designing, prototyping, testing, and it leads to advances that meet the needs of the day. Those are different goals a paper written in a fundamental science will be read many years later the paper that describe the spin Echo which is the building block for magnetic resonance imaging for example was actually a one nine hundred forty six thesis from the physics department at the University of Illinois a piece of fundamental science the paper is still read and it is going to last and stand the test of time. M.R.I. advances that are taking place downstairs in this building are examples of really moving that and building on that fundamental piece of science to solve problems that meet the needs for today so really our building is the integration interwoven us of those two ideas and I'd like to give you in my talk today one deep dive into an example of that and it's really it's a draft of a paper that's in the works right now but I thought it was so relevant to this idea to demonstrate how we can foster those collaboration's with different parts lists and for example the first author on this paper one and two is my student Ian Robertson and he's the person who really enabled with some breakthrough science to make advances in this energy efficient manufacturing of polymers that all tell you about and so when science and so he's from the Department of Chemistry what Ian shares in common with the corresponding author, my colleague Scott White, is that Scott is also a member of the Beckman institute in a very close collaborator of ours but you'll notice that he doesn't share the commonality of chemistry but rather of aerospace engineering and we very much think this manufacturing problem will reduce the carbon footprint of things like large structures wind turbans for example or fuselage of airplanes and so the two come together we believe that's how discovery is accelerated and I'd like to say is that an isolated example that I just showed you and this isn't what I would call my experiment of n equals one it's just my data but I think it's representative numbers of coauthored publications between this group which reside at the Beckman Institute, by the way anyone with a face are my colleagues within the Beckman institute, my colleagues at the University of Illinois are not shown with their faces but just with their names and I think you can see at least in this case we've had for a long lasting and productive collaboration the ecosystem of that command supports this idea how so there's really three components I think to building this ecosystem that we're all going to engage in as collaborators and it's first of all having people involved and projects involved and that's really where we come together and our human interactions exist. So the recipe for collaborative creativity as I see it really is getting to know one another it's very rarely discussed as a sort of an essential component of collaboration but I believe it is really the key. If we don't come together with a different expertise but then don't learn to share that expertise by trusting one another we'll never get to the point where we innovate and so that's really what the rest of the ecosystem is all about how to foster interdisciplinary socialization that's a term that I heard spoken for the first time this summer President Obama's advisor John Holdren was basically describing how he learned that if they wanted to write an important position paper that required many different expert experts to come together they needed this period of time where that team could come together and socialize before they could get down to the business of actually writing that paper. Once you learn to trust your colleagues who have different expertise sharing that information our hunches come together and we produce innovative science but we need a place to do that and so the building here provides infrastructure I'll highlight one thing on this our Beckman services and facilities that's so crucially important and that's the café. It's food it's what Bill talked about when you entertain us in 2014 and why is that, you know you can stop and wonder why is food so important to interdisciplinary socialization and the reason is. Is because it keeps us captive during a meal for that period of time it would be kind of rude to get up during the middle of a meal and walk away your held captive and during that captivity you share conversations and you get to know your colleagues and your colleagues might have a much different parts list than you but you are willing to engage with them during the course of the time of the deal so never. Sure the importance of food and I hope you enjoyed some of the food that you'll have during your visit here at the University of Illinois. The last thing really is programs and our programs in include things like fellowships that I mentioned and so these are really the drivers and cultivators of how we can come together and and and do research and it's done well I think within the Beckman and we want to expand that beyond together all that makes the Beckman innovative ecosystem and we very much think that it's those components that lead to productive collaboration. So let me do a very brief advertisement because I do think it's very relevant it is a great way to seed future funding because it allows us to get preliminary data and I just want to call your attention to the excellent opportunities that exist if you have talented colleagues that you think would be suitable please consider sending them our way the deadline is at the end of November and we usually take about six or seven post docs to see these new opportunities to establish new collaboration and so on and so we very much welcome that opportunity. Let me tell you a little bit about the broad in a broad sort of sense the research initiatives the go on here at the back of an institute and here's where I'll introduce this idea of health span which we probably think about it applying to quality of life over a long period of time over the lifespan of an individual for example it has components of development starting from birth it reaches peak performance there are issues involved that require some kind of intervention hopefully we are resilient beings and we can last for long times be fit for long periods of time before aging said sin and so we think about that from the context of human health I'd like to say that I think it's much broader and as we look at the pillars of research programs that exist at the Beckman Institute in many ways they all do wrap around of this idea of the health span some of them are more obvious for example the idea of bringing together medicine with imaging to allow us to get deeper probes and understanding of issues in cancer research or neuroscience are absolutely critical to much of what goes on at the Beckman Institute we have as I mentioned a large effort in imaging magnetic resonance imaging, optical imaging, we have ultra sound imaging, we have many developments along those lines and a lot of that work is brain work focused on the mind and understanding which also spans from the molecular and cellular scale all up all the way up to cognitive neuroscience and so very much tied in these problems of cancer in your life science very much tied into making a long lasting health span for individuals you might say, What in the world is this doing down here and I would say as I hope that in the talk today as we think about materials of the future you begin to think about how that health span problem really plays out analogously to what I just described and that's really what I want to show you about it's this problem of thinking about the lifecycle costs of our infrastructure making our infrastructure smarter and longer lasting and safer for people of the urban environment that are going to populate that. In the U.S. alone it's been predicted over the next ten years that the gap in order of currently what monies are available for infrastructure to what is needed is about a twenty trillion dollar gap an enormous gap and if we don't fill that gap the likely hood is that we'll be paying even more due to losses in jobs for example or sales and so the infrastructure investment is critically important I've lifted this from the report card that came out from the American Civil Engineering Society and this quotes talks specifically about ideas that I just mentioned so enhanced resiliency and the goal of reducing the lifecycle of the material maybe fifty percent by 2025 and so what do we mean by the health span and the life cycle of materials and and so here's what you will see as we begin to think about innovating concepts and materials in order to address some of these problems of both from manufacturing to the end of life and ultimately to regeneration I'll tell you more about manufacturing it was the title of that paper that I mention a little bit later on so I'll skip that for the moment and move on to really what we'd like to do is know more about our system have and have that system protect itself inevitably a material is going to encounter an environment that is creating damage, damage in that material must be repaired much like we are or have mechanisms for repairing damage and so we've invented ways to use force that is inevitably present at the point where those damage events are taking place to induce chemical transformations and I will give you a lot of detail except to say there are real bonds in atom's behind this concept of being able to repair damage due to the presence of force. Ideally we'd like to take and make those forces not destructive but rather productive and we've been working in this area of what we call the development of Mechanophores. Maybe a little bit more easily visualised is this idea that we can sense the damage as it occurs so we know where the sight of damages and for example last year one of our Beckman post-doc fellows published this idea where there was a release of flourophore at the point of damage and we could detect damage in materials that wasn't even available wasn't even visible to the human eye and so we have the means of detecting damage long before it becomes catastrophic. What we've really been very excited about for a long time is this idea of self healing because once the damage has occurred we'd like to return to peak performance and how is that that that we have the capability of doing that and this is where we've been thinking about compartmentalization of reagents that can recover damage and so one approach to self healing is the idea of putting reagents in micro capsules that are broken open upon damage much like that sensor example but now they have the ability to recover damage and in 2001 our team for the really our first co-published paper came together and invented the idea that we could repair damage in this way. It took from 2001 until late December last year before this technology became commercial I won't play this whole video but it really is exciting that. That there is now a commercially available material it's not only because well maybe it might make us some money I'm not all that a concerned about that aspect what's actually more important is there's a pathway now where there is a commercially viable process and as the technology begins to move into the marketplace I think the area will begin to gain momentum and pick up even more activity so we're very excited from some very fundamental advances that came out almost two decades ago now that is moving into the marketplace but this problem is limited in that when you in capsule lead material that has to have some finite amount of lifetime before it is released and then utilized in the context of healing, isn't the way we are thinking about healing in the human body it's much more of a vascularization approach where there is damage and release of of those healing agents and so we began an effort maybe ten years ago now to think about how we might vascularized structural materials like composites that are used in fuselages of airplanes, cars, transportation, vehicles, and so forth and so here's a composite it's made of a fabric a reinforcing component which has a matrix polymaric matrix that is in between those materials and when damage occurs often by ideal lamination pulling apart those layers the vasculature is broken open in the red and the blue which are separated normally can come together mixed together and begin our chemical reaction the can rebind those interfaces back together. Finally as we get to a point of and irrecoverable state it might be time can you imagine a day when you have a cell phone and instead of trying to return it to a recycle of electronics. That you could just program in a number and it would automatically undergo a triggered transience into maybe just vapor and so we're thinking about that idea and here's a very early somewhat primitive example of the material on the right is packaged with a material that undergoes triggered transients at one hundred degrees C and over the course of ten minutes or so it literally turns from a solid polymer package into vaporized material and even the electronic components thanks to a collaborator John Rogers was able to be converted into essentially silicon sand at the end of the process. Finally we might want to use that recovered material and possibly use it in a repair or even maybe regenerate damage and so here's a large damage volume area and we we now have to fight things like gravity or wind but we've learned to build materials that that basically have the ability to fill gaps and then harden over time and so even large scale damage not just a small crack damage can be repaired so that's essentially the lifecycle of materials and I think these four bullet points are really the main message live long be fit die fast and leave no mass behind that's probably healthy aging of materials as well as something that might apply to people as well we want all live long and be fit but then when it's time let's end it quickly and don't leave anybody with some problems left behind we think there is a close analogy between materials and the health of of people let me spend a little bit of time about diving just a little bit deeper into this problem that really all this life cycle begins at birth and the birth for materials is manufacturing and I'll try to convince you that there hasn't been any disruptive change in manufacturing of composites for quite some time at least three decades. But we think we're on to something that's really quite interesting and has the AS A At the very end of the talk potential to be interesting from the standpoint of of a development morphogenesis kind of problem so fiber reinforced composites, here's the primer it's basically a reinforced fabric usually carbon fiber these days is very common and it's infiltrated with a Palmeric matrix a cross section looks like that when it comes to lightweight and high strength these materials are without exception really phenomenal and so they're used examples of wind turbine blades where lightweight and high strength. Long time thirty year life cycle is typical, fatigue of basically wind blowing on the sand and contorting it during its thirty year life cycle or another one is lightweight high strength now as you'll see in just a moment the Boeing seven eighty seven Dreamliner is using large amounts of composite materials taking advantage of the lightweight fuel efficiency and high strength. However there are some very big challenges to using composite materials and they come mostly from their manufacture they're expensive to make they leave behind a large CO2 footprint and even more problematic is that they do undergo damage they've gone undergo fatigue damage from basically being loaded and unloaded over long periods of time and that damage is often difficult to detect and almost impossible to repair could we design a composite materials that would not have to be detecting their damage they'd repaired before it even occurs. Here's an example of the Dreamliner and how prevalent composites are coming into the transportation history the seven seventy seven was introduced in ninety four and it had about twelve way percent composites the. Dreamliners from Boeing seven eighty seven was introduced in two thousand and nine and everything you see and blue is a composite material its fuselage is about fifty percent composite. I'd like to just zoom in on one section of that and talk about what kind of carbon footprint is left behind by the manufacture of this one small tail section forty six actually two sections forty seven and forty eight it's an a long temperature high temperature long time curing process about an eight hour period at high temperature and so if you could imagine this one large monolithic object being heated for that period of time it's going to take about ninety six mega watt hours of energy in order to cure that. Here is the carbon footprint for aluminum under a scenario where it's recycled Here's the carbon footprint under an aluminum fuselage where it's not recycled and you can see that there's an even larger C O two footprint for these carbon fiber reinforced composite materials and so it would be desirable, over the lifetime I'll say of the aircraft this is recovered, but it would be desirable to reduce that footprint substantially and get rid of these large energies that are required in manufacturing. So how might we do that and what does it look like so here is a typical investment of capital in the autoclave that Boeing uses to assemble this fuselage if you look closely that's an individual persons of this is really massive it's heated to a high degree another thing that's interesting is that the parts for all those different sections of that seven eighty seven are manufactured across the globe and the most interesting thing I think is that there is a aircraft that has been built to transport thos components to the to the site of assembly and so this is called The Dream Lifter for the Dreamliner and it is humongous that if you ever see again I should have had a picture of it but it is an amazing thing. Here's a wind turbine for a mold for a wind turbine blade and again there's an individual you can see the massive size of this is as I said it's been thirty years since there's been any disruptive change and so we clearly need faster more economical versatile low carbon footprint kinds of manufacturing for this material the life cycle begins at birth can we make it even better and I'll tell you about some exciting science and then how it's been put into technology very recently and that was the gist of that paper that I showed it involves what you see there which is known as a frontal polymerization this is a reaction wave, this is a solid polymer, this is a very low viscous water viscous monomer and you can see that transformation is moving steadily very well controlled I like to call it a controlled burn and so it's driven by the heat of the polymerization and I'll say that more about that more in just approach a moment you might wonder if you're not accustomed to doing frontal polymerization that's nice it's a small little tube it doesn't seem to be problematic could it work on a much larger scale like this fuselage and we think the answer to that is yes this is the largest one we've ever done it's not nearly as large as a fuselage but it is about two and a half leaders of this monomer and it still remains very controlled at the bottom of this there's a little tiny heating element that triggers the event and so with just ever so slight amount of energy we can execute that very well controlled frontal polymerization reaction. Now I'd like to take a moment if I can to just teach you a little bit about how that frontal polymerization takes place and I want to do this I thought about why am I putting this in the talk because what comes of the very end of the talk the future what we are really most excited about reflects an understanding of what's going on in that frontal polymerization. So if we break it up into small volume elements and put our chemicals in there there's a catalyst that's based on ruthenium and a monomer that basically releases heat and all we have to do is get this started and that propagating wave will take place we get it started by introducing some heat and that transforms that catalyst from an inactive state to an active state and there's some chemistry that goes on that's all driven by that initial very brief contact that you saw in my student even with the soldering iron touch the top of that tube to what one catalyst is activated it will trigger the chemical reaction that this monomer will transform into polymer and it does so with the release of heat and so you can think about now there's a little flame in that in that element where he is being released and it turns out that the rate at which heat is released from that reaction is going to depend on how fast that chemical reaction takes place Alpha is how much of that reagent has been consumed and if it's initially zero and at the end of that process Alpha will go to one and so what happens is we have a coupled reaction diffusion kind of equation so alpha goes to one this burning stops because of this equation the amount of heat released goes to zero but what happens in that volume element is that we've been able to heat that volume element up. Heat is transferred through the heat equation and so that all now takes place in a repetitive type fashion and so before long the entire element has driven this propagating wave to the end. Just a little bit about the chemistry that we have come across, it is chemistry that we think is robust and scalable to the dimensions of something like a fuselage it involves chemicals that are quite readily available even if they look to you to be complicated by Dicylcopentadiene comes out of the ground still is a byproduct of the oil refinery and quite frankly no one has known what to do with it for a long time and it's just been stockpiling or being transformed through chemical reactions and into other useful materials and this is a ruthenium catalysts that I spoke about it might look complicated to you if you're not a chemist but it really is a relatively simple catalyst now to make. It won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2005 that reaction releases a lot of heat. It is suitable from the standpoint of having a ball being thermoally stable chemically stable and like all composites we need a polymer matrix that's stiff and strong and so the only question that seems to always come up is well is there really that much ruthenium I'm available in the world to for example make a fuselage it's a precious metal and you might expect that there wouldn't be enough and quick calculations suggest that each airline liner and fuselage the whole set of them would require about thirteen hundred dollars worth of this ruthenium catalyst flying around for thirty years and in principle one could then recover it and recycle it and so it really doesn't become a limitation of the problem the real limitation is what shown in red that initial chemistry that neither the discovery and understanding was that the reaction was just too fast if you mix the catalyst and the monomer would instantly polymerize and there was no control you need this ability to come in and turn it on by thermal activation when you need to and this is sort of again the chemistry that was available in 2014 and it use this ligand Dimethylaminopyridine and it just did not provide the sufficient you had ten to twenty minutes to work with the speed for a transformed at room temperature into a solid That was no longer able to be manufactured in a reasonable way. We need to increase that time by a factor of a thousand in order to make a robust manufacturing process and this is where Ian made his breakthrough in discovering that other ligands besides that Dimethylaminopyridine ligand was going to be suitable and in doing so Ian made these materials that would be gels. So if you take that Dicyclopentadiene that petroleum product and now you introduce our inhibitor and our catalyst at room temperature it reacts very slowly and transforms into this gel material and this gel material in of itself is quite useful because it's now very compliant and flexible and so for example in this case Ian is rolling it up into some tube and then is going to light the fuse and sort you'll see him bring in the soldering iron just a little bit of heat and the reaction wave will begin to propagate. I sped the movie up ten times Ian's finger is starting to get hot so he decides to vacate and let the reaction continue and so in doing that now he's made this real. Very robust transform that gel into a structurally sound polymeric material and we have the ability to control where that gel time takes place prior to gelation a liquid easily like water viscosity and the rate at which that chemical reaction takes place and so here is the development of these carbon reinforced polymer composites in which we can ignite that reaction at the very begin very beginning this is our carbon fabric if you like infused with liquid monomer we can ignite it at one point and you'll see that on the next slide and the wave will propagate also on the next slide if you just pay attention to the video what you're going to see on the next slide is a thermal profile as a function of time. Blue is cold orange is going to be hot and I'm going to show you not only this configuration where we light the fuse from the left and watch it propagate through the infiltrated fabric with monomer. We're also going to uniformly light the whole base and so the wave will propagate up towards us and it will be blue and then all of a sudden it will appear orange and so that's what you're seeing in these images on the left is propagating the front and then on the right we lit it from the bottom and the wave propagated through the thickness and there was a uniform coverage. In the end what we've been able to do is make objects like this and what you see in this plot is how much energy we've consumed relative to the time and so anything here is very short to cure at a relatively low energy things like the Boeing seven eighty seven using conventional materials take a relatively long time to cure and they consume huge volumes of energy and so we have moved the needle, literally, by several orders of magnitude lower in energy because the chemical itself provides the energy that's needed there's no external energy that's going to be required and the materials that we're now producing in our lab are almost as good as what has been available from carbon from carbon reinforced apoxy based compounds and so this is a traditionally apoxy material showing both its tensile strength on the right which is the cross hatched bar and the modulus on the left which is the solid bar and so you you can see we're nine percent lower at the moment in terms of the stiffness and then how flexible that is and then the strength is about eighteen percent lower but I should say this is very much unoptimized the carbon fiber itself has been designed for apoxy materials not our hydrocarbon petroleum based products and after damage you can see the two that are shown here of our material on the right actually still is very it's very tough it's actually breaks in you know in a way that somewhat different. Last thing we've been able to do that I'll show you in terms of progress made to date is this idea that with this frontal polymerization we have the ability to print in an unusual way most 3D printing now is a layer by layer process but we've been able to use a substrate that's heated and allowed the extrusion of that liquid monomer if you watch very closely you'll see the front trailing right behind the print head and so we go from a liquid out of the print head at a controlled rate of delivery we're making a rigid object almost in real time and so at the end of this we can take liquid and transform it into a solid almost instantly and make a freestanding 3D object without a layer by layer transformation and so this is really a much different and quite revolutionary approach to a 3D printing and as you can see it's a robust structurally solid component it's really a very remarkable effort that our students have done. Here is some of the things that they've printed my favorite of course is the chemist is the printing of Dicyclopentadienein itself. And some of the other objects that have been shown so I'll conclude in the next five minutes or so and then we'll have some time for questions before the ten thirty break by telling you a little bit about the future and where we see this and let's go back to the health span curve and that very first point birth and then after birth is the development phase and right now our really approach has been a more of a conventional thinking about manufacturing and with the inspiration from what goes on in the Beckman Institute in thinking about people who are studying development and understanding that comes with that we were really inspired to think about does that heat equation coupled to a chemical reaction allow us to manufacture things in a radically different way if you just look at the picture of that show and it's one of many objects that you can find in nature that have a recurring pattern and with that pattern form and function come together and this is a dandelion seed in each of these seedlings basically looks almost identical clearly there is function built into that form and that function is to catch the wind and spread the seed and it's one example where did that come from where was nature's refinery or the casts and molds. What about the mill, where is the assembly line and obviously doesn't exist how did that form and function occur and do we have the ability to repeat that in some kind of a manufacturing process with the materials of the future be prepared much more in a fashion like growth and development as opposed to a mass manufacturing and we think the answer this question is an intriguing one and may be discovered a long time ago the mathematical biology literature describes from the paper that was written by Alan Turing around the early 1950s the chemical basis of this form and function that we see in nature morphogenesis and Turing described the idea as a symmetry breaking process that is a process that uses what he called if you read just the first two lines of his paper morphogenesis chemical entities that are diffusing through the tissue. For us we don't have a chemical in our in what I showed you the frontal polymerization we don't have a chemical entity that's diffusing we have heat that's diffusing and heat diffuses much faster than a chemical entity and so in principle we can accelerate growth if we can just learn to break symmetry and I'll give you one very crude very early example of broken symmetry this a carbon fiber and a frontal polymerization where we've added a component that couple's into the the thermal reaction in the process and undergoes the process of vaporization. And so this is a spontaneous symmetry breaking process we very much like to think about it and the health span part as the development phase of this material building in voids that might become vasculature or as I look at this I certainly begin to think about that looks like a leaf and how did that happen spontaneously it's a really intriguing really exciting area that we think will allow us to use morphogenes we want to understand what are the morphogenes in this thermal diffusion kind of manufacturing process this is the current team that has carried out the research it is a group that we meet every other week Fridays at ten AM feel free to join us any time you like it's the autonomous material systems group here at the back of an institute. All of the work that I described today was not done by the four of us or five of us in the front row but rather the cast of characters that are in the back row of the students are really wonderful students and post-docs and they really have come together in this interdisciplinary way where science and technology science and engineering has met So let me just call out my colleagues Philippe Geubelle, Paul Braun, Nancy Sottos, and Scott White who have had this longstanding productive collaboration that's led to I think a number of conceptual advances and we're beginning to put them into play but really more importantly this is our current list maybe one person's just or to have have left us but mostly what the work that I described today was done by a mix of chemistry, materials science, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, and hopefully chemical engineering covered everybody. Actually I'll point out I went through a lot of the lifecycle details fairly quickly and Evan will have a poster during our poster session with that let me end and I think we have a little bit of time for questions so I'd be happy to answer anything if you have them now or we could talk during the break thanks so much and welcome to the University of Illinois. [clapping] [clapping] Absolutely so evolution has this great limiting time and it takes so long. The half life for evolutionary changes is, our diet is a great example right how we have a very slowly we haven't adapted to the quick changes of our industrialized diets and so now I think what you're saying is let's use science to actually, I don't want to say reengineer ourselves but maybe intervene in ways that will solve some of these problems that we've encountered because evolution doesn't keep up with us. A great example where synergies now with the  with health and fundamental science what will come together. Bill. Yeah. I think many of these concepts are now carrying over into other kinds of materials I know there's a major effort in asphalt for example. It would be wonderful especially for those of us who live in an environment where our asphalt is undergoing freezing and thawing and repeatedly exposed to a mechanical environment of that expansion contraction and freezing and fine from water that seeps in there and then leads to damage it would be nice if it repaired itself and there's definitely an activity that I don't know how far it's gone but the idea of being able to apply some of these concepts beyond polymeric materials is an active area of study. The key is to have those sensors right having those sensors and the ability to communicate the info that they're there collecting which then becomes a big data problem if you're thinking about our transportation or whatnot. But. Yes yes. Absolutely, so first I'll have to give a huge credit to one of the faculty that I mentioned at the end who really drove that effort because I think especially in the early days without that involvement it really one of happened Scott White really drove that that effort into a convert to the point where it's commercialized we began with a spin off company from that technology that I showed in about 2002/2003 and we actually started at the research park just as it was opening up and so we were one of the first occupants of what is now the enterprise works and there's an autonomic materials plaque on on that wall we stayed there with venture funding for maybe eight years or six to eight years I think it was and all the while trying to convince an industry that was relatively slow to adopt new technology. That we had something quite special for them. What I mean by that is if you're going to claim that your product last longer than our product you have to prove it which of course means either accelerated aging studies or or a lot of time and accelerated aging studies look very promising but I would say most of the interesting interested parties in this technology were needing to be convinced with does it really last longer under typical application conditions. This required us to actually scale up the effort that had been going on in the research park and so autonomic materials moved off campus they're now located south of Mansfield if you know where that's at by what used to be a fertilizer company and we've outsourced a lot of the production but spent the next I would say eight years basically trying to convince companies that that indeed we have not only the ability to last as long as conventionally apoxy coatings but we have this ability to prevent what was the big problem that we were going after it was this problem of creep corrosion and the idea that is once there's a scratch on a on an interface that exposes a metal that that metal oxide will travel under the coating and ultimately debond and release it and through that eight years. Rustoleum was one company but we actually have several others that have become convinced I think you'll see this enter into the marketplace of other very high profile coding companies that are literally around not just our Eleanor based the story I'm which is an Illinois based company but that was the long process was because we were offering a material that claimed to last longer than any other commercially available material that it took an awful long time for that to play out and convince our commercial partners that this technology really was viable along the ways many of the typical problems how do we scale this up can it be scaled up what's the shelf life is it stable for how is that is it able to be applied in the traditional ways will people have to learn new ways of applying it all of these kinds of real world problems crept in and required us to work through all of those. We have a great team at AMI now south of Mansfield who are working to basically solve those real world problems it's a group of about eight or ten people out there so it's well supported well funded now and obviously even maybe generating just a little bit of money.
