 Hello. In this video, we'll be covering unsupervised learning. Unsupervised Learning usually deals with algorithms that utilize centroids. Some of these algorithms include * K-means clustering, * Hierarchical clustering, and * Density-based clustering. A real-world example of how unsupervised learning can be applied is classifying categories of music! Dimensionality Reduction and/or feature selection, play a large role in this by reducing redundant features to make classification easier. If we can apply unsupervised learning to classified music, then it's not too hard to see that we can apply something similar to create a program that can convert speech to text! For instance, by looking at the amplitude, breaks, and frequency in the sound wave, the machine can estimate what word has been spoken, and then convert it into text. We can also use unsupervised learning for image processing. There are several ways that something like this can work, one of which is mapping the color of a pixel to a data point on a plot. As an example of how this might work, let's presume that the computer was given a bunch of images, and we wanted to classify or name the image without a person doing the work. So, if the computer was given the picture of this cow, it may be able to decompose it to these data points and be able to tell that the image is, in fact, a cow. Thanks for watching!
