 Hello my name is Arash Beldachi. I'm a Senior Research Associate at High Performance Networks Research Group,  at the Smart Internet Lab, University of Bristol. In this demo I will present you a 5G Programmable Node. We use Time Shared Optical Network technology to build the 5G programmable node. Time Shared Optical Network technology is initiated and implemented by the High Performance Networks Research Group. We use this technology to support a varying degree of bandwidth and latency requirements.Time Shared Optical Network technology is a multi-wavelength fully bi-directional synchronous and flexible system. This solution includes two different types of nodes, the edge nodes and core nodes. Time Shared Optical network edge nodes provide the interfaces between different technologies, such as LTE, PON, Wi-Fi,  Li-Fi domains to the optical domain and vice versa. The extended Time Shared Optical Network technology not only handles Ethernet frames but also supports LTE traffic. The ingress Time Shared Optical Network edge nodes are responsible for traffic aggregation and mapping, while the egress edge nodes have the reverse functionality. Time Shared Optical Network core nodes do not carry out any data processing, but need to switch the traffic optically based on the client's requirements. The parameters of the Time Shared Optical Network nodes are programmable by the Software Defined Network controller. For example, Quality of Transmission overhead programmable, time-slice size programmable, time-slice numbers in a frame programmable and time-slice allocation. When the operators or service providers request to set up a network service, the Time Shared Optical Network nodes choose the corresponding parameters to fulfil such requests to compose a dedicated network function slice on the node. As a test scenario for this demo, I'm using an FPGA as an edge node and a traffic analyser. The traffic analyser generates traffic which is 9.2 gigabit per second for this test and passes it to the FPGA. Then the FPGA converges the incoming traffic to the optical domain after traffic aggregation and mapping. In the optical domain, I pass the traffic to 8km fibre and loop it back to the FPGA. The FPGA receives the traffic and passes it to the traffic analyser after segregation. This technology is an essential component of 5G.
