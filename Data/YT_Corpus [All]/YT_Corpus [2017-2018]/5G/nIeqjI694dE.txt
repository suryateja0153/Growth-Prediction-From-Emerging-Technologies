 the future of mobile communications is likely to be very different to that which we are used to today and every consumer and every industry will be affected by the capabilities of 5g [Music] network speeds of far more than 10 gigabits per second of virtual zero latency and also reliability are driving forces for a new generation of applications in April 2015 nokia showed 10 gigabit speed with the millimeter-wave proof-of-concept system today we are pushing the limits of Technology with Nokia five teens centimeter wave proof-of-concept live over the area we put the main focus centimeter wave concept to carrier frequencies between three and thirty gigahertz that is wavelengths between one and ten centimeters this is the expected frequency range where 5g products will be deployed first globally nokia's CM wave proof-of-concept system is versatile enabling in future to adapt to multiple different carrier frequencies and antenna types in our demonstration today we show live over the air 19 gigabits per second downlink peak data rate at 15 gigahertz carrier frequency this is an OFDM a based DVD system with 4 x 100 megahertz component carriers we have eight by eight mile enabling eight independent data streams sent between BTS and the ue finally we have 256 QAM modulation enabling sending of eight bits of information for modulation symbol this 19 gigabits per second demo is our first public step in centimeter wave build measure learn cycle to bring 5 gene for people and things everywhere
