 well things like 4G networks haven't been around for all that long but soon it will be all about 5g and there's something beyond pure speed to get excited about so when we're talking about how fast 5g will be it'll be about 10 times faster than 4G when it's at its like peak which is almost never if you have a regular cell right you notice that so it'll be faster than faster we have a 4G so by contrast 5 G's to be more reliably fast as well so you know sometimes your cell phone will slow down in those crowded areas like city centers and stadiums they say that with 5g you shouldn't have any problems staying connected should also accelerate new technologies like augmented reality helps self-driving cars and link everything from pollution sensors to health monitors so the technology goes beyond just what you know most of us honestly will care about on a day to day basis and that's how fast can I pull up Jason to Russia's Twitter supposed to go out in 2020 and now it's 2019 yeah even faster than I think people were expecting I know and I'm probably the really annoying consumer here but I feel like this should have happened two years ago I'm just mad grown so impatient with my cell phone speed you know and 6g already oh gosh I wish but you know I mean we how frustrating is it though whenever you go into a stadium or whatever and you can't access your Facebook or we can't post your picture it just feels like we've reached a time now where we should be able to do that and also I mean I have an unlimited data plan but I had to switch to it because for that short period when I didn't have it it was so annoying when you're watching a YouTube that you get charged like an extra $10 because you've reached your limit we have moved past this we are ready for 5g I say 2019 can't come soon enough very passionate I'm very well I mean Kim is right in that the United States the wireless speeds that we have here do lag much of the rest of the world what's exciting about 5g is that your home devices which right now think of how much stuff we have hooked up to the Internet is now your home devices could be hooked up using 5g wireless technology now you're gonna need new Wi-Fi routers you're gonna need new devices all of your stuff is now obsolete sorry it goes with but this whole system could be really a game changer especially when you think about medical yeah you think about rural areas where they don't have great Internet service they maybe don't have great access to health care the kind of teleconferencing and the fact that you could have that is pretty exciting well and so the waves that we hadn't have right now they kind of struggle with obstacles so you think about you know your little phone is sending some now it hits you know a tree has to bounce around it so this is going to kind of fill in those gaps and it won't have that anymore yeah when you think about like where the future is going with these self-driving cars they're gonna rely on your cell phone in your car then communicating with this with the stoplights and you cannot have a slow signal during those moments you can't have a drop signal so that technology needs to be there for that happen I'm just getting excited for self-driving cars those can't come soon enough you guys are ready for these two years ago
