 Most of the internet and traffic maybe 90% of the content actually using tcp/ip protocol. So this is a very fundamental protocol because of we're proposing 5G and the next generation cellular network. Because of the challenges contained in this new spectrum to be using a cellular space a lot of work has been done by them in my wireless over the millimeter-wave channel understanding the millimeter wave propagation and the physical aspects related to millimeter wave how will traditional protocols will react to this type of new scenario of new links and therefore this generated first insight on how we should better design the network the higher layer to cope with the millimeter wave issues one of the key projects related to cellular system design that has been working on is if the development of the first of its kind open sirs and to end system simulator for 5g millimeter wave network on the one hand we detect problems that were unknown before and that we can propose solutions implement solutions and test our solutions on the on the spot for our students the ability to get up to speed with simulations in the millimeter way space would give them great amount of opportunities which is exactly what is happening now because we had trying to develop a new technology nobody knows anything about this we are still developing with studious covering new things I feel like I am trying to get something working and this you cannot benefit the world and because I'm also excited about this technology and are very fast and I now I become more and more independent I have my own thoughts I have I now I develop more and more questions one more shoes i discovered more problem to solve initially we were driving them we were giving them the inputs now they are giving us input they are detecting the problems and they are proposing the solution so this proactivity is key for me this is giving us opportunity to grow faster because of their enthusiasm and that's what my your Wireless taught me I feel like I'm very passionate it I never feel what I feel I'm working on something interesting and useful I want to keep doing that
