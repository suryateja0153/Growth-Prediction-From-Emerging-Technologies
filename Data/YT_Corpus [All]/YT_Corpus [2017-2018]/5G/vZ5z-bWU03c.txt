  Verizon claims first 5G service available next year, but don’t get too excited Verizon has announced that it will use 5G technology to deliver residential broadband internet in “three to five US markets” by 2018. The rollout should begin in Sacramento, California, in the second half of 2018. The focus on residential broadband means you aren’t looking at the successor to LTE mobile internet that we’ve heard so much about recently. Instead, Verizon will be using millimeter-wave spectrum as an alternative to running a physical cable into customer’s homes.
