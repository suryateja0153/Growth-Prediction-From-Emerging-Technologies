 necessity is the mother of all invention the same implies for the need for something better or to say more advanced in mobile communication the growing need professed and more than communications as the driving force behind the state-of-the-art mobile technology but that being said and just a matter of a few more years here of the digital world president Newland approved by G mobile technology but what is this my G you're smart about and how does it go out by together the solution is in the making and currently process but what we do know is that the dawn of this latest technology is and we'll mark the revolution in the way we live forever before that lens to take a journey back to memory lane and cellular technology the evolution of cellular technology began apartment G also known as the first generation of mobile communication analog signals are used as a form of radio signals to communicate or mobile devices such as the telephone these signals are sent to the radio and then to the receiving end of one data capacity with one g is only two kilobits % then comes the send generation of mobile technology which integrates the SMS or a short message of services in mobile devices the signal and mobile calls are emitted form of digital signal no longer an analog data capacity for this mobile technology is increased to 10 kilobytes percent after that the age of Internet advisors begins with the help of third generation mobile technology users are able to watch their favorite movies favorite people globally without decline with 3G data capacity reaches up to 384 kilobits per second on its mobile technology predecessors due to certain switching 3G is the first generation from that use the package switching and circuit switching with the existence of the current fourth generation we are able to reach greater height and Internet connectivity speed mainly an upgrade in the digital world would speed up to 10 times faster than 3G information assist within a matter of seconds but there's more and more devices are connected to the Internet soon even the 4th generation network will be crowded a solution to be made communications has evolved so has plane and rapidly with a contemporary fourth-generation is to provide with the potential to supply for the up-and-coming Internet connected devices bus IG is the solution to bits this fifth-generation and mobile wireless technologies built upon the existing LTE networks as in now the mobile technologies predecessors have witnessed substantial increase in peak but read however IG has a daily bitrate up to ten times as per the porgy ing is expected to bring the frequency bed and wider spectral bandwidth the frequency channel with the potential of 5g networks Internet of Things devices such as automated our smart phone and smart city in the near future can be supported tremendously how can this be achieved well researchers have shown that there are five technologies that lay the foundation to the birth of this cutting-edge mobile technology the first technology is millimeter waves these waves operate at the range of 30 to 300 gigahertz in the radio frequency spectrum with millimeter waves more internet capable devices can't be on gated with more bandwidth for everyone on the downside signals transmitted from one divisor on co2 travel fire and weakens when traveling through obstacles such as well this is overcome by using small cell internet network signals are broadcast by power cell towers that can span over long distance with the use of small cell towers that are located closely together millimeter wave signals can be broadcasted and relayed by these nearby cell towers without weakening the strength of the signal however these small cell towers are not capable of handling the network breath with more devices on the network sending and receiving data but it work and holy would shed so much before it becomes a real traffic massively more massive multiple-input multiple-output is a technology that gives us a significant number of antennas that transmit and receive signals embedded in the small cell towers the handle is therefore smooth in the flow of data threaded where data is being sent over the network fine G also comes with the technology beam for as broadcasted signal and strands memory directly it will inevitably induce interference in the same bus with beamforming technology these cell towers are able to steer the signals directly back the attentive device without any loss in the signal strength last but not least radio waves tend to travel both forward and backward at the same frequency bet this will cause interference hence with full duplex technology different signals will Traverse at different frequency earth when transmitting and receive fine G fully utilizes package switching or data are broken at the smaller campus known as Pakistan sent across the network this is considered simpler and cost-efficient compared to circuit switching fine G uses the modulation technique known as CDMA and OFDM CDMA stands for code division multiple access it refers to a form of multiplexing which allows numerous signals to occupy a single transmission channel optimizing the use of available bed OFDM known as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing format that is based on digital multi carrier modulation method a large number of closely spaced orthogonal subcarrier signals are used to carry data several parallel data screens or channels single data stream is split across several separate narrower back channels at different frequencies from reduced interference and post op 5g will also a death ipv6 instead of ipv4 where the former utilizes 128-bit internet 10 versus compared to 32 bit of a lot as the address space if ipv4 is nearly exhausted ipv6 also may produces the neighbor discovery protocol tables multi-protocol interoperability between the OG devices so both the number of interests hammers is an ipv6 and the features of the protocol will be critical to the success of fight P the protocol stack of by G is Matt with the OSI stack in the following first would be the Oh W layer which is the short-form of open Wireless architect relay it functions as physical layer and data link layer pub as done that next up would be the network layer it is used data from source might be device to the destination might be divided sources it is divided into lower and upper Network lay the open transport layer top box functionality at both transport layer in session layer OSI layer application layer marks the data as per proper food that required in also is encryption and decryption of the data it selects the best wireless connection through get inserted now we're done talking about fine G let's move on to smartphone smart home is the automation process to manage and control premises environment with technological filaments or qubits that are unable to communicate consent from you or gateway through one control entity software panel where management interface and cellular would object at the simplify life and improve efficiency the devices can be controlled remotely from anywhere being assigned to other side of the world on an Asian wind for different stages starting with central machine or gate white and throwing the unit then the introduction of artificial intelligence units that support any other center humans and the introduction of smart robots which could be delegated to perform attack some of the smart home devices in that ear cube by home smart plug and Phillips Hill wide LED start the common communication protocols used by smart home devices at compact n which is used in remote controlling six level 10 which is a combination of ipv6 and low-power wireless personal area network include with LP which is globe are looted other protocols that are used as well because they z-wave and RS 485 all of this protocol to use on low energy radio please Finnick some appliances for appliances allowing for wireless control with residential appliances is lighting control security systems and many other systems which form smart bubbles there are many alliances which is made available for consumers for example we might have see some places which use function sensors in their lighting which protects human presence and turns the lights on and off accordingly other examples include documents with that voice commands as a control security and surveillance systems which allows us to do and control the camera when we are out of home smart curtains that use trackers and sensors to detect sunlight the main purpose of smart Paul mr. midlife north can be and to reduce human effort for example having a smart thermostat reduce our consumption because it automatically controls the temperature of the room accordingly at the same time also reduce our effort to control the temperature in a minute this is implemented throughout the house so if there is no one in the room air conditioner for example automatically turns off several other benefits of having a smart home art it makes a better place for disabled and elderly people this is because they might have a better capability for movement so it might be hard for them to do things the court will take instead they can use a tablet to control their home devices so how does a fifth generation of mobile technology in the smart home IG make smartphone more effective as that it's a data transfer rate and low latency which makes data communication more seamless and smooth both I call immediate delivery of smartphone applications represent from you spaces per 5g that's wireless access my only technology is dependent on the interconnectedness of multiple devices on one platform and 5g technology provides Desna right base truth success imagine getting notification from smartphone cameras on your phone when a package is delivered to your doorstep thoughts precisely the kind of thing I OT and by a technology together can achieve by G IOT devices we'll use an era bandwidth to support thousands of things for silver devised offered for long battery life and provide coverage and challenge in the areas of soaring home systems have reached commercial maturity with the appearance of art appliances on the market the revolution is expected to create schoolhouse Y ecosystems in which appliances from different vendors and applications created by different developers interoperate team lessly although availability of connected appliances using standard interfaces and protocol is already in production supporting local applications that the graph proximity of smart objects is still working progress in the near future Bhaiji will open up many possibilities for IOT devices it Marco
