 hey everyone thanks for joining me here today on Tesla nama Clive I'm Ben sullens I'm your host and I'm gonna be recapping the biggest Tesla related news from the past week also have a few announcements for you and some other cool stuff that I got to see this past week that I just think is cool and I want to share first and foremost I want to you know just say I hope everyone pays remembrance today about September 11th 2001 a day that has changed all of our worlds dramatically and to all those that were lost and everyone just you know give your thoughts and prayers to all those people and hope that we never seen anything like that again and also to those that are still in the midst of dealing with hurricane Irma and those that are recovering from hurricane Harvey if you guys please can donate to whatever charity I know the Red Cross is doing a big thing but I don't want to push anyone particular but so first and foremost those things be a good person do the right thing if you have the resources in can so please please please do that next I want to talk about the referral program we're getting up there we're at officially 36% towards a towards a free roadster which I'm still shocked I don't know how this is gonna work but it looks like we may get there if you or anyone you know is looking to buy a Tesla Model S or X please share our link with them Tesla nama Co /td it's crazy enough on the 9th which was Saturday five people used it and I think they were all in Europe so that's so cool to see that not only is it helping us you know with some cool stuff that we'll be able to then share with you but it's also helping you get a thousand bucks off and free super charging so if you were anyone you know please share the link do those things and and yeah we'll have fun and see how far we can really push this transition to sustainable energy I want to see if we hit that 50 limit which is kind of what it's at now if Tesla will let us keep going or if they'll kind of put put up with a limit there I think it's in their best interest to let's let it let it ride so we'll see also if you're not um if you're watching this after the fact you're confused because it's like an hour-long video just know that essentially what I do is I'll have a bunch of different stories I cover here and I will put a comment in the comment to this video and you can find all those different stories and just jump straight to that section so you don't watch the whole thing if you don't want to which I can't imagine why you wouldn't want to but fine I get it sometimes that's just how it is so from here I want to jump over and share something that I found which was super cool this past weekend at the national drive electric week we had an event here in San Diego and the event the event had sponsors I had people that were coming in and showing off cars there and I'm gonna do a whole video on it I took my son down there thanks to everyone that stopped by and said hello I had about five people you know say they watched the channel and I'm always open for chatting with people whenever you know whenever you see me out and about so please never hesitate to stop me and say hello if we if we come come across each other's paths so the thing I want to share though was about this company called Evie match and you can find them at Evie match.com to be clear they are not a sponsor but I think it's something cool that I wanted to share with you in the event that you can find this useful so I kind of think of it like Airbnb for charging and the idea here is if you're someone like me who has an e V charging station at their home you can put it on there and then people can come use it and then they pay for that you make a couple bucks I don't think you can set what the rate is but more importantly if you're a new Evie owner or a potential new Evie owner like say a model 3 owner and you don't live in a place where you can charge whether it be an apartment complex or a condo unit where you can't get one installed whatever the case may be you can use this app to go find places to charge and there's quite a few of them it's growing and it's a new startup out of California that is helping the Evie community grow so I think you should support them you can see you know that there are all these different locations let me see if I can zoom out you can see these are just the San Diego ones here there's my zoom they always hide it so you can kind of see there San Diego there's there's Orange County there's LA so it's growing pretty rapidly and this is really good news you know so I wanted to share because I get a lot of questions from people about hey you know what am I gonna do once I get my model 3 and I can't charge and I you know so you have a couple options super charges of course which you'll have to pay for but will be probably the most efficient way to charge but maybe way outside of town way out of the way this is another option for you that's there so check that out Evy match.com I think that's a pretty cool thing for you alright so next I want to talk about a rumor that I have and the rumor is now I've got rumors before and so I'm gonna be a little bit cautious here and in in calling instead of calling this like a a leak or or any kind of you know official statement from from anyone what what it is is that Intel will be the provider of the chips for the model 3 actually for all all Tesla's in the future to give them Feige 5g connectivity and I'll read to you the the tip that I got it says that Tesla has launched with Intel's X mmm 72 72 based cat 5 l2 caps are cat 6 LTE telematics solution Tesla plans to scale the model 3 globally which mean they're which means there is still work to do for additional operator certs of the X mm 72 72 platform in China and Korea the X mm 72 72 now also has good chance to expand into additional Tesla car models through 2018 further the Intel team is also working to win Tesla's next-generation telematics platform using the X mm 7 6 6 2 + 5 g note Intel is all in on 5g and that's the post I'm showing you here on the page partnering with Tesla has been an interesting journey as a new disruptive automotive manufacturer Tesla does things differently the most of the auto industry we all know that already instead of relying on traditional third-party life electronics system suppliers aka tier ones Tesla managed the details of this design integration direct this required Intel to work very closely with the module partner tell it as well as Tesla directly and bring deep as well as Tesla directly and bring deep tech technical expertise innovation and flexibility to make this project a success this engagement with Tesla has helped Intel learn a lot about bringing their cellular connectivity technologies to the auto market with this achievement Intel's recognized as a legitimate player in the telematics segment which has otherwise been dominated by Qualcomm San Diego company these learnings and a market recognitions given until the opportunity to compete with with nearly every new automotive telematics RFQ across the world across a worldwide set of automotive manufacturers BMW GM and many others are now in sight and the team teams continue to work tirelessly in pursuit of these new automotive customers so a couple things what this means it means that Intel will be the provider is kind of what I'm gathering here and that that's all about 5g and the reason all that matters is because in order to do self-driving cars you need some serious horsepower in in the in the car itself which we know a little bit about that then you have to have a ton of data which they've been collecting and have been doing you know really good things are in terms of the amount of data that they're getting should be second to none maybe Google is close to them and then the third thing is they need a really strong internet connection to process these kind of things and so it sounds like that's what's gonna be happening here I don't know if this is already included in the model 3 or if this would be something that that comes later I didn't get all that info but there it is I'm chalking it up as a rumor I don't know I haven't seen any official word on this but it is something that a little bird told me that is close to Tesla so there we go there's that so the next thing I want to talk about is something that just came out today which is the exact reason why I do live shows is because things with Tesla change so fast let me zoom in a little bit so you can read this so Tesla is is installing these new superchargers that are smaller and footprint you can see an image of one here I'll read a little bit about of this for you so it says supercharger stations in urban areas will be installed in convenient locations including supermarkets shopping centers and downtown districts so it's easy for customers to charge their car in the time it takes go to grocery shop or run errands they also have the same pricing as our existing superchargers which is far cheaper than the cost of gasoline yet another not to either get a new from inventory Model S or X which will likely come with free super charging or a used Model S or X which will have unlimited super charging as well because if these start popping up everywhere it's gonna become more and more common that you do use them and so so that's a pretty good option for everyone especially model 3 people superchargers inner bear in urban areas have a new post design you can see there that occupies less space and is easier to install making them ideal for dense highly populated areas to increase efficiency and support a high volume of cars these superchargers have a new architecture that delivers our rapid 72 kilowatts of dedicated power to each car this means that charging speeds are unaffected by tells of vehicles plugging into adjacent superchargers and results in consistent charging times around 45 to 50 minutes so the note about their if you're unfamiliar with how this works a supercharger essentially there's an A and a B unit and they're connected to kind of the same infrastructure and then if two people are using it at the same time the speed at which it's going to charge the kilowatts that when you see 72 kilowatts that's what that means in the speed it will be reduced and so that's because I guess the infrastructure can't support it or whatever this is interesting because not only is it slimmer smaller you know more more efficient for highly densely populated areas but it also will have a dedicated 72 kilowatts which means you won't have that variability anymore which is great I'm super excited about this I can't wait to see one I know I rarely use super charging and I think that's the case for most people they rarely use super charging but if these start popping up everywhere will in convenient locations really that's why most people don't use them is because they're far out of the way now in certain areas like la I know has a few that are at malls and things like that so it's it's common there but a lot of other parts of the country in the US anyways it's not like that the super chargers are out in the middle of nowhere hundreds of miles from anything else so you really don't use them that often so this is cool I'm excited about this I think that this is a big step forward when it comes to helping the model three folks you know deal with with with what's gonna happen with you know hundreds and hundreds of new or thousands of new people on the road potentially wanting to use superchargers okay next I want to talk about something that I'm pretty excited about and this is my new course so if you don't know I make data science courses I've been doing it for the courses anyway it's about five years and I've been actually a data scientist or working in the data science field for almost twenty almost you know half my life now and I you know I turn to online coursework a few years ago as a way to share what I know and to help people promoted Vance in their careers this course is a little bit different and it's inspired by you guys and so what I'm looking for here is your feedback now the premise of the course is that using data to communicate something whether it be a pitch a sales pitch you're giving and you're giving a presentation or whether it be you're trying to get funding for a project at work whatever the case may be I'm very curious and I want to help you do that I want to help you learn how to use data effectively in your presence in your presentations so that you can communicate more clearly and have a more impactful message and if you think about it that's essentially all we do here on this channel you know we happen to talk about Tesla but what it really comes down to is looking at the world through this lens of data and trying to make it into digestible stories and that's essentially what all of our videos are right I either find my own data or someone on my team I have a couple people that help me research things we find some data out there and we either do the analysis ourselves or we comment on analysis that other people have done often you'll see us share things from from Bloomberg or from from other places like that like quartz anyways I want to give you these same powers I want to help you use data to be more effective in sharing your message when you give presentations so please do me a favor and go to Tesla Mexico slash c1 and we'll probably will show you this survey it takes a couple minutes or there are a few questions there but it's all it should be it should be pretty quick and you should be able to fly it through it and it really helps me out and at the end there's opportunity if you'd like to to get a free preview of the first section of the course so I'm not collecting your email info or anything like that directly in this forum unless you give it to me at the end and you say hey yes I would like a free preview of the first chapter which I almost have done so still early stages I have an outline and I have some parts of this I already put together so please you know if you're interested in this kind of thing give me a hand go mm I'm excited take the survey and I can't wait to hear and see your feedback and then stay tuned for updates in the future about that course and how it comes out this is the first one I'm releasing on my own not with Pluralsight not with LinkedIn not with any other platform out there but on my own so just for you guys and I want to make it as valuable as possible so thank you thank you in advance okay next I want to talk about my long for the week and the long is the thing that I like so if you you know if you follow the markets in the economy you hear people talk about you know being long on something or being short on something that's what I'm talking about here so my long is the thing I like and it is about this thing right here this this I don't know if you want to call this a great thing that Tesla did they issued a software update to give people extra route extra battery capacity to flee hurricane Irma so I'll read a little bit and this is from Tesla Roddy it says Tesla has issued a surprise over-the-air update software update to the Model S an X 60 and 60 D owners living within Florida's hurricane irma evacuation zone the Model S in acts 60 vehicles with a 75 kilowatt hour battery pack that were previously software limited to 210 miles of driving range per single charge were automatically upgraded to 249 miles and given temporary access to the full range capacity of the battery so that's awesome this is part of the power of Tesla and part of why other companies do not and still I argue that the cars themselves aren't even the things that will drive or that will really keep people engaged with Tesla it's the fact that it's a platform and here is a great example of how that platform can save people's lives and really change the world completely over the air and it's something that Tesla didn't have to do you know there wouldn't have been any any major negative news if they hadn't done this but this is a great thing and I hope some people were able to benefit from this as well as you know it's a great PR move for Tesla so this to me doesn't just about you know getting good juju with the media it's about showcasing the power of Tesla as a platform instead of just a vehicle so yeah kudos to you guys for doing such such an awesome thing here for all those folks and I hope everyone that num has been affected by it is safe and all that I haven't seen the latest updates as of this morning I was heads down doing research here so there you go next I want to talk about my short and so the opposite of my long is my short the thing I don't like and it's basically Mazda doubling down on on fossil fuels it's pretty crazy that that they still I mean literally every automaker in the world is is racing to try to compete with Tesla and come up with electric cars and all these things and we'll talk about some of those here in a minute but it's crazy to me that Mazda a company that actually I think has a great design philosophy and makes beautiful cars in fact you know the lead designer for Tesla used to be one of the one of the I think chief designers or if not the chief designer at Mazda and so you know here's a company that I think has a great product and an opportunity to really really do something special but they're just losing it so they put out this report and and they have all these quotes on Jalopnik here which is kind of a garbage website which is just you know trash talking and all that they play it kind of in the controversial space which it's the media it's garbage anyways but they have the same old kind of plate argument out that v's aren't really better for the environment and that we shouldn't really be thinking about going TVs we should just be making the combined in turn will combust an engine better and here's here's a Grahame explaining that now I've done and I talked about this extensively that the whole point is to switch over to the the power generation in the grid versus the oil refinery to turn it into gasoline because that is how as the grid gets cleaner it'll have a network effect and really make a big dent now the thing it doesn't take into account in this diagram or the report or the percentage of people that also have solar and so you think about that this whole thing is totally jacked up and you know if you think about places like California where I live where we have a bazillion people we have like what is it 40 million people or something like that we have also had the most EVs out of any state by a mile and the most solar so if you think about this whole thing now if they're talking at a global scale it's a different thing but when I think about this in the US I think this is a completely played argument that's been debunked a dozens of times by lots of different folks far better and far more knowledgeable than I but anyways I'm shocked by this and I can't I can't see how this will play well with anybody honestly it was really surprising for me to see it not surprising that Jalopnik wrote about it because like I said they're pretty much a garbage publication so yeah they're then you have that next I want to talk about something a little bit better and this is the new Nissan Leaf I have a few notes here man instead you know if you go to the Nissan website you can see all this stuff some of the highlights hundred and fifty miles range has instant torque which we know because the same as the electric powertrain and 147 horsepower which is what like a Honda Civic may be and yeah they have some some interesting stuff here you know they have a video which highlights a lot of these things I'll just I'll just quickly run through them and then we can skip on I'll show you some footage I got I think it looks a lot better I think the car itself looks less like an Eevee and more like a regular car so kudos on that they have the one peddle driving which we are all Tesla owners are familiar with basically regenerative braking when you let go of the gas slows down to the point where it's almost a stop it has instant acceleration they have a new thing which is a kind of like a wannabe all pilot called pro pilot assist which is great that it's you know coming they do have a 362 362 camera which shows you the all the way around the car which I'm totally jealous of and I think that's probably the coolest new feature they now have an app you can start the car you can cool it down you can do those kind of things but the big thing to me that's a shock is that it only goes 150 miles I do not understand how you can how you can sleep at night as a car company that's releasing an e V that doesn't even go 200 miles I just you're not even you're not even in the ball park anymore you're still competing against the first generation leaf honestly to me it's absurd I mean yeah it's a better looking and has a lot of other features to it but the fact that you don't go 200 miles you still have that range anxiety issue and you're still just going to be dealing with the niche enthusiast so the fact that they talk about you know we're the leader and all in this and you know they have some big vanity metrics to talk about that nobody's gonna envy this car unlike Tesla where every other auto manufacturer is basically an envy of what Tesla has been able to do which is to make a beautiful amazing car that happens to be an e V this is still a Navy that wants to be a cool car it's kind of the opposite and I'm really bummed by this but I do think it'll sell well and I know that they've partnered with different municipalities to offer insane incentives on this so I think it'll be fine but it's still disappointing in in my book and let me show you the footage I got of this from with President Lee and using the poll blog from from the event there you go and and with that yeah they had it on display they're giving away free popsicles and helping keep people cool which I really appreciate and I do love what they're doing I just wish it would I don't know why the the battery is still a 40 kilowatt hour battery pack and so that's probably my biggest point of confusion is how they didn't update that yeah so here you go I mean I would get it probably especially considering the price it ranges from 29,000 the 36,000 so it's pretty good when it comes to the overall price especially compared to some of the other cars out there like the Chevy Volt and the model 3 but still really really shocked it doesn't go so I guess I'm kind of ok on it you know I'm not I'm not super excited about it there's my son with his popsicle from Nissan thank you guys but at the same time I think they had a great opportunity to really dominate a market and and they didn't quite capture that opportunity so I would have loved to see them do more I do think that they're doing good things and that this is going to bode well for them but in the end you know hey more EVs on the road is helping us make that switch to the sustainable form of Transportation so there you have it and I think I got a shot of the front here I'll wait see if we get that far it's pretty hard to film with a toddler basically attached to me yep no franck yep big ol engine don't get it I don't understand why they don't use the same kind of layout that Tesla does but anyways and the charge board is kind of hidden underneath that little little compartment there which is pretty pretty monstrous so ok let's move on next I want to talk about self-driving in the United States and this is pretty cool the US House unanimously approves a sweeping self-driving car measure this could be great our government is notoriously bad at making things happen though so I'm a little worried about it the basic gist of it is that instead of different states putting in their own laws the federal government is gonna set a law for this and then that way it'll be companies that want to do self-driving cars it'll be the same in every state otherwise you could have really weird things where like you know let's say we were had an autonomous semi semi truck and it was driving from Nevada to Arizona but as it crossed the state line a person has to hop in because Arizona doesn't approve the law so it helps streamline things hopefully again our government isn't really known for its effectiveness so yeah we'll see how that goes next I want to talk about the model 3 calculator so yeah more self-promotion sorry but thank you to everyone that used this I hope you liked it this is the one that shows you all the details down to exactly how much you'll pay and taxes and fees and all that you can see it if you go to Tesla know Mexico slash Model 3 cost too or just click on the link on top model 3 cost if you haven't seen this yet I would go check it out you know I spent a lot of time on it and so far we've got over 85,000 people that have used it and this came out last Wednesday so getting close to 100,000 mark before the end of the week and of course one of the cool things about this is that every time somebody uses it aye aye cap sure all the selections and so I'm going to be able to use that data to then do more stories and talk about what people are gonna pay and what features are the most popular so by using it you're actually helping me understand more about what you know options people are gonna choose and what the cost is gonna be so share it with everyone you know send me questions on the video I did for that if you have bugs or anything leave a comment there are a lot of comments on there I haven't had time to go through all of them but but I will go through them and I will keep updating this especially for example like as we get details about autopilot I'm sorry all wheel drive and other things from Tesla about the three so go check that out and thanks to everyone that has helped to kind of make it such a huge success already next we're gonna run through these next ones pretty quick and then we'll get straight to Q&A I'm beyond BMW redesigns the i3 to compete with Tesla okay just make them just make the 3-series on an Eevee ready I don't know why you got to make this boxy goofy-looking thing and try to like make it look better just scrap this crap design and use the three series it's an amazing beautiful classic car anyways there you go there's my rant on that next China is looking they're doing a study to see about a fossil fuel deadline for the electric cars so they're working on a timetable to ban to ban fossil fuels in cars and this is also the UK and France are doing something like this and it's pretty amazing that a that China would be doing this so I think this is gonna be huge if it happen if and when it happens China really is the leader in Eevee sales as well as now renewables in their push to to combat climate change so not that the US was even ever in that conversation maybe when Obama was president you know there was a focus on it but certainly not anymore so there you go so this is kind of exciting lastly I want to talk about stuff that's coming up later this week and then I will get over to QA later this week I will be sharing on Wednesday how Tesla is gonna win at self-driving and I actually interviewed a guy who is a doctor of computer vision asatyam Malek and he has courses on this he is an artificial intelligence expert I got to sit down with him for an hour and got some really great insight so I'm gonna share this with you on Wednesday about how Tesla's gonna win at the self-driving market and then on Friday I'm gonna have kind of the more fun video this one is going to be how tell anomic Scott started my background and all those kind of things so those of you that are new here and those that actually I don't think I've ever shared it here so you'll get to learn a little bit about me and how we got started so that way I guess when you hear me say things or make claims you have a bit of a sense of where they came from and you know how I think about things so hopefully hopefully that's that's a that's enjoyable for you on a Friday okay next let's move to QA and if you'd like to ask me questions you need to get on the email list at Tesla echo or become a patreon supporter at patreon.com slash Tesla nom --ax where I take those questions first and then I take the email questions now so yeah go do that and then I'll run through about ten of these each week and then sometimes I just reply directly and sometimes I group them together so I think today I got about 70 to 80 questions submitted and I only have time for about ten so yeah I'm sorry to those that I wasn't able to answer your questions but just please feel free to keep asking keep asking you tweet all right so let me switch you over first and foremost Craig asks I wonder if the grid is down for a month the power to pump gas is less than the power to charge a Tesla on a generator so this is thinking about the Hurricanes and those kind of things you know assuming that you're not underwater what would be better well Tesla did a great ad campaign about this during the solar eclipse with the power wall and so I think the answer here and you know part of the reason that I love what Tesla's doing and I and their whole complete package is because of this kind of a thing so I have solar panels on my house didn't get a solar roof that still weighs out I have a couple power walls on order hoping that they'll be delivered and installed soon and then I have one Evie and then I'll have two V's so assuming that you know the grid is down let's say as long as the sun is shining or even partly shining which it almost always is that with the batteries I'll be able to have a house that runs and have transportation that's part of the freedom that this whole platform gives you and that's why people like me are even more excited about things like Tesla energy instead of just just the cars themselves and why also I think it's a platform and not just one specific product thanks for the question Jeffrey asked what was the first thing you did to celebrate taking Villere picking up my Model S in an hour so thank you again for the referral code Jeffery I'm so excited that you're getting it I saw that you had some issues kind of ordering and I'm happy that you're actually taking delivery finally so congrats I think what ideas I took a drive up the coast I live here in San Diego we've got some beautiful beaches and coastline and so yeah I just went out went out on a drive and had a blast it sent me a pic also I'd love to see how it goes Lars asks hi Ben I wonder any chance of Tesla may upgrade batteries in the Model S to 90 120 it seems as if they somehow have to differentiate with model s in the model 3 unless 90% will be the model 3 so I do believe that this is coming you keep seeing things like them lower the price on some of the higher ones I do believe this is gonna happen I don't know when and I don't really have any details so chalk it up as speculation if you like but I would say all signs point to yes if I had my magic 8-ball Rosco asks if a tez owner cannot reach an available supercharger will Tesla for a nominal charge in this emergency adjust onboard software is said vehicle to extend range near a charging station no they will not or they haven't yet to date and there are people that have actually run out of run out of charging space but they do have roadside assistance and they will tow you to supercharger so you're not kind of stuck out there so yeah there is an answer here but it's not to extend the range because the thing about it if you when they extend it just to be clear about how it works they're just allowing you to store more energy in it it's not that you're actually somehow magically giving you electricity so if you're out you know if your battery's about to die them extending the possible range that the battery can hold won't make a difference so yeah no that doesn't make sense that won't happen Wendell asks I know that the first release of the model 3s were to employees have any been released to the general public yet I do not believe so a few employees have taken delivery a few of you have emailed me so thanks for giving me all the info and the update and also I think a few people have posted some videos online so yeah none to the public yet but I know a few employees have Joe asks realistically how much will I pay for a used Model S that has free charging and autopilot is that still available well you can go to Tess anomic or I'm sorry you can go to Tesla comp slash pre-owned I believe and find that you can you can just do a like a control F or command F on your keyboard to search for the word autopilot and and and find it I don't ones I've seen with that are around 70,000 so yeah you're paying for almost almost a new one practically so really that's a big differentiator you know you can get a used Model S for sometimes as low as 35,000 but it won't have autopilot won't have any of those things that'll have the smallest battery and all that so that's where the big differentiator is as an auto pilot Scott asks I'm wondering if the sunroof on the model three opens and or if there's a shade to block out the Sun if no wills be a feature in the future so I believe there will be a sunroof that opens I'm not sure I've seen that to date maybe Trevor from model three owners club knows the exact answer to that but you won't need a shade honestly I have a Model S that has a sunroof and it's you know all glass still has a headliner so it's not like the model act but it's you know three different panels and yeah it's fine and you know I live in a sunny climate now there are some companies out there I think Eevee annex has some and Tesla may also have some where they're these kind of shades you can put up underneath so yeah it won't be something that comes with it I don't believe but it will be will be third party people that can deck and sell those Charlie asks what do you believe the costs of super charging will be Eve full-on the model 3 so they already have announced this and in fact I did a video on it if you go look what is the cost to charge my Tesla you can see what that'll be and I use the supercharger rate I believe Tesla has a web page also where you can find out it it's kind of varies it's kind of strange certain utilities require that you charge per hour other ones require that you charge per amount so like kilowatt hours and so usually it's it's a it's a the average rate for that area whatever it is and it varies I did build a map of this by state but Tesla has all this data out there so you can go search for that and find that Chris asks how do you think the model three resale values will be in three years I don't know if we'll have many available for resale in three years I think we'll all still be kind of wrapping up the initial release or initial rollout I think if you were to try to sell one in three years it would probably still be extremely high because I think the weight would still be high and the demand would be even greater than it is today so there you go Lennie asks can the model still function if the screen breaks I would hate to be stuck in the middle of nowhere with the screen freezes or crack so I mean I've chose this question because I think it's it's really helpful for those that don't have a Tesla know and actually you know I guess I need to know I need to test this on the three I assume it works the same but on the S I can actually reboot the computer that does things like the AC and the music and navigation and all those you know kind of the center console I can reboot that wall driving so the the computers that control the driving of the car and the computer that controls everything else in the car are separated that way if there's any glitches or issues with that one then it doesn't affect the other one so my my you know strong belief is that yes you will be able to use the car without that screen now whether or not AC will function and those things is another case so there you go okay and that's all I have for you guys today I appreciate you all very much if you have any questions or anything please feel free to leave them down
