 hi I'm Jeremy count for IMT now people often ask us what's ahead for one of us in the Internet of Things perhaps I'm crazy but I don't think it's technology well not just technology it's not technology that will define whether we have drones buzzing around our skies delivering things for Amazon or DHL if it was just down to tech they'd be doing it already technology is racing ahead but business models legislation can't keep up not only will Amazon take time to work out how this will make a profit more significantly our politicians will take even longer to agree the rules of IOT they can't do it nationally yet certainly a long time before they do it globally this applies to so many areas smart metering services smart homes cities autonomous vehicles connected health data privacy data security and so on very little has been agreed for delivering the Internet of Things or ashamed machine communications in the public arena the areas where progress can be made and has already be made are in private networks for enterprises universities industrial campuses and the Armed Forces why because they didn't need to wait for industry standards to come out of 3gpp or one end to em they were able to deploy networks that met their unique needs often using a hybrid mix of technologies like 2g cellular zigbee and Wi-Fi or they switched on low power wide area networks using readily available unlicensed spectrum right now there's a lot of hype around the future of 5g in the Internet of Things i was at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona earlier this year and the abbreviation 5g was everywhere which is odd because there is no grief I cheesed out of yet don't get me wrong I'm sure that when it comes in our offer significant advances in lower latency and greater bandwidth with exciting applications in connected vehicles mobile healthcare just don't expect it to happen anytime soon phi g do me a favor would be more like five years now i get far more excited about the services that are being enabled right now i know my children always something i should actually get a life but these are enabled sometimes by technologies like low-power wide area networks that aren't that in take the story we reported earlier this month on how cattle mortality could be cut by as much as eighty percent as a hundred and fifty thousand cars are born safely with the app muuqaal and vodafone iot or there's the wheelchair problem at schiphol airport in the netherlands they always need in wheelchairs to move people to and from their planes but they could never find them with help from to enter they fitted a low-cost sensor to every wheelchair now they can not only find them they can cut the number of wheelchairs they need because they can always be located and it wasn't done with 2g cellular connections a sim on every wheelchair would have been far too expensive they used LP wa at a fraction of the cost of cellular of course cellular network operators are fighting back with LTE m-nb IOT standards which offer lower cost than traditional Sims and more robust networks that's a Laura or sig Fox that's the point really all these technologies have a role to play but it's not just the technology that is making the IOT app it's creating new business models and developing shared legislation several services in one region can be repeated in another there I've got that off my chest now feel better I'm Jeremy Cameron this is I OT now
