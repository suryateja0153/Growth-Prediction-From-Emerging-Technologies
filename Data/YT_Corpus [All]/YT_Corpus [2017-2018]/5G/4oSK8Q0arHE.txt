 Hi, we're here at Mobile World Congress Americas in San Francisco and I'm with Marie Hattar, our chief marketing officer for Keysight. I'd like to ask you what are some of the key strengths that you see Keysight contributing in the 5G arena? Thanks, Karolina. First of all, it's wonderful to be here at the show--there's a lot of excitement around, and I'm really proud of what Keysight is doing for 5G. Our end-to-end solutions that we offer for 5G really differentiate us in the marketplace. There are no other vendors that go across layer one all the way to layer seven. If you think about it, 5G, and the rollout of it. It's such a complex technology, and the innovations are happening across so many arenas. With Keysight, you have a single vendor that can help you collaborate across all of the organizations. What we do is, we ensure that our software allows you to transport workflows across the different measurements and this allows you to compare and contrast and innovate in different areas. Take, for example, operators who are building out their towers. Today the handsets are not yet available for 5G, yet we provide the capability to capture the signal strength and the measurement and the emulation so that they can start advancing forward in this. We like to say that we like being first, but we also like being first and best. With 5G, partnering with Keysight allows those innovators out there to connect and secure the world much faster. Sounds good--thank you Marie.
