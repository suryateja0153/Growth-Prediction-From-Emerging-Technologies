 [Music] we spoke with Adrienne bash Nong Garrity why about 5g and its implications for future tech hi Adrienne so you're the globe will lead telecom analyst at UI King to start us off can you tell us a little bit more about what your job entails please that's right yes so basically I'm responsible for firms thought leadership output in the sector I cannot do a lot of our consumer research and also our industry research focused on telecoms operators and from that we get a lot of insights about what customers are feeling and the direction the industry is heading in so in that case you're probably best placed to talk about what kind of innovation 5g will deliver absolutely 5g is is really a paradigm shift for the mobile industry so it really signals a step change if we think about 2g for example that was all about digital voice with 3G we had data communications with 4G we had true mobile broadband if we look ahead to 5g it's all about unlocking the Internet of Things and critically the difference between it and previous generations is the capacity for low latency communications so ultra reliable responsive communications and when we think about what kinds of services this can unlock it could be anything from autonomous driving to remote surgery to frictionless logistics for example so the opportunity is very wide for 5g it sits well beyond the traditional consumer market for example and if we think about when it's going to happen 2020 is really seen as the launch year for 5g partly because standards haven't yet been finalized that's an interesting point so what is the operator take on 5g and how ready are they sure I mean in terms of operator readiness we conducted a survey this year and we found that 77% of operators think that 5g will have the greatest impact on the industry there are a lot of high hopes behind it when you drill into what waiters are actually doing their taking a varied approach some operators in the States for example are looking at the role that 5g can play for rural broadband communities most operators are figuring out how 5g can play a role in the Internet of Things and they're also thinking about this step change in terms of mobile broadband in terms of 3G video or augmented reality but when it comes to actual deployments commercial availability isn't slated for 2020 so right now we're seeing a lot of trials so you've mentioned a lot of interesting use cases but what are the opportunities for startups here in the UK yes the deployment of 5g will be really reliant on partnerships so if you're an operator for example you already have partnerships with the developer community also IT companies also other industry verticals all of those will become more pronounced in the age of five G because nobody really has end-to-end ownership of the customer so if you're looking at the application developer community you're thinking about how can specific applications be created for specific industries that's that's one area but even on the technology side when you look at millimeter wave technology startups could play a very active role in that space too and finish off what enablers need to be in place for 5g to succeed there's a number of things that need to happen for 5g to become a success first off the technology needs to be standardized that's going to happen in two phases one from the end of this year the next phase in 2019 secondly you need a lot of spectrum to come onto the market to support the roller deployment of 5g services and again there's a few decisions that regulators need to make in terms of the auction frameworks and how they stagger the release of these different frequency bands and finally you know government needs to play a vital supporting role here as already mentioned you know the the industry impact for 5g is huge and the opportunity to redefine different interest verticals is substantial so government supporting in terms of supporting the trial of 5g Services is critical also down to the local authority level in terms of overhauling planning policies these are all areas where public sector support is vital definitely a lot of food for thought there thank you very much for your time agent thank you
