 B-89 Blast Jinnius 5Glaive Guard is an interesting release; it comes with three brand new parts, as opposed to most boosters that usually only came with two. The Blast Jinnius Layer has a ring around itself that rises during battle to absorb hits, but in reality it does little to change performance besides make the beyblade easier to destabilize in battle. That combined with the recoil from the contact points leave the Layer hindered competitively, as it is quite easy to Burst or KO with Layers like Legend Spriggan and Sieg Xcalibur. The 5 Core Disc has a design that is much like a reversed 4 Core Disc, and it performs similarly to 4 with the top-tier stamina Frame, Glaive, which is also contained in this booster. Lastly, the Guard Driver has a ring around its tip that keeps the beyblade from falling over. Theoretically this should make it good for defense and life after death, but it’s very easy to destabilize and its knockout defense is poor, resulting in a part that remains outclassed by Revolve and Atomic. Overall, while Blast Jinnius.5G.Gr is a neat departure from typical boosters, the new parts within leave a lot to be desired. As such, you should only pick up this booster if you need the Glaive Frame. Otherwise, only pick it up for collection purposes.
