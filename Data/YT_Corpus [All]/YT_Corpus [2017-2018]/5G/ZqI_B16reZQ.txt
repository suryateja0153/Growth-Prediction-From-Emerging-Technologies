 right thank you everyone for joining this webinar from the industrial IOT 5g inside service from RCR wireless the time of the webinar is smartening up a city looking in particular at we're smart cities have got to around the world I'm David Pringle well I'm the host for today's webinar and I'm going to give you a quick introduction and then we're going to get into a number of presentations and we're going to follow that by a QA there will be a chance for you as the audience to ask questions so please do input questions via the interface on your computers and we will take those questions towards the end of the webinar so the agenda today is should be on your screens now we have myself by David Price and the lead contributor here at the industrial IOT Phi G inside service our first speaker will be Jeremy green he's a principal analyst at machinery search following Jeremy will be spell Allah grouts director of feature IOT networks the connected living program at the GSMA and finally we have Rafael sepideh he's the smart study's lead at interdigital so uh why are we talking about our cities now concept in a smart city has been around for quite some time but maybe even decades but it's been a long time coming but there is still big potential to use the latest information and communication technologies to solve a lot of the problems facing municipalities around the world those problems today exacerbated by ER at the fast rapid urbanization of screen going on there's a lot of people moving into cities around the world that's causing a lot of congestion overcrowding pollution etc and there's a potential to use both connectivity and and computing power to address many of these problems but this has been this has been attempted in the past and progress has been somewhat slow the reason for lies does a lots of different stakeholders involved as many different participants in any typical city for both the the local authority that local government but also the citizens themselves businesses and the various different services that exist within a typical City some challenges bringing out all together and actually harnessing these technologies away as coherent and makes the best of them but we may be at a key point in time in the development of smart city and a number of technologies new technology advances are coming together and these are pausing to make it much more economic much more cost effective to to actually create an arts to these solutions a key one in particular may be low cost and low power wide area networks which will make it easier to deploy connectivity around the city particularly existing cydia so-called brownfield city good isn't being built scratch and there's also the prospect of 5g on the horizon but on all the good things that not might bring in terms of connectivity at the same time the cost of sensors is falling image processing is improving and the Solana computing power being now available at a relatively low cost so the question we're going to address in this webinar us has the ear of the smart city finally arrived and I'm following on introduction I'm going to ask our first speaker to take over he is jeremy greene from machinima research jeremy over to you thank you David and I thought I'd just introduced who we were for a second with Mac in our research we're an analyst company and we are specialized in IOT and rather introduced to us i thought i'd show you some slides for some of our clothes of some of our clients as you see the the best and brightest from the aya so next live David so um as david has said it does feel like we've been talking about smart cities for a very very long time but it's not entirely clear that that we've been talking about the same thing for all that time we started off probably about 10 years ago with the idea seemed unproblematic but you know there was all this fabulous ICT technology and particularly m2m communications which could help solve some of the problems in in cities that seemed intractable so we started off with this focus on point solutions aimed at specific problems and then the realization dawned that there was a commonality between some of these solutions and thus it was an opportunity to share resources and an element from those solutions especially the network but also in the back end in databases in analytics and application frameworks and tools and so on and and as time has passed we've moved from that that ideal just simply sharing resources to a recognition that there's a danger of getting locked into a particular vendors solution and thus we've moved again away from the idea of a single centralized platform that was in one platform to rule them all and we've increasingly there's a focus on standard and open interfaces and interoperability via AP is rather than this sort of single centralized City brain next slide and at the same time that that journeys been ongoing there's there's been another one in parallel where we've changed what what we mean by smartness so the in the early years there was a big focus on municipal operations you're the operation to the city's internal systems and the vision was something like the mayor on the bridge of this sort of Starship Enterprise like thing controlling all the city systems and we've moved away from that now untold an increasing focus on the citizens so it's much more it's about engagement and participation and with smartness is now much more seen as a two-way street so there's a different flavors of the discussions with a lot more emphasis on the user interface and on opening up data so that their data can it one lot of data can interact with another lot of data but also about presentation layers and it also means that there's been a bigger focus on things that citizens care about rather than necessarily the things that make the biggest impact in the city so the poster child for this if you like is fix my street yeah where you can you can send a message to your municipality that says there's a pothole but it's noticeable that some commentators are starting to include other sharing economy things in their definition of the smart city even if when they're nothing to do with the municipality or even service economy platforms like you see uber increasingly cited as being part of a smart city next slide one thing that analysts like to say a lot is that there's no one-size-fits-all but it really true of cities you know if you think about different kinds of cities i consider london which has either 8 million or 13 million depending on where you draw the boundaries where you counter and cologne which has 1 million projects that you can can think think about doing in cologne are a lot more complicated if you intend to do them in london another important difference is that the political frameworks for all these cities are very different are we living in london it's easy to think that the london mayor is it a celebrity and is an important politician but actually the Mayor of London is it's not responsible for very much at all so if you imagine him on its Starship Enterprise bridge he just doesn't have very many many levers to pull compared to say the mayor of a much smaller french city a french mayor controls the city's water and the sewage and its police force and its buses the british met doesn't control any of those things and even those things that they normally control has probably been outsourced to a private company with a long-term contract so you have not much political control and you have fragmentation and then the problems that the city's face are all different so there's huge variations in for example the traffic congestion between say cologne again or and London and Lagos the efficiency of the public transport the level of air pollution there's a big difference between an old city with an out-of-date infrastructure against a like London and a city that never had much infrastructure or has grown much faster than its infrastructure has grown that's typical of developing country type cities on one second and it's important to remember that not every city it would typically we talk about the problems of success yeah that's it you have cities outgrowing their infrastructure but not all the problems are about success we have we have cities that are of either failed or I'll failing so we have fragile cities some people talk about feral cities and that there's there's a network of shrinking cities and in all those places there isn't a city budget that might possibly be on the same scale as the problems of the cities have there's a very uneven vulnerability to climate change and so on and so on so next slide of it and the other thing that's worth bearing in mind is that cities are like that they're like and they're not like enterprises it from the supply side we often tend to think well it's a large organization cities must be quite a lot like enterprises and in some ways they are they have legacy IT and communications they've got organizational structures with silos they've got budgets and they've got perching purchasing centers but they're different too I mean they make the major and most important difference is that they have goals and objectives other than financial which by and large a commercial enterprise doesn't have so some of those are imposed through regulations and administrate administrative obligations what we call statutory duties we often talk about city managers as if there's some sort of see CEO but in a city power is shared and it's diffused at it and crucially it involves elected politicians and elected politicians have different considerations to commercial CEOs so of course we know that companies care about their their image but it's sometimes it's surprising how far a politician think they can go toward meeting their obligations but though their objectives by just posing in front of something having a picture taken and it's worth remembering that the municipality is not the same as the city at one level this the municipality has responsibilities extend over the space that's occupied by the city limits but often the city's economic influence extends way beyond its formal boundaries and at the same time it doesn't control everything within those boundaries it doesn't control its carbon footprint it has limited impact on the air quality in the city so my last slide David's so we're in an experimental phase but it's it's not experiments in the sense that you know they constitute a coherent program of of science we are in a phase where we have a lot of pilots and yet those pilots don't seem to build into much consolidated learning so you see this many cities will repeat pilots have been tried somewhere else it off seems to be the case that those pilots don't get documented so nobody gets the opportunity to learn from somebody else's pilot there aren't many what you think covers exemplary implementations there aren't many places where people can point to and say you want to do smart street lighting go to freiburg or stuck out or whatever and and they've done it right just do what they've done or smart parking or anything like that and I think that partly because we have tended to emphasize competition between cities rather than learning between cities so the last little picture there is the man who is at least partly responsible for that that's a man called Richard Florida who wrote a book called the rise of the creative class which very much emphasizes that cities compete to attract these cool and funky people who in turn lead to economic growth I think it's from a supply-side we've been very prone to if you think of a city like an enterprise you say hey you know do this you can get one step ahead of your your rivals and your competitors so we've brought the same approach to cities and perhaps we've done that a little bit too much so that's what I wanted to say I'm now very happy to hand over to the next speaker thank you very much Jeremy and so Jeremy says set the scene there we're now going to move to settle on the ground to the GSMA who's going to give us sir looking a little bit more at some of the enabling technologies svetlana over to you ok thank you very much David a good morning good afternoon everyone I would like to talk to you a little bit about the use of mobile technologies for the smart cities and the Internet of Things and if we go to the next slide David I would like to first of all for those of you who do not know who the GSMA are we are a trade association for the mobile industry with about 800 mobile operators globally as our members and nearly 300 companies there is infrastructure the device and application providers and we have a view this one is as one piece of a big Internet of Things puzzles there is obviously more to it to just IT there are connected all the rack connected citizens and and there are quite a lot of different angles that would be used to look at this Mort cities we started looking at smart cities about five years ago and have had projects or related to smart cities all this time and now we are dealing with yet another bit of enabling smart cities which concerns connectivity and the reason why I would do it is because it is a growing area and there was already a reference to the declining cost of chipsets to the pervasive on activity the growing number of projects to the availability of ipv6 addresses and generally there is more and more proof coming in that the there are plenty of benefits to deploying the connected solutions for the cities we've done number of of research projects with the likes of PwC and Accenture which looked at the potential benefits captured from introducing the smartness and the intelligence to the cities and the benefits range from some of the efficiency gains such as the example quoted here in traffic telematics we're reclaiming nearly eight hour two hours every week in China for example that over 20 billion u.s. dollars to the chinese gdp every year and because what's it is such a huge area we are looking at efficiency gains from the smart grid smart metering types of solutions we're looking at a big savings from the health care costs and mobile industry has a very significant place to play just looking at some of the predictions in the total number of machine-to-machine connections by by 2020 there is some expectation that bit of these could be coming from the cellular machine-to-machine and low-power wide area bushings and of course as with any new row wing and emerging in the street even if it takes a while for it to emerge um there are plenty of risks that need to be addressed and preempted and are plenty of issues that need to be results the security certainly one of those that we are working on a to guide the new companies the IT companies to understand the basic principles that they need to follow to provide security for the IT services and applications and and we are looking at for the ways of how to make it easier to get connected and together and share it exceeds so in the next slide David I'd like to talk to you early the little power wide-area solutions that are that are standardized in 3gpp and will be released at the end of June so we're talking about three technologies here that are based on the existing of our network footprint so we're looking at the l teen or based LTE M tcot machine type of communication technology are also known as cat m1 we're looking at the narrowband OT technology which is built specifically to send very small amounts of data at very big distances and allowing the battery in those connected devices to last over as long as ten years plus we're looking at ECG is MIT type of technologies which are going to be using the existing 2g network footprints and so all of this can be deployed very quickly over the existing coverage or mobile networks and bond because all of them provide extended coverage we are looking at a very low costs so they are going below the existing 2g modules for example we're looking at their long battery life again depending on how much traffic is going it's going to be our years and in many cases enough for such applications as water metering it it lasts as long as 15 years and we're looking at the way to not only read the data from these devices with this 3gpp technologies but also to communicate the devices which is not something that is sometimes thought of by by their organizations and companies deploying IT solutions very often they find out that when they deploy with the solution they only need to read the data from a sensory device but as the time goes by they come up with different ideas for applications and services and they understand that it's a good idea to send security patches for example to their devices and also to our great firmware as need be and maybe introduce the new services so all of those all of those features of the new technologies are available and and of course as these are standards-based and moody blue and and will be deployed over the existing mobile footprint it will effectively provide global coverage and make them quickly scalable and there are plenty of examples in the distinct smart cities where mobile operators are involved just just making a quick list it's it's anywhere from from the US where there is a big initiative to connect smart cities to China where where plenty of smart cities initiatives ago going on with with such solutions as smart parking and and a range of others smart grid for example where vulgar it is already invoked and to plenty of European cities from some tender and Barcelona to Amsterdam and German cities when mobile technologies are used as sort of the total big range of heterogeneous technologies that include a lot of short-range lot of fixed networks and mobile fits in very well to support a very big range of use cases and if we take a look at the next at the next slide one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about is summer the trials that are currently taking place follow power wide area technologies in licensed spectrum so this regional edge technologies just some of those I wanted to mention to you involve water monitoring and environmental monitoring for example the Chattahoochee River keeper example in the US where mobile is used as part of the solution around Atlanta area very interesting example where a completely different approach to Baltimore entering it has been taken by using some of the power saving features and low power technologies and we're looking at quite a few examples of smart parking applications and these have now been trialed with the with the cities in range of cities from from the Middle East to to Germany to China we're looking at some of the examples that are coming in in terms of waste management in vodafone in australia and some of this have already been deployed over the old 2g for example technologies and now they're moving to more optimized solutions that that will work better for the cities generally this year we'll see a lot more customer trials and pilots taking place with the cities and next year from the first half in 2017 a lot of commercial launches will be taking place and so within the GSMA if we take a look at the next slide we're on the mobile IOT initiative and we also run a smart city projects we work jointly in collaborating with the cities and explaining to the cities of what type of of solutions are available for them and of course today I'm talking about connectivity but there are quite quite a few other services from platform based services to opening pies to analytics services and security services that can be provided on the existing interoperable platforms so we are supporting not only the new low-power wide area solutions but also discussing other features of the mobile technologies that that that are effectively used in the cities and if you look at the next slide in terms of the operators and vendors who are currently involved I've got a list of those who are already actively working on the deployment and development more below par wide area solutions and we have a lot of companies joining every day and also asking for collaborative project so we expect to see a lot more activities in the smart cities area as the as the months go by and certainly commercial launches in next year so that's that's the main main presentation that I wanted to live with you and if we go to the next slide and the next slide you will see a number of references for the content on the Disney side where you can find out more references with some of these solutions thank you very much and I'll hand over to the next speaker okay thank you spat on and well there we'll talk a little bit more about some ways enabling technologies later on in the QA so thank you for that our next speaker is raw files to PDF from there interdigital and who's gonna give us his take on particular what's happening I think in the UK so raha over to you ya think ya bit so we be hearing about smart city so I purpose with its very short presentation is to to share what we're doing in the UK and and what we think is the next step after smart cities so with this practical example that we called one transport we want to show how the Smart City concept can be taken into a more multi geographical multi-system and multimodal integration system where multiple sector partners can join forces to create solutions that are more targeted to what cities need and also to what different partners these are consistently so in the next slide what we see is its main to take the main reason why we thought about this project is a smart cities are evolving into a world of silos and if we see the next slide and we see that if you look at different Smart City concepts you see that they are kind of grown in isolation different geographies CTA is a competitor from CTB as a one of the previous speakers mentioned also there are many spoken incompatible solutions like can be very good but unfortunately they are not transferable or expandable to other cities or to the region where the city is actually deploying these solutions we see multiple different technologies mostly incompatible and what this is pro producing is it's log data so data is useful only for a city but maybe it's not useful for for other cities and this is also sometimes driven by who is the provider for the particular technology in that city so what we see in the next slide is is what an IOT solution needs to be actually the best possible solution for a city so first the platform and the city the sensors all the deployment needs to be economically sustainable and I'm not talking about just a initial deployment I'm talking about what happens after three years four years 10 years solutions have to be sustainable in that sense and solutions also need to integrate whatever is already deployed in cities so that's what I mean with the legacy systems and this should play an important role on how you integrate future sensors and new systems and once you start integrating whatever it is already ployed cities with new developments then you create an open marketplace for data and data services for the benefit of of the items in the city and also the region and the country and probably the world if if you can interconnect multiple cities globally also some something very important for cities is to have a better control of information it's not only about open data that sometimes is mislead us three data is who is accessing your data and there what conditions what can they do with the data so cities need to understand better what their data assets are and how these are being used and how people are actually benefiting from this eight also important for cities is to understand or to have an acknowledgement of what data they are producing how this data is actually helping the city to grow and feedback from users and a feedback from users is not great I like your platform is it's more about I'm using a mobile app based on the data from the city and how my journey my experience is producing more data that will help cities to do a more informed planning of of the evolution and the growth of the city and it's also when once you have an open marketplace for data and data services you may have multiple competitive and web apps that we create solutions that target the specific sectors of the population and this is not only about mobile applications or web applications but is also a wealth of different analytics and may not come just from one company or one institution but for many in a very competitive marketplace and so the last point is that it is important to start thinking about integration among multiple cities is not anymore about only one smart city concept is we need to start thinking about how cities integrated with regions and how it is integrated with more cities and and how you or me for example as a user can move from city to city using the same mobile applications or or using the same tools that make me feel at home in other cities so in the next slide what I want to show is just a brief summary of all the project we are running in the UK so this project is it's a cooperation of 11 multi-sector partners as part of of this project we have formal local authorities and highways England these guys are actually leading transport data initiative where they share understanding and knowledge of how they days use how data can be consumed with multiple local authorities is an open forum for discussion we have analytic providers who is a Imperial College and track bringing different sets of analytics we're integrating more than 200 different data sets from from local authorities and highways England and we are also integrating different sensors from clear beyond wall same thing with the aim of showing that we are integrating what every so trained cities with new sensor deployments we also have a transport expert era which is leading the research and innovation on how better transport systems can be deployed this project is sponsored by NOAA UK is a governmental institution in the UK and and we started on the first of November and we are open to more partners to joining to explore the data sets we have and also to to join the local authorities and have some a gain of knowledge and understanding thank you ok thank you rafael that's a good insight into what's going on in the UK and there in transport in particular so now we're moving to the Q&A section of the webinar we're going to expressions from the audience and that I deal with some broad topics as well for for the panelists I want to start with the technology side of things and maybe if I start with you on this jeremy and come to raw file and then maybe we can there dig a little bit more into the mobile networks with Svetlana Jeremy I think first question for you is that is all the technology we need now available are there any pieces missing or do you think we we now have all the technology we need another price points we need oh there's a two different question I'm unmuted on time you are yes I can hear ya oh good okay those are two different questions you know the first thing is I you know there will be technologies which will come along later which will turn out to be useful that we haven't thought of at the moment but I don't think there is any car any yawning gap there isn't there no there isn't ah some roadblocks that is preventing City type applications from being deployed we've got a number of different connectivity technologies now to do you know to sort of cover the waterfront we've got sensors or various kind we've got all the backend stuff yeah it isn't the case that they can't get better and they could there will be performance tweaks that will make some applications which can't be done or can't be done economically at the moment don't you know but things but as the second point about the the price point as things get cheaper it'll be the range of play of context in which these things can get deployed will get wider so whatever you know wherever you deploy these things you need something like a business case and that business case gets easier as either the connectivity or the modules or the sensors all the costs of supporting those gets cheaper so the second part of the question is about the price point is is a little more of a moveable feast but but but in after the first one I don't think there's a yawning technology gap anywhere but I'd be interested to hear what the other two panelists thing solana here if I can add to that I would agree that we are not looking at a massive technology gap at this time I think we we needed to have the log power solutions to address the the battery long battery requirement and generally the requirement for this sensors and devices to be located you know either either deep indoors or further out in the field and and so so this has now been done and and I think that you know these these this new technologies now address quite a range of different very you know very extreme cases and I think that you know we'll probably see more in terms of new technologies 15 G becomes available but it's you know we're not looking at this in the short term so they'll obviously be more availability but at this point in time I think it's more about the way you use this technologies and how you you know build the solutions to justify your business case is more important i think the cost well is now low enough to enable it and so it's more about a partnership to make this solutions viable rather than try to find another technology yeah thank you smell Thank You Jeremy um there's a couple of questions here related to that from from the audience around how do you choose which connectivity solution to use there's a lot of potential ways to connect Smart City solutions and sensors and molitor's etc how how do you actually choose which solution and also how how do you handle the signaling side of their the equation so no I'll put that to you but if for a fire like Jeremy wants chicken as well please do yeah and I've just I've just replied via text as well to this questions and so in the new 3gp technologies this signaling is is hugely reduced its simplified its existing its existing solutions but they are there simplified and a lot of time the devices that are out there are either in sleep mode or annoyed or mode do they come online and communicate and chirp you know occasionally and then the rest of the time they don't generate a new traffic and and that's one reason why this technologies have been upgraded to local where there is to deal with the signaling which then affects them the battery life and and allows the devices to keep going a lot longer in terms of months and years rather than days yeah I like to is Rafael spare here I'd like to add to the sand also to link somehow this question with a previous question so I think there's a lot worth of technology available now for a smart cities I think it was also mentioned that the cost of sensors is falling the main problem that I see now once we start applying this in multiple cities is that the okay the cost of sensors is slowing but the cost of integration is rising and the reason for this is that there are many different vendors with resolution sometimes preparatory and then when you start integrating these sensors in a different platforms that becomes really costly and so there are some emerging standards like one m2m that try to two are harmonized how devices are connected to a single platform but what will happen in the future is that we will have multiple of these platforms and there is need to start integrating multiple platforms and to make data available across multiple of these solutions and I think that that's the next step yeah okay I'm not actually on that question another audience question around standardization actually and swallow this is around the emergence of Laura and yeah well that's a competitive or complimentary system to what mobile operators are doing around the mobile IOT initiative that you mentioned if you could briefly just touch on that and yeah the issues around standardization of Rafah touched on them yeah thank you David and the answer it is both a number of the GSMA operators are deploying Laura and obviously for those of you who know a la razón is a proprietary technology that is offered in unlicensed bactrim so I Sam spectrum so there are deployments out there in the market and we expected that a lot of operators who who are looking at Laura will also be deploying bins over their existing network footprint as well so it it could it could be instead it could be together there are really all sorts of options the point is that you know if if a city works with kind of a range of operators who are active in that particular market there is a technology for whatever need is there um so I think it's just a matter of talking to your supplier and finding out what's available what kind of coverage is already there you know what price point you're looking at and and kind of figuring out what works for you best um it's not you know the point is not to say there is one single technology the point is that there is a lot of choice and I think it's probably a matter of figuring out what each of this can do and how it can work past for you yeah okay tell me I'm just a related question I'd like to put to you actually is whether city should wait for technologies to be standardized you know in the case of some of these technologies and standardization process is still ongoing and you know what's the risk of deploying a technology that might become obsolete in a few years time what are you thoughts on that um I saw the question in text as well there you know on the one hand there will be vendors who turn up and tell you that you know you need to be first off the block where these things you you know you need to steal a march on your your rivals and gain competitive advantage for your city and I think you can safely discount all of that but if you wait for perfection you'll never deploy anything at all and the key really is not to assume that Alan that every part of your solution is going to last forever you need to think about which of the bits that are really difficult to change and which therefore need to be relatively mature and which is a bit which you know you can swap over for something else relatively simply I mean you know if you think you know by analogy if you think about yourself as a mobile phone user you you buy a mobile phone and you keep it for maybe a year and or maybe two years if you're Lagarde like me and then you you change it for another one it doesn't matter that the mobile network is going to upgrade its technology every few years you don't say well I'm not going to buy a 3g phone because one day there's going to be 4g it's a you know the key thing is to you think about which bits of your solution are going to be really hard to touch and not to stick something in there that's likely to become obsolete versus which bits can be reconfigured or if a some sort of translation or interface layer between them can be reconfigured so that you can add your what you've done you could make it talk to whatever you're going to replace it with I hope doesn't sound too abstract but in a way is about abstraction layers yeah i mean i'm having the point about waiting for perfection is an important one you can always hold off making a purchase decision I guess it's a it's a question of when you take the plug just to try an interest of time because switch topics now too there's been a question asked around privacy and the personal data which I think rafa is dressing by text but let's hear the answer live is one of our in terms of there is obviously a lot of potentially sensitive data being captured by smart city solutions and how do we you know sways those concerns how do we show that show that resonance citizens I protect appropriate safety yeah i kinda i can either on that so in the same way that that cities need to be more aware of how their data is being used is the same applies to do to people in cities they they need to become aware of what their data is being used for and at the same time they need to add value to the data they produce there's not any more about getting draw and unprocessed data from users is telling users okay we will use your data enhance it add metadata add information about what you're doing and in that way and data owners or end users will become more like data producers we have where they have more control and they provide even better information for citizen to multiple players that can actually pay or exchange services in an exchange of data okay Germany quick thoughts I think we've discussed that issue in the past yeah I mean I only to say that I think actually to some extent actually people are quite grown up about these things and yeah on the one hand you know there are people that are there are occasions in which you peoples don't think very much about their data privacy and they they expose things that perhaps they not to expose them that don't make them safe but on the other hand if you can explain to people that there is a social or a community benefit they're often quite happy to share either data or information or processing power in the knowledge that other people who are not them are going to benefit but they'll benefit somebody else doing the same thing I think where people become unhappy is when they are contributing their data which then becomes part of somebody else's commercial service so they get monetized but it the municipalities in a way or in a strong position because you know that they represent a public body if you say that if you you can say to citizens that you sharing your information whether it's about your travel or the sensor data from accelerometers or from air pollution sensors or if you're prepared to share that there'll be a benefit for you I i think you know cities are in a better position to do that than some commercial organizations okay sorry again I'm gonna have to change topics they're just addressing the audience questions there's a couple of questions around sensors and how they'll be used ones around the use of sensors at street intersections Raphael I'm thinking you've looked at the transport use cases in particular any thoughts on how sensors can be applied and whether they perhaps should be single point solutions or whether you'd have a multi-purpose census it street intersections so for street intersections we can have many different sensors looking at different things sometimes have some redundancy to ensure that you know what's going on for example you you can have rode loops that are under the tarmac and those will count the number of cars but also you you may need to understand better how traffic is flowing so you use cameras and this this will provide automatic number plate recognition systems so it is really a mix of different sensors that need to be deployed and in that respect you will need a different connectivity methods so cellular is one option but there will be more proprietary and an open solutions for connectivity and the main point here is is how you are sending this data to for example cloud services and how these cloud services interact with oil cloud services yeah I know what it was like a related question around whether these sensors need to have an IP capability or whether they can connect to us or higher level device that aggregates the date and relays it back via the network spell honor do you want to take that one sure um I I don't yeah I don't think every sensor needs IP capability um I certainly think that there will be plenty of architectures there that you know Kinect sensors to a gate with some sort and the 3gpp technologies also support non IP communications so there are different ways to set this off depending on on what works um at the moment I think the cost of connectivity and the cost of connecting census JP is going down so significantly that it's not difficult to envision connecting all of them via IP but I don't think that's going to be the case yeah yeah okay now yeah I know spell on you've taken this from my text but I just want to cover this cracks I think it is important to us a question about how much infrastructure the city's them sell need to own and when were you know it's important that they actually own the assets or whether they can be used the existing public assets no you can't start Jeremy on that is it it's important for the city to have you know their own dedicated solutions with their own dedicated bandwidth basically not I'm sure Svetlana will answer this better than I will but we didn't get where we are today by everybody building parallel networks on top of each other so that you know the city's got a network and then large enterprises all have their own networks it we have some really good technologies which make sense when they're deployed as public network technologies with shared access to them and you know the idea that you got to own and control all of it is it is basically not ten ssible that you know there are exceptions there are places where you can do that but by and large that's not the way you want to go just a group for from New slavonic so we'll be there are some mission critical applications I guess where you need some kind of quality of service around that you need to be sure that you'll get the connectivity when you need it so is there a way that you know we can do that within the public network um yeah I mean I think there is a very you know there are different ways you can use the public network and certainly there are ways to work with the operators and and you know have the SLA is written so that they support a lot of Craig mission critical applications not all of them obviously which is why i thought you know says was going to really both then d you need to look at options but generally i think it's a kind of capex vs vs capex and opex a discussion and you know if you decide to run your own network it it doesn't mean that you've invested into it and you can let it be you basically still need to have a team of people who run it who maintain it upgrade is core aware of security implications you know who need to basically look after it will you buy a managed service and you basically allow somebody else to do it and I think that even mission-critical applications there is a way to reuse the existing public networks with you know with guarantees so that's kind of very top level I know it's very individual and depends on the application but that that's sort of top-level answer yeah okay no thinking for that well I'm just a quick concluding question just get your thoughts on on who's going to actually make money from smart cities and in terms of you know what elements of the value chain will play a key role in delivering start cities and realize the value then I'm just gonna ask you each quickly for your thoughts on that I mean I think we've had a senseless there is momentum in this market but you know the value chain potentially could be somewhat complex wave out some of you on my Jeremy who who do you see making money from smart cities well I mean everybody will make some money but I suspect the most money will go to systems integrators okay rafa I agree completely it's going to be an ecosystem with their money for multiple partners but systems integrators we get there most people okay and Svetlana I'm hoping you might say yeah I'd love to give a a you know completely different answer but if you look at the kind of pyramid of value that will be created you know connectivity will obviously be generating some revenue otherwise you know the network providers wouldn't be building this this networks but generally most of the value sits on top of it and so systems integration application support platform types of services those are all going to be much bigger a bit of the pie yeah yeah okay well we're nearing the end of our time I'm just gonna wrap up quickly actually just to give a few high-level thoughts on what I've heard I mean as I said we are I think hearing so that's the momentum around smart cities is growing but I think Jeremy made a very important point about active learning from Leah pilots and trials that are taking place out there may be quite a lot of duplication repetition of trials going on and there may be reamed it to streamline that and move more quickly to commercial deployments but certainly from what we're hearing I think the the 10 technological pieces are in place and there it's probably now question of picking a low-hanging fruit there the killer apps as it were that it's gonna get politicians and citizens engage and get the smart city market really moving but it does feel to me from what we've heard that we are reaching a key point in the in the development of this market um so I'd like to thank all our panelists for their insights on there today and there I'd also like to thank the audience for joining us we are publishing a report on this topic which will be available on the RCR wireless website following this webinar which gives some more color and information about what's going on in there in various parts of the world in the UK and also in there in the US and Spain and and also in Asia as well so where I could recommend that to report to you but thanks again to a panel and thanks again to the audience and it's been a good discussion
