 my name is Jeffrey Babb I'm a security training engineer with Palo Alto Networks and today I want to talk to about GlobalProtect for pan OS version 7.1 the purpose of our demonstration today is not to do any deep dives into GlobalProtect but rather just to show you how what needs to be configured in order to get GlobalProtect up and running so we'll look at an overview GlobalProtect preparing the firewall for GlobalProtect and then configuring the portal gateway and the agents ok so every time a user leaves the building with their laptops or their mobile devices they're bypassing the corporate firewall and GlobalProtect resolves this issue by extending the protection of the Palo Alto Networks next-generation security platform to your mobile workforce by using GlobalProtect to maintain visibility into traffic and enforcement of security policies for protection against known and unknown threats you can use GlobalProtect as a licensed product or an unlicensed product if you use it as an unlicensed product you simply get the secure remote access VPN solution for either single or multiple internal or external gateways and again you would not need any licenses for that however if you wanted to use some more of the advanced features such as enabling HIP checks or associated content updates you would then have to have a licensed version of GlobalProtect and that license would need to be installed on each firewall that is running a gateway that will perform those HIP checks right GlobalProtect provides a complete infrastructure from managing your mobile workforce to enable secure access for all your users regardless of what devices they are using where they are located that infrastructure includes the portal the gateways and the clients so let's talk about the portal the portal provides the management functions for GlobalProtect infrastructure every client system that participates in the GlobalProtect network receives configuration information from the portal this will include information about the available gateways as well as any client certificates that may be required to connect to those GlobalProtect gateways you also have the GlobalProtect  gate wins themselves you have two options you have the external gate base for the internal gate with the goal of protecting way provides security enforcement for traffic coming from who GlobalProtect agents for apps if you are connecting to an external gateway then that gate will provide you with the security enforcement or the VPN access for your remote users the internal gateways are configured on an interface that's on the internal side of your network that is configured as a good will protect gateway you would want to use a internal gateway for sensitive environments where authenticated access to critical resources is required so what happens is the GlobalProtect client will send a request to the portal requesting the information necessary for the connection once the GlobalProtect plural identifies the client it will send the configuration information to the client which will include the information about the available gateways now those gateways can be configured with different priorities which gateway you connect to will be dictated by what is the priority of that gateway or what is the fastest response time for those gateways but we will look at those configurations okay in order to get GlobalProtect up and running we will need some specific configuration set but before we look at that just says verify I'm using pan OS version 7.1 dot six and the latest version of GlobalProtect three one four in order to get GlobalProtect running I'll need to configure some interfaces so I'll go to my Ethernet interfaces and I'm looking at ethernet 1/1 and there're interfaces that's going to be useful GlobalProtect can either be a layer 3 interface or it can be a loopback interface and for the purposes of this explanation I will go with a layer 3 interface that layer 3 interface is tethered to a virtual router the default virtual router and it is in zone layer 3 untrust so my external or my remote users will have a way to connect back to my corporate environment or GlobalProtect another option I have would be to create the loopback and again I don't want to create the loopback for this particular example but it's an option another thing that I can do is create a tunnel tunnels are not mandatory however they are an option and for this explanation I want to tunnel that - it is not assigned an IP address it is config connected to the default router it is in zone layer 3 trust and currently it is assigned to GlobalProtect so let's look at the portal zone so as far as the portal is concerned I've identified Ethernet 1/1 as the interface that I'm going to be using for GlobalProtect and this is the IP address for Ethernet 1/1 I can use different response pages in this case I'm choosing to go with the factory default response page I have authentication profiles which I've already set up and in subsequent demonstration videos we'll look at setting up the authentication profiles these things have already been pre-configured for this demo for the agent itself when I configure the agent I'll have to give it a name identify what type of certificate I want to use in this example I'm going to go with a local certificate and I'm using a certificate call tester and I'm saying that I want to save the user credentials but these are just specific options that you would want to go ahead and decide if you want to use them as far as the user group is concerned I'm saying about any user group with any operating system and we're good to go there if you want to you can get more specific the internal or external gateway options right now I'm just going to go with an external gateway for my remote users and they will connect 255 20 and this gateway has the highest priority if I want to do internal host detection basically what I'm saying is I want to know if this host is a machine that is on the corporate environment right now or if they are outside the corporate environment maybe they're at Starbucks I also have the option to use third-party VPNs and and if I want to do that my options will be the Penn virtual Ethernet adapter juniper or Cisco options I just want with the pen option here for my app itself you have to make a decision how do you want your users to be able to connect to GlobalProtect do you want to do on-demand whereby the user manually initiates the connection or you can go with user logon or pre logon using machine certificate or pre logon then on demand these are just some options that you can choose the allow user to disable or protect that you do not need to allow your users to disable or protect but if you do you can say I want to allow it or disallow or allow with a comment or passcode or ticket if that's what you choose to do and if you do decide to allow users to disable disconnect you can set in thresholds but how many times they get to disable GlobalProtect now if I'm if I'm using a licensed version of GlobalProtect then I can do the hip collection but we're not looking at any of those advanced features right now okay so now I want to go ahead and look at the gateways the GlobalProtect gateway also is using local interface Ethernet 1/1 same ip and I currently have it using tunnel dot suit again I don't have to use tunnel that too or I don't have to use a tunnel at all I am choosing to and when I go into the Gateway and click on agent the option for tunnel mode is a checkbox if I want to use it I'll check the box if not I won't check the box if I do decide to use the tunnel then by default enable IPSec will be checked and if I do not want to use IPSec I can take that checkbox out whereby we will use SSL however if I leave that checkbox in I'm saying I want to use IPSec but if for any reason IPSec should fail go ahead and revert back to using SSL the option for enable X of x for support is do you want to allow extended authorization options but again that is an advanced feature which we don't need to look at right now we can we also have our timeout settings how long do you want the tunnel to live for if the tunnel is not being used or it's idle how long should it stay idle for before it's shut down for client settings I can identify different groups or users I can identify specific operating systems I want and in this case I'm only allowing Windows users and if you aren't going to be allowed to be connected then you would get an IP address from 192.168.100.1 through .25 the option for no direct access to local network simply means that if you are connected to GlobalProtect you no longer have access to devices on your local subnet for example your wireless printer ok the network services do you want your devices to inherit their information or do you want to manually enter it now again hit notification be an option if we had a licensed version of GlobalProtect the satellite option would be for large-scale VPN connections and that would be discussed in a later demonstration video so at this point we've configured everything we need to configure for GlobalProtects work so let's go ahead and test and verify that we are connected to GlobalProtect so we are now at the point where we can download the GlobalProtect agent for our Windows machine or our Mac device if you want it for a mobile device you can go to the App Store or the Play Store so you can install the agent that you want to use so just to show you I already have GlobalProtect enabled so I'll share this with you and here we have the welcome page for GlobalProtect we have the notice to users and we can say that we don't want to see this message again if we don't want to and I have my GlobalProtect icon which I will click here and we can see that we are connected to global protect and we have the portal that I'm connected to the assigned local IP the IP of the Gateway that I'm connected to the security protocol I'm using is IPSec and these are the specific details for GlobalProtect if I click on home I can see the URL for the portal and my username is visible and you also have to put in putting your password here so you can see that you are connected to global protect as you can see the status is connected so that's the end of our GlobalProtect demonstration video hope you all enjoyed it thank  you have a good day
