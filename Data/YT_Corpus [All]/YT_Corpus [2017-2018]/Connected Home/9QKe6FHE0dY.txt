 ON SATURDAY. NOT BEFORE THE BLOODY ATTACK KILLED SEVEN PEOPLE IN LONDON. AN UPDATE ON THE FBI RAID IN A DOOR BORN HOME LINKED TO A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE. WE BROKE THE STORY LAST THURSDAY. SINCE THEN THERE'S UNFOUNDED CLAIMS THAT IT WAS TIED TO THE FAMILY OF AN AIDE TO HILLARY CLINTON. TONIGHT JONATHAN CHARLES SON IS AT FBI HEADQUARTERS SEPARATING FACT FROM FICTION.  Reporter: AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND FEDERAL AGENTS HAVE TO REMAIN COY ON THE INVESTIGATION AS TO NOT JEOPARDIZE IT. THAT LEAVES A HOLE FOR ACCUSATIONS. A SOURCE TELLS ACTION NEWS THAT A MAN WAS TAKEN IN TO CUSTODY AND THE FOCUS WAS CENTERED IN ANOTHER STATE AND THE MATERIALS LOOKING FOR, HERE. THE NIGHT OF THE RAID, THOSE AT THE HOME NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS.  CAN YOU TELL US WHY THE FBI WAS NOT HERE AT THE HOME TODAY? THE FBI HAS BEEN TIGHT LIP AND THAT'S ONLY FUEL IT HAD THE SPECULATION. THEY STARTED TO CLAIM THE HOME AND THEN A MICHIGAN NATIVE SUGGESTING THAT THE RAID COULD BE PART OF THE CLINTON E-MAIL SCANDAL. THEY START TODAY DIG AND CROSS CHECKING THE CLAIMS WITH THE PROPERTY RECORDS AND FINDING THE OWNER OF THE HOME AND THE SUSPECT TAKEN IN TO CUSTODY AND WE ALSO CONSULTED WITH THE FBI TODAY AND THEY HAD NO EXCEPT, BUT SOURCES THAT WOULD KNOW TOLD ME THAT THE CLAIMS ARE DOWN RIGHT FALSE, AND NOTHING MORE THAN INTERNET NOTER.
