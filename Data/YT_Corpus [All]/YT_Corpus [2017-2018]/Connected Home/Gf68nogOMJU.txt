 hi guys my name is tamij i am from takeoff So today we are going to discuss about the IOT Based Home Automation For World Wide Accessing which means we can access total home automation through world wide where ever we go so in this project i am using Node mcu Wi-Fi module which can be used for Wi-Fi so i am using supply as a transformer which gives 12 volts AC supply so converting the AC to DC i am using a separate power supply board which gives the 5 volts DC power supply so this 5 volts dc supply is connecting to the Node mcu which will used to control the whole loads. loads means bulb and fan so whenever we are going to give instruction the load should be on and load should be off for that purpose we are using relay which will trigger when the instruction is given and when the instruction is given as off it automatically trigger and the bulb will be off so how we are going to control so we are using a cloud server. cloud server means accessing the cloud so for example in the cloud server we have Facebook,gmail for that purpose we have separate login user id and password in the cloud server also we have a user id and login through that we will login to that particular account and there we will add this IP address as a host name and then we will operate these loads through the particular IP Address here we have discussed about the block diagram of our project Now we are going to see the hardware how the hardware use in our project we have already discuss about the block diagram now we are going to see the hardware components which we will looks like this so transformer this is the transformer may look like a different compared to the real time so this is the power supply which we are going to use in our project and this is the relay board which will use for switching the functions so whole total controlling of the operations we are using Node Mcu so this is the Wifi Module which can be controlled wherever we go okay so this transformer stands for up to 230 volts AC it reduces the 230 volts ac and gives the output as 12 volts AC here we have some diodes which will control which will convert AC to DC supply and this voltage regulator is used to giving the 5 volts output voltage 5 volts why 5 volts our electronics components are very sensitive so we are using only 5 volts these 5 volts will given to the relay board through some connecting wires which we are using in our project After connecting the total connections the hardware will look like this so these are the loads which i am going to connect in our project.so here we have connected the connections see the connections carefully so the transformer is connected to the power supply board after this power supply board output is given to the Node MCU and likewise to the relay here from one relay to another relay we are transferring the supply with this we can control these loads here we are using only the dc voltage we can also control the AC voltage like this can directly connect this total set up in our home so we are showing this in a small plank here we are transferring the 230 volts AC to 12 volts AC to this power supply board and we are getting 5 volts voltage from the voltage regulator After that this 5 volts supply is share to the both the relays and this 5 volts supply is also given to the Node MCU here also i am using my data to this to my hotspot after with this WiFi it gets to the server then we can control wherever we go on our home loads So in this project after connecting i am now switching on the bulb now bulb is get on after that I'm going to switch on the fan you can see those two after that i am  going to switch of the bulb after that i am going to switch out fan itself so like wise we can control the home appliances where ever we go through wifi after that we are going to WiFi server and now i am operating the loads now the fan gets on you can see this after that i am going to switch on the light yeah after that i am going to switch of the fan itself you can see the relay will get trigger after that i am going to switch off the light this means where we go we can operate the home appliances where ever in the world so after that we can totally connect this set up to our home itself now i am showing it in a plank for a prototype so this is server which we are going to use control the home appliances through the world wide Here we are going to sign in after signing into this one these are home automation dashboard I'm using fan and light for the loads Here I am on the fan is off the fan off and after that fan off,light off like this we can control our home appliances wherever in the world so this is the site which we are going to use to control our home appliances through worldwide so this is the address and Here I am having a dashboard that I am using IOT home automation in that we have to loads fan and light now the fan will gets on after that lights get on and now lights get off and the fan will get off like wisely we can operate our home appliances wherever we go so for more exciting and innovative videos please subscribe to our channel
