 hi DIY arse sterling with alarm grid here and today we're going to show you how to wire up in AI GSM v4g dual path Honeywell AlarmNet communicator to a vista 20p honeywell wired alarm control panel on its own the vista 20p which is Honeywell flagship panel by far the most popular panel that Honeywell dealers will install for you it will only support phone line communication using the incoming phone terminals using a traditional analog phone line this system is not designed for digital phone service and all phone companies are transitioning away from analog phones and going to digital phones if it's not done already even if you have a true copper analog phone line in your house the chance that one of the switches on the phone system service ID from your house to the Central Station one of those switch is going to be digital as soon as your analog signal hits a digital switch it's as if you have VoIP phone in your house and you're going to have all of the same problems that people that use VoIP phones have with alarm signaling your signal may not reach the Central Station at all your signal that's supposed to hit to your account can hit to someone else's account there's all sorts of problems with voice with VoIP phone signaling using a digital phone service so we always recommend using either an internet cellular or dual path alarm communicator that goes through honeywell's managed AlarmNet servers the signaling is faster more reliable more secure and gives us a lot more ability to troubleshoot your system when there's issues know what's going on with your system because it's supervised and also you have the ability to get Total Connect 2.0 service which allows you to arm and disarm your system from a smartphone mobile device computer you can receive text and email alerts you can do z-wave home automation control Total Connect is a very powerful addition to a Vista 20p panel but you do need an alarm net communicator we're going to show you the I GSM v4g which is our most popular can in Decatur because it offers you the flexibility to use the speed of the internet path but also has the security and signal path reliability that cellular communications offers and what that means is if your internet fails it has a backup cellular communicator that uses AT&T cellular network to send the signal out to the servers into your central station or to the Total Connect service side so the process to wire the I GSM v4g to the panel is going to be the same if you're using any of the other AlarmNet communicators like the 78 47 I which is an internet-only communicator or the GSM v4g which is a cellular alarm communicator it'll be the same wiring we're going to show you how to do it with our most popular one I GSM v4g so the tools you're going to need you're going to need your i GS and v 4g communicator you're going to need your vista 20p control panel if you want Total Connect service your vista 20p will require a prompt chip version that is nine one two or higher so there's a black prong chip in the middle of the green circuit board it'll say W a 20 P - a number you need to have a version 9 1 2 or higher if you want a Total Connect 2.0 we have another video that shows you there's options to upgrade your prom depending on the version you have now and if your panel doesn't have a nine one two chip there's a chance you can still get Total Connect service and in fact we even offer the I GSM v4g as an IG SMB for G - TC - which comes with a prom upgrade chip and again we have a video that shows you that prom upgrade in this video we're just going to show you the wiring of the communicator to the panel once you have those two items and you verified you have the right prom version then we're also going to need the transformer that comes with the I GSM v4g this is a two prong plug in power supply it plugs into a standard wall outlet and provides power to the communicator the communicator also has a sealed lead-acid to Rebeck up so that if you lose power to this unit whether it's damage to this unit damage to the wire of this unit to here or just a simple power outage or power outlet issue this communicator will still work because of the battery backup same idea every alarm system is powered by a transformer and if the transformer gets unplugged or there's a power outage the system has a battery backup so the important thing is that your communicator will be ready when you need it as long as you're powering it with the right transformer and have the battery backup in addition to that equipment you're going to want a good pair of wire strippers you're going to want a nice little screwdriver which will fit the terminal screws both on the panel and the communicator that we're going to use to land the wiring to and we of course need some wire we have 22 gauge 4 conductor wire are commonly called 22 4 this is a solid core wire although you can certainly use stranded wire as well sometimes that's easier to work with it doesn't really matter it doesn't have to be shielded or anything fancier than that so 22 is the gauge or the thickness of the conductors not the thickness of the white sheet it's the thickness of the conductor on the inside and when we talk about conductor it's how many little wires are within the white sheet so in this case 22 4 is for conductor we have 4 different colors for different wires that we can use to connect the communicator to the panel so now that we know what we need for this project we're going to show you how to complete this project so your vista 20p panel as we discussed is powered by its own plug-in power supply which is just a 2 prong transformer plugs into a standard wall outlet the most common one you'll find on a vista 20p is a 13 21 Honeywell transformer which is a hundred and 20 volt input meaning a standard 120 volt outlet and it outputs 16.5 VA c25 VA so that's the rating of this transformer and that's the rating that's needed for a 20 P the IGS MV for G comes with a 1361 transformer from Honeywell which is the same 120 volt input from the regular standard wall outlet and it's also sixteen point five B AC output but it is a 40 VA so it's a higher voltage rating to give more power what you can do often times where your panel transformer is plugged in you may not have an available outlet so while you normally wire your I GSM v4g and mount it on the wall near your 20 P panel you may not have an available outlet and that can be a problem for some people however the good news is you can simply use a shared transformer so instead of wiring off your i gsm v 4g to this transformer and plugging this into an outlet if you don't have that spare outlet then you simply change this 1321 transformer that powers the panel out to the bigger 1361 transformer that comes with the i gsm v4g once you do that you can use this unit to provide power to both systems or both devices in parallel what that means is you would use the existing wiring from the 20 p on the twenty p the first two terminals of the panel are the AC input terminals power terminals AC is not polarity conscious so there's no positive or negative you simply have a 2 wire connection 1 and 2 runs through the wall and comes out wherever this is plugged into the wall you have two screw terminals on the back of the transformer that you'll see once you unplug it and if you were to disconnect these two what these 2 terminals by simply unscrewing them you would of course want to make sure you've removed this from the outlet and also disconnected a lead from your backup battery on your panel so now you have your panel fully powered down and you can disconnect the existing wiring which is no longer live to the 1321 to the smaller transformer and on the back of the 1361 you have the same two screws again it's AC power so there's no positive or negative there's no polarity you simply land one to one and one to the other Honeywell now sells the 1361 is a 1361 - t and that would have a third screw but you don't have to worry about that middle screw that's just a grounding screw I'm sorry 1361 g t is in grounding terminal and again that would be in the middle a lot of people get confused and think they go AC to GT the grounding terminal you don't you just do the two AC terminals so we're using the existing wiring that's run through the wall you want to make sure you screw it down nice and tight so the wire doesn't come loose like it just did to me you'll find off in that the wire that's already landed to the old terminal has a nice little fish hook on the end so that you can wrap it around the screw terminal and make a really good contact so that you don't have any loose connection or bad connection all right now we have a nice tight connection on both terminals and we now have a transformer which will work just fine to power the 20p and more importantly has enough VA rating that we can run a two wire connection off of one and two on the panel and land it on terminals 1 and 2 on the IGS NV and again we've we've now eliminated the need for a second outlet to be near where we're going to install this unit because we're using the one transformer to run power to here and then we have our 1 and 2 connection off of here going to 1 and 2 on here and the 1361 powers both units and it is a approved wiring setup when using the IGS MV for G if you happen to have the other outlet it's even easier just run one and 2 off of here to the 1361 and leave the panel power alone so now that we've reviewed the different ways to run power to these units I'm going to swap my panel and my communicator to have a nice view of both and we're going to detail the wiring that goes between the two and the wiring to the transformer so we're going to cut a length of wire off of our spool of 22 4 and depending on where you're mounting this most people just mount it right to the side of the panel so you don't need very long wire but you simply cut a length for how long you need between the two devices and you strip off the outer feet using your wire strippers you have your 4 conductors and again you're going to have to strip the ends of each conductor this is 22 gage you and on the other end we already had stripped the sheet to explain what 22:4 is but we do need to strip each conductor and now we have nice clean ends on both sides for conductor each this wire is traditional color which is black red yellow and green if you have wire that has different color it doesn't matter don't get hung up on the color it's all about which terminal on here is going to which terminal on here we're of course going to show you the proper convention for the color but again it really doesn't matter if your wire is a different color it's still going to work so even though we're getting power to this into this off the transformer there's still a power connection from here to the panel's power output and that starts on terminal number three on the i gsm v 4g i'm going to turn my unit here so you can see the numbers of the screw terminals and follow along with what i'm doing here so terminal number three on the i gsm v 4g goes to terminal number five counting from the left on the twenty p and that is your positive power output so the panel gets power input from the transformer 16 and a half volts and pushes out 12 volts on terminal five and the ground or the negative the negative output for that 12 volt power output is number four and that's what we're going to connect first is those power connections so we land our red wire or a positive wire to Terminal three on this terminal on this terminal block I'm going to show you how this works there's screws on the backside here and on the front side you can see there's a gap on all the ones I haven't wired yet that gap means it's open the terminal block is open you can fit your wire in and then on the top side you screw it down and it closes the terminal connection to keep your wire tight so those terminals are what they use on the I GSM v4g on the 20 P it's more of just a simple screw with a contact underneath and you're just loosen the screw enough that you can fit your wire underneath making sure that you're not extending your exposed wire or too far where it can jump over and touch any of the other terminals they do have these black blocks to prevent that type of thing but depending on how long you strip your wire we have seen people where it gets a little messy in there so you don't want to go too far or too big on this portion of the wire also we have a nice clean panel here when you're adding this to your systems you're going to have a lot of things wired on here if you have keypads or wired here if you have wireless receivers they're wired here if you have four wire motion detectors or glass break detectors or smoke detectors they're going to be wired here so don't get confused by that all you simply do is land multiple wires under the same screw terminal making sure that you don't let any of the existing wires fall out if they do fall out make sure they go they go right back to the same terminal they were on so again you can land multiple wires under one screw on this panel as long as the wire connection on your wire is making contact to the metal screw you're good to go so again we have terminal three on the IGS mv4 g2 terminal five on the vista 20p now we go to the next one on terminal four is our black wire we insert the wire to the open terminal block make sure it's in there I know we're blocking the view right now but just to make sure it doesn't fall out you get it nice and tight on the top give a little tug to make sure it's not loose you don't want these wires falling out you're going to have issues with supervision of this unit to here and on this side four goes to four so again you're going to have other things landed on four here you just loosen the screw enough to be able to fit your black wire and land it to four that is your power connection so that if you did lose power from the transformer the vista 20p is still feeding power over to this unit to keep it held up so now we need our data connection data is data in and data out and that's our green and our yellow wires so we're going to do terminal number five on the IG sm v 4g is the yellow wire feed the wire into the opening screw it down tight make sure you give a little tug it doesn't fall out five on the IG sm v 4g goes to seven on the 20p when we talk about data in and out we're talking about a device that needs to be able to pass data to the panel and vice versa so when the panel has an alarm signal needs to pass that data to the communicator so it can send its signal to Honeywell servers for Central Station and/or Total Connect service that's why we need for connections power and data so we've got five to seven data and now we have six on the i gsm v 4g goes to 6 on the 20p which is our last keypad bus terminal that is not used open up the screw terminal to fit the green wire under make sure we're not loosening any other connections that might over to be present there screw it down so now we're fully connected wire to wire in this case you would want to have run the wire through a knockout on the control panel so that when you close your panel lid you're not crimping this wire I failed to do that here but they have multiple knockouts that you can use on this 20p cabinet there's one here there's some on the top and so you can kind of pry those out and feed your wire through there so that when you close your cover you're not going to be pinching this wire the important thing is you get your connections mapped properly so with those connected we can now address the power connections to the I GSM v4g we don't want the panel feeding power to here all the time we want the transformer to be feeding power to here and the panel's only here is a backup when you lose power to the transformer and again you would have wanted to feed these wires through this back hole on this on the IG smv 4G or try to notch the plastic out here there's a little tab that you can notch out so that when you have the cover on the I GSM v4g you're not pinching this wiring so we're going to need another length of wire if you get a length of 22 4 just make sure you have enough for this connection and then enough for another connection from here to your transformer however far that may be if you're doing the separate transformer if you're doing the shared transformer that we discussed then you don't have to run the transformer because the transformer is already feeding power to the 20p and you're just making your 1 & 2 connection on the IGS MV or g2 1 & 2 on the panel so that bigger 1361 transformer is powering both units in parallel so we're just going to cut another similar length of wire we strip our white sheath off to expose the internal conductors and just for convention we can use black and red which is normally used for power you can even double these wires up if you were using skinnier 22 gauge wire oftentimes you'd want to use probably 18 gauge wire when running direct to your transformer power wire you want to be a little bit thicker depending on your wire run in this case with such a short run 22 is fine I'm just going to trim back the green and the yellow connectors and conductors and just use the black in the red so we strip the ends and we have our connection that we can land here strip the other end turn back the green and the yellow strip the red and black and we now have our wire ready to connect from 1 & 2 on the 20 P to 1 & 2 on the I GSM v4g this is AC power again no polarity there's no positive or negative you simply land each one and make sure to screw it down tight you want to tug on the wire after screwing you want to make sure it's not coming out going out to pull too hard but just give a nice little tug to make sure it's not loose and you put your black into the other terminal that you that you did in this case we did black on to our red on to and black on 1 you could have done the opposite it would work the same you would feed your wiring through the wire channel that you knock out here or through the back if you've got a hole that you can run through the wall you would either come in through the back of here there's knockouts in the 20p so knockouts along the 20p and you feed it in to the panel to keep things consistent we can certainly put red to red and black to black it doesn't matter you could swap it AC power no polarity last connection tighten it down give a nice little tug make sure nothing oak and we'll lo and behold this one came out on my tug so we're going to make sure that one gets down nice and tight we would never want that to fall out on its own especially because once we plug that transformer and that's a live wire you would never want that to fall out and touch anything else on this board potentially do damage to the board so now we have our ECP connection data and power 3 2 5 4 2 4 5 2 7 & 6 2 6 and we have our power run shared transformer 1 & 2 2 1 & 2 and then 1 & 2 to the 1361 transformer and that is all of the connections that we need at this point we can plug our battery leads back in we've got our one read connection disconnected to keep the unit fully powered down you'll notice that on the I GSM v4g it will power up off the battery only so as soon as I'm touching this lead to the terminal we're seeing light activity on the board so this will power up off its battery only whereas on the 20p when you connect your battery it's still not powered until you plug your transformer back into your standard wall outlet so last step is plug this in you'll often see there's a screw which we just have removed right now that if you remove the screw in the center of your 2 outlet wall plate you can screw it through here into your wall plate to hold the wall plate to the outlet so that this doesn't get unplugged accidentally if someone sees this screw it into the outlet they're never going to unplug this that's because this is critical you don't want this getting unplugged because you don't want your panel or your communicator to lose power once the battery is drained you don't want your cleaning lady to say oh I need an available outlet for my vacuum cleaner I'm just going to unplug this for a little while that screw prevents someone from accidentally unplugging this not realizing what it's doing so now that you've got this connected we've got our proper prom we now have a system that can be monitored either internet cellular or dual path it can do Central Station service and/or Total Connect 2.0 service and with the right monitoring service you're all set up so if you have any questions on wiring up any of the AlarmNet communicators whether it's the i gsm v 4g the 78 47 i the gsm v 4g to your vista 20p vista 15 p panel please
