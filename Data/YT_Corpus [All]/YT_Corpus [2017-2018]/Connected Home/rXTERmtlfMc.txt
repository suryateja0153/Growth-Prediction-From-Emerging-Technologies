 Hello Barbie, CogniToys Dino, and Amazon Echo are part of a new wave of connected toys and gadgets for the home that listen. We sought to understand how parents and children interact with Internet-connected toys, particularly with respect to their privacy expectations and mental models for these interactions. We conducted interviews with parent-child pairs in which they interacted with Hello Barbie and CogniToys Dino, shedding light on children's awareness of the toys' ability to record and parents' privacy concerns. Our findings will help inform the future designs of interactive, connected toys and gadgets.
