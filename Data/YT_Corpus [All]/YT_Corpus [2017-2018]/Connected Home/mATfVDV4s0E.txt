 let's live from Lincoln as she's finding out more hey candy good morning so imagine baby being able to save yourself money and also give yourself peace of mind did you shut the garage door maybe you need a reminder to take a tea instead of 50 there are a lot of things that your home can help you with I'm just saying you know we wake up early you can be forgetful in the morning and so this is a way to be able to help you you don't even need to have a smart phone to be able to do something like this there's a lot of different things you can do this is a new business bill you just started this back in January it's called connected technology now I see the wires out which lets me know that I should not be anywhere near this what are you putting in right now actually we're putting in a control panel for the smart home house there's a lot of different things that we can do at this house for this customer we have lighting controls happening for her we have a ring doorbell we have some heating and air conditioning controls we're installing a garage door opener control right now for her and a lot of different things happen just as she leaves her house naturally you could do something by putting it with your phone if you always have your phone on you so when you leave it knows that you're leaving let me take you outside so we can show you here how this is gonna work with the garage door opener and so you also can if you don't want to do it on your phone you can have something that's like a key fob right and so you would have a little tiny thing that you would keep maybe in your car and as you leave the house well their garage knows oh they're leaving and the garage instantly goes down you can put these things on timers right so that it knows at a certain time you'd this is what time you want your air conditioning to come on and what about when you leave can you make it go to a certain temperature yes sir absolutely it can work either on timers but really the automation works the best just with the occupancy sensor just to know whether you're a home or not and when your leave it can close your garage door or lock your front door turn your air conditioner back to a certain temperature set your lights to operate in a certain way you want them to go some people buy some of these things that like a home depot or lowes they install it and then they have no idea how to use it and that's where you guys can come in you can actually install that and then walk people through how they can use it but what what does what you do make it better than just installing it yourself well I think probably the biggest thing is that there are some security concerns with smart products you know everybody asks questions about you know products whether or not they can be hacked or not and there are certain safety steps that you want to put in place just to make sure that they are secure also a lot of them have to do with electrical controls your heating and air controls and if you don't do those right you can actually cause damage to your property coming up in the next hour we are gonna show you how all of this stuff works including if you know someone who lives alone if this is this product is going to change their life while you want to have this at your front door has to do with the doorbell we're gonna show you that coming up in the next hour it's called connected technology find them if you'd like to make your home a little smarter and save a little money all right it's a way of the future for sure it can be Thanks
