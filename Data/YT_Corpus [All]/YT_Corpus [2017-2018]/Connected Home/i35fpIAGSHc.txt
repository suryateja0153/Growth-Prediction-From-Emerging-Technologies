 This video will show you how to replace batteries in the following XFINITY Home door and window sensors. You’ll need one, three volt CR2450 battery per device and double-sided tape should you need to remove the sensor. First, be sure to disarm your XFINITY Home security system. Now, place your thumb and index finger on the sloped ends of the sensor cover and slide the cover away from the magnetic end to pull the cover off the sensor. After removing the cover from the sensor - you may receive a “tamper alert” from your system. The tamper alert warns you when the cover of your device is open and will clear once the battery is replaced and the cover is reattached. Avoid touching the tamper switch while the cover is off. Touching the tamper switch may reset the sensor to factory settings. Next, remove the old battery by using your fingertip to pull one end of the battery up until it is loose. Insert the new battery by placing it flat against the prongs in the battery compartment - with the positive side facing you. To attach the sensor cover, align the small tab on the inside the cover with the indented slot track on the front of the sensor. Press the cover down on the sensor and slide it back into place.
