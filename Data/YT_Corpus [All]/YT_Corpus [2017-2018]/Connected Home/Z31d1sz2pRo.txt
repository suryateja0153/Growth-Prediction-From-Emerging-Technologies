 As you can see it's raining, we're having some difficulties besides just being cold and wet hanging new drywall got the mud on the wall since the HVAC system is disconnected right now while it's being worked on there's no climate control on the home so all the humidity out here is in there so the muds just not going to dry, so I'm hoping that we can catch up on that part of it come the beginning of the week on Monday and Tuesday, when hopefully the weather is supposed to be nicer. Well let's squeeze in here and look and see what we've done. Yeah you get a lot of stuff going on back here so talk to us about what you did in here there's a whole house HEPA filtration system. This is a media type of cabinet and what's great about it is, it's typically a furnace filter is just an inch thick. Sure. Because of the environment the Zeke's working in, in his art studio we've got wood work, we've got dust that's permeating not just down here but through the house so. Sure. This will remove about 90% of that. This is a 4-inch pleated filter you can change it probably sometimes yearly with this environment I bet he's going to be changing this probably every six months. Back behind you there, we've got a very expensive piece of equipment donated by The Goodman folks. Yes. We can't thank them enough. Tell us what that does. Well this little wonderful hose here is leading to a steam humidifier, this is really going to help manage the comfort level in the house this is really gives the house a lot better, not just efficiency but more comfort.
