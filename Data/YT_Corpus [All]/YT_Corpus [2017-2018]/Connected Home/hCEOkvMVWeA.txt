 Hi, my name is Jigar Shaw. I’m the president of Generate Capital and I’ve been working in the solar and wind energy industry since 1995. I think the energy future really looks like scaling up these technologies that have already been invented. There is a set of technologies that are going to be transformative for Canada, so while renewable energy I think has been transformative, not only for Canada but for other parts around the world, I think you’re going to see electric vehicles really take their place very soon. Even fuel cells for fork lifts and for other industrial uses. And I also think that you’re going to see a huge change in agriculture and the way in which we use energy in agriculture in fertilizer, water and other areas. So, I’m excited about the future. What you’re going to see in the future is a move to the connected home where you have an ability to shut of lights and things from your phone. You have the ability to shut off different loads from the utility centre because the utilities believe that that’s actually a cheaper way of levelling the grid than adding more natural gas peaker plants Canada is a very generous nation around the world and helping Caribbean countries move to this clean energy economy I think really matters with Canadian technology.
