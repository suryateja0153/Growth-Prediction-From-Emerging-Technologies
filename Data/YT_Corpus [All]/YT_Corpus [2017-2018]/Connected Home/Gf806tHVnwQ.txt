 okay so now in the emergency how many of you here have seen Doctor Who how many are Doctor Who people know you guys are smiling but you never saw doctor oh my god doctor who is the oldest sci-fi TV series that exists older than Star Trek British and in the old days it was very low-tech and one of the bad guys one of the super bad guy groups which is still in the new reasonable recent sort of higher tech ones BBC thing they're really very high tech now robots or a robot race but they have human brains implanted in them like reycarts what I want to do it's out of Stanford in 2045 he wants to put all of us in robots then we won't have any more problems you know only two eternal will be eternal robots and he has all these wealthy people supporting him that's completely lunatic neuroscientist who's going to and what it is is he has a machine that you know when you just at the point of death should appeal your brain like an onion and it's gonna take all the patterns in your brain and plant them in the robot and then you'll be eternal in the robot nurses don't worry it'll be a soft skin biological robot it we won't be clanking into each other loony people who don't want to fix this planet you know so they're gonna make something else anyway these are called the Daleks and in those days originally the Daleks looked like Hoover vacuum cleaners gone berserk and they were going around and they had these things they would go exterminate you know and then doctor who would do them but minting I'm sorry I shouldn't get distracted Doctor Who is a Time Lord but they called time glory comes from the end of this universe from the Gallifrey which is where the timer was living he's the last time world except there's one bad guy time nor that he interacts with in some of the earlier episodes and thousands of episode zero and he has nine lives and two hearts and he sort of comes out to all these tremendous adventures you know but the point is he can visit anywhere in time and he helps beings on other planets of this planet and his vehicle is a police box it looks like a blue of London police box like a phone booth basically from outside but inside it's huge it's like has rooms and rooms and laboratories and swimming pools and mansions it's like enormous inside and Doctor Who dark and vimalakirti houses like that Fela Kuti has a house that looks like the regular house in the city of I Charlie but then thousands of people can go inside the house and they note and then they they bring Thrones into the house from another universe at one point which are thirty two hundred thousand leagues tall come inside the house and then people in order to sit on them to listen to that particular teaching at that moment they have to make their bodies forty two hundred thousand leagues the league is about seven miles tall your Genesis and rebirth means the amount of distance that an oxcart can travel in a day about seven miles ten mile and then they're different then they have to learn how to suddenly be huge like you suddenly change dimensions and in other words it's very sci-fi as what I'm trying to say and it definitely comes from at the latest that as a piece of literature from the second century of the Common Era when it was first translated into Chinese Western scholars make their dating of Buddhist Mahayana texts by basically when the first Chinese translation is made and then they'll go back 150 years and decide maybe it was there for 150 years before it was translated do they have a rule of thumb like that which is completely arbitrary and they really have no idea the Buddhists my on the Buddhists anyway claim that these this does record events that happen in Buddha's time and the Mahayana teachings there are over Shakyamuni Buddha but that he purposely suppressed them ahead of time saying he didn't want them spread widely in India for 400 years the Mahayana teachings but that of course is totally discredited by modern scholars because they don't believe anybody would have such a view of life and society in history that they would say something would be appropriate for 400 years later but it isn't appropriate now although I for your group that I'm teaching it is appropriate I'm teaching you but I don't want to spread widely so he entrusted it to some beings I think to merchants actually to the merchant class which was his big class that backed the Buddha the Brahmins didn't really back him they were worried about the Buddhist monks competing with them and the Warriors thought Buddha who was a warrior class at King trials royal class so he was a traitor to his class you know it was like started all these nonviolent monks wandering around instead of concrete you know and having a good army and all this like his dad wanted him to do so so Westerners won't believe that dad so you can take your pick of the different views I personally agree with the Buddhists and I think this ability is known he's known as someone who was a wealthy layman and by Charlie in the Buddha's time from all the different versions of Buddhist but his history but that he was such a person as this and as recorded in the Sutra how many of you found on the website the text of the Sutra in English yeah well you've read the before they make it clear right so this was a really popular Sutra obviously in India it was not particularly popular in Tibet although it was known of course they had it translated it's very popular in China Korea and Japan and various Emperor's that people wrote commentaries on earth and they were really fond of every mother carroty Dogon the famous Zen master he very much respects people acuity although he complains about the maturity you know sometimes that he wasn't respectful enough to the monks because the remulak er T is very famous and that he's a layman but he's always teaching the monks even the high and light monks within the terroir love you you know who are the world's closest disciples who are our hats already a meaning sort of scenes but they have a dualistic world view and implicit is always questioning them and if you read the sutras oh but not many most of you have not read it right this Sutra so if you read the Sutro you will see that he's he's always in dialoguing with sharp hutong was considered the closest disciple of the buddha if you see paintings or statues of Shakyamuni Buddha there's two monks on two sides usually in front of him one of them is shariputra the other one is Narayana Mogollon as they say in pali and so he's very high he's like st. Peter you know shariputra for the Terracotta people but for the Mahayana people he's like the epitome of dualistic thinking because of the terrible of Buddhism is but not only to have all of those a 17 or 18 different schools of Monk monastic Buddhist in the in the Buddhist time and they are all considered dualistic and they're dualistic in the sense that they think Nirvana is somewhere else and they want to get away from this world and get to Nirvana
