 joining us with some ways to turn your house into a smart home it can be yeah so there is a business called connected technology that helps you do all of this one of the things that I wanted to show you guys this is a doorbell you ring the doorbell when the doorbell goes on the light comes on there is a camera that's here well the light should come on but we've been turning things on and off because we're studying some more things up in heathers has a camera right here I promise it worked earlier when everything was connected this has a camera now Heather inside her home can look at the camera and decide if she even wants to come and open the front door to whoever is there so there's a lot of good safety thing now let me show you over here the nest because a lot of people are familiar with it a lot of people don't know all of the things they can do one of the things you can do is when you are about half a mile away from your home it'll turn off then when you get about half a mile near the home it will turn back on and so really able to program that so that you are never sweating in your home and you're also not wasting any money has this saved you very much hunter well I don't know because it's all very new yeah but it works very well you're able to turn on some turn on and off some lights which we're gonna show yeah you have a Google home back here we're gonna pay attention to and that's just one of them that she has in control isn't that cool and so she's able to do that with multiple lights in her home now bills working on setting this up over here which she's almost done and that's why we've been having some of the power going on and off at the moment because you've been setting this up what will this be able to do for Heather so this is this is a one location that allows her to do all of the smart home activities that are that are here for her so she can mostly control it by voice or even from her phone by voice on her phone or from touching it but say somebody comes to our home that doesn't have her phone or it doesn't recognize their voice say a house sitter or somebody coming to take care of their dogs then they can come and use this control panel to control the automation as well now you open this business connected technology in January you said really you saw a need especially for senior citizens because this is a big thing for safety yeah it's pretty amazing the quality of life changes that can happen just with some simple automation so for example some of the things that we talked about earlier leaving the house and not having to worry if your garage doors closed or your front door is locked I think more importantly though we can make the house look like your home even when you're not home you had mentioned the ring doorbell even when she's not at home she can see who's at her front door and she can talk to them yeah and that light will come on and so it makes it seem like someone's there let me end with this really quick just in case Heather wanted to leave and we were coming over to her home she could actually look at the camera see that it's us although if she saw was me she might just say keep that door lock but if she wanted to let us in she could remotely open the front door all of a sudden the door will just let you be able to go inside but she's able to look at you and see if she wants to let you in or not it's called connected technology get in touch with Bill he does a huge presentation and Heather was saying that he always wears his booties when he comes in he's super easy to work with and make sure that he treats his home like it is in their own home yeah great idea I love that connected technology I love the being able to open the door remotely yeah off site turning your lights on and off and the whole air-conditioner thing I mean being able to just be comfortable no matter when you're home can be great
