 REPORTER: PULLING INTO HIS GARAGE FRIDAY NIGHT --  I SAW IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT HE WAS PULLING UP AND GETTING OUT OF THE VEHICLE. REPORTER: JASON CYZA KNEW SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT. A COMPLETE STRANGER, FOLLOWING HIM INSIDE.  HE WAS DOWN IN BETWEEN THE VEHICLES IN BETWEEN THE TWO CARS. OBVIOUSLY AT THAT POINT I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO ROB ME. REPORTER: CYZNA, SCARED, CONFRONTING THE MAN, AND CALLING 91  HE JUST KEPT MUMBLING THAT HE NEEDED TO GO HOME. REPORTER: THE MAN, NOW IDENTIFIED AS 26-YEAR-OLD PATRICK O'MALLEY. CYZA HELPED HIM BACK INTO HIS CAR. DEPUTIES TELL US O'MALLEY WAS UNCONSCIOUS WHEN THEY ARRIVED, SO HE WENT TO LAKESIDE HOSPITAL BY AMBULANCE.  THEY DID PULL SOME EMPTY PILL BOTTLES, SOME ALCOHOL FROM THE VEHICLE. REPORTER: FASTFORWARD 24 HOURS, JUST A MILE AWAY. ACCORDING TO POLICE, A MAN, STILL WEARING BLUE HOSPITAL SCRUBS, FORCES HIS WAY INSIDE A HOUSE, ASSAULTS A WOMAN, AND RUNS OFF WITH HER CELL PHONE POLICE FIND THEIR SUSPECT NEARBY, PATRICK O'MALLEY.  YEAH, JUST SHOCK. REPORTER: JASON CYZA SAYS HE RECOGNIZED O'MALLEY FROM OUR STORY SUNDAY NIGHT, AS THE SAME MAN IN HIS GARAGE THE NIGHT BEFORE.  I JUST HOPE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL GETS HELP. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH OR WHAT THE LADY ON SATURDAY NIGHT WENT THROUGH. REPORTER: THE DOUGLAS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE TELLS ME THEY DID NOT KNOW O'MALLEY WAS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. THE CHIEF DEPUTY SAYS THEY FOLLOWED PROCEDURE, BECAUSE AT THAT POINT, IT WAS MORE OF A MEDICAL CASE. THEY DO PLAN TO CITE O'MALLEY FOR MARIJUANA POSSESSION AND TRESPASSING. AND HE'LL FACE A ROBBERY CHARGE FOR THE HOME INVASION.
