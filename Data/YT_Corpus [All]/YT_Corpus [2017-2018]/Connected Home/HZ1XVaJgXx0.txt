 I don't I had is where you are but here in Florida we love talking about the weather even when it's great like this but that got me thinking it was time for a new weather station so I've had one here the house it's plenty reliable still worked great but it was just old it was an LCD display and it wasn't connected at all time for something better time for something to monitor time for something definitely more modern let's go take a look so I needed a new weather station and I did what anyone in my position would go do I typed in what is the best weather station and one that consistently came up was the tap mode and that by the way is how you say it in the tap mode so I went with the tap mode and actually was able to find some deals on Amazon so cut around a little bit before you buy and I'll have links down below that will help you at all now the tempo has a few things that you can buy when it comes to weather right so you've got your basic indoor outdoor station one part of it goes inside and tells you about the inside of your house one part of the state's outside and tells you what it's like outside pretty simple then you can also buy a rain gauge and that's the one that I actually like a lot especially living here in Florida because here it's either monsoon or desert and not a whole lot of in-between then there's a we engaged and I don't really care about that quite as much so I didn't bother getting it but if you want to know if the winds is like or if you want your neighbors to note the windows like now get more into that a second you can get one so the indoor module is surprisingly small less bigger in pictures here's a frozen banana for scale don't don't ask don't judge me then you have the outdoor module it's a little bit smaller and that's good because I'm going to want to hide it up there and leave it outside it uses a couple batteries and I honestly don't know how long it'll last yet we'll just have to see setup is simple enough you're going to pair the indoor module to your phone and then you're going to pair the outdoor module to the indoor module and any of the other modules that you get the rain gauge or the wind gauge you'll pair in the same way is easy enough if you've ever paired anything to anything and that's that you're going to have your account all set up and then everything just works so what kind of information do you get with all this well and you get temperature of course you get wind speed and you get one speed even if you don't have the wind gauge it will pluck that out of other places where wind comes from including other users definitely dig the iPad app pretty simple and really the same information you get anywhere else but I like the way to present it so you get temperature minute max for the day we're up to almost 94 already in May so the mobile apps are pretty good very functional and they look very similar I'm tell you everything you're going to see current weather outdoor temperature pressure dewpoint humidity forecast stuff like that on the bottom you have inside you have your co2 level you have indoor temperature Y of a sound meter and humidity if I tap here and I'll show me the minimum and maximum for the day so that's kind of cool so right now it's at the hottest point of the day and we're only in May down on the bottom we have indoors so I have indoor air temperature and air quality that's co2 carbon dioxide boys and girls back from science class again minimum maximum time I will also has a really good website if you don't want to deal with phones and you just want to get things that way cool you just log in and it's all there pretty easy to see you can see any or all of your sensors so I have inside outside and rainy mccrane face you can go to the weather map here is well and see not just your station but everyone's station here the weather map you can see the top most stations everywhere except for in the desert apparently most of the desert pretty cool you can click through here and get temperature and rain and wind information all in one place oh and the indoor sensor to tells you how loud it is so when your kids are in there throw a party as my six-year-old is prone to do especially if early in the morning on the weekend you'll know it so does weather stuff is actually just part of what the top mode on they also do security cameras and they have a couple different models prices get up there a little bit but they look pretty cool they have a healthy home coach which is supposed to make it better for you at home ok and if you're in Europe they actually make a thermostat as well but that was not available to us here in the US I'm really hoping that no tap mo or somebody else builds a third-party skill for the new Amazon echo show how great would this be so you've got an always-on display you can always see what the weather is very quickly or you know I could just stick my head outside I guess so that's it for the top mode now it's not inexpensive I get that but I do like that it's modular so you by as much or as little of it as you like I have the basic indoor/outdoor station I have the rain gauge and bother getting the winds gauge just because I don't really care how windy it is outside they've got a pretty good API so all sorts of things tie into it my nest ties into it anything that ties into if this the net can talk to it super simple so if you have any more questions about this let me know down in the comments be sure to subscribe sign up the newsletter if you haven't already we're having a lot of fun with that see you next time [Music]
