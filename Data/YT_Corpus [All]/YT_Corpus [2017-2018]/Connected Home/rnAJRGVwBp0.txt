Wow! Seriously? How did you do that? You're like a genie Did that just turn on? Yes Yes it did Woooow Whaaat? Meet Hayo it transforms the space and objects around you into a set of magical remote controls With just a simple movement of your hand Hayo allows you to control: Lights Music Television Temperature and much more...
