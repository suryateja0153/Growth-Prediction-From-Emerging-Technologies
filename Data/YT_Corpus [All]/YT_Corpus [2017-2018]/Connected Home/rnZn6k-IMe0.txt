 hello this one is dill three five two one laptop and this laptop problem is when we connect adapter adapter when we connect adapter adapter light goes off okay now we open this laptop and check what is the problem because we remove no open [Music] [Music] [Music] now after removing all the screws Navi open its keyboard [Music] nobody move Lavie now we again connect adapter and check what happened adapter light goes off or not after light okay now we connect a tapper light goes off means something is sought there somebody now we take sorting step by step first we take 19 volt line is okay or not by using multimeter now we check for some ground pin this one is drawn both are ground this one is 19 gold line red wire 19 volt now we take few G's okay from this fuel MOSFET is connected PQ one double zero now we take this MOSFET you take this MOSFET one side so value will be worse side now we take your second MOSFET is okay or not this one is connected more than this one is second MOSFET now we take this it souls ii MOSFET souls 0 3 reverse the probe again 0 3 means this one is salt now we remove and take oops and slugs now we remove this MOSFET which one is sort no removing first we take this MOSFET again again it shows point zero four zero five sort on both sides means this one is faulty MOSFET now we take on board link shows value it was the probe again so no value means this MOSFET is faulty now we take this more fret number is four four zero nine minutes it's P channel MOSFET plane the track now we put care of working be channel MOSFET now before we putting a working P channel MOSFET here we take sorting on both side is gone or not first we take input side one probe to ground and next to its input side no value no sorting now we take output side it's so zero twelve pain means sorting has not been gone now we open this PR one zero two its way in line means 19 bold line now we remove PR one zero two we can put jumper on this side or this side to check sorting means jumper means from DC power supply I am removing this [Music] no after removing this we check again we tape output side this side no sorting input side no sorting output side cotton on this one is 19 volt line now we set our DC power supply in nineteen world and make ampere and zero now we connect these two wives worth first one way to brown no second we're 219 volt output side okay now we connect ground to ground and stay positive now we increase ampere step-by-step for checking sorting point ninety sufficient point 82 is taking point 7 ampere now we check which component is getting heat [Music] this one this PF is taking more heat I'm skating heat no of DC power supply now we take this it shows zero six zero seven no we remove this PF and check you know after removing we take 14 I mean first we take this PF it's Souls 0 to 0-3 this one is bad now we take on board sorting is gone or not he was the probe no again we was the probe no Valley no we check output side again sorting has been gone now we put first to be [Music] there one more way to check this navi on the DC power supply no ampere now we give ampere giving ampere it's 19 volt ampere off no sorting okay now we remove in this motherboard first component is faulty this MOSFET a p-channel MOSFET we have to not put here after that we have to put a a PF here now we put a working MOSFET and a PF now we put a working MOSFET it's a P channel MOSFET movie put we are 1:02 back no backside of peers [Music] now we plane I'm ready no we connect this is x4 switch you connect after connecting lights now we switch on getting on now we connect speaker for sitting this laptop one two three I forgot to connect I was you know we connect this it beep office coming because of this cable I'm not connected now we again switch on laptop on having this ability thank you for watching videos if you like my videos please subscribe audit double 1 triple T
