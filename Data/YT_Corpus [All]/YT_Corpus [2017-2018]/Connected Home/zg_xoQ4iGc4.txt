 yes I this is Jim Nolan from into digital and want to welcome you to individuals booth live from mwc we would like to discuss IOT in this segment and an IOT and 5g or two of the hottest segments and that that are being shown at mwc so we'd like to focus on the promise of IOT the value of the data and what could be extracted from the data current state of the market also we'd like to talk to the panelist on their vision and experiences in IOT and also different trends opportunities and challenges that they see so I'll introduce myself I'm Jim Nolan on the executive vice president of into digital solutions IOT solutions and on my pet on the panel is sandy ranjan senior vice president of Harmon lumet Luigi licciardi of gsma narayana IOT forum and Ettie and ranjit khanna director of product management IOT and embedded security from a trust data card thanks to pleasure to be here so what we'll do first is maybe give each of you 30 seconds or a minute to to explain you know or give a brief overview of your company and in what areas that you're what you're looking at in IOT so i'll start with with sandy hi so I'm Sunday brunch and i represent harmon click your services if i don't know how many of you know most of all about Harmon so in in terms of harm on there are three areas which we are pretty much focused on one is the connected car the connected lifestyle and then we talk about the industrial peace which is the industrial IOT I think these are the three focus areas for us and I'll probably talk more about that later on but i think that's that's what we focus on 3g okay nice to medium I'm Luigi rich rd I'm actually board member of Etsy i recently found in my consultancy company and I'm supporting large company and interdigital as well and telecom italia to work on iot to enter in the iot business and in 5g i had a 30 years of experience as a telco operator in telecom italia so i think that if there are some question about operator i will be happy to answer and to exploit olesia referring I OT the role of Delta inside inside the panel thank you hi everyone jitka know from Andros later card entrance data card is a industry leader in providing trusted identity and transaction security solutions for financial sector garment as well as the digital enterprises as part of interest data card i had IOT security and embedded security solutions helping our customers in their digital transformation ok thank Thank You Reggie Luigi and Sandeep so I want to start with a couple of questions so the first one maybe two sandy where are we seeing the most traction in IOT from from verticals perspective what do you see as the state of the industry and the current state of the market as IOT is developing ok so if you look into IOT is all about connecting the physical world to the digital one I think it's that sort of us so if you look into the three major investments which any person makes in the lifestyle is what he buys an house he buys a car and then he is a professional enterprise conversos I think these are the three basic things which are driving most of the growth right so in terms of harmon we are aligned to that so automotive for us is the number one focus area then it is the lifestyle which is connected home connected retail is the smart infrastructure and third one is the industry so from harmons perspective these are three areas these are the three areas where we focus on this automotive the smart infrastructure and the industrial ocean yes so so following up on that same and deepen and maybe Ranjit is which would you say is the hotter vertical Sandeep that you know that that for for Harmon which is the which are the ones that are currently the hottest verticals or what do you see is the emerging hottest hot verticals right now so the hottest vertical is the connected car so if you look into the connected car is where you're looking at most of the investiture going into that is for Harmons perspective that is the most shorted one then we have the connected infrastructure which is connected home connected lifestyle the indus the smart cities etc and the most important use cases about the mash-up between the connected car in the connected home think about a user he moves from an house to a automotive can you have the same connectivity can you have the complete facilities whatever you are having insider so i think that for us it becomes a very very big vertical for us to really take the experience of the user from one home to automotive to his office and all the stuff right so that's what it is so effectively you see it going cross vertical it's the importance of being able to join all those verticals together the value of the data from those verticals yeah I think so it is all about the mashup you can't say it's just one thing it's about connecting everything together right as i mentioned getting the physical to a digital and the connectivity has to be simple secure and scalable IOT is nothing but simples secure and scalable right obviously it has to be standard driven etc but i think from my perspective it is connecting the physical world to the digital making it simple secure and scalable ok so you mentioned security so and follow it with Randy Don that in terms of what what what verticals do you see your heart verticals looking at the the market from a different perspective than Harmon from security and privacy perspective so let me let me give you a different you know segmentation of our industry so you know if you think about industry from a to prospective the device manufacturers the companies who are building the infrastructure that will be consumed in various different connected ecosystems so that's one set of the industry segments another set of this industry segment is the operators of the devices who are operating on top of those devices building solutions that will be consumed by either the enterprises or the end consumers if we see from that perspective you know you you see a different you know different dimension of the industry how you can segment that and when it comes to the operators of the industry who are trying to monetize the outcome of connected ecosystem that's where auto industry the industrial sector critical infrastructure like energy utilities and obviously the lifestyle which involves what a consumer owns and how he operates his life are some of the major investments area that are going on so so you mentioned operators and what's what's what's important operator so sandy mentioned some segments that are operator driven and some that or not and you mentioned operator driven seconds as well so maybe we'll ask Luigi from an operator perspective what verticals you see that are important and and what is the impact that that operators have in terms of the development deployment of IOT systems yes sure for operator all the verticals that were mentioned before of course are very important i would add another important issue that of course refers more even it's more difficult else safety and smart city in general so the role of the municipality and of the countries in improving the life of the people and so i think that this is another another important issue including even for example the payment because I otic and play even a significant role in payment in parking so I is something that can improve our life so this is one of the main issue that we have to work on just the first question for the second question what is the role that the telecom operator canal for sure operator have a significant advantage and of course they have to play well with this advantage that is the fact that they have powerful network and at the end most of this device to be connected use the network the network can be the mobile network or can be a tone in the office could be even of course Wi-Fi but at the end the resources are done through fiber optics through this communication network so for sure operator of the great advantage of providing the connectivity so they can have a significant role the important issue and we have to take into account anyway of the role of the operator of course network as they are now are not enough are not sufficient so most of our of the customers of the operator are asking to have network data network as a service so they want to use our network depending on the use case depending on the needs depending on the application so the first mission according to me or the operator is to provide these network as is in the best way according a trust to the customer if they are retailing or or if they are business customer so trust as security and all this stuff will be fundamental to guarantee this network as a service this network is a service solution of course operator may play depending on the country depending on their flexibility may play even a larger role than providing even if the one I said before it's it's not easy to perceive they can of course be partner with the customer providing true important partnership platform solutions so they can let me say leverage they are all depending of course on the capability of the telco operatory and this is the right the right point of attention so so we've covered a couple different things here so different verticals where where where each of the groups are living their role of operators but what I would think for sandy pin and ranjit some some of the things your your solutions actually cut across beyond operators so so what I'm curious about is what are some of the pain points that that you see in the in the industry Luigi touched on some of them for operators but I'm curious where the pain points are for interest across multiple applications and then Sandeep the same for you beyond just operators what are the pain points that you see I think so two major pain points 1 is the monetization because let me start with the thoughts saying that maybe five or ten years down the line we will not be talking about IOT because it will be perceived to be present there as sundeep said earlier it has to be simple right the simplicity means that the customer will not buy technology infrastructure or solution customer will buy a use case or a service so so I OT has to be invisible in a way that it is always present so that's point number one so what if we go ahead with that you know thought process the two fundamental issues how to monetize the service hopefully Sandeep can show more light on that one and how to secure it because security is the fundamental issue in the monetization of IOT services in last 24 months if you scan the industry events you will see events where either the products are being recalled not because of the functionality issue or not because of the manufacturing defects they are being recalled because of the security issues or the impact of the connected devices into the privacy safety and the security of the ecosystem and the people's life has significantly gone up because when we talk about IOT we are not talking about email getting hacked which has a financial impact and potentially the brand impact we are talking about a potential impact on people's life and a severe loss in those Vegas so that's the security is one of the major barrier in a progression and the implementation and adoption of IOT driven digital services Sunday monetization yeah so the biggest challenge in IOT is how do you make money that's the biggest challenge if you ask me right who is making money how do you make money so it's not about how to transmit the data I think probably people focus more on how to transmit the data obviously that's becoming an hygiene right security becomes very important aspect the scalability becomes very important aspect but the real i would say crux of the matter is what to do with the data that's where the money is what to do with the data and when we talk about what to do with the data that's where the challenge comes in right who owns the data let's say in case of an operator still I think operator has that upper hand and they's try to flex their muscles for example a simple case right let's take the case of an automotive and you have a OEM fitted car right it's not an aftermarket solution which is owned by an operator but it is a car which is fitted it's all tcu connected and everything connectivity is there it's getting all the data from your sensors etc who owns the data is it the car OEM probably the data coming from the car canvas etc they operate the OEM can own that but it also has the data about your driving pattern so that data is your data right it is your driving pattern and now somebody is trying to monetize the data by selling their data to insurance companies your data right it is your driving pattern harsh braking acceleration how you drive it how do you press the parallel etcetera so the important part again which again I still think is not yet been addressed this who owns the data so i know i think there are different discussions which you are having we anonymize the data and all take a much broader look at the data but the fundamental thing is what do you do with that data first who owns the data and what do you do with a return because this data is very very important right this is about your pattern right it is about you how you behave how the masses behave how the Geo behaves and that is going to drive a lot of the pattern on the selling pattern right so I think important aspect which we are still trying to addresses who owns the data and then their larger question is how do we monetize it and again these discussions are on if you ask me there is no one solution right now I think those discussions still on and that is one is going to be the one of the toughest challenges which we have to really solve right so so we mentioned security data data privacy ownership of data how do we monetize the data I know in our in our case we've looked in terms of building intelligent transports solution that actually can broker the data for the counties and the individual governments that own that data so that's one way to do some monetization but but rent Roger you mentioned some some of the issues in terms of simplifying the solution so why don't I ask you is is how do you how do you do that is partnerships of key way to do that is to build a complete solution is it company build one or you know the whole vertical stack or is it really driven by partnership absolute totally I think it's a IOT implementation and I will start with the IOT monetization is a monetization of an outcome of a connected ecosystem which means it could be a data or it could be a function that you can execute remotely that has a monetary value to it and if we think that business perspective there is no one single solution that can address the need of end-to-end connected ecosystem and get give business ability to monetize the outcome of the connected ecosystem so that's a fundamental fact and premised that everybody has to start with now whether it's a customization or whether it's a build-your-own end to end given the you know experience that we have and how we see the progression happening in the it is going to be an ecosystem played is going to be a partnership play where more than one players comes together understand the business need and business requirement and connect integrate and deliver integrated solution which can actually help customers to monetize the outcome of connected economy it has to be an ecosystem offer different players bringing different set of technology solutions and capability and then gluing it together obviously I will touch base on a standard based approach rather than a proprietary batch of pros because the success of the IOT monetization also depends upon how open the ecosystem is so standards will play a very critical role in that so obviously an ecosystem and the standardized approach will go a long way so let me follow up with that Luigi a direct question answer for standards what what role the standards play here especially in terms of interoperability and and how do we drive interoperability certification what else what would actually will drive that interoperability to simplify the solutions standard as was said before a significant role in IOT and machine-to-machine business and of course the interoperability is a key point and if we take into account that we are forecasting trillion of device interoperability in inside the network is an important issue standard should move at any level so starting from the physical layer and I see significant progress recently from 3gpp with the standardization done very soon just some month on technology based on LT like nirobe and LTE or LTM that are a powerful solution depending on the bandwidth that you need depending on the application reduce the battery consumption so simplified the signaling so there are solution that are standardized and are good they use license the solution and they are safer than proprietary solution that are going to move all around recently so this is one ensured the physical layer but I think that another important issue is having platform that can have a standardized API at the downlink at the upper link so they can of course have something that is standardized to manage the resources the network resources the radio resources and not only on on the downlink and on the upper link they have the capability of managing application and give the capability of developers and verticals to put their application efficiently in this common platform the one machine to machine initiative of the partnership project is a worthwhile project that put together the the most important as do in Europe in Asia in us so it's it's it's it's a great it was a great point of attention now we have just at alpha of the the way why because standardized is done and we have fortunately already some platform like the interdigital one empower that is compliant with one machine to machine but it's very important now that this platform have the branded & beach certified in order to be used and widespread with the customer so this is the most difficult thing so how to introduce in the market this platform show the value of this platform probably you mentioned certification certification otter at least the compliance with the standard could be a further point of attention for the one machine to machine community but this is not enough security was mentioned security need of course standardization in order to identify depending on the application what we need to do to avoid intrusion or taking away the data that belongs to the person or something like that another important issue a fairing security is related in such a way to the privacy how to protect the privacy so ear ear not only standardization but even regulation in the different country should define some rules in order to protect their customer and their citizenship so this is another important issue unfortunately even there are a lot of project on cybersecurity on whatever according to me with respect of the other standard and the other activity are a bit behind so so so maybe move to sandeep honest because Harmon has been successful building products that use multiple different radio access technologies multiple standards multiple platforms so sandy per click to get your view in terms of what what makes what simplifies the creation of platforms and interoperable platforms and is it standards or or is or is there other things in the ecosystem that need to develop to drive simplicity see as I mentioned right it's important that you partner with the best you you have to partner with the best you can't create everything on your own though Harmon also has our own 5+1 security model we purchased the company at our second Israel but still I think we are working with interest because they also have some very very unique proposition we are working with VMware now when you look at an enterprise the way you manage a mobile phone same way any other asset has to be managed you cannot have two mechanisms managing an asset so that's where VMware kemon comes in picture right they are the masters in managing their assets within an enterprise now when you talk about things right that also be should be completely i would say integrated to the via managing a mobile phone the way you are managing maybe a desktop out there maybe you are managing holding out the sensor out there so everything is a corporate asset it has to be managed as a corporate asset so that's where we are parting VMware and same thing with interdigital because the way you have your what I are one Empire etc I think we think it has a lot of value because its standard ribbon at the data exchange platform is pretty good so I think the important thing of creating a platform is that you have to master you have to work you have to work work work with the partners like-minded partners innovative partners people who believe in it who are the specialists of it and that's the way up to a forward you can't create everything on your own if you are trying to create everything on your own it's a recipe for disaster yeah well I'd like to thank all the panelists we've gotten some very diverse views in terms of the current state of IOT I think there's some convergence in terms of what we need to do to simplify development what we need to do in terms of standard standardization certification to make it easier for customers to deploy solutions and also we've discussed the power of partnerships because no one company is bringing bringing complete solution so I'd like to thank thank all the panelists and thank you from into digital here at mwc on a dialogue on internet of things thank you thank you thank you you you
