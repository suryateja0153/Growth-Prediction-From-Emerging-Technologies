 hi everyone welcome to the IOT hero show and my name is Tom raftery I'm a global IOT evangelist for SAP and with me on the show today my guest is Andy Mulholland. Andy would you like to introduce yourself? well it's a better to stick to the relevant, I spent the last four years leading research at constellation research on IOT and four years ago people barely recognize the term. Before that my background was as the group chief technology officer for capgemini. I've tended always to look at the subject much more around solutions and much more around the business applicability of the solution so it's been rather a different path and it's led me to focus much more on why would you want to do it how would you want to do it more than these are the pieces that can do it great that's that's that's perfect that's the last couple of podcast that we published work kind of around the pieces and well actually that the last one was more the vehicles and connected cars but it's always good to approach it i think from a business perspective then a a specific technology perspective because the technologies change all the time but very often the business needs don't well that's true and pretty well we can argue that there's two sides to IOT and one of them has been quite a long time in the development which has been industrial automation in various manufacturing plants etc that's not new what's changed is what we can do with that the other side is the one that really is changing it and it says that most companies accept their future is around services.Services giving higher value. They accept they're going to a digital services economy but they find it very difficult now to relate that to "What does that mean? What do I do? Where is the value? and so the picture is still based on IOT internally for cost management and externally well the web and the internet are going to do great things for us to deliver services but very little connection between all those pieces yeah yeah and I mean it just to just to frame the conversation, my own interest in in in IOT, I have been working with IOT for quite a long time again similar to yourself long before it even had the term IOT i was talking about connected energy and smart grids and things like that your your background is more manufacturing so that this would be for people listening this is going to be more a connected manufacturing conversation than anything else really and and Andy a lot of this a lot of this has to do i think in in the manufacturing particularly it has to do with the the improvements that we're seeing in data flows. I think actually I just say that manufacturing has been an early adopter mainly because of the background we just talked about other industries are doing it but there's been some very significant drivers to do it in manufacturing and of course we all know that manufacturing suffered very heavily from cost cost cost pressure that's... So everything went East... yeah yeah that's also led us to think about product lifecycle management much more so when you've taken this flow of solutions people have much faster product life cycles now and they need to extract value they need to get the product up out running extract value from it, and take it to a service generation and extract more value from service generation so they have the head start of knowing that IoT meant the way they operated and managed a factory could be much more efficient. Lean manufacturing we understand the principle you know we very rapidly improve each cycle and adding in further degrees of instrumentation to that has already been happening for quite a lot of years as you pointed out. The question is what can you do with that information and previously we've looked at reporting and operating a business on 30-45 days cycles around standard business reporting. What lean manufacturing is saying is we have to do things on whatever is the right cycle so if you're operating machine some machines its daily can even be hourly that you're trying to understand how to make the improvement so that data is about the way we interpret it and use it but in a very very short time cycle of optimization continuous optimization That's the big change. Can we do that in a very different way let me take a slightly different approach to this Andy just just for the sake of trying to try to get people to help people comprehend the kind of change we're talking about because I i see it myself i have a Fitbit and the Fitbit that i have reads my pulse my heartbeat now if i go to the doctor's surgery the doctor will take my pulse and that would be a snapshot of my pulse when I go into the surgery on a day when i'm feeling unwell, when maybe I've got half an hour and I got another meeting coming up and I've got to get into that surgery I got to get that pulse taken or whatever it is and then i gotta get out and go to that meeting maybe get caught in a traffic jam whatever i'm under pressure a time so i'm i'm i'm stressed out when i get into the doctors place already i'm not feeling well he takes that snapshot of the pulse whereas on my phone I now have three years of my pulse data saved every day all day 24 hours a day going back three years it's a completely different view of the data and a helluva lot more data it's a much richer data set but if I hand that over to the doctor he won't know what to do with us so i mean this is the kind of difference were talking about in the manufacturing space I think it's the move from as you say getting 30 40 day reports to getting 30-minute reports and suddenly there's a vast, there's a swathe of information there and are the manufacturers able to cope do they know how to handle this? I mean my doctor wouldn't know how to handle it if I handed him my Fitbit application listen it's very interesting example actually because the rest of the story would be that if they really worried about they would have structured device on you for a day and then take it back though the cost of doing that is actually very high yep where is what really has changed in that is the cost drop dramatically and therefore the period you could examine became longer and from that you start to see these things we call insights so far are now trying to relate a little bit more to the subject and we talked about an insight let's really really expand the horizon for a moment and we'll talk about one of the pioneers that everyone knows about in doing this General Electric's I would about the way they instrumented jet engines for a number of years and they have known exactly what's going on in a jet engine but the real point about that is that from that we got to power by the hour so we don't start the engine we sell the output we sold that the what you want you want to use it you don't want to actually buy it you want to use it and you want it maintained etc yea there is a link back to your fitbit in a moment but what they've learnt out of that is that the power by the hour assumed all engines were equal and all uses were equal what they now know is that an airline that is based in and flies in and out of the middle east in hot sandy dusty conditions sees a very different wear profile to the one in Scandinavia who's doing it in the cold and every other extreme in between so what they now know is it's not power by the hour as an overhead prediction on that engine they can now charge by the wear factors that different people are utilizing it by so if we come back now that's a very good service example of saying if I have more data in a very different way to the data I've had before i could understand how that related to service now if we come back to your Fitbit watch the people who do understand your Fitbit watch are the insurance companies and they understand that if you do your 10,000 steps a day then you're likely to be much more healthy individual and they will reflect it in your premium so where we're going with this is it's not kind of the data model we saw before and the kind of well that's a nice snapshot of the time of shiny machine where we want to know actually about key assets we want to know how we're using them and people have talked a long time about shifting from capex buying the machine buying the jet engine buying maintenance on the jet engine of power by the hour to now saying no no it's actually about opex'ing that asset so I actually really understand that asset & I understanding exactly how it's being used and I understand exactly what cost and overheads belong to it and those that don't and from that I can build a very different responsive model about how I charge so when we come back to the services element the only thing you can do with the services model is reflect what people use the service for so you actually want to go the whole of the way around so now visualize your pantry and ask are you going to be buying all those big expensive machine talks or are they gonna come as a service that you use them and will you pay for the wear you put put in them so that when you're not using the asset it's not actually a direct charge on your business that's where the the whole IOT argument will take us it will take us to the idea that we actually uniquely understand every asset and how that is built into our business model in order to be a very the concept for a long time a very agile enterprise because we know how r cross walls work and they're not just overhead models and they're not just cost efficiency drives our overhead models actually re-thinking our company model yeah and and this is something that people are starting to talk about now the the whole manufacturing as a service and the digital economy and the whole shift away from capex to opex but I've still yet to hear anybody espouse how that will change things for for me for the consumer for someone who buys something from a manufacturing organization I mean will the costs to manufacturer drop as a consequence I know the capex will drop it shift to opex but will the overall cast drop and with that would be reflected in prices of purchases that I as a consumer make or we'll just be a different cost structure for the manufacturer well there's a lot of questions investigate yeah well let's try to break it out um contract manufacturing has boomed why because companies actually want to remember what it is they really do that adds value versus what they have to do to add costs so if you're in the electronics business, chances are you get a lot of your product made by a contract manufacture so (the Foxconns of the world) manufacturing as a service if we think about manufacturing as a service that contract manufacturer has to be very good at using the manufacturing assets because implicit in the argument is they can do less money and that also implicitly means they can change what they make more quickly for less money so one end of the argument we've already seen contract manufacturing take specialist tasks and shorten product lifecycle management because they can change the product so quickly the other end of the task is what do we as consumers want to do? The interesting thing is the consumer dimension has changed more rapidly because we don't have to cost justify a capex expenditure if we buy a toothbrush that happens to have a bluetooth connection so we will play around with it a lot more and we've come to the idea that we quite like having information we quite like using things doing things so we very rapidly adapted to a service economy so the idea of buying piece of hardware and then being able to set it the way you want it to make it connect to your network in that in your home which is IOT again is rapidly establishing itself amongst that now last time you can argue those things happened they happened with mobile phones companies did not buy mobile phones for their start at the beginning people bought them and learn why they had value pcs went through the same cycle the internet went through the same cycle so we seem to be going through product adoption cycles or technology adoption cycles which then with them bring cultural cycles that change business so i would argue at the moment we are on that is that as consumers we are readily adapting to a service economy and really understanding its value to us and culturally accepting it to be that way so that will flow back into companies thinking I have to support that that's my market and there isn't a resistance so i would say at the moment that according to what you look at you can argue how far down the curve it is so if you're gonna take the house I would say it's very well down the curve um if you're going to take a car and say it's coming up very sharply on people's visibility but if we take that for a moment and ask another question is how we still thinking about things in the same way so when we say car we think the car is the object and the services must be around the car that's old-fashioned thinking seems there's just been a interesting buyout in the industry where one company's bought another for no other reason than its saying the entertainment at home is personal to you and when you get in a car that entertainment should be with you so the other thing about the services economy and the other thing we're all learning is its cross-functional that's going to be a big challenge for the manufacture of the back and i would say the same thing to to them I say the problem that we have now is not multi-channel as we knew about the web it's multi-device multi-service and we don't necessarily have the same structure that our services will fit in that we are confidently assuming is the next few years path that example I've just giving you along with several other examples i know you know we talked about in the past all point to the fact that start IoT in the realm you understand of your own business but you're doing that in preparation for the way that understanding is going to change the way your business with works in a digital services economy yeah i mean that's that's why the likes of Google and Apple and SAP are getting involved in connected cars yes it's a connected device it's another connected device and in using that connected device you will have a host of associated services The services needn't be directly about the car. They are about what you're doing because you're in a car where you're going what you what's going on with your life you know it's it's part of your life model part of your what you're doing today I'm gonna get taken out shopping i'm sure by my wife today because we're coming up to Christmas the cars function that is to convey us to the shops which shops what are we going to buy how do we decide that could be part of a different package that invokes the car as well if you want to look at that one in a very interesting sense is uber and if you're in the states and you use some tripadvisor and you look at a restaurant or you look at a hotel then on that page you will find a button, if you are on a trip in an Uber city to call the Uber to take you to that address and the Uber knows where you're standing and it knows where you want to go so it's an embedded service that's how we'll see these things ultimately progress yeah and I do you think well I guess this is a difficult question because the answer to this is yes, or it depends but wherewhere are manufacturers along the maturity of figuring out all this of figuring out how to shift their current business models to what's coming down the line oddly enough in the boardroom the take-up has been... of understanding has been much better than you might think primarily because of Industry 40 in Europe and industrial Internet in the states. In both of them there are some very strong parties and some very very interesting things that have been done and one board room does tell another so in manufacturing the penny has dropped or the and the pfennig has dropped or however you like to think of it, or the cent has dropped but it seems to have hit the consciousness the challenge that hasn't hit the consciousness is that there's a tendency to look sideways at your traditional competitors and say well i'm moving at the same rate as them. I think that's very dangerous because as I proved in quite a lot of cases your real competitor is actually a lot of companies bidding for very quiet value parts of the services model around transport or manufacturing or whatever and in the case of taxis, cars transportation nobody saw Uber coming she took it over and you can repeat that argument in other places so let me get it and an obvious want to look back at is the likes of Johnson Controls being hit by the likes of Nest I mean that was one nobody saw coming at thermostats think what the hell? well actually that's a very interesting example because if you go back about three years then the building management services industry Johnson honeywell etc and they were very very sure that they understood exactly what the future was and they were all talking about the superior of their products today they talk about the superiority of services Johnsons bought Tycho. Honeywell is doing other things etc in other words yes you're absolutely right they didn't see it come and you can see this in other places as well so my message to to the manufacturing industry is you've got the idea you've got the principal you know things are moving but in your sector stop looking at your traditional competitors start looking at all the smaller companies who are trying to take bites out of you because one of those bites could be a really painful one quicker than you realize interesting interesting yeah and I mean for for anyone who's in a manufacturing was in the board or in the manufacturing organizations any kind of level you know where do they look to see where this competition might jump up and bite them from well that this is where the industry gets self interesting self interested the simple answer is the industry's changed the tech industry has changed as well when I say these companies can can jump up and bite you one of the reasons people will give is that they don't have legacy model to worry about or actually the legacy model should be a strength and so in looking at this and looking what you do about it then you can look at some of the other ways it's been handled where john deere is another famous example where they've actually managed to take their ability to organize and do around their key farming equipment and then connect it to become the huge advantage that everybody else now wants to connect to so in saying this we're not necessarily saying that you walk away from everything you know around IT that's your strength that's how your company works that's what it does your question is how do you actually use that strength to compete and it comes down to another popular phrase people talk a lot about AI without really understanding it if you term it augmented intelligence or augmented experience which is you learn lots of things in your company lots of embedded information and experience if you can't bring that to the fore to understand then how to use that and use that leverage of install base etcetera that's a pretty poor show because it is happening... but I get it though but it's it's I guess it's profoundly difficult for people in organizations like that to say to themselves that this is their core knowledge set or that this is the record i mean if you if you that deep in an organization you think everybody knows this stuff and you know that it's you know II it it's hard to a step outside and and and see that this is actually valuable information that you own yeah it's very hard and companies of course particularly in manufacturing it you know they say well you can't do it but then we'll talk told her about contract manufacturing, and if you take the car industry the ability of BMW vs mercedes to bend a piece of steel to make a car wing is no differentiator it might be a differentiator they could get a cost advantage on it of maybe ten percent yeah and that might be a differentiator because that implies that the rest of car they get a similar cost advantage but the reality is that nobody bought a BMW or Mercedes for the beautiful curve in the wing might be part of a bigger package of I appreciate how it looks I appreciate its quality etc so it's really their ability to design the right car to appeal to the right sector of the market work out how to put it together sites are really good quality car and supported in service so i actually bending the metal and making wheels or tires as Henry Ford would have said years ago that is other people's key advantage speak... speaking of the car industry though and the move to as a service how do you think the BMW's and the Mercedes of the world are lined up for the as a service transportation industry where people no longer buy cars but they rent them as a service that is absolutely fascinating point because i read on friday i think it was, a very interesting survey where they looked to people's attitudes about buying cars and the big thing they were looking at is people buying electric cars and people who buy electric cars have a hugely different attitude to them to the people who by conventional cars and this came out because they asked the question would you be prepared to do an Airbnb and I don't remember the exact figures but we're in them the mid-sixties of people who buy electric car saying yes and we're in the the teens of people who buy conventional cars and it was drawing the differentiation it said people bought electric cars bought them for very practical reasons people who bought other cars had a much higher emotional reason now the question is, are all those trends working at once yes they are so where on that does it put the next trend which says are people buying transportation now clearly GM thinks they'd have to change because they bought Lyft so they're trying to form a relationship about your transportation requirements not necessarily only a car but that's another example of how attitudes change I'm probably older I like cars, I like driving so I've been one bit whereas one of my son's I know for sure is in the other part and I would say there's a middle ground because i know several people who own Tesla's and for them it's a very emotional experience to own and drive a Tesla so i'm not sure how they would fare on the airBnB question that's very interesting actually because i would buy a Tesla and I would confess myself to being a self-confessed petrol head what does its design and it's other issues are very appealing so the way they've done it appeals so again we're back to this fact that um how did that differentiate them what they differentiate themselves because they could get a design around their experience into that package so again we're back to to some very common phrases here experience how do you repackage things because services are kinda consuming experiences ownership is a different experience yeah so again we're back to this this whole argument about the the digital services economy is not the internet web economy revved up it's taking the whole thing to a new stage of connected inter-dependency and activity and how what we do functions in that business network of services so we have a role in a network of things that are happening and that role we have to define and those are the services we will have and that links all the way back to how we think of ourselves think of our product think of what we build think of how it is used/sold think of how we buy the things we're going to use in our factories etc it's a chain of change and like any of these things I mean William Gibson said it very well when you said the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed I mean I think you know it all happen faster and some areas some geographies than others some places will leapfrog, in the developing world for example others will have legacy issues and it'll take longer to get there absolutely and and the mobile phone itself is very good example of that one with connectivity they missed out the wired ya era in a number of states but i think if we come back to it that the one question that people always say is when is it gonna hit me and my reply is it has hit you. The question is have you noticed because IOT is not something you wake up on Thursday and decided to start a project on a monday IOT is happening every device everywhere that's coming out is gaining much more ability to connect and much more ability to harvest data. Why? Chips get cheaper service connectivity like LoRo everywhere in the Netherlands, South Korea and shortly elsewhere gets easier so against that background IOT is happening fact yeah The question for your company is how do you learn how to respond and the fastest way to learn how to respond is to start to look at applying it internally and learning lessons about what kind of things you can do what you can learn and then relating that to what's happening externally and I very good data point on that was I visited schneider electric two years ago I think it was September 2014 when they were opening their new North American headquarters and their CTO whose name slipped my head of the moment but very bright guy Pascal i think it is french guy he he talked about how it costs them less than at the time less than two dollars to put a system-on-a-chip on everything they were manufacturing so they said you know if it's going to cost us less than two dollars per device why wouldn't we do it so every single device they were shipping everything had already at that time in 2014 a system-on-a-chip built-in yeah and the thing that used to be the problem that has also changed has also been do you have two connect it to power and the other big change over about a two-year period has been the capabilities of batteries so relatively straightforward sensing equipment now will run for 10-plus years on the same battery yeah so it's a game changer if you go out and look at utilities in the Netherlands where they've got a lot of water that they have to monitor in case they get flooded these things that are sort of somewhere around about 12 $25 a time to do simple pressure sense or simple out and shut sense and they link onto a LORO network for virtually nothing a year so why wouldn't you as you just said when the guys they're doing routine service why wouldn't you be telling him just whack these on these points and done enter it now that's the kicker I want to end on personally because we talked a lot about applying it but there's some very very clear things to think about one is that we are talking about something that's going to multiply by hundreds of thousands millions billions we all know that over the next few years think of mobile phones you can think of nothing else and the ramp up and the numbers so when people start thinking about this and they start doing what i just said it actually is key that they start proper documentation and they link it back to their existing documentation because it's great to know that look at this Watergate I now know this this and this that singular take the I dunno 10,000 watergate's in the Netherlands probably more, now think about that and now think about the fact that when you get an alarm you need to know which one where it is you need to relate all the paperwork to it you need to know how it's maintained what part it is, a host of things you know when new phases start people get enthusiastic and they do pilots and that's great because we learn a lot but one of the lessons usually from a pilot is I wish I'd known where i was going to end up in other words we tend to do a pilot in a fairly limited manner and we tend to limit it within the budget within a lot of other things almost invariably it doesn't then serve us well into connecting up so my lesson about this that i inferred earlier is you have a huge amount of documentation which is an asset in itself, you have a huge amount of information the question is how you tie these two things together as much as exploit the new things very good Andy for anyone who's listening who wants to learn more about all of this because it that there's a huge amount to learn are there any good books you could recommend on this topic for example actually funny enough that because the topic is so vast there isn't my standard recommendation to people is that there are a lot of quite good events around and I was doing shortly before this call actually some work on one and and I mentioned it to you at the beginning but it doesn't matter we'll use it as an example event in london in mid-march smart IOT if you go to a big exhibition of IOT you can look around and you can browse now we all say we stopped going to exhibitions because we don't have to we can find it on the internet The problem with that is it infers you know what you're looking for if you don't know what you're looking for and you need to get ideas you need to soak yourself in you need to go browsing and in this case I recommend people start physically browsing that's why the numbers attending exhibitions have gone steadily out last year because there's so much new technology in this space that going to show has several advantages everybody spread out in front of you you can browse them at your leisure you can pick was relevant to you you can walk on the stand and almost certainly you're going to be able to get a good demo and talk about people who really know and understand it so you're first learning stages i recommend that course of action to see what strikes home to you more than any of the books at the moment always seem to be sliced round a particular area i'm trying to get a generic feel first that's great advice and for anyone who's listening who wants to know more about you or your writings because you've got a very good blog where we where should people go to find you online was very kind of you to say it is a good blog cos I'm in the simplest thing is to just google Andy Mulholland blog or if you need to Andy Mulholland constellation research blog and you shouldn't have any trouble at all finding it ok you're on twitter i am on Twitter when the slightly strange handle because it goes back to a long time ago and it's @CTOontheboard the reason for that was that it was becoming apparent quite a few years ago when Twitter first started that technology was becoming a boardroom issue it was becoming a need to understand how what i would call a techno business will operate so i used the the name in the early days of Twitter @ctoontheboard. It got a certain amount of currency so I stayed with it ok excellent idea that's been fantastic think it's been a great conversation thank you for your time thank you Tom and look forward to continuing the conversation with you and others this one's got a long way to go yet before we we know what the next era really looks like in 10 years time I think you're right i think you're right okay thanks a million thanks everyone for listening and we'll see you same time same Channel next week
