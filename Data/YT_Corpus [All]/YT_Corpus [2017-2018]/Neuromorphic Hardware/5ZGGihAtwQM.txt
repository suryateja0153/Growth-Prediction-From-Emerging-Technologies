 - Sometimes I would start to kinda like type to the beat of the song and usually would make a few more mistakes doing that but it did make it a little bit more fun. I'd say when I first started to learn how to program I would spend many hours late at night like, headphones on listening to usually some kind of industrial music. One of my favorite bands at the time was KMFDM. I would usually listen to them for a long time or listen to different like, EDM style bands like Glitch Mob or Daft Punk or different things like that. It would help me kinda just like, zone out my surroundings and just kinda focus in on what I'm trying to do. (electronic music) My day to day role involves tending to our OpenPOWER and Open Compute platforms that we're developing here at Rackspace. The primary systems that I'm focused on are the Barreleye OpenPOWER systems. We have a G1 OpenPOWER system that we released last year and this year we're collaborating with Google on a G2 version of the Barreleye system. In labs in general, the servers can be kinda loud but in the lab that I work in some of our systems are so new they don't have fully functioning fan control yet so the fans will run at 100% and they get quite loud. While I'm working in the lab I'll usually have some ear buds underneath my hearing protection just so that I can have some music going to focus in on the work that I'm doing. My name is Kenneth. I'm a system design engineer for Rackspace. I've been working here since June, 2010.
