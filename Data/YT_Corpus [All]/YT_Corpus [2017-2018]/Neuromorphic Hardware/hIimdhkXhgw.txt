 fly from San Jose in the heart of Silicon Valley it's accused covering dataworks sub at 2017 brought to you by important works welcome back to the cube I'm Lisa Martin with my co-host George Gilbert we are live on day one of the data work summit in San Jose in the heart of Silicon Valley great buzz in the event of that you can see in here behind us we're very excited to be joined by a couple of fellows from IBM a very long-standing Hortonworks partner that announced a phenomenal suite of four new levels of the partnership today please welcome Assad Mahmood analytics cloud solution specialist at IBM and medical doctor and Linton more distinguished engineer Power Systems open power solution from IBM welcome guys welcome great to have you both on the queue for the first time so Linton software has been changing companies enterprises all around are really looking for more open solutions really moving away from proprietary talk to us about the open tower foundation before we get into the announcements today look at the genesis of that ok sure we recognize the need for innovation beyond a single chip to build out an ecosystem and innovation collaboration with our system partners so ranging from Google to Mellanox for networking to Hortonworks for software we believe that that system level optimization and innovation is what's going to bring the price performance advantage in the future that traditional seamless scaling doesn't really bring us there by itself but that partnership does so from today's announcements a number of announcements that Hortonworks is adopting ibm's data science platform so really the theme this morning of the keynote with data science or did see the next leg and really transforming an enterprise to be very much data driven and digital eyes we also saw the announcement about Atlas for data governance what does that mean from your perspective on the engineering side very exciting you know in terms of building out solutions of hardware and software the ability to really hardened Hortonworks data platform with servers and storage and networking I think it's going to bring simplification to on-premises like people are seeing with the cloud I think the ability to create the analyst workbench or the cognitive workbench using the data science experience to create a pipeline of data flow and analytic flow I think it's going to be very strong for for innovation around that most notable for me is the fact that they're all built on open technologies leveraging communities that universities can pick up contribute to I think we're going to see the pace of innovation really pick up and on that front on the pace of innovation you talked about universities one of the things I thought was really a great highlight in the customer panel this morning that Raj Verma hosted was you had healthcare insurance companies financial services there was Duke Energy there they all talked about kind of in it one of the great benefits of open source is that kids in universities have access to the software for free so from a talent attraction perspective they're really kind of fostering that next generation who will be able to take this to the next level which i think is a really important point as we look at data science being kind of the next big driver transformer and also going you know there's not a lot of release field data Sciences how can that help in that change over time and this is one the open source community that Hortonworks has been very dedicated to at the beginning is a great it's really a great outcome of that definitely I think the the ability to take the risk out of a new analytic project is one benefit and the other benefit is there's a tremendous not just from young people a tremendous amount of interest among programmers developers of all types to to create data science skills data engineering and data science skills if we if we leave aside the skills for a moment and focus on the sort of the operationalization of the models once they're built how should we how should we think about a trained model or I should break it into two pieces how should we think about training the models where the data comes from and who does it and then the orchestration and deployment of them cloud edge gateway edge device that sort of thing I think it all comes down to exactly what your youth is you have to identify what to use case you're trying to tackle whether that's applicable to clinical medicine whether that's applicable to finance to banking retail transportation first you have to have that use case in life then you can go about training that model developing that model and for that you need to have a good potent robust data set to allow you to carry out that analysis and whether you want to do exploratory analysis or you want to do predictive analysis that needs to be very well defined in the training stage once you have that model developed then we have certain services such as Watson machine learning within data science experience that will allow you to take that model that you just developed just moments ago and just deploy that as a restful api then you can embed into an application into your solution and in that solution you can basically use across industry right there are there some use cases where you have almost like a tear appearing of models where you know there's some that are right at the edge like you know a big device like a car and then you know there's sort of the fog level which is the which is to say cell towers or you know other buildings nearby and then there's something in the cloud that's sort of like master model or an ensemble of models that's how you know I don't I don't assume that's like like Evel Knievel would say you know don't try that at home but sort of are it's the tooling being built to enable that so the tooling is already in existence right now you can actually go ahead right now and be able to build up prototypes even full level full-range applications right on the cloud and you can do that you can do that thanks to data science experience you can do that thanks to IBM bluemix you can go ahead and do that type of analysis right there and then not only that up you can allow that analysis to actually guide you along the path from building a model to building a full range application and this is all happening on the cloud level we can talk more about it happening on on-premise level but on the cloud level specifically you can have those applications built on the fly on the cloud and have them deployed for web apps for mobile apps etc one of the things that you talked about is use cases in certain verticals iBM has been very strong in vertically focused for a very long time but you kind of almost answered the question but I'd like to maybe export a little bit more about building these models training the models in say health care or telco and then being able to deploy them where's the horizontal benefits there that that IBM would be able to deliver faster to other industries definitely I think the main thing is that IBM first of all gives you that opportunity that platform to say that hey ok you have a data set you have a use case let's give you the tooling let's give you the methodology to take you from data to a model to ultimately that full range application and specifically I've built some applications specific to federal healthcare specifically to address clinical medicine and behavioral medicine and that's allowed me to actually use IBM tools and some open source technologies as well to actually go out and build these applications on the fly as a prototype to show not only the realm the art of the possible when it comes to these technologies but also to solve problems because ultimately that's what we're trying to accomplish here we're trying to find real-world solutions of real-world problems Linton let me let me redirect something towards you about a lot of people are talking about how Moore's law is slowing down or even in ending well at least in terms of speed of processors but if if you look at the not just the CPU but FPGA or ASIC or the tensor processing unit which I assume is amazing and you have the high speeds interconnects if we don't look at just you know what can you fit on one chip you look at you know 3d what's the density of transistors you know in Iraq or in a datacenter is that still growing as fast or faster and and what does it mean for the types of models that we can build that's that's a great question one of the key things that we did with the open power foundation is to open up the interfaces to the chip so with Nvidia we have MV link which gives us a substantial increase in bandwidth we have created something called open copy which is a coherent protocol to get to other types of accelerators so we believe that hybrid computing in that form you saw Nvidia on stage this morning and we believe especially for deep learning they the acceleration provided from GPUs is going to continue to drive substantial growth it's a very exciting time would it be fair to say that we're on the same curve nothing if we look at it not from the point of view of you know what can we fit on a little square but if we look at it what can we fit in it you know a data center or the power available to model things you know Jeff Dean at Google said hey Android users talking to their phones for two or three minutes today we need two to three times the data centers we have what's the what can we grow that you know price-performance faster and enable sort of things that we did not expect I think I think the innovation that you're describing will in fact put pressure on data centers the ability to collect data from autonomous vehicles or other endpoints is really going up we will have some real paid for the near-term but at some point we will have to start looking at other technologies to continue that growth right now we're in the throes of what I call fast data versus slow data so keeping the slow data cheaply and getting the fast data closer to the compute is a very big deal for us so NAND flash and other non-volatile technologies for the fast data are where the innovation is happening right now but you're right over time we will continue to collect more and more data and it will put pressure on the overall technologies last question as we get ready to wrap here I thought your background is fascinating to me having a medical degree and working in federal healthcare for IBM you talked about some of the clinical work that you're doing and the models that you're helping to build what are some of the mission critical needs that you're seeing in healthcare today that are really kind of driving not just healthcare organizations to do big data right but to do data stands right exactly so I think one of the biggest questions that we again one of the biggest needs that we get from the healthcare arena is patient centric solutions there are a lot of solutions that are helped hoping to address so a problems that are being faced by physicians on a day to day level but there are not enough applications that are addressing the concerns that are at the pain point that patients aren't facing on a daily basis so the applications that I've started billing out at IBM are all patient centric applications that basically put the level of their data their symptoms their diagnosis in their hands alone and allows them to actually find out okay more or less what's going on wrong with my body at any particular time during the day and then find the right healthcare professional the right doctor that's best suited to treating that condition creating that diagnosis so I think that's the big thing that we've seen from the healthcare market right now the big meat that we have that we're currently addressing with our cloud analytics technology which is just becoming more and more advanced it's sophisticated and it's trending towards more of some of the other health trends or technology trends that we have currently right now on the market including the blockchain which is tending towards more of a decentralized focus on these applications so it's actually putting more of the data in the hands of the consumer of the hands of the patient and even in the hands of dr. Wow fantastic well you guys thank you so much for joining us on the cube congratulations on your first time being on the show as on my mood and Linton Ward from IV and we appreciate your time thank you very much and for my co-host George Gilbert I'm Lisa Martin you're watching the cube lies on day one of the data work summit from Silicon Valley but stick around we've got great guests coming up we'll be right back [Music]
