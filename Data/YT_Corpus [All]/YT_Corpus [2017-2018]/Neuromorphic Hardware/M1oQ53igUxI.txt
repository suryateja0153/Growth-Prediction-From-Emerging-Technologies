 friends I'm 20 Karen and you are watching technological logic in today's video I am going to share with you some of the most important important information about your carrier especially if you're dreaming of being an engineer this video will be very much useful for students who are right now pursuing their senior secondary school examples well in this video I will be describing the different branches of engineering what are the different topics and what are the different areas different branches of engineering power and which branch of engineering will certainly suit upon you the best the other fluid of acceptable describing well let's start I will start from Electronics Engineering well first of all Electronics Engineering is somewhat different from electronics and communication engineering and electronics communication engineering essence of some other colleges electronics and telecommunication engineering there is another branch or a related to electronics that is applied electronics and there is combined electrical and electronics well I will define the exact difference between all these branches well first of all electronics pure Electronics branch deals with the different logics applied to the devices electronic devices for example if you watching this video in your laptop or in your maybe in your mobile or anywhere that is an electronic device now how exactly this video is reachable up to you that is decided by electronics engineer what are the different components available in your phone what are the different logics splitted within any electronic device that can be understood by Electronics Engineering well before taking electronics engineering you must make it sure that you are highly passionate about knowing the logic band electronics person if you are from the very beginning of your childhood are interested to know the different method methods and different mechanisms the mechanism or a set of of exactly how electronic devices are controlled and if you have ever tried to open any electronic device in order to find out what are the different components available in that then you see you must use electronics engineer well applied electronics and instrumentation engineering is somewhat different it is electronics for fifty to sixty percent of the syllabus is similar to that of electronics engineering the exact Israel is it is applied that means it is practically purely electronics it is practical practical usage of electronics for example if you are inventing or if you are developing any sensor for example your microphone your headphone they categorize these are categorized into the applied electronics and instrumentation in it well there is a branch electronics and communication engineering in this branch you are actually dealing with electronics and communication that means we're using music using the help of electronics you are trying to communicate to the world in the form of electromagnetic waves that will be clear as you go up to higher semesters and there is another branch electronics and telecommunication which is act exactly the same as electronics and communication engineering well coming to mechanical engineering if from the very beginning of your childhood if you are highly interested to know the logic behind our mechanical devices for example cause trains aeroplanes how actually airplanes fly having having quintals and millions of will tens of tons of weight then you must use mechanical angel it's a great price of Engineering your mechanics is is the most important if you are really interested to know the different thoughts forces applied to any body especially bulky bodies you must of mechanically while civil engineering or it is a branch of engineering where you are dealing with the different construction areas different ridges flat different I mean when you are crossing through any trade there are bridges there are railway bridges schools etc and how how the design is made what design should be made in order to require any minimum amount of resources from the world that is designed by civil engineers well there is another important branch of engineering that is computer science and engineering there is a great link between electronics and computer science because in electronics engineering you are actually making the hardware you are developing the hardware's different components of electronics but in computer science engineering you are programming them I mean nowadays every electronic circuit is digital you have to program it you have to make art I mean you have to fill the electronic devices or soul and that soul is what I call the program even by computer science engineers so in computer science engineering you have to be very much logical about the writing programs making software's in order to control any partner it is quite similar to IT branch informative information technology there also you have to do a lot of programs from the very beginning of your school life highly interested to write programs put your logic to control any electronic device then you must use I to your computer science engineering now comes electrical engineering what exactly the different electrical and electronic well in electrical engineering you are actually dealing with high power devices for example motors generators powerful power tool and engineering that means how eleven thousand volt is generated in the thermal power plant or hydro hydraulic power plant etcetera so I mean in electrical engineering you will be dealing with high power devices where voltage is very high but in electronics five volts is sufficient I mean if you are working in a microprocessor or microcontroller which is fitted inside in any electronic device which controls the whole whole device that merely requires five volts to operate so that is the special difference between electronics and electrical well a lot more branches are there for example one of the most important branches is aeronautical engineering in aeronautical engineering you have to deal especially about the different mechanical forces applied to aeroplanes so how actually airplanes fly what are the different forces acting on them and what are the methods to optimize their performance there you will come to learn in aeronautical engineering moreover there is a chemical chemical engineering branch where you have to analyze the chemical properties of any substance for example you are riding your bike vehicle anything that requires petroleum products so what is the efficiency of that petrol or diesel etcetera and any chemical substance of the world their properties their optimization are done by chemical engineers now there is a great branch called what is say automobile engineering in automobile engineering you're especially dealing with the different automobile industries for example designing a special part or designing a special car special bike in order to aerodynamically move to cut the air flow and reduce the air friction like that I mean you have to design the models of cars which are more efficient according to the modern world well friends a lot more branches are there no doubt if you have any doubt in other branches please write in the comment section well but my main motive of this video is to make you aware of the fact that if you are really pursuing or dreaming to be an engineer you must be very much passionate to load know the different logics acting on engineering devices if you are really passionate if you are really interested to have the knowledge of how devices work how electronics how mechanical how single construction are done if you are really interested then choose I mean select engineering as a carrier otherwise for the sake of a bit of a bit exert if ik --it this is not going to help in your future well I hope this video will be very much useful for you while choosing a carrier if you liked the
