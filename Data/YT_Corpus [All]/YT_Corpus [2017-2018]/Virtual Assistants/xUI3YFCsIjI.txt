 a number of years ago my wife was seven months pregnant oh and with our third child we had two other kids at the time and I had these two guys in the Philippines who were working for me and we wouldn't they had been with me for about 18 months and I had spent a lot of time training them and I had put a lot of effort into the into them and so I went into a doctor's appointment my wife and the doctor told her you have preeclampsia and if you don't go on strict bed rest for the next three to five weeks you're gonna lose this baby and all on my way home I I was just thinking like I'm not about to lose a baby over money I have these two other kids to take care of my wife is gonna be on strict bed rest and so she went on strict bed rest for the next three weeks so when I got home from that doctor's appointment I sent an email to these two guys in the Philippines and told them look here's the situation I can't work here's why I need you to take over everything that is currently happening in my business so I turned everything over to them and three weeks later my wife had our baby this perfect healthy amazing little girl and so during those three weeks I worked one hour while these two guys in the Philippines took Oh took over everything for the next two months I literally worked an hour a week while the you know everything got done by these guys and so when I came back to work not only had my business and not falling apart but it had actually grown during that time and you know it didn't grow because these guys were running it didn't grow because I wasn't there I had set it up to grow and it was gonna it was gonna work but the point is it didn't fall apart when I wasn't there and that is a really big deal so during this time you know you have you have an experience like this where you don't wear your foursome they're not working and someone else takes over your business you learn a lot of things so I learned number one these guys are really good because up to this point they had only been doing menial work and I didn't really realize that what they were capable I learned there's always work to be done it's just a matter of who doing the work is it you or is it someone else cuz it had always been me and now it was someone else and then I learned this is how you live this lifestyle that everybody talks on this is how you live the 4-hour workweek lifestyle you get other people to do your work for you and in the Philippines is a really good way to do it so this is here's the title of my presentation today is how to replace yourself by hiring full-time workers in the Philippines and really what I want to talk about is how to live the the 17 hour workweek is what I call it because that's what I work today that's about what I work somewhere between 10 and 17 hours is usually what I work and that's because I have people in the Philippines doing my work for me so I'm gonna talk about a bunch of stuff today I have a whole bunch of talk about I'm gonna talk really fast I would love to cover I would love to make you super super comfortable with the idea that you can hire someone and how to do it and what process you should go through you know in order to be effective at this there's so much there's so much more than just outsourcing here what I discovered and what I've learned of the is that if this is done right it really is a method of overcoming the problems of information overload and not having enough time in the day this is about living a better lifestyle so here's my family now I have five kids and this beautiful wife life is really good so let me tell you a quick story when I was starting my business this is probably 13 years ago now I was frustrated because I had tried outsourcing a number of ways I tried hiring local people I had tried hiring people on Elance which is today's upwork a contract worker and I was really frustrated with the process it just wasn't working for me and one day I was talking with the owner of backcountry comm and he was obviously he was the owner of a really really big website and I was very new and I didn't really know what I was doing but I was doing some things and so he he said to me you know when you're when you're ready to start outsourcing this stuff make sure you go to the Philippines with it and and I was like wow that's interesting why and he said because in India when you tell them something and they say yes that means yes I heard something come out of your mouth not it doesn't mean yes I understood what you said and when I heard that I was like wow that's way different I had never thought that like a different place could make a difference and really what I realized today is when he told me that it gave me hope because I was frustrated with what hiring people was with what alik sourcing was it was a headache and a problem and and I was frustrated and he gave me fret he gave me hope but I went back and forth for a while I didn't know if I had enough work to keep people busy I didn't I didn't know if I could afford it I didn't know if they can really do good work and he had given me a reference to where I could hire someone at the time through a service and after a couple months I finally took the lead and I hired someone full-time and it was the single most liberating experience in my life all of a sudden I had this guy whose full-time job was to do anything I asked him to do and I had to try it and I had to teach him but I because he was working full-time for me and not hourly and not part-time and not on a per project basis I was forced into keeping him busy which forced me to work on my business and not in my business and that was the very first time I had ever been able to step away and think like okay what is a good thing for us to do in the business that I can have him do instead of being like oh man I gotta get this thing done it was the first time I was ever I wasn't really ever able to do that to work on and after I had worked with him for a couple months I had given him a task and then I did give him another task and I taught him how to do each of these things I realized I had replaced myself like there were two of me now working in my business or cuz I was still working in the business on some stuff but he was also working in the business on stuff stuff which allowed me to work on the business sometimes and that was an amazingly liberating experience and at the time the guy was making two hundred and fifty dollars per month for full-time work and just so you know this is a business expense is totally tax deductible there's no insurance there's no 1099 you don't fill out you don't because they're overseas I don't have utility cause because I don't have an office space there's none of that stuff none of the normal stuff that comes with with employees exists here payroll issues or taxes this this is a tax-deductible expense that after tax you know it's costing me like one hundred and eighty dollars a month for a full-time worker so that was 12 years ago today I have 22 people working for me and so I know I'm a ways down the road today from where I started and probably from where you are listening to this from where you're starting today I have all of that get all of these things done in the Philippines and there is so much that you can get done so my goal today and what I want from you is I want you to implement everything I want you to implement everything you know of and become the CEO instead of being the grunt worker so as you do this your goal is to hire one person to get one thing off of your plate and that's where you start with this really you're gonna hire someone and and see your goal with hiring this person is to see if you can work with this person you're not you're not implementing everything today all at once your goal is to get something off your plate and get a couple hours back and then move on to something else and get something else off your plate and get a couple hours back and then you can move on to getting something else done that you don't know how to do but but as you hire this first person I'm gonna talk about it you want to see if you can effectively work with this person and see if you can effectively get a couple hours back because if those two things work out this will change your life if those two things don't work then this maybe isn't for you so okay so let me let me talk about the Philippines really quickly when I say the Philippines obviously we're at online jobs up eh there is a the Philippines is different than anywhere else in the world and it's not any single thing but it's a big it's a big line of cultural things that exist that don't exist anywhere else when you combine them and actually let me go back for a second so this is a collage of six of the 22 full-time people I have working for me and I show you this for two reasons what I want I want you to see a little bit of what you can get done which I've showed you I just showed you what you can get done programming design web master you know HR work social media marketing content marketing I I have people I have all of these people that work for me today second reason is I won't you understand these are humans like this guy who's a programmer and also has some design skills also has problems in his life and for the last year has been a really struck a real struggle working with him because he has gone on this kick of really wanting to get things what's the hot of what does he call it like will I can't think of the work anyway he's gone on this kick that's made a really unproductive for me and I'm really unhappy with it but he's an amazing worker and he's been with me for 10 years and I'm not gonna let him go and so just so you know as you go through this you're gonna have unproductive times you're gonna have they have problems in their lives this girl has gotten really sick a couple times over the years we're like there were months on end where she didn't work and that was painful but she's a really really great worker and I stick it out through those times so just so you know you'll have problems you'll have difficulties you're gonna encounter this stuff as you work with the Philippines it's a third world country so let's talk about the culture then and I'm gonna go through this really fast so in the Philippines they're very honest to the point where my guys in the Philippines have access to all of my personal information they're very loyal which means you can teach some things you wouldn't teach a contract worker or an hourly person or a part-time person and that's a really big deal as I show you this this is the first guy I ever hired that was 12 years ago he still works for me today this is maybe the second or third guy I hired that was that was 9 or 10 years ago he's still with me today you know these people work they will work for you for a long long time which means any effort you spend teaching them or training them or building a relationship with them is gonna pay off hundreds of times over which is different than a contract worker or a freelancer and that's really important and in fact they're so loyal that they will quit when they're offered another job um unless they don't trust you and well I'll talk about the trust issue as we go through this was because their trust is a really big deal and I can tell you a story about them being loyal so one time the one of the very first programmers I ever hired after a couple years of working for me he gets a job in Singapore and he sends me this email that says sir I got a job in Singapore making twenty five hundred dollars a month well he was making five hundred ollars a month at the time with me and he says I'm gonna take this job and my response that was was you know that's great good for you go ahead and do it because I knew I could hire another really good programmer for five hundred ollars a month of the time that same person was about a thousand dollars a month today just so you know but his response to me was but don't worry sir I'll still keep working for you part-time at the rate you're currently paying me which was you know part-time would have been two hundred and fifty dollars a month which he did continue to work for me for a long time at that rate even though he was making ten times that much as at his day job so they're very loyal they're very intelligent I mean most people you find will have bachelor's degrees from a real after high school college they have computers and internet access which means they could work for home you don't have to go through a service to find them you don't have to have the the four x mark up on their salaries where they're at they want to make four hundred ollars a month but a service is costing you sixteen hundred dollars a month that they're paying them for dollars a month they're very hard-working by nature and pleasing like they really want to make you happy and you'll see that as you gain their trust they speak American English which is a really big deal if you're running a small business and and you know I'm not one to sugarcoat stuff or really be politically correct there's a big difference here between outsourcing to the philippines in india it is it is a significant thing in the philippines they actually like america which is different the most of the rest of the world right now and and also this this the more i've learned the less i think this is an america thing as much as a foreigner thing they'll work this works from anywhere in the world of you're in australia or the UK or canada where ever this will work also they don't have an issue working for a male boss versus a female boss there's no stigma with that in the Philippines they're very hard hardworking and it's hard to find a job in the Philippines it's a third world country so when you combine all these things with the fact that they're not entrepreneurial what you end up getting is a worker who is loyal and hardworking they're very honest so you can and you can teach them things and you can give them access to things that you wouldn't give to someone else they want to work for you long term they're very affordable what do you end up getting this someone who will go above and beyond what you ask them to do to make sure that you're happy as long as you gain their trust and treat them well so having said that let me talk about 22 tips and some of these are gonna be about gaining trust some of the these are just hiring tips and recruiting tips and managing tips that I want to go through so number one is the disappearing Filipino and this is the number one problem you run into with people in the Philippines and it's also the biggest thing that you can do that will help determine your success so in the Philippines culturally they feel shy they feel embarrassed they've they want to make you happy and if if you're not happy with their work then they feel really bad about it so rather than telling you that they're scared or that they're embarrassed or they're shy or that they're upset about something they will disappear this is their solution to having a problem is they disappear so that's very different than other than typical outsourcing where in normal stuff they'll just say yes how's the project going yes are you working like yes it's gonna be done on time yes when you know that it's not gonna be done right that doesn't happen in the Philippines and so this makes it a solvable problem here's what happens and I will say so if you have a Filipino that disappears from you 95% of the time it's on you the employer not them that that's causing this problem here's what happens so you give them a task - do they get partway through it they don't know how to do something they get stuck on something they don't understand something you said and rather than saying hey I don't understand this or I don't know how to do this or I don't like doing this they'll try it for a while until they can't do it anymore and then they'll just stop talking to you they'll disappear and so when this happens when they disappear you need to seek it out and say hey what's going on with you well I know there's a problem so when they haven't responded to you for a couple days this is your solution to it hey I know there's a problem what are you stuck on what have I done that that doesn't make sense what can I teach you what can I help you with if you'll do that you will solve 95% of the problems of people disappearing also the disappearing Filipino means you have done something wrong in working with them either you have given them a test they don't know how to do something that they're not capable of doing something that you didn't recruit them for or that they didn't they didn't have that skill in the first place or you've given them instructions that aren't clear no matter how clear you think they are I've seen this over and over and over again where people like oh man this guy he didn't do this thing and and I given them the most obvious instructions and I gave him the instructions over and over again and I was like well so send me your instructors let me see it and they'd send me their instructions and I'm like dude I have no idea what you're asking for here so if they disappear you have to look inwardly first you have to ask yourself what have I done wrong that is causing them to disappear what have I done that they didn't understand you got to look at yourself first so let me talk about gaining their trust when I hire someone the very first thing I do is I give them the first task and I'll talk about that in a minute and I I tell them you can't disappear actually you know what let me I think I have something about that I'm gonna I'm gonna move on so one of the things that I have gotten from people is I get it I get this kind of regularly actually you got to be realistic with who you're looking for I get this enough for someone I want someone who can study the nano blogging system build WordPress blog quick good header graphic design logos write articles create videos do social bookmarking using social BOTS second create forum post at least twenty a day and provide value create an opt-in page into my blog and write a pre-sale sales letter write 30 page right so you want a graphic designer webmaster programmer who can write really great content and there's a copywriter and like this doesn't exist right like there's this person there's no such thing you've got to be realistic and who you're looking to hire I had someone just yesterday who made a job posting said I didn't get any applicants to my job and and I looked at her job posting it was ridiculous she had like 14 different skills that she wanted from this person so be realistic in who you're looking for never hire full-time this is a really big deal and a lot of people never get this but there's a huge difference between hiring someone full-time versus hiring someone how early if you're hiring hourly your brain will automatically think oh if they're not busy it doesn't matter it doesn't because I'm not paying for it whereas if you hire full-time if they're not busy you're paying for it and now you have to solve the problem of keeping them busy which means your brain starts to work on your business and create things for them to do in your business and that is a big big difference towards allowing you to live the 4-hour workweek towards allowing you to get time back in your life towards changing the way that you manage your business and run your business when when you're when you're able to successfully give other people stuff your brain will start to solve the bigger problems like how do I make sales better the other thing is this is not a per project basis Filipinos can get enough per project work with up work there's a reason we see them all the time leaving up work and coming downline jobs because they want full-time long term stable work it's very hard to find in the Philippines and even part-time work is fine for you to hire them but don't hire hourly or per project it will make such a difference on your experience in outsourcing number four when you're recruiting so I haven't see people saying hey I'm shortlisting candidates right now that's the wrong approach to this Filipinos are so loyal that if they have a job already and you email them they're likely to not even respond to your to your email and so rather than shortlisting candidates saying hey here's the three people I'm looking at out of the half-a-million you have here the three that I'm interested in instead of doing that narrowed down to a you know a set of skills on the website that you have that you want do a search and find people and then respond to or contact like twenty or thirty of them and see who responds to you and then from there you can narrow it down or if you post a job respond to all of them who apply to your job at least all of the ones who are reasonably well qualified and then interview from there so when I interview people and this is a key I think to filtering out people really well is I will send lots of emails to lots of people overlocked over a long period and so when I recruit I will ask them ten different questions and I'll do that two or three questions at a time in in emails so tip number five in six the first test so let me talk about the first task here I've mentioned it before so when I hire someone the first thing I do is I say okay you're hired here's the first task and this solves that the very first difficulty that we have which is the disappearing Filipino I'm gonna give you training here's the training for this task at some point I know you're going to get stuck and when you get stuck here's what I want you to do I want you to try it I want you to google it see see what you can do to solve the problem when you get stuck ask your friends whatever you can do when you don't feel like you're making progress I want you to come to me for help what I don't want you to do is disappear that's the worst case scenario for your job is to disappear now I know this is hard for you I know you don't want to talk to me about it but but this is what you have to do so and I'll tell you an example of one I said this exact email to someone I hired years ago she was awesome for like two months and about two months in she sent me an email and she said sir I'm so scared and I don't want to send this to you and this is really hard for me but you told me I can't disappear so I'm telling you I have this problem and I don't know how to do it and it was really great for me to see like okay I gotta solve this problem really easily and for her to come to me and see that I'm actually gonna be there to support her is a really really big thing for people in the Philippines so that first task and setting things up correctly with them where you set yourself up as I'm here to help you succeed in your job instead of hey go do this for me and I don't want to hear anything about it which I often see from people that that difference will make will determine whether you succeed or not with this email so I require all of my people to have daily communication with me and in that data communication I want three things number one what did you today remember - what problems you run into and number three what can I do to help you so this does two things know what hold them accountable for what they're doing if they didn't work on something today they have a hard time telling me what they did today number two it lets it lets me get what they're doing out of my head so that I don't have to think about it so that my brain is more clear to solve the bigger problems on the business so when you when you require this daily email you can send you can get your email from them see what they did respond to it give them feedback when you send it back to them you're done and you can go focus on something else and let them do their work and stop thinking about it and don't micromanage it and and that will that I I've seen this over and over again where business owners start to succeed so much better when they get that stuff out of their head so number seven time tracking I do not recommend you use a time tracking tool and so this is kind of goes against the grain but and that online jobs up hitch we we offer time proof which is a time tracking tool and it's really good and it'll track their time but I don't use it and I don't recommend you use it peep the Philippines don't like to use it obviously it feels like Big Brother it it makes it hard for them to work they do not work well under stress and it adds stress it's I'm just saying it's not it's not a great way to to start a relationship with someone you can do it and a lot of them will do it someone will just find out say no but it's not usually when they say no it's not because they're trying to cheat you it's because it's just not a good productive environment to work on their way to the region so all wages that you see are negotiable um one time I hired this guy I recruited this guy who I really really wanted to hire and I got through the whole recruiting process and at the end I said how much do you want to make and he said eleven hundred dollars a month and this was like eight years ago or maybe ten years ago and I said okay I'm sorry I will go find someone else cuz I knew I could hire someone I care three people for that much he said wait sir how much did you want to pay me I said 450 he said great when can I start so I'm not advocating that you under pay people 450 at the time was a pretty good wage today he makes a thousand a month but you know it's all a negotiable I pay my people once or twice a month on the first on either on the first of the month or on the first and the fifteenth depending on who they are and what their situation is you will probably need to pay your people once a week for the first couple months because they're very scared of not getting paid so they you know they don't know if they can trust you and that's a really big deal and that's their thought process we think I don't know if I can trust them as a foreign employer they think I don't know if I can trust him as a boss and so they're very scared about doing a bunch of work I'm not getting paid you'll need to pay them once a week for the first couple months and then after that you can move to bi-weekly or monthly I give raises once a year generally around the first of the year we give a raise and I do a based on on performance but I also just give a standard raise even if I don't think they're doing all that great I will also give random bonuses and raises for good work so like one time I had a guy I told him I asked him to do this to do this process for me and I taught him how to do this process I it was article marketing this was years ago I you know here's how you do this here's how you write the articles here's how you do the resource boxes how you do the links here's here's how you submit them and I gave it to him I let him go and a couple months later he had stopped notifying me about doing this and I knew our website was doing really well because it was very effective and so I sent him an email and said hey are you still doing article marking what's going on with that and he says yes sir I'm still doing it but after I did it a couple times the way you told me to do it I did some research on my own and I figured out that if I do it like this unlike this instead of what you said and if I use these websites in addition to ones you told me and if I do it this often instead of how often you told me it's way more effective I hope that's okay with you sir you know I was like that's amazing this because who does this right and so I I sent him a fifty dollar bonus that month and he was thrilled so I'll give random good bonuses for doing good work to people and then I also give a standard raise and what I don't do it what I don't recommend you do is offer performance-based incentive it doesn't work well in the Philippines often it scares them where they think they're going to get docked if they don't do if they don't accomplish your goals so a performance-based incentive is probably not the right way to do this number ten you snag okay so Snagit is amazing in his screen capture software screen recording software that sits open on your desktop you open it up you drag it out you click capture and it captures the image and now you can annotate that image so like you can give feedback by saying I like this and then you can draw on it and draw an arrow to it so the real magic of Snagit is when you click share you can upload it it's negative limbs it to a server for you puts the image in your clipboard and all you have to do is click paste and that image is online and you do anything to create that all you had to do was click Share so Snagit gets even better when you can capture a video you click capture now it's gonna record my desktop my mouse my voice and I'll say stuff like hey I really like what you did here but on all of these screens I want you to move that over there like this doing this on all of these click stop click upload Snagit puts the URL in your clipboard you click paste there's that video already online and it just works it does a couple things one it prevents you from seeing these super long emails where you know you have to describe stuff exactly it lets you talk through things and and show it visually so they know exactly what it is the second thing it does and this is really important that you don't realize but it lets them hear your voice reaches a big deal because you know they're far away and they feel like they need to trust you and hearing your voice and having you provide them feedback and and training personally is a will go a long ways in helping them gain helping them trust you so create video feedback use Snagit it's amazing software there's a couple other alternatives snag it's what I use ok number 11 how to communicate so I do not talk to my people on the phone ever I don't talk to them on skype I don't talk to them on Google hangout you can I use email Basecamp project management system or chat like we use slack so one of the things and especially in recruiting is Filipinos don't want to talk to you on the phone they're scared they're scared that you won't understand them they know they'll understand you cuz they watching American TVs and American movies but they're scared of that communication they're they're embarrassed about their house they're worried that you're gonna hear the chickens walking around on the other side of the curtain so like if you're trying recruit someone and you're a cry requiring a skype interview you're very likely to have them scheduled interviews with you and have them not show up and that's because they're worried about it they don't they don't want to do it so if you're trying to do Skype interviews while you're recruiting you're likely to lose good recruits I it's just something I don't recommend you do so number 12 success will depend on your management if if you're not willing to manage people and to be nice and to be to recognize that this is a human on the other side and not a robot this is gonna be really hard for you and so if it's hard for you it's not working out if if you have these really crazy high expectations of perfection the very first time you do something it's not gonna work out so one of the one of the things that I always see that that works really well is give positive feedback before you give any criticism and you know this is just a generally good management technique but it's especially important in the Philippines they thrive on on making people happy and so if you'll always give positive feedback before you give any negative feedback or criticism that will go a long ways in in making this work so number 13 comes with any products so when you're training someone what you can't do is buy a product and just give it to them and say here go implement this it won't work because every product that I've ever seen every information product that I've seen or video course or DVDs or whatever is intended for the CEO of the company to be the one doing the implementing or the the decision-maker is the one implementing and being the decision-maker is not something Filipinos are good at especially with the cultural thing of they want to be pleasing if they're asked to make the decisions and they don't know that you're gonna be okay with the decisions that they make they don't want to make the decisions because they're worried that you're gonna be upset and then they'll disappear so if you buy a product and you want to give it to them you have to filter it for them I'll tell you how I did this so a couple years ago I bought a product I knew that I wasn't gonna be the one implementing it so I actually read it which was different than most other times I had bought stuff where if you buy a product you have you already have this information overload you're already as if you read it then you're creating guilt for yourself because you know you can't implement this right so it just creates more internal turmoil well I bought it knowing I wasn't gonna do the implementing and so I bought it and I download it and I immediately read it and as I did I took notes when I was done I sent it to them and I said hey I want you to read this and I want you to implement it pay specific attention to these chapters in these pages but ignore this chapter and these specific pages because they're not relevant to our business and also here's this thing that it asks for on header for B and here's this copy that you need for this so I sent them the stuff they needed to succeed with it and I filtered it for them so if you're gonna buy stuff and train them that way that's a you've got to filter it for them number 14 so in recruiting asked lots of questions and hopefully you can pause this and I'm not gonna go through these but you can see these are examples of some questions at all that I will ask people I'll just cover this one right here so one of the things I'll ask is something random sometimes just to see like how is your attention to detail one of the reasons I have lots of questions is because I want to see during the recruiting process how how well do you pay attention to the details because if you don't pay attention to details while recruiting the chances of you skipping one of three tasks when I send you three it's pretty high after you're hired another one of things I look at as I'm recruiting is I don't know how fast do you reply because if you're replying multiple times a day then the chances of you being responsive after I hire you is high if you're if it taken you two or three days to respond during recruiting then after I hire you the chances of you ignoring me for a couple of days is pretty high I don't like it I use ez pay is is built into online jobs and you can that's how we pay people the 13th month okay so in the Philippines if you're a Filipino company it is legally required that after someone has worked for you for a year you give them a bonus of one month's pay called the thirteenth month and you need to be aware of this actually how it works is it's paid in December so it's paid or earlier the earlier in December the better you give them you pay them for the work they did in November and you immediately give them December's a bonus of one month's pay called the thirteenth month also its prorated so if you hired someone in June in December you pay them for the work they did in November and you give them half of one month's pay as a bonus because they work for you for half the year or if they if it was in October you'd give them a fourth or a third or whatever it works out to be so this is something that you should be paying even though it's not legally required for you the Filipinos will expect it they need it they base their lives around it this extra month of pay so it's really important and something you should be aware of number seventeen routine customs so I remember the very first email I ever got from someone said dear sir I hope you had a good and blessed day today here are the things I worked on test123 thanks and God bless and I remember I was I was 27 at the time and it was the very first time in my life I had ever been called sir and it felt so weird and I immediately started a response back that said please don't ever call me sir again and then I didn't end up sending that and I'm really glad I didn't because well first of all there's nothing you can do about it they're gonna call you sir or or or they'll call you sir man as a woman which is I don't know why they call you sir man but that's what they do or they'll call you boss or there's gonna be something like that it's gonna feel weird just leave it alone number 18 internet outages and power outage is probably the second biggest problem you'll encounter in the Philippines you will get an email from someone at some at some point that says sir I'm so sorry I couldn't work for four hours today because we had a power outage but don't worry sir I'll make it up for you tonight or on Saturday so at least you know they're being honest with you this is something you have to deal with when I when I first got started I didn't I I actually know when I first got started I wanted them to make it up I wanted them to make up their time today I really just like making their lives better and so I don't care if they make it up or not and often I'll say don't worry about it or depending on what they're working on I'll say yes please or you know you can make it up or don't you know you just you just need to figure out how you're gonna deal with it cuz it will happen so if you have time sensitive stuff you just need to be aware they're going to have internet outages and power outages it's part of it's part of the life there in fact often at different times a year these are planned the power outages are planned they know I'm gonna have a power outage so pay time off I I'm a little bit more relaxed with this some people you know say oh you know five paid time off days a year I when I hire someone don't do that I give them any time off they want I tell them I don't have any specific time you just take whatever you want or whatever you need don't take advantage of me also before you take time off I want to know ahead of time and that's really important to me so if you're sick let me know send me an email that day just say I'm sick and I can't work and that's good enough I just want to know what's going on also holidays so the Philippines has so in the u.s. we have like six holidays a year something like that six six required holidays in the Philippines they have like 13 and they have like 12 optional required optional holidays they have so many holidays and they're not the same as ours here so you just need to be aware that there's gonna be days where they'll take the day off because it's one of their holidays and you're not expecting it and we're dealing with poor work so one of the things that that I see is people either expect perfection the first time they don't get it and then they're really upset or when when something goes wrong they don't know how to deal with it so one of the things that I have always tried to do and I think it has worked really well is to always look for something positive in the work that was done even if everything is wrong I'll say thank you for trying now we gotta fix this on this and this and this and this and this and this even if I want to yell at them the first time like oh my gosh this is ridiculously bad you know I know that I've recruited someone good I know that I spent time recruiting so I will work through that with them at some point it comes time to let someone go I'm a little bit more relaxed about this than maybe I should be but I am one of the things I think that has made me have so much success with this over the years is that I'm very patient with people like I will give them multiple chances I'll give them a lot of chances before I fire them and and then they that's when they trust you and when you get a rock star workers only when they trust you so beyond that you'll need to you'll need to figure out how you're gonna deal with this obviously it's gonna happen you're gonna have poor work sometimes I have some people say hire slow and fire fast and I don't subscribe to that philosophy I don't think you should fire fast especially in the Philippines because you you're unlikely to ever get a rock star worker that way if you're firing people because they made a mistake number 21 it's on there twice daily communication daily email it will make such a big difference number 22 so I often see people will come to me and say I want to hire a team you know I want to hire five people I wanna hire three people and I think that's a disaster mistake I've seen it too many times hire one person see if you can make it work unless you've done this before if you've done this before then hire whatever you want but if you haven't hired in the Philippines before before you go and hire a team hire one person and see if you can make this work with that person see if they're compatible with you see if the culture works for you see if the time difference works for you and and that's your goal with this one person provide them the training to see if this works if it works this is gonna change your life if it doesn't work at least you know like okay I can't do this you know go move on and try somewhere else but if it does you're likely to hire other people you're you're likely to figure out how to cut your workload down this this is a life-changing thing if it works for you so here I'm just gonna talk through these steps getting started so the first thing is to recruit well spend time recruiting ask lots of questions narrow it down by asking questions and you'll find that people will drop out as you ask more and more questions and I there's some blog posts on online jobs where we talk about the questions that we ask I mentioned them earlier then as you hire someone spend time training invest in this person the more you invest in them the more of a rockstar worker they will become and that that investment is likely to pay off hundreds of times over over the years as they work for you in their loyal free I just I just talked to someone yesterday who said who said hey you changed my life nine years ago I hired this girl she's still with me today in fact she runs this business completely on her own and it makes a whole bunch of money for me so I guarantee you that he spent a bunch of time with her bring her up to speed and training her and giving her feedback and and helping her work through problems and he was patient when she had family issues cuz her mom died and she spent a week off and a month of unproductive work so spend time with them give them training provide provide training and feedback and training and feedback and and eventually you'll be able to stop providing the training because they'll they'll be learning stuff on their own my last slide is something I've already covered but so when you hire someone don't don't make don't make this mistake of saying like hey I want you to do 14 different things right hire one person to do one thing and make that one thing something you know how to do and that is that is really critical towards cutting your workload down rather than hiring someone to do something you don't know how to do something you can't do take a different approach and and hire someone to do something you can do first and teach them how to do that thing and get them really good at it and then when they're good at it teach them something else and and get them doing that and see if you can't gain four or ten hours back out of your life and then go and hire someone to do something you don't know how to do then go hire someone to build your website but first I you will find so much better success if you hire someone to do something you do know how to do and you spend the time training them and teaching them and teaching them your style and you'll get time back and that's why I said in the beginning this was more that more about lifestyle than it is about outsourcing so I wish you luck I wish you good luck as you go through and hire people we're available you can email support it online jobs that pH that will not go to me directly but if you ask for me you'll get me my name is John Jonas thanks for watching
