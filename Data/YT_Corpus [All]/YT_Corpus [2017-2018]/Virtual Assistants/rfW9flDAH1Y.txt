 in this video we're going to cover how to manage someone into being a rockstar virtual assistant for you so I want you to notice that I didn't say how to manage your Rockstar virtual assistants I said I want you to turn them into a rockstar based on your management and I've seen this over and over again where how you manage someone will change how they perform in their job so having said that I want to get into eight different pillars that I've not I have come up with that will help you manage these people really really well and turn them into Rockstar employees for you oh also with that I say that this only takes five minutes a day and the reality is it does only take five minutes a day but you have to spend the five minutes it's not something where you can spend 45 minutes once a week instead of five minutes each day it takes that daily commitment on your part to keep them to keep them going well and to turn them into that Rockstar so here are my eight pillars number one embarrassment number two they're human number three it's a long-term investment for what are the expectations five training six you need to be the expert seven and eight are communication and then I have some things that you need to watch out for so let's get into this number one is embarrassment it's the number one problem addict you'll have I've talked about it before it's really important that you recognize this so when a Filipino worker gets embarrassed or when they don't want to disappoint you they disappear and they do this because the losing face by having you get mad at them or you then disappointing you is worse to them than not having to deal with it and so often what employers think is oh this worker sucks they don't want this job they're not good enough or they're just lazy and the reality is that's not what's going on ninety-eight percent of the time the reality is this person is stuck on some things you didn't give them clear enough instructions and so they're going to disappear because of it the other situation that this creates is that if the Filipino worker doesn't trust you they won't try me two things which means in order to have a rockstar employee you want them to be thinking you want them to be trying things you want them even if they're going to fail they're willing to try it where if someone doesn't trust you they're scared that you're going to let them go or you're going to fire them or that you're going to yell at them when they try something new if they get it wrong the consequence is so high that they won't even try new things whereas if they trust you and by trust you mean they know that they're not going to be embarrassed if they get it wrong because you're not going to berate them you're going to tell them good try I'm so glad that you tried this then they're then they're willing to go above and beyond what you've asked them and try and bring solutions to you for things that they're working on so what causes this situation this embarrassment is either lack of training or poor training or miscommunication you often it's the employers fault and I nobody wants to be told that it's your fault but 95% of the time when we see this it's not the workers fault that this is going on it's the employers fault and I can see certain things that they can and should do differently to prevent this situation so training will often take care of it giving a different perspective of something will take care of it there's a lot of things that you can try including talking that I'm saying hey I think you're stuck on something and I want you to I want to know what it is what are you stuck on that I can help you prevent another couple things that cause this is assuming that they can do something or assuming they can do something well or not following up you know just letting them go giving them instructions and not following up ever again not asking how are they doing with it that can cause the situation so so when you give someone something to do you've got to follow up with them also this is a permanent problem it's some of it doesn't go away with time which is really unfortunate but the more you do things with this person the less of a problem it becomes so let me give you an example of this one time I heard this girl absolutely amazing super talented her parents are in the u.s. she speaks perfect English she can talk on the phone and solve people's problems she's really really great and I have to do some SEO work and she hated it she absolutely hated it but she even tell me that and she didn't want to tell me because I her boss asked her to do something so she continued making phone calls for us but stop sending me daily emails because she was too embarrassed to say that she doesn't want to do this and she hates it the SEO stuff and after a month or so I finally confront her and said hey what's going on you've disappeared why and she finally told me I hate this I don't want to do it and it's terrible I said okay that's fine and easy you don't have to disappear you don't have to do this again please don't ever disappear again if you disappear again I cannot have you working me this is too much so then she can do use doing good work for me for a while and then disappears again and and at other time it was a different issue but even though I had told her up front you cannot disappear again like this or I will have to let you go we had to let her go she was a great worker but it's an ongoing problem that persists so you've got to do things to prevent it actively and I don't think with her I had done enough actively to prevent it so my second pillar is recognize that you just hired a human they're going to make mistakes this is always going to happen they're never going to do things perfectly and since they're full-time worker they may not be an expert at what you have them doing so there are numerous things that you can do to prevent this or to improve this situation first always take the blame even even if it's clearly their fault say to them you know I'm sure I made a mistake in in teaching you how to do this or oh I see where I messed up here this is my fault I'm so sorry if you will take the blame it will go it will make your relationship with them so much better second always give positive feedback first so after you have said or maybe maybe they didn't do something totally wrong but there's just things that aren't great and there's things that are good always find some way to say I really like what you did here or I really like your effort here or this piece looks really great and then get into the negative however we have this problem and let's fix this and and and let's work through that the more you can get positive feedback first the big such a big difference it will make in fact it's such a big deal that one of my workers brought it to my attention recently that I hadn't been doing this with her and she knows that this is one of the things I talk about and and she said you know John you haven't been doing this with me and it really bothers me so so just the fact that you give positive feedback first really makes a difference so my third thing is to have patience you know you're not going to get everything done correctly the first time it's just how it works sometimes I will so I I have a good friend that says everything this guy does is perfect the first time which I don't know if I believe it but that's what he says so the more patience you can have obviously only up to a certain point the more trust you're going to build this person where they will start to do things that are knowing that you're going to be patient with them saying if I mess up it'll be okay and he'll he'll allow me to make this mistake but I can try new things so if you'll get things like one of my guys one time I had asked him to do something on a website and my instructions were very unclear and I didn't realize that but so he goes through it and then sent it back to me says sir is this what you're looking for I'm not sure if this is what you want and he sent it back to me he tried something and it wasn't what I wanted and I realized oh my instructions were terrible here but because I had patience with him over time now he's willing to try new things so my fourth thing within this is give praise and give lots of praise when they do things right tell them oh yes this is awesome I'm so happy with you maybe give them a bonus give lots of praise limit when things go right so I want to show you an example of this so let's look at this graphic that one of my guys did for me so in this I had to lay out this page and he add this little graphic here to this little robot thing which you know this is the page about outsourcing and to add a robot to a page right officers it kind of gives the wrong impression right it looks nice but it's not the right thing to happen and over here these bullet points are like toxic icons therefore like a toxic waste thing and so when you send this to me I had a big mix of emotions that I laughs because he sent me a robot which he's not a robot or why he put a robot in this about outsourcing and then these toxic symbols are like oh man we cannot have this but the beige looks good right so I said you know what you did a great job with this the pigs looks fantastic here a couple things we need to change number one let's light a different graphic here we are Oh bot gives the wrong impression and these toxic things yeah we just can't put that there so you know there's kind of a mix there in in how often things are going to go right and how often you can go wrong and the corrections you're gonna have to make in all of it just remember you're not doing the work they're doing the work so my last thing within this is to recognize that they're a human and be human yourself be nice to them recognize they have problems and they have families and they needs and and they have things going on in their lives that may cause them to have to fly to Manila for a couple days and not work for you and don't yell at them when this happens it's going to happen and be kind to them the nicer you are the better of an experience you're going to have other ways to do this is to ask them about their family you know how is your family I was your brother how's your mom give them a bonus on their birthday you know send them send them $15 extra maybe the month of their birthday saying happy birthday you know they'll be thrilled Lilly thrilled that you remembered their birthday along with that you know the Philippines is a hard place to live they have these they have typhoons that come through and just destroy things and when when something like that happens you might want to send them some money to help them rebuild their lives or you know when their mom has major surgery and they're taking that a loan to pay for you might consider helping them pay for it will go a long ways towards them really looking up to you as a boss and really building long-term loyalty so along with the birthdays thing let me show you show you this email sequence I have the one of my guys so I had sent him an extra bonus for his birthday and said thank you for doing great work for me thanks always been willing to improve and listening to my nagging about the daily but this is not good at sending me the daily email it's so I nag him about it but he's an amazing work his response back was thank you sir for being a great fantastic and caring bot you're the best boss in the world you know the more time you'll spend with them of the more you care about them the better response you'll have from them another thing that you can do with them is ask them how they like their job you know how do you like your job what don't you like about it what can I do to help you what can I do better in my work you know what things do you see in our business that we could do better that might make your life easier all these things go towards showing that you're a human and you care about them and that you recognize that they're a human and and that they have a personality and a life and needs and and the more you do that the more they'll trust you so my third thing in this is in the my pillars is is look at this is a long-term investment where if you're hiring a contract workers you know it's a short-term thing if you're hiring a long-term employee you know this is going to be long-term and you can your brain will allow you to do other things because it's long term so one of the things that will allow you to do is to give them training where you wouldn't normally give someone training and that will help them do things that are different in your business that someone else couldn't do which frees up your time in looking at a long term investment you can also spend time solving problems with them where you wouldn't do that with a contract worker you know a contract worker you would expect them to be able to do with all themselves right now and with a permanent worker you can take that extra time even if it takes you longer to teach them to do it than it would for you to do yourself the next time that comes up it'll take them less time and the next time something else comes up that's similar but not the same they'll still have that extra knowledge that will help them solve that faster so the more you look at this is a long-term investment the better off you're going to be within working with this person a couple things to consider in this is providing incentives one of the things that provides good incentives to Filipinos is to give them ownership of something it shows that you trust them so like this project this is your this is your project I want you to own this and I want you to take care of it assuming of course you've given them training you made yourself available to them providing financial incentives is often a disincentive to Filipinos so I've had worker I've had employers come to me and say you know I know it's a long-term thing so I'm going to give my employees a piece of the business if it succeeds and what I've seen is that that's actually a disincentive for that Filipino because they say oh if I don't succeed he's going to fire me if I don't do this work then they're not going to get this money he's going to lower my salary you know and that often is it does not it backfires on you so in long-term business ownership is probably not a good incentive
