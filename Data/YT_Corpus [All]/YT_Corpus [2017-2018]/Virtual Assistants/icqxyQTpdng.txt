 Hi, my name's Rob O'Byrne, and welcome to this next video on outsourcing to help grow your business so we've covered quite a bit so far we've talked about how to find the A's how to recruit them select them different ways of doing the training how you're going to actually manage things in the first week or so now I'd like to talk about pay because that's pretty important that's why they're doing this work then you may love working with you and they love your products and services but at the end of the day they have to make a living so let's talk about pay first of all be fair okay you're getting a great deal because you're generally hiring people at a much lower cost maybe ten percent that it would cost in your own country so you need to pay a fair rate so don't be mean and ones getting pulled off sort of being the opposite of mine so be fair now how do you know how much to pay we talked earlier on about home-based VA s and office based fides now I'll give you a rough indication but obviously it depends very much on the role it's going to vary a lot and it depends you know when you're watching this video if this was recorded a year or two ago so for a home-based and I'll put this in US dollars you're probably sort of 350 to 450 per month something like that for an office based you're probably looking at sort of seven hundred two thousand a month possibly now let's start there wouldn't be double rent maybe nine hundred at some time just very rough figures so why the difference in the figures let's explain so if you think about the home-based VA for staff they have no overhead they may not be paying health insurance anything like that the money is basically just going into their pocket and that's why they can actually do it cheaper for the office based the let me just say if you're picking an office based a VA do check them out check out the company make sure I started out using a large BPO and I found they actually weren't that ethical so do check out you know try to get some references for the company that you're looking at the benefits of an office based are fairly significant not cover those in a minute it's going to cost you a little bit more because in I'll talk about my office for an example they're getting you know paid this but they're also then getting health insurance getting gym membership they're getting holiday pay they're getting a team leader to support them that's the thing to watch out with office base VA is try to find out what the team leaders job is because in a lot of the big be POS the team leader has their own team lead or supervisor has their own client as well as supervising maybe up to 20 VA s in our office team leaders don't have clients they are there purely to support their team and they only have about 10 VA s so they're actually supporting each of the VA s in their roles and so on so you've got what all of these additional costs we talked about health insurance is so important one of my team had to go in the hospital for an operation couple of weeks ago their company health insurance paper all so glad to hear that so health you know our guys have gym membership does all the IT support is all the HR support you know all of the relevant taxes and so on are being paid to make sure that they're legal we we've got that you know the supervision we've got the training so dessert there's a fair bit of additional cost that goes into the office based VA we I mean in our office for example we have backup power we actually have a generator sitting right outside the office some heroes in the Philippines but know that get burn outs and things like that you're also getting you know leave cover generally so when your videos going and leave you know they're getting badly you get someone else to cover I saw the benefits also have an office based one are that if you suddenly get a peak in workload they may be able to you know provide extra staff for you for whatever period that you need so that's that's really just explaining why these costs are very often sort of double those costs but there are an enormous amount of benefits the other difference that I found with home-based pas and I don't want to be unkind here I've had home be based of EA's that was supposed to be working for me full-time than they quite clearly weren't they had two or three clients I also had a home-based VA who had to work really strange hours because of her to live living environment and I just didn't work when the internet was terrible and that didn't last so I only do office space now it's just so much more professional and so much easier to manage so I'm talking about pay what you should be doing is going online and doing a bit of a check around whether you're going for home-based or office based do the research and see what's a fair rate because you know you don't want to be you certainly don't want to be mean but you certainly don't want to be sort of paying way over the so do your research behind based on office and find out sort of what the what the fair pay rates are there's a couple of other things that we should talk about with pay and and also that is bonuses so I haven't actually talked about countries yet I suppose I don't want to be down on any particular country or a number of different countries where you can source of EA's I know people have them from India friends of mine have videos based in Eastern Europe and they're terrific to my mind the big hub of outsourcing is the Philippines and it's the Philippines for a reason that is that the Filipinos have a great work ethic they generally have really good English language skills if indeed that's what you need and they're just really good honest people to work with so yeah that's my preference so and it's probably why you know the Philippines leads the world really on sort of outsourcing let's talk about bonuses a bit if you are home-based that's a little bit easier for you to manage if your office based I've had an office-based VA when I was paying bonuses and then I found out that they were taking 3 months to get to the VA where I didn't exactly make me very happy to be honest that relationship with that BPO didn't last long what all of this is is partly and all of these benefits and things partly the reason that I set up my own BPO to be honest and without going into a long story I'll share that with you now I started off with two or three VA s in a large BPO I didn't like the way they were being treated and the way it was being run I'm sorry I thought I'll set up my own they worked out their contracts it was all done properly we set up around business we had four I think to start with my the team who now looks after me has grown to eight I think I have about there's another six who look after other elements of my business and then what we did is we started to grow the business with additional staff to actually help other businesses of a small business owners and so the team is just growing and growing and I just like to know that it's run properly to be honest okay let's get back to the subject of bonuses I've got some really terrific advice that a seminar the other day you know I don't love going to seminars and learning stuff in level two I'll stop learning and this guy was talking about how to motivate staff and how to reward them and his view was that you shouldn't reward outcomes you should reward effort and think about that for a moment he's so right so if you're rewarding you know I need this website built by 30 June oh great you know there's a bonus or I need this thing designed by 15th of July and we've done it well done there's a bonus you're kind of training people to expect that there's going to be a reward every time they do a big task which is probably not a good behavior to encourage so what this guy was saying is reward effort and that's what I tend to do now so you know if some of the team have been giving an example one of my teams are really good with systems and I said look it's only way we can integrate this system in this system so that when something happens here our contact management system automatically gets updated and then something over here does and like three days later said yep all done Wow and there was a few things that had happened and so you know I would give a small bonus and so I had it that's going to have been really little bit of you've done some great stuff there so I tend to reward effort where people have stepped up and learnt new things or you know they put in a particular effort for you know whatever reason the way to pay bonuses um and my experience is mainly now with the Philippines so let's let's talk about Philippines not everybody has a bank account we make sure all our people our bank accounts and that they save and all of those things that's another story they're not necessarily have a bank account so that generally don't have PayPal and things like that Western Union is the easiest way to do this you pay a little bit of Commission and I don't go nuts but if if your team if your staff have really put in a great effort and you know really done some great work for you small bonuses are really really appreciated you know and I should add actually whether your VA is are based so a minor in the Philippines some stake get over there understand the culture understand the working environment now you'll feel a lot closer to your team and you know you can see what a 20 30 40 dollar bonus can do you know goes a long way you tell you so bonuses are really important there is just one thing what this was cool because I also have a business up in Thailand and up there they have a similar sort of process whereby christmas is an extra month pay so you need to be aware of these cultural things basically there's the sort of a rice bonus in Philippines and traditionally you know staff would have been given a twenty five fifty kilo bag of rice or whatever to take home at Christmas this is virtually now become like a 13 month 13th month bonus so be aware of these things so you know it's probably expected you know check that out with a time based or or office base do you do your own research and be prepared that you may need to pay that so but again you're not paying a huge amount anyways so just just factor that into the cost okay so that's all about pay I think we'll talk maybe a little now I was going to about tools and training next but we've kind of covered that let's just move next video and we'll summarize you
