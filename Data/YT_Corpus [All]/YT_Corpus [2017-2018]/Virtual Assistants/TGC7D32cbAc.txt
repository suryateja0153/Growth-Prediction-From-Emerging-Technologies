 Hi, this is Rob Oberlin and welcome to this video series on outsourcing to de-stress reduce your working hours and grow your business I'm going to share some tips that I've learnt over the last eight or nine years on outsourcing and if you follow these it's going to help you enormous Lee in all of those elements of your business or number of businesses whatever you have you're going to be able to cut your hours down cut down the stress and it doesn't have to cost you a fortune so the first thing I want to talk about is what exactly is 8va what is a virtual assistant now a lot of people are using these now business owners and entrepreneurs but a virtual assistant is generally known as a VA and if you imagine someone that is working entirely for your business they just aren't sitting in your office or wherever you're doing your business if you like me I was working from the back bedroom for a couple of years so a virtual assistant can basically do everything that an employee would sitting in your office but their remote hence their virtual and the trend in recent years I mean this all started I thinking about really took off in about 2007 when Tim Ferriss wrote the four hour workweek but it was going on a few years before that but the whole concept is that people are generally sourcing virtual assistants from overseas not in their own country and there's a very good reason for that and what is that it is cost wherever you may be dollars pounds euros if you just think for a moment about the cost of support staff in your own country it can be a real struggle for business startups and small businesses I know it was for me when I started out and the thought of actually employing local staff at 60 or 70 thousand dollars it just wasn't within my reach and so that's why I ended up working 80 90 100 hours a week so virtual assistants are a great way to actually get you the support that you need to help you grow your business and for you to focus on the things that are really important and that's looking after your customers and looking after your sales so the concept has been around for quite a while the early 2000s really sort of took off in the mid 2000 2004 up to about 2007 and now most savvy small business owners and entrepreneurs are utilizing virtual assistants so that is exactly what a virtual assistant is that just like a staff member working with you but they remote where are they well a lot of people use virtual assistants based in their own country so they could be local I'm not sure there's a huge amount of benefit in that though from a cost perspective there may be fun because they might be working at home there are obviously benefits in terms of language and culture that type of thing certainly some people do use locally based virtual assistants most however use overseas based virtual assistants and the reason for that is purely the cost and it can be as little as 10% of hiring a local person so just think about that for a moment what could that do for your business if you were able to get people helping you with your websites with your marketing taking calls running appointments at about 10 percent of the cost that you would pay here that is a phenomenal advantage it's particularly in the early days of starting your business up so if you're thinking about virtual assistants local sure offshore generally a lot more popular for that for the obvious reason of cost and then it's a question of do you get home-based or office based and let me explain that so home-based a virtual assistant is literally that they're working at home they're providing all of their own equipment internet communications and so on they're looking after themselves and they were working for you virtually I have done that I've had a number of VA s who are home-based I choose to actually have office based fides I let go through a lot of detail in a later video why that is but if you just start thinking for a moment what are some of the advantages of the home base they're probably going to be cheaper because they don't have any overhead there's no management structure they may not be paying things that they ought to be paying watch out for that I've had home-based virtual assistants who weren't paying taxes and you know you don't want to get involved in all of that sort of thing the office based are probably going to cost you a little bit more but then think about the support the redundancy factor you know if they're away sick like that to me is a lot better option so there are some positives and negatives you know for either a lot of people start with home-based and then gravitate towards an office based to be honest so I think you know we know what a virtual assistant is we know why people use it why people use the services of virtual assistants but there's probably a nagging doubt at the back in mind and there often is with people and is it's about ethics is this really ethical are we nearly taking jobs away from people in our local communities and sending them overseas you know we're not really supporting our local community are we I would challenge though I would say that through this mechanism using virtual assistants everybody's a winner and I have seen that through the 8 of 10 years that I've been using virtual assistants what it enabled me to do was to actually have supporting my business early on when I needed it at a cost that I could afford and basically I couldn't afford to hire local people anyway so these virtual assistants were taking jobs away from anybody because I couldn't afford to hire people in my own country as the business then rolled forward basically what is happening is that through the support of the virtual assistants my business is growing I can now actually afford to more staff in my own country but they're not the support staff they're not the lower levels loan lower sort of paid staff I actually was able to hire a lot more professional staff in my business so my professional team grew bigger my consulting team my training team on the basis of having that cost effective support in the early days so it's actually a win-win when you as the business owner when because you get this boost of support very cost-effective that you need to actually help your business grow the staff that you're hiring and being there or Philippines or wherever else and I'll talk about the pros and cons of different countries of sourcing virtual assistants they're winning because generally these are areas where people desperately want good jobs and to be honest you know you're employing you're creating employment in your local area anyway because your visit business is great and therefore you need those local professional staff to help you deliver the services so it really is a win-win-win and I've now had a virtual assistants working as an integral part of my business for eight or ten years now I could not do without them they are fantastic workers they allow me to do so much more in my business they are great people to work with they are just you know as much a part of my team as the people based in my local office and in fact they come to visit me once a year we'll come over here come and stay with me I often go over to visit their office so you know it's a really very very close relationship and it works marvelously okay so we talked a little bit about what a virtual assistant is the options of sourcing them why we need to do that let me then move on in the next video to how we actually find those virtual assistants where are they how do we select them I'll see you next video
