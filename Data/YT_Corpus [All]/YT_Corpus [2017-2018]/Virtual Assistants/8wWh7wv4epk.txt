 in this set we're going to cover this in more depth in more detail I'm going to get into things about recruiting and evaluating who you're going to recruit and exactly how to hire people and how to manage them we're going to go into really good depth on this stuff so you can get really good at it the better you get at this the more success you'll have the better off you're going to be at getting other people to do your work for you so you can live a better lifestyle and in the end that's my goal with this is for you to live a better lifestyle through outsourcing through being good at outsourcing so as we go through this I want you to think about the details of things that I'm talking about I want you to pay attention to how you're sending emails to workers and to what things you say when you're recruiting them which will make a big difference on your ability to find really great workers versus just ok workers and it'll make a big difference on your on the experience you have as you hire workers to having really great experience and being able to replace yourself versus just having a little bit of extra help we're gonna get into depth and how I recruit people and tactics you can use to to get better workers so my first thing that I want you to understand is don't be like this guy here's an email I got from someone and he says to me first I want to hire a Filipino who can one study the Nano blogging system and build WordPress blogs using your thesis theme create good header graphic design and logo and write articles creating videos and do social bookmarking using such a bot so your first requirement is that you want someone who can build WordPress do graphic design write good content do social media and create videos that's a lot second I need him or to reply forum posts at least 20 forum posts a day and provide tips and value to the phone key so they need to be really smart and participate in forums every day learn any of the inner creative opt-in page in my blogger write a pre-sale sales letter so you want him to be a copywriter and to be able to create opt-in forms fourth I need him or her to write a 30 page ebook 15 page free reporting this is ridiculous there's no such thing as this person that this guy is looking for and surprisingly he's not the only one like this I've had quite a few emails from people saying I need someone who can do all these things person doesn't exist so as you recruit find one or two skills that you're looking for and and narrow it down in the beginning I'm looking for this on this skill and then I'm also looking for other things that I've talked about before dedicated worker consistent work and I'll show you how to get those in this video so when I'm recruiting a new worker I'm always using online jobs now pH it's the only ones that I use I own it and I've told you that but it is the biggest and the best place to find people so I'm going to focus on it before I do that though I'm going to give you a couple other options just in case you don't want to use what I use you can try and use Craigslist Manila Craigslist org is an option I've never actually seen someone successfully recruit someone from Craigslist and I think a big part of that is that there's quite a few scams Craigslist is very unmoderated in this area and so there's a lot of scams or scams from employers and so Filipinos don't trust it and their scams from workers which just make it hard it's an option it's not a very good option another option is best jobs pH when I first started best jobs was amazing they've gone way downhill since then the number of resumes they have is shrunk instead of grown it's not rocket another option is ez outsource comm it's not as good as online jobs but it's pretty good so that you know that's another option another option is is a website that's actually run in the Philippines pH job Street comm they're pretty expensive but they have a large pool of workers and you can post a job when you'll get you'll get some good responses another option is to go use a recruiting agency so you know there's when I got started this is what I did I admit agents of value comm there they are a recruiting agency they have workers in the Philippines they recruit those workers and bring them into the office and they mark up their salaries and lease them back to you there's thousands of companies that I'll do this a couple other bigger ones are one city employee there's tons of companies that'll do this where they get an office in the Philippines and bring the workers in and and mark them up you know it's an okay situation at least they give them to you full-time or they only work for you and they provide them a computer and internet access which they already have at home some of the problems I lost a worker there in the very beginning doing this because they couldn't handle the off politics they were a good worker but there's politics in the office and they didn't like it as I quit the market the salary markup using them will also be six to ten thousand dollar a year difference which you know is is acceptable its it didn't work for me so those are a couple other options now I'm going to focus on online Java dot pH so it online jobs there are a couple options for how you're going to recruit people one options to post a job and the second option is to browse through resumes and contact workers you can use a combination of both which I do very often so in posting a job on online jobs on page I have a couple specific things you can and should and shouldn't do and then I have some examples for you so number one when you're posting the job be specific with a couple things but don't be too specific with everything don't tell them all of your employment policies upfront don't tell them Bill need to work on 18 different things you'll want them to work you'll want to give them very specific things of a couple tasks but then leave it generic the problem is that if a Filipina thinks that they're not qualified to do one of the six things that you list they would even apply and then you're losing good candidates who could have done all the things but they were sure and they don't want to disappoint you they don't want to let your damn other things that will happen if you post a job you're going to get a lot of responses and some a lot of those some of those responses are just going to be junk they're not going to be filled with people that you want to work with and there's very little we can do about it although I'll give you some tactics where you can avoid that you'll need to filter through those job responses after you've posted and kind of narrow it down to who's responding well and then you'll have to respond and communicate with them a whole bunch at that point it's very similar to browsing through resumes and contact where you're going to communicate and narrow them down through your communication and your interview process when you post a job you're probably going to get a couple really great responses as you do this just make sure that your filtering make sure your filtering workers because anybody who's trying to scam someone from the Philippines that person is probably responding to job offers rather than waiting for people to to find them and find their resume so you leave you a little bit better filtering if you post a job but you'll probably also have more options whichever one of these you use or if you use a combination of both I have a couple tips for you number one if you're hiring a designer a webmaster or a programmer always verify their skills or an English writer verify their skills look to see examples of the work see their design work look at websites they've built in the past look at samples of their writing get them to send samples or ask them to write something new for you it can be short one paragraph which will give you a good sample of their work also you should be aware that different regions of the country will demand different salaries so if you're hiring someone in Manila they're going to be the highest paid workers in the Philippines and there have a huge talent pool in Manila because it's the biggest city some of them Davao is going to be painless and the salaries can be double from devout to Manila who you're hiring and you could hire the same person from develop or from Manila and it's going to cost you twice as much in Manila I'm not saying it's not good to hire a manila because there's a lot more talent there but you can usually find people in outlying areas that have really good skills it will cost you quite a bit less another thing that you should be aware of is that sometimes usually you're going to get what you pay for not always but usually so if someone is saying they have lots and lots of experience but their salary asking price is really low that's a red flag and you should just be aware of it be careful of that it could be someone who is working for eight different employers and they are skilled but they're not giving you the time that you want them to give you so another tip that I have for you is to ask them to take a test once you've kind of narrowed it down or you're narrowing it down ask them to take a test but maybe that's a test you find online maybe it's a test that's available at online jobs up th but if you can ask them to take a test often what we find is that workers who are trying to scam someone or willing to take a test and you'll filter out problems that way another thing that kind of throws a red flag to me as I recruit is if someone has too few skills or has too few skills or too many skills so someone who says they're really good at everything in my experience is just not right something's wrong there and then someone who has said that they haven't given themselves any four or five star ratings and all my job's tells me they're not confident enough in themselves to be a functional worker I want to look for someone who says they're good at some things but they also recognize they're not good at everything so those are some of my tips as you as you move forward there's a things to look for and things to watch out for okay so let's talk for a minute about if you're going to contact workers things that you should do and some of these principles are the same for posting a job versus contacting workers one of the things that I see people make a mistake often is I'll get an email from someone that says I'm shortlisting my list of potential candidates who I'm going to contact that's the wrong way of approaching this the way to approach contacting workers is to contact a whole bunch and see who responds going back to the Filipino loyalty thing if someone has a job already in the Philippines they're likely to not even respond to your job inquiry that's a loyal layout and so if you are contacting people who already have jobs and you shortlisted it to three and all three of them have jobs they're not going to respond and you're gonna be really disappointed so what I recommend you do is contact 30 people
