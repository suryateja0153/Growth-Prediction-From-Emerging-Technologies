 this is a demonstration for high dynamic range video with automatic exposure the modern-day HDR was invented by Professor Steve man ACR involves a process of combining images taken at different exposure levels to eliminate washed out parts or completely darkened parts from a normal camera image the problems with the existing technology are that you need to know where the exposure values required for combining of the images and also the process of combining these images is very computationally intensive and that makes it very difficult to implement HDR video as you can see over here we have implemented an automatic exposure selection process for ACR which automatically adjusts the exposure values so that the entire dynamic range of the scene is covered you can you can see this adjusting to the light levels
