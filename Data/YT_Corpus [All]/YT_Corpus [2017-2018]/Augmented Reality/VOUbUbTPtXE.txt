 hi guys welcome to my channel and usually we do reviews of games like Xbox games or walkthroughs or gameplay videos and I've done a few reviews of products but today I'm gonna review an app on my phone is called snatch and basically what it is it's a augmented reality game bit like Pokemon go we can actually win cash prizes instead of Pokemon excited you should be it's made on Android and also on iPhone and one should once you download it you basically see a map like this of your local area and see all these parcels nearby basically the aim of the game is to collect those and once you tap on one you have to hold on to it for six hours and whatever is inside it you get to keep sounds pretty easy right well not really because there's also snatching involved and snatching means that if for instance you go to this little indicator here all these people potentially have boxes that you can snatch and if you snatch a box off them you might not necessarily have to wait six hours because they might have held onto it for a while already and then once it's open you win what's inside anyway I'll show you the basics so here I am in a random car park and if you click on this parcel it gives you the option to snatch it so you just basically try and get it into your view bear with me this is the tricky bit got it so once you've snatched it this is what shows up you picked up a parcel and then you go back to find more parcels so I've got five at the moment you can see in the top right and if I click on that it shows me how long is left on them so my I've got one ending in three minutes and the one I just picked up because it's a parcel and not one I've snatched it's got five hours left then I scroll down to the bottom of my parcels you can see I've got one that's been secured so what you do then is you tap on reveal so basically nobody's snatched this one off me in six hours and you can win all sorts of prizes let me see what this one is coins yeah so the coins although they're the least exciting thing you can win they're really super useful because on this page here if somebody tries to steal anything off me and there's a few snatches in the vicinity what you need to do is basically you can go into here oh no sorry this one this brings you a list of various things you can use to defend yourself so you've got a tent which you can put up so nobody can get you for a little while there's the invisibility cloak and which you can wear and nobody can sense you're their emergency battery basically tapping them all it tells you what it does so if your battery's running low it gives you a bit more bit more time to protect your stash until you find some juice there's a snatch proof vest which defends you against one attempted snatch and smoke screen which is one I use the most is fifty five coins but for 15 minutes nobody can get you and also there's these super weapons which you have to get diamonds for supermassive black hole you can set that off anywhere and if there's parcels nearby or people nearby you can snatch everything that's there basically so taking you back to the main screen again I'll show you what it's like when you snatch something of somebody so if I click on this here I can try anyway I'm going to go for thief 101 because he's a bit of a cheeky customer keeps robbing off us so you click on snatch he has any parcel so you can't snatch anything of him so let's try that's two shaded oh no parcels there either I'm think across that paradox iam void got something I've always away bitching here we go so as you can see there's a little bar the tapas is snatching in progress I got three minutes to try and sneak his item off him without him noticing so and if he notices obviously then you could put one of his defenses it doesn't have to put up a defense if you've got no coins left you can simply surrender the item but usually I'll put up some kind of defense so that it stops the snatching progress and basically you can steal from them and they can steal from you and what we have noticed though is that when we go to bed at night obviously you've snatched something and it could be sort of midnight two o'clock in the morning is still our left someone might wake up before you and snatch it off you knows nothing you can do about it see you hopefully will get something off him I can show you what it looks like you might even have something that's not got very long left oh yeah there's the golden there's also the golden Parcells actually thinking about it and in them you get can get cash you can get Playstations you can get sort of flights abroad and and the only other thing I need to mention really is there's also safe houses so if you're driving along and you've got ten parcels and there's about just under an hour left on any of those you can check in to sell your safe houses which are usually sort of cafes pubs and restaurants and as long as you stay there for an hour then they can't get you so that's quite useful if you know you've got a few openings soon or you've even got a golden box it's quite a new game this really it came out in November of last year and the most recent update was yesterday and it's the 10th of March today or the 11th 2017 so they're updating it all the time and I've been in touch with the people who make it and they basically said that today they're going to be launching it in America and over the coming months is going to be launched worldwide I think it'll be really popular because if I love playing Pokemon go even kids oh wait a minute what's up in there one of my ones is just did you see on the top right the fight went down to a four that means one of my parcels can be opened which we call yes so the snatch people they've got really good and useful Twitter and Facebook page and they said basically at the moment there's sort of tens of thousands of pounds of cash in play at any one time and we've got a message on our phone today saying that somebody had won 500 pounds so it's definitely worth playing because it's nothing to lose here we go 78% 20% to go is he going to notice me we're outside a supermarket at the moment it's a really good place to go snatching because most of people are in there concentrating on their shopping not realizing there's people outside trying to rob their items as they walk around with their shopping trolleys come on this would be so cool if we can get it off him 86% eighty nine ninety come on come on come on ideally it'd be some it'd be like golden box I'll be pretty sweet we don't had one of those yet so the people at snatch there's no plans yet to arrange a protection for overnight when you fall asleep I guess that's the beauty of the game it's called snatch so you need to be alert at all times you have to be 17 plus to play this let's have a look so what we got what do we get this guy click on here I think it might be mm don't know which one it is might be that town lane one possibly so that's pretty good so 23 minutes left on that one I'll just open this up one that's just literally coming across might be coins again might be something a bit better time for the reveal this is the exciting bit come on come on oh it's just coins against hundred coins so what you need to do with these coins is they don't automatically get added to your coin total at the top what you need to do is if you go into this little bar here and go into my winnings and so these are the coins I've won so if you redeem them that's when they get added to your coin total redeem redeem and obviously these are other things that I've won so far so pretty good I've got a two month subscription to now TV if I choose to accept it and there's also five pounds to spend at Prezi bugs but as things like Nando's vouchers as I said there's flights abroad t-shirts Playstations as also there's a really really good game and it's pretty new and I reckon everybody should get it because it's gonna make it so much more fun anyway hope you enjoyed the video and go and look for snatch I'll leave a little link in the comments about where you can get it from and yeah enjoy happy snatching see you later guys bye
