 I'm Marc-O-Matic I'm from Victoria, Australia I've been creating art and storytelling experiences through augmented and virtual reality I've been teaching myself AR and VR over the last two years particularly because I love storytelling and immersive tech allows me to bring my Illustrations and artworks to life It requires me to wear two different hats, both as an artist and a technologist so I do everything from creating the stories the artworks, animations as well as integrating the functionality behind the experiences I think the terms VR and AR are generally associated with videogames but they can also be used by creatives to tell stories in ways that lets audiences become part of the narrative So through VR headsets or mobile devices audiences are able to explore the details of my work as the stories unravel I think with such an abundance of knowledge and community support online, these days artists able to teach themselves almost anything And I think being able to experiment and try new skills are very important for anyone wanting to get into these emerging fields
