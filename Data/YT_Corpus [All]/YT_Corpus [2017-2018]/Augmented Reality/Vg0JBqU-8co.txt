 Not too long ago, even the smartest people, you know, scholars, scientists, and sages, could only go by what they saw with their own eyes, but when the telescope came along, a new world came into focus. Today, there are two game changers that, like the telescope, are transforming the bounds of research, exploration, and imagination. They're called virtual and augmented reality. Now, here's how they're different. With virtual reality, you wear a pair of goggles that covers your entire field of view, immersing you in an imagined or replicated world. Augmented reality uses glasses or a screen to superimpose digital images and information over what you're seeing in the real world, and here's the deal. Over the next decade, VR and AR are primed to be the next big things in computing technology. How big? We're talking potential for $95 billion in hardware and software sales by 2025, and the buyers won't all be die hard video gamers. For example, eight million doctors and EMTs world wide could use virtual and augmented reality for everything from medical procedures to virtual visits to treating patients with anxiety disorders, and 200 million primary and secondary school students in developed countries could use these technologies to take virtual field trips and interact with objects in a 3D environment. At their best, VR and AR will revolutionize computer interaction, making it even more intuitive and collaborative than it is today. This is the pulse of technology you need to see with your own eyes.
