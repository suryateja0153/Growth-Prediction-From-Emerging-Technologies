 [background music] Hamel Hey Cortana, take a video. So this is the hololens, and what we're hoping to accomplish is to use a device like this to essentially create an augmented reality, and what that would do is it would help people using this device, which is is our dual particle imager, project onto kind of a real life scene where sources of radiation are located, which might help first responders or inspectors and nuclear facilities to really get a sense of what they're actually seeing. This device is is measuring and creating a spatial representation of where the radiation is located, but normally that's really only laid out on on a 2D computer screen. The hope is that with with this device which is the hololens we can project out a hologram and that would kind of take what you see on a 2d screen and put it out into the real world and let the user really interact with what this device is measuring.
