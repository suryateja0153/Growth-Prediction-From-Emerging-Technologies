TEACHER: Pretend you're an airplane and fly over the tornado STUDENT: That's the top of it. TEACHER: What do you see? STUDENT: These are asteroids! Meteoroids. TEACHER: We're learning about DNA and genes. Things that we can't see. So the most exciting thing for me with the AR technology was that I could see kids get an "Aha!" moment that I couldn't get by just telling them about it. The minute I saw it pop up on the screen it made me want to get up and walk to it You actually get to turn around and look at things from all angles so it gave us a nice perspective. TEACHER: See if you can figure out what that might be based on what you know about the respiratory system. STUDENT: I got to see where the alveoli branched off  and I can look inside them and see how everything works, which I never saw before. And it was really, really cool. &lt;music playing
