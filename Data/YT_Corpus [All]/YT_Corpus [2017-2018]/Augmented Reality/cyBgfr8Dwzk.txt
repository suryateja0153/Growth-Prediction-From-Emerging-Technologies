 Pattern to be recognized Filtering to highlight edges Trying to identify corners, but not necessarily they are restricted to patterns Better identify closed curves shapes that define pattern. Identifying just closed shapes in the image Detecting corner points on closed shapes. Identifying the 4 highest curvature points define the shapes. Corners detected on the pattern Orientation of corner points based on center points of two rectangles.Orientation matching. Corresponding points in image and model are identified. Different colors. This matching of image and model points will be used for virtual camera calibration.Virtual camera is created. Now we can render virtual objects inside the video streaming. Objects will be rendered accordingly depending of virtual camera distance. Another example of object projection. Thanks
