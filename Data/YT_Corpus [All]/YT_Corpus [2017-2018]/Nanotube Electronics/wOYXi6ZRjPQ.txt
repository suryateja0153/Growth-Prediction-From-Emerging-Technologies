 [Music] so our researcher MIT focuses on both the development and experimental realization of what I like to call nano system so what what is a nano system well in data system is when we take new emerging technologies these enable new types of devices like new transistors new types of memory cells maybe new types of sensors etc and billionaires SMS the question well just having a better transistor or a better memory so gives me a little bit of benefit but how can I combine all these benefits altogether in order to realize new types of systems which in the end to enable Vario types of applications the types of applications that we're looking at currently here in our group range from both traditional high performance computing applications and these are how do I make a computer run faster how do I make my cell phone battery last ten times longer to applications that extend beyond the scope of what we would think a typical electronic system would do because electronics are not just contained to building better computers a better cell phone so for instance I if we can build systems which have sensors memory and computation all intertwined I'll gently integrated in three-dimensional stacks for instance I what types of metals application for corner of care diagnostic care could we perform so ILP has been a tremendous asset for myself here at MIT forming the connections between the research that we're doing in our group and different member companies that come and visit and those just those conversations that we have I've already themselves not just created contact but they've also created branding research projects and because we have our ideas of what we find interesting and we're cause I'm looking for you know a new application where we can apply the research in our group - so all the time we're meeting with different companies that come in and they have a very different set of problems a very different set of applications that they're interested in and it's exciting for us because not only does it make our work that much more broad but I know we learn a lot from meeting with these companies you know what are the important problems you know to ask what are different applications we can apply research to one of the many emerging technologies that we focus on are carbon nanotubes I think they're they're an excellent case study for the type of work that we try and do because we don't you know what we focus on asking the question how do we make a really improve device these Netta - what I think is really exciting is what are the new types of systems that we can build using this new underlying technology and recently there's been you know for for many many years no one could build any type of system using nanotubes and certainly if you could build any type of very very small field circuit it would be very very low performance and devices would also not you know achieve the performance of promise and recently I think we've made both myself and you know uh collaborators and the whole community this whole field has made huge advancements specifically with carbon nanotubes and I've shown devices that can compete against state-of-the-art silicon we've been able to build systems now that have millions of these devices on them and I think it really shows that after all these years of work that some researchers are put into the field is starting to become fruitful and what it allows us to do know is we can go beyond asking these very nitty gritty you know very device level questions and can actually start doing some really exciting chips and systems with these new technology and what's exciting is we can go because we can actually build system using these new technologies you know we can really ask the question of what can these new technologies do beyond just make a better cuter right what new type of systems can we actually built for instance if we can build them and we are building systems that have millions and billions of sensors directly onto the chips no I what types of metal complication systems do for for point-of-care Diagnostics from the breath if you can make a chip that's extremely extremely small you can put them inside in the body what work about it if you can make I if you can use now in technology and not even have a chip but just play down technologies inside of your bloodstream them arm to them in real time and where they're going and what they're doing inside your body and what could you do with that
