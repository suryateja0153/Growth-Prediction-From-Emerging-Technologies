 Honeywell HPM Series particle sensors use laser-based light scattering detection to quantify particulate size and concentration in real time. The HPM series enables more cost-effective and accurate measurement and control of particulate contaminants in air conditioners, air quality monitors, environmental monitoring, and air cleaners and features a particulate concentration range of zero to 1000 µg/m3. The sensors output data based on PM2.5 detection, but can be reconfigured for PM10 detection. Honeywell HPM series particle sensors offer an industry leading 20,000 hour rated operating time, and their enhanced reliability allows for use in harsh environments.
