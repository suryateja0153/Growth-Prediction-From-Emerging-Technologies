 hey there everybody Phil here for android central.com Hill here for android central.com hill here phil here from over clip where are we we are in Palo Alto California Phil we're ahead Cadillac of in here in San Diego we are here in London we are now New Orleans scare the month coding let's enter and Modesto California we are here in Times Square New York we're in Barcelona Spain welcome to a Aoife Berlin I'm here at Seoul South Korea we were at the mobile nations and geekbeat meetup beautiful Las Vegas Nevada yep that's me you're probably wondering how I managed to stay alive for so long looking like that so for the past few months I've been keeping track of my blood pressure and perhaps you just saw my video on that where I've been using the wireless blood-pressure cuff from weddings but I've also been using their scale and I've been using the scale a lot longer in fact I'm on my second version now so it works the way a scale works you stand on it and it figures out how much you weigh and that's great but that's not even the most important part cool thing about this is you can use it with your entire family and you don't even have to do anything it just it works automatically check this out so here's the way it works you set up all the users within the wedding's app so I've got myself I've got my wife and I actually have my two kids and as they go and stand on the scale it will initially say hey which person is this and then it recognizes all right we've got somebody on here who's almost 200 pounds no longer 200 pounds though but almost 200 pounds that's probably fill or hey here's somebody who's about 40 50 pounds all right that must be as a Bella the little one and in between so it does a really good job of determining who's on the scale at any given time so every time I weigh myself on the scale it automatically kicks it back up to weddings back in over my wife I and I don't have to do a thing all I have to do is weigh myself naked every morning picture that for a minute just I'll wait let that sink in hey Greg do you drip dry first or do you weigh yourself wet oh yeah you got a yeah yeah so this is where it gets really smart this is the dashboard in the wedding to happen every time I share this people ask what it is so that's what it is it's the wedding's app and here's my weight so this keeps track of every data point every time I have weighed myself way back into a 2014 it has every single point in here and that's fine that's good I could obsess over each and every little way that I do what I really want to look at is this thick trend line here this really shows how much I've changed over time and not each and every little point and you can see as we zoom in there some of the points are higher some of the points are lower but it's that average it's that trendline that's really what's been important to me and I can see that I've gone from 210 down to less than 190 now and even back in the day it was up even higher but it's that trendline that's really important here now this scale will also do things like measure your body competition the newer scale will do body water percentage they actually just switched to this scale so I'm going to start getting those data points here shortly and it will track your BMI which some people say you need to keep close watch on some say you don't but you get a pretty good idea of what's going on so here's the winnings app it's relatively the same on iOS as it is on Android got your different users here up top timeline dashboard leaderboard profile reminders now weddings does tie into health kit which is Apple's thing it also ties into google fit on Android so if that's what you use to keep track of all your stuff it will automatically sync in there as well once you tie them together no big deal alright so a couple things about the scale I want to point out one it's got this glass acrylic I don't know what finish on the top here and it picks up every little bit of dirt and dust it shows every little drop of water or god knows what its gonna get a little nasty it's all nasty here and this is just in our office this isn't even at home you've got your display up top not a whole lot to be said about the underside comes with four triple-a batteries which you're going to have to replace every now and then it does a good job of showing you on the display actually when the battery's about to run out I've maybe had to change it twice since I've had it and then it has a little a syncing button that I don't think I've ever had to push after maybe the initial pairing if you're putting it on a relatively hard surface like this or bathroom tile or whatever you're good to go just put it down you want it to be relatively level but that's it if you want to use it on a rug or carpet you're going to need to use the four feet that actually come in the box with it there's one there's two there's three four feet and they just stick on to each of the feet thusly and that will allow it to work on carpet kind of knowing how much you weigh is one thing doing some about it is a totally other thing I'm going to go do something about it now the gym you be sure to
