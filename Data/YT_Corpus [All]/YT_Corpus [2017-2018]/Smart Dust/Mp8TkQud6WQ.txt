 [Music] hey folks your OS reviews you're watching our video first look and a quick review of a 3.5 millimeter IR blaster accessory this is a very low cost mini SS or just like clickers or I press the devices that were popular a few years back that uses a headphone port so sorry' doesn't work with the iPhone 7 or 7 plus but any Android device or older generation iOS device will work and it has a tiny IR emitter which adds the remote-control functionality to your phone if it doesn't have it so you can then use this to control a television air conditioners anything that uses a standard IR on a receiver can work with this that comes in a number of different colors the version I have here is extremely generic I'll put some links below but I picked this up for under three bucks which is very low cost it could be something to consider let's take a look at you know encodes just the IR receiver adapter unit itself and it's a gold-plated connector as you can see here and the other side is made out of plastic there is kind of this slight edge onto the IR receiver just to send a signal out a little bit more strong strongly so that you can probably point it at the device like the TV or the DVD player to turn it on it does need to be in a direct line of sight that is limitation of IR technology but if you block it or you face it the other way it will no longer work so there's actually quite a few of these designs floating around but this seems to be one of the more generic and low-cost options that you can find alright so let's take a quick look at some of the compatible apps that recommended this app called ZZ remote and it's a pretty common app that also works if your phone already has IR technology built in some of those flock ships came with IR technology as a sensor a few years back it was pretty common but it's probably gone from a lot of phones today so we can see 50 million subscribers that are using this app it controls all your air conditioners and 'pliance --is that have IR and going next and then finally enter the app seems to be a few ads here and there alright so the next thing that you would do is pop in the remote onto the top of your device and afterwards it uses basically the power source of the headphone port to provide some pretty limited power to the IR sensor here the blaster so one limitation of this design is obviously it's not going to be super powerful if you go further from your device it's probably not going to work because headphone jacks are supposed to be low powered just to make sure that the phone doesn't run out of juice so easily that is one of the limitations of a lot of these accessories that uses the headphone port like there's some laser pointer accessories called the eye pen there's also again clickers all these things that try to add peripherals and new uses for the headphone port in addition to blocking out any dust when it's not in use but they have to be relatively low consumption in terms of energy so here we can then add a controller so I'll try adding a television next and see how that goes a jump cut after doing some more testing so when I first plug those into the headphone port and just try to turn on a television and some DVD players it didn't fully work so what I found was because the power output by means of through professional Jack headphone jack is very minimal since it doesn't want it to be a huge battery train and it doesn't make sense since all you're doing is typically plugging in a pair of headphones we have to do to kind of completely power something like this the IR sensor which does draw more power is to turn up the volume all the way up on your phone so you have to make sure that the volume is all the way up also for like maybe playing back the song or something like that if you tap the volume key a few times that's going to do that afterwards you really have to make sure it's inserted and sometimes it's not going to be detected the very first time so you have to kind of play around with the orientation as well and kind of twist it this model in particular doesn't have a sensor where you can twist it 90 degrees to turn it off and on automatically so it's more of a maybe like a connection that's always on so you kind of have to play around to make sure that the sensor is really touching the headphone port and getting the optimal position afterwards for the most part it did work I tried pairing it with one of my tell and if I was standing very close such as within a feet I could turn it on and off and I'm standing right in front of it and kind of aiming it at the receiver on the television same thing with things like DVD players and no problems as far as the app is concerned since this is really a standard apps as easily remote is something a lot of companies use and it works with basically any IR tool that you may have the bigger problem really is with the power and I think with the the practicality since I found that this very generic a little plug oftentimes kind of struggled to get a stronger reception if I walked further it wouldn't work anymore and sometimes again the connection port can be a little bit finicky and also the fact that the power output isn't that high to begin with on on the set design so what I would recommend actually is maybe look around for other models on the market I know that there are other IR accessories if you are intent on adding IR functionality into your smartphone by means of the microUSB port and other things that make more sense that can draw more power and so you get a more powerful sensor or there's a variant designed exclusively for iOS which has a bit better engineering and seems to be a little bit better in terms of the quality and how it performs at the end of the day I would say that this is maybe a nice little toy to play around with it could be kind of fun it's a good very inexpensive accessory that's under $2 if you look on on Amazon on eBay but it doesn't work all that well and I think at the end of the day although the concept is really alluring I would I would have to say that you probably should show it a little bit more to get an expensive model that actually performs a little better this one looks cute it functions as a dust protector to prevent dust from entering into the headphone port but if you really are intent on using it as an IR remote you have to stand very close and also you have to make sure that it's properly plugged in and depending on the phone that you try it with the manufacturer the model sometimes it's going to be a hit or miss so it's a little bit disappointing in that regard you can learn more details about this in our article review with a bit more details about the performance and the testing that we did for now this has been our video thanks for watching here OS reviews this has been the very generic 3.5 millimeter headphone I our remote-control accessory for Androids
