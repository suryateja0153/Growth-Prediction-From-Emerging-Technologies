 Linear Technology's SmartMesh IP wireless sensor networks are self-managing, low-power internet protocol networks built from motes. They deliver more than 99.999% network reliability in challenging RF environments and sub-50 µA routing nodes. The LTC®5800-IPM is the IP Mote-on-Chip integrated circuit in the Eterna® family of IEEE 802.15.4e System-on-Chip solutions, featuring a low-power radio design by Dust Networks, as well as an on-chip power amplifier and transceiver, requiring only power supply decoupling, crystals, and antenna with matching circuitry to create a complete wireless node. These features come in a 72-pin 10 mm x 10 mm QFN package. To learn more, visit this product page on digikey.com.
