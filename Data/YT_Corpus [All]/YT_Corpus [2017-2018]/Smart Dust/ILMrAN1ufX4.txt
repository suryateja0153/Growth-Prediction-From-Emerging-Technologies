 hey guys welcome once again before starting I would like to share one incident with you in the apron of year 2010 there was old spillage from oil rigs en gulf located in Mexico due to spilling of about 185 million gallons of oil into the sea endangered breeds of marine creatures it happened because there was a puncture in the pipe due to oil and gas pressure it would have been avoided if there was a smart automation system and fault would have been detected earlier well this incident highlights the necessity of smart automation in industries this need of safe secure and efficient industrial system gave birth to the industrial Internet of Things there was a time in 18th century when industrial machine were powered by steam industry 2.0 was powered by electric energy industry 3.0 went autonomous now these days we have 4.0 industry which runs on cyber-physical systems for enabling a IOT we must consider distributed intelligence rapid connectivity establishing open standards and systems in real-time context integration and autonomous production line simply it's extracting data from all system or releasing data from main system and placing it into different machines in perfection this data isn't connected to each other in a network after integration later as per customer needs this data is extracted in a smart way to avoid monotony of work and minimize labor cost what is the technology behind IOT hardware components of a IOT include sensors radio frequency identification condition monitoring distributed control system smart meters camera system industrial robotics networking technologies supervisory control data acquisition systems and much more additionally artificial intelligence virtual and augmented reality are the fields of IOT where something exciting is happening now added best dictor's in industries allowed 3d mapping of objects using time-of-flight concept and the sensor integration in automobiles are now well equipped with Bluetooth Wi-Fi automata heft alarm and many features in automotive adverse travelling assistance and now integrated on a single chip which reduces why harnessing and simplifying anatomy of casts a IOT contains smart camera and imaging system in big multinational automobile manufacturing company robotic arms are used for automation which detects objects to pick and assemble only at special frame and angle but even if there is no work robotic arm continued to move which wasted electricity now with the smart automation robots can easily identify objects in 3d space to this 3d vision is making manufacturing smarter saving time electricity and human efforts new measuring techniques have came up for automotive industries paint lines which combines deflection in 3d and 2d surface this technology in cameras controlled the quality 100% and inbuilt sensors deliver precise automated result in real-time hi oh t had smart networking protocols ZigBee Louisville Ethernet protocol and Bluetooth 5.0 are some of the smart networking protocols that are implemented in smart lightning smart energy and smart automation system Sigma pronet work can support up to 2.4 gigahertz band for the IOT one thing keep in mind that as bandwidth increases the more number of devices can be connected to each other due to increasing bandwidth of networking protocols wireless technologies are making a way to high-end developments using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi technology smart applications of IOT from the smart dust dune futuristic farming to energy networks IOT applications are creating a web across Blue Lotus our generic element for industry their efficiency reliability and power consumption need to be taken care of using IOT driving circuits long-term reliability of motors can be achieved as we have discussed in earlier session by genes latest strength which has left all generations being smart card and intelligent mobility systems are highly dependent upon Phi G and IOT however there may be some obstacles for this technology in case of critical machinery control there is a high possibility of failure if timings of AI control signal mismatches there needs to be safe and secure networking system for communication with sophisticated network comes the responsibility of data handling and security and this system should be tightly secured so that only registered users can extract the automation data by 2020 companies will spend roughly about 1.5 trillion dollars a year on the IOT dealing companies have created some protocols to plan security systems now let's see the adoption of a IOT in industries the New York Factory of General Electric which manufactures sodium nickel batteries has more than 10,000 sensors employed in its manufacturing area since us monitor quality and quantity of the battery material make temperature of oval air pressure present and battery energy the complete supervision of production to final testing phase is carried out by census recently Ericsson has launched a recent maritime information and communication technology via cloud we are using sensor system location of missile speed and temperature can be monitored in real-time UK government has recently announced plans to integrate its power grid with IOT devices to improve the grid reliability and cut down the unnecessary costs Indian government has launched digital India initiative to prepare the country for data do feature well this irt technology will be used to connect health medicine education and employment services with people similarly shale and oil and gas major uses visualization technique and MRI like technology to track natural resources from exact location IOT is making big strides due to new advances on both hardware and software French on the software side each computing is providing cloud-based machine learning models which will make hardware faster and reliable on the hardware side major companies reaching the size of sensors to increase their number in a unit and increasing number of functions it can perform with properties like mechanical flexibility thinness and weightlessness IRT would connect millions of devices worldwide enabling just one organization culture for all nations China Telecom and addiction had signed MOU in 2016 to build a global IOT in order to provide one-stop global IT connectivity solutions even if the IOT is a complex system it is creating its impact worldwide and we can see the condescension of IOT making smarter and easier let me know what you guys think about this give thumbs up if you like this share it with your friends and subscribe to my channel if you haven't done it and finally thanks for watching
