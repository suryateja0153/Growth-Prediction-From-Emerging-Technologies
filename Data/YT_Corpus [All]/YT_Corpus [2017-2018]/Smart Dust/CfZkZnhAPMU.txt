 Hi, I'm Bill  and welcome to Clean Care. In this episode, I'll show you how to correctly dust mop a floor. Dust mopping is one of the most important components of floor care. Not only is it used in daily maintenance, but it's also done before periodic processes like top scrubbing or stripping. To begin, you'll need a dust mop, a handle, frame and head, a broom, a dustpan, and dust mop treatment. Use a dust mop that has been pre-sprayed with dust mop treatment 24 hours before use. This will help the dirt stick to the mop and  will prevent the dust from becoming airborne. Clear the area of any obstacles including mats or furniture. Scrape away any tape, gum, glue, or any other residues. Next dust mop the perimeter of the working area. Keep the leading edge facing forward at all times. There are two basic techniques, the mop can be moved in a figure 8 motion similar to damp mopping, or can be pushed along in a straight line similar to a push broom. It's best to work towards an area where the dust mop can be shaken out and debris collected once the main area is completed. Use the broom and dustpan to collect and dispose of the debris. After the dust mopping is complete, brush or vacuum the mop head to remove the fine particulate. Finally reapply the dust mop treatment until it is slightly damp, and leave to dry . Store the mop vertically with the head upwards not on the floor. If you found this video useful,  hit like.
