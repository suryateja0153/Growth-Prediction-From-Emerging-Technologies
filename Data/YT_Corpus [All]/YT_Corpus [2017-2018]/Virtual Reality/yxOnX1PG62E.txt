 The learning just comes to life for them. It's like really, really cool, I feel like I'm actually there. My favorite was a getting attacked by squid. It's amazing when they put those goggles up to their face the 'ooos and aahs' of that first moment of when they're feeling like they're teleported, as one kid said, to that virtual field trip. You see if I put on a virtual reality headset, it would be like I'm just in the real world. It was really surreal. I felt like I was actually there. I've never done this before and I'm really excited about it. I think that it's a great way to get the students much more engaged and to get me engaged,as well. You'll have to get an app you can put phone in them and then click on the app and then you look like you're actually somewhere else, but you really stay where you are. It was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be, very user-friendly. There's the text with the teacher can narrate and there's different spots on the image that we can point to and direct their attention to and teach them. So it's not just a fun thing, it's really a learning experience. To make science research real for the students, it's not just facts in the books. This is really powerful. A book you just flip the pages and it can get boring, but with this you can interact anywhere. You see a bunch of different things instead of just staring at one picture  What I love about the program with Cellcom is that schools have the opportunity to kind of test it out, test the waters, to see is this worth the investment. And I think from our two weeks with the virtual reality kit it's proven that it is absolutely worth the investment and we're excited to explore that it was just validation that this is the right tool. I really want to learn about more things in VR.
