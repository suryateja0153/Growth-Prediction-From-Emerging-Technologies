 [JOHN JEKA] This is the the CoBal Lab,  which stands for the Control of Balance and Locomotion, in which we actually study how people maintain upright in standing and walking. This is the virtual reality cave. The reason we use this is because it's very, very immersive and you can actually control the visual environment that people walk in on a treadmill. [JACLYN CACCESE] Virtual reality in general is being used a lot more frequently in rehab settings. The current project, we're looking at vestibular function, so how the balance in your inner ear works following head impact. [JOHN] We actually study how people use, for example, sensory information actually to control their balance while they're standing and walking. [IAN SOTNEK] What I really love about UD is its really dynamic research atmosphere. It seems like I could come here as a young  researcher and really do something. [MARIANA GONGORA] I received a scholarship from Brazil. I asked Dr. Jeka if I could work with his team. [IAN] I started in strength and conditioning, transitioned into older adult research for my master's and now I'm here working with kids with cerebral palsy [MARIANA] and try to understand how they  balance during walking [IAN] and comparing that to healthy individuals. [DAVID GRENET] I'm trying to get a project started focused on how people with Parkinson's disease balance when they walk because they have quite a specific typical gait pattern, and so we expect to see that they might use different balance strategies as well, which hasn't been studied yet.
