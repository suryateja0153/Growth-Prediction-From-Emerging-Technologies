 The Tucson Police Department now has a new training system to teach officers how to decide when to fire their weapons. I visited Tucson to see how the simulator works. Tucson police officers are surrounded by screens and confronted with the aftermath of a shooting. The VirTra system is a interactive virtual training system that's designed to train firearms and decision-making for police officers. Norman Scheopner will be training other officers using the high-tech system. The goal: to help officers decide when to shoot. We can run a variety of scenarios from active shooter training down to communication de-escalation training and having officers work with people potentially in crisis. Most importantly VirTra gives officers the edge they did not have with the old one screen system. It provides a more realistic encounter with the scenarios that we provide or that are provided for us that make the officer be aware of his total surroundings. The Tucson Police Department plans to use a system for training officers in as many different ways as possible. We certainly want to use it for a variety of scenarios. Shoot no shoot decision-making situations where you might use a less lethal tool. High-profile shootings in several cities across the U.S. have led police departments to update their training. I think any training is a way to to look at any instance where we can take take a specific scenario an officer was involved in and say maybe we could have done this better. Tucson police officers will start training with the new virtual system next week and other law enforcement agencies in southern Arizona will also get to use the simulator.
