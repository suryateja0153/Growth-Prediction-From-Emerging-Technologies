 [music] [Kamanja speaking in Trio] [Lee Pace narrating in English] The forests of Amazonia connects us all. It provides clean air for the world. It gives life to me and to you. My name is Kamanja. I am born of this forest. If you don't know this place, you may see it as mysterious. Filled with strange creatures. You may see it as scary; a frightening place. But we see it differently. We see it as home. We care for the forest. Protect it. Tend to its needs. As it tends to ours. These trees give me water when I am far from the river. I travel our rivers as you travel roads. Sharing what I know of medicinal plants. And passing on the knowledge of a life in balance with nature to our grandchildren. The forest provides everything my family and my village need. It gives us food, it gives us medicine, and all that we need to build our homes. We love this way of life. And it not only sustains our bodies. [birds tweeting] It sustains our souls. Those before us lived this way since the beginning. We try to do the same. But the world around us is changing. The air hotter. Rivers are diverted. Mines are being dug. Plants and animals are disappearing. Every year, those who destroy the forest move in closer. Seeking gain only for today. And with every illegal mine and oil well, we fear for the water we drink. If the old trees are destroyed, the forest will never be the same again. You and I share this journey. And our destination is not yet decided. We can choose a different path. The forest doesn't just provide for those of us who live here. It provides for everyone. We can only save it together. It's up to us. [music]
