 It was a great opportunity to be able to work with Marc on this project because he's been working on Valerian as a concept designer and illustrator for many months, working with Luc Besson, and it' a really big honored to be able to work with Marc because I've known his work for a while and to be able to have our world kind of meet on this project is very exciting to me kind of combining the work of 3D and VR with concept design and illustration When i read Valerian I was kid and it was being influencial... There is basically two, three, four, five, different ideas in each frame of the comics, and the tone is fun, it was back in the days more optimistic maybe for the future When you're in VR you're not really thinking about perspective as much or depth you can just rotate something and paint the other side of it, being able to walk through and immerse yourself in some kind of environment I think that's what sets itself apart a little bit is that you're not just drawing a singular object you're able to build a world scale it up to a certain level you can move around in that area and I think that's like the big thing that sets it apart is that you're building immersive worlds. You can even do things like funhouse style, where you're walking through or getting in your hands and knees and crawling through something and that's just unheard of in the art world, so i think that's really exciting. I think that's going to be a good way to just try to have new tools, to have more artistic freedom you you
