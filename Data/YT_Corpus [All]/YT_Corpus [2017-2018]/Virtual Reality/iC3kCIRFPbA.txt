 My first game that I ever played was with my children and it was Pac-Man. Atari, Donkey Kong. Scrabble's not a video game is it? Yeah you can get that can't you? Have you guys heard of Virtual Reality? Yes. That's what you're gonna do. You gotta be kidding. I have heard of Virtual Reality. It's like an illusion, I guess. More so to say. Are you sure we need to do this? (laughs) (playful music) This doesn't have a tendency to make people dizzy by any chance, like vertigo? I shouldn't have signed up for this. [Man] See these things? Yes, what is that? Reach out and grab those. They're controllers. There you go. This is awesome. (laughs) See 'em! You see 'em? There you go. How do you get 'em, though? Here, try to grab it. Can I help her? Right there! It's supposed to be a creature of some sorts I suppose. Handles? For what? Looking down kinda makes me feel like whoa! I'm afraid I'm gonna fall. You're not falling. You're right here. I'm right here. (playful music) I can't get too close to that cliff. I'm gonna go to that mountain right over there. That just freaked me out 'cause I'm afraid of heights. This is absolutely gorgeous. Is it? Yes! Well I can't wait. Yow! Oooh. That makes my knees feel funny. That's a cliff there. Feel like I'm getting closer and closer to it. Y'all tryin' to make me fall. So when I did that I moved from over there to over here. Oh this is gorgeous! How fun! Oh my word. Whoops, sorry. You're in my way, I can't shoot. Oh my goodness, it's the sky! (chuckles) Ooh. It's a long way down there. So I'm supposed to shoot the zombies? Just don't let 'em get too close to me. Whoa, shoot! I see a... Zombie walking toward me. He is not dying. Why am I not killing him? (screams) (man in background laughs) Shoot it. (screams) Got him. (shrieking) Yes I love it when the head flies off. (woman laughing) Ah! Ah! (screams) Now I can't see. It's all red. Oh I died. Sorry. Oh, what is that?! It's a little dog. Isn't he cute! (both laughing) I see a space dog. Wait a minute. What's his name? (laughs) I can't do it. I'm usually not... Real good at these. I did take archery in college. I think that's absolutely amazing. Amazing. I love it! I mean I thought it was fantastic. I'd like to have one. It was so realistic to me, too. Oh yeah. I mean I felt like I was right there on the edge and it was real. That's a little bit different than Atari.
