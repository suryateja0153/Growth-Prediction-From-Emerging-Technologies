 pull that down over your eyes now we see this as a science while using therapeutic virtual reality to allow patients to escape a jail cell of a hospital a lot of people think of ER just simply gaming and entertainment we start to help them understand that it's so much more than that virtual reality helps us redefine kind of what we do for actual patient care you'll notice that you can look wherever you want and what we'll do is we'll bring you to Iceland our patients suffer they suffer grievously they suffer physically emotionally socially what we've been doing is treating them with virtual reality there are two reasons why VR really works one is it blocks out all the threatening sights and sounds just removing the environment alone blindfolding yourself to it and replacing with something pleasant is uncomfortable the second part is the more pain you're in the more you need to displace that focus onto something else I realized how powerful the illusion the virtual reality can be by overwhelming the mind with signals we can essentially distract it you can actually reduce the pain that you feel at the time they've even shown this an fMRI is that your pain receptors don't light up the same way we'll see if it helps with the pain or not you'll tell us yes everyone talks right now the fact that we're in a pain crisis you talked about the opioid epidemic that's going on everyone is looking for a solution we know that VR has a role to play and what we've seen is that it reduces pain by about twenty four percent after just about ten minutes on average I wasn't thinking about the pain you weren't no I was just thinking about being there it is not necessarily a replacement for opioids but when somebody has acute pain it's at that vulnerable moment where we can potentially insert something like virtual reality rather than sowing the seeds of opioid dependency by starting somebody at that moment on an opioid so we're focusing specifically on pain and anxiety if you think about when someone's going to a hospital or an outpatient there can be a lot of fear and anxiety and sometimes you know on the walls and these places they'll put a picture of a beach scene up there well think about it with VR we can actually literally transport them to a beach there in an immersive 360-degree environment it's not like watching a movie it's something different and you can see it it's just incredible the transformation that you could observe almost instantly the breathing slows and you can see the body language the patient is sort of comfortably falls back into their bed and almost surrenders to this experience and that's when we realized that the treatment is having having an effect your mind is elsewhere you're not I'm not I wasn't thinking about the hospital just now I was thinking I was going on in there like we're doing is we wanted a lot of platform that we can on think of it as almost a VR pharmacy of sort of therapeutic and escapism type content library of different visualizations we think of this as a new field I need to be able to pick and choose the right treatment for the right patient at the right time just like with any other medication because once you see the success once you see the smile on a patient's face who's in pain or experiencing anxiety you get it yes it feels like it it's moments like that we are impacting a patient that shows the power a technology could have like a big clip as a net you feel mmm nervous cuz I'm afraid of heights but it's peaceful it's like a dream you feel the energy that's going in force being directed towards the water and you feel you impact on the nature around you [Music] it feels magical intuitive and it feels like you have superpowers you [Music]
