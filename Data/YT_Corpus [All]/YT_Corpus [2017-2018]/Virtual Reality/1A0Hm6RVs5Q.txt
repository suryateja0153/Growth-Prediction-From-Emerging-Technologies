know this is what everybody is shopping for this is truly the future of any and all entertainment going forward you know I've been going to the Consumer Electronics Show for many many years about 17 18 years now and the last three years or so it's been all about virtual reality the problem was they had these big clunky headsets that had a lot of electronics built right in and they were thousands of dollars now with the Arcadia we've made virtual reality so affordable and so easy for you to get into your own home because all you do is add your very own cellphone that is literally all there is to it there's that roller coaster ride I was experiencing just a minute ago and this is that 360-degree entertainment that's happening all around you see how it's a split screen right there so you can literally go right into YouTube and grab some split screen VR videos to be able to watch them to enjoy but here's the thing this is gonna accommodate cell phones up to about 6 inches so virtually every cell phone out there is gonna fit in here securely this is a front loading mechanism it's got a nice strong magnet on it you even have your inner pupillary adjustments right here so you're gonna be able to adjust the width your eyes are apart this has dual adjustable focus so you can adjust how far away you are from your phone so that you're getting that customized experience every single time you have these really plush cushy comfortable totally adjustable straps so you're just gonna wear this right on your head and then right here on your face is this ventilated breathable perforated padded fabrication that's coming in contact with your face you're getting this unbelievable lens system to be able to see and experience everything around you talk about completely loaded these headsets are gonna give you that great experience and let's talk about what virtual virtual reality really is right now it's everything you know the last big bowl game that happened so that was last year imagine having this for this year there were broadcasters broadcasting the main plays the big plays happening on the field in virtual reality where you could stand there on the field and be a part of it there are movies coming out in virtual reality so you can be out there with your favorite actors and actresses feeling like you're part of the storyline that's happening around you 360 degrees with no scene yes you can play games watch movies view sporting events you can do this exotic high-end international traffic and climb are you scary oh wait now these charts I am swimming with the shore you have got to experience this because this is not about sitting here talking about it until you get it home until you see the quality is exceptional you are truly in an immersive experience and Laurie I remember when virtual reality first came out and everybody was like the glasses and everything else they were crazy crazy expensive right $17.50 basically seventeen fifty per per headset and you want to because people like to do this together okay but we have never been able to bring you a value like this never before these are gonna fly out of here already you guys use Express ordering to get through 3495 free shipping but everything about this is really it's made for comfort it is made to immerse you in in a world that I would never ever want to be in rollercoasters no mate nothing to do it swimming with the sharks I don't think so maybe going into space not not really my thing but you are able to experience all of it with this but these are so lightweight so light so a little over a pound here I'm underwater right now so you can see everything that I'm seeing as I'm turning my head look at how everything is immerse around me look at how I can see these other divers and all of these gorgeous fish I'll tell you what I'm never ever gonna go deep-sea diving and if you are scared to maybe go on a roller coaster and you want to experience it and look back on it almost like a memory that's what virtual reality really and truly is all about I hate to say this too I always thought it would be fascinating to be an astronaut but I've aged out of the space program on four unfortunately that's never ever ever gonna happen for me so you know I'm not gonna get to do that but I'm gonna be able to sit on my couch and feel like I know what it feels like to go into outer space and again you almost look back on this like it's a memory but it this is great for kids this is great for teenagers this is great for all ages people are going to love being able to play games look at Victoria here she's popping the little germs simply by moving her head see how she is the controller her body is the controller for this and I just want you to realize there are hundreds if not thousands of apps and games and movies and TV shows and all kinds of different things that you're gonna be able to do in virtual reality and more and more is coming out all the time and with this unique headset from Arcadia you even get some additional little bells and whistles that you wouldn't expect in this price point you're getting this great little action button right here this is gonna give you maximum compatibility so that's gonna enable you to make selections and choices in some cases on your cell phone without opening this up which is really nice the other thing I want you to realize this supports augmented reality so your cell phone is in the air right that's the camera on your cell phone so if you've ever played games like Pokemon go where there's that layer over reality you're gonna be able to do the augmented reality with this headset because of that sliding opening and access to your phone's camera can I tell you Apple is coming out with some incredible augmented reality content I mean it is super exciting it life changing and that is happening right now if you have these headsets you're gonna be able to participate in that you're gonna be able to play in that world you're gonna be able to see what all of the buzz is and what everyone's talking about and again maybe you don't have the nerve to jump on a major roller coaster but you want to see it what it would feel like you're gonna be able to do that in virtual reality you're gonna be able to walk the streets of Paris France you're gonna be able to experience the changing of the guard at the Royal Palace in the UK you're gonna be able to you know stay in one of those hovering Suites over the beautiful water in Bora Bora like who gets to do that but you know how you do it $17.50 it's crazy because this is something I don't care what age you are you're gonna be able to experience this whether you are eight or 80 it doesn't matter because the opportunity to to actually experience it in an immersive way this is different than anything it's kind of like going to those those theaters you know the ones that they're great big domes it's kind of like that but it's more personal and the more you look around the more you experience it you will have literally thousands and thousands and thousands of experiences that you can now do just by adding your cell phone to it it is so simple you just pop it right in here and you'll be able to do all of that $17.50 look how look how light it is so like at one point was gonna say if it's a pound you know I'm surprised by it and it's so cushy a lot of the other ones can be heavy which means when you put it on your head it can be uncomfortable uncomfortable this is super lightweight very breathable fabrication here everything is padded everything is fully adjustable there's that phone so you pop it in your cell phone Apple or Android up to six inches this will work with most phones the more the more features you have on your cell phone the more features you'll have in VR but everybody can get in by going to I just go right onto YouTube and I just look through for split screen VR content and you're gonna see look at the roller coaster this is another one so maybe that's not gonna be your bag but you want to do the maybe you want to jump out of an airplane maybe you want to do the parachuting maybe you want to do all of that I'm never gonna jump out of a perfectly good airplane but I've always been curious what you know what it's like to do the parasailing and all of that kind of stuff you're gonna be able to do that in virtual reality I want you to also realize this lens system is very advanced it's called lucid view so it has an anti-glare on it and it makes that screen easier on the eye so your eyes won't give us tired and you just set it Alice with all of that padding and with that comfortable comfortable headpiece here this fits on your face it almost feels like a custom fit and you just don't get tired wearing it you're like when you wear those sleep masks and it's really really comfortable it's that very very much molds this guy's already already over 800 of these have been ordered I have another 500 of you trying to get through these things are flying what toys you walk through a toy store what do you pay for just something really you know plastic toy this is way beyond that this is an experience that you're gonna be able to share with somebody else because we're giving you two of them a 2-pack of virtual reality headsets at $34.95 this is amazing guys to be able to bring you the best value we have ever done ever done on a virtual reality headset and the quality is so exceptional you can't even believe it is 17 50 per set but what you're gonna be able to experience it's unlike anything else any other way I don't know how you can capture an experience like this but if you miss it you are gonna be so bummed because everybody's going to be looking for this under the tree and like I said this is ageless this is where every single age is going to want to experience whatever it might be going to the moon going underwater going on anything you can imagine you can now experience it but if you don't I highly recommend if you want to two sets of these and you know why free shipping and handling start there sir you're not paying any extra

anything else and guys a thousand of these have flown out the door you do not want to miss things and it's so great to get to because the only problem my husband and I had before is we were sharing one back and forth right and we were experiencing things oh oh you gotta see this honey oh my gosh this is crazy and then I would hand him the headset well that's no fun now you could both be doing it at the same time I told Alice this a little bit before the show you know the last time one of my favorite things to do with virtual reality was i sat in the audience of Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary show people were in tuxedos I could look around I could see the crew bringing out the big cue cards that they were flipping for the actors on stage you could see all the set pieces being brought in it was amazing I'm probably never gonna go see a major TV show like that you've done it but I mean you have to be up late at night you're waiting in line there's big crowds what does it cost to fly there this you can do right on the comfort of your couch and it was so fun because I was just showing my husband I was like oh my gosh look at all these people but now that you have two headsets you're gonna both be able to enjoy it so this is a really cool of jet-fighter so I'm experiencing that right now again there are games there are apps there is unlimited content and more coming all the time out in virtual reality so this comfortable Arkadia headset you are getting two of these it's a front loader you got that magnetized front this is going to accommodate cellphones up to about six inches so any cell phone is gonna pop right in there you've got your little action button right here giving you maximum compatibility helping you to make some selections without always
