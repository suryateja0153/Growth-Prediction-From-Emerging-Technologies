 Hi everyone, my name is Anthony Scavarelli from Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and my supervisor Dr. Robert Teather and myself are really interested in exploring how do we avoid collisions in virtual reality environments. Particularly, how do we avoid collisions between multiple users in co-located spaces? So when we are sharing the same physical space how do we avoid running into each other?
