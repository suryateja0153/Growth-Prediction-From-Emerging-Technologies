 My name is Breland Williams. I am from Kinder, Louisiana. This is my first time ever being here. I own a timeshare in Wyndham, but this is my first time coming down here and coming in here. I really enjoyed it. First time experience All Star as an adult, so go All Star weekend. We picked I think it was the car. I was all on my knees, and turning up and everything else, I'm just like... (laughs) My first time experiencing virtual reality. It's this awesome experience, and I appreciate Toyota for giving me the experience. I know the unknown!
