 lose a shitload of money betting on VR consumer over the next five years and I think that there's a lot of opportunity in b2b and I think 15 years from now VR is gonna be a beast we've got the CMO with the devil's here today great who's gonna put headsets on Devils mask so people can at home buy tickets and watch via VR what do you think I don't think it's gonna happen I hope he's not here yet he won by doing it cuz he wants to press around doing it and that gives awareness to the brand and that's a good KPI but do I think everybody here is gonna watch the devil's game next year on VR I do not what do you think they'll do I say everybody this is an early user crowd right you're at propeller I don't even I don't think a good percentage of you will do it I definitely don't think a good percentage of Ricky Thompson who knows nothing about tech is gonna do it and that's what I care I care when Ricky Thompson knows about snapchat I care wouldn't Sally Arkansas cares about snapchat not when nerd McGee's on it I think he's here nerd what what do you say what do you think is the number one use case and I'll bring this up because I think dude it's gonna take by the way VR is the only potential arbitrage to the Internet it's the next platform it just might be 15 20 what's a good effect life shopping entertainment gaming all taking you know what you're leaving out though the number one thing that tends to push tech advancement is porn and that's where VR is being pushed around I can't wait for VR porn would you invest in that uh maybe just to get the free headset yeah no I you know like I just think could Sumer even pee even porn I think is further away they like look consumer behavior is underestimated guys only 20% of products are bought in e-commerce like we're still buying in stores in 1996 when I started winelibrary.com 1997 if you told me that in 2016 only 20% would be e-comm I would have made fun of you you don't see the future you don't get it it takes time for behavior to change for you to sit at home and live your lives through that world or spend a meaningful amount of time we'll take time I actually believe it will happen but I think it's gonna be a hell I think headsets will never be at scale ever meaning by the time it's at scale will be on contacts or some other version I don't think we'll ever have mass headsets at home doing VR mass mass like everybody but maybe but I just I'm I don't see it I think it's gonna take too long and they'll be advancements on the headsets
