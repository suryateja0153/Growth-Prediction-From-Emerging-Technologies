 [iPad] [Man:]Hi [iPad] [Woman:] Hello. [iPad] [Man:] Welcome to... [Man and Woman:] ASMR with you. [Woman:] Just as an extra special treat... [Woman:] We brought some of our favorite... [noises outside] [Man:] What do you have? [footsteps shuffling outside] [Man:] Do you have some spoons? [voices arguing outside door] [Door slams open] [Katie:] Freeze! [Ryan:] Don't even think about moving! [Katie:] Don't move! [Ryan:] And if I hear you make a sound... [Katie:] Bang! [Ryan:] Bang! [Katie:] Alright. Bag him! Let's go! [iPad][brushes bristling] [grabs cash money] [iPad] [Woman:] That's lovely. [Title Screen] [Kidnapped VR] [car radio playing] [Ryan:] I can not believe we just kidnapped somebody! [Katie:] That was amazing! [Ryan:] Flawless kidnapping! [Katie:] We did so good. [Ryan:] We are going to get paid! [Katie:] I would have thought we were professionals! [Ryan:] Right? [Katie:] Hey, hey! [Katie:] Eyes up here! [Katie:] You're not going anywhere... [Ryan:] Hey, I didn't say this last time but... [Ryan:] Could you stop with this fake man voice thing? [Ryan:] It's freaking me out. [Katie:] Sorry, are you serious? [Ryan:] Yeah, seriously. It freaks me out. [Katie:] Well, somebody has to be the man around here... [Ryan:] Oh, come on. That's a low blow. [Katie:] I'm just saying. [Ryan:] Well, we're here. [car engine off][radio off] [Katie:] We're just dropping off the hostage, right? [Ryan:] Yeah, we drop the hostage off. [Ryan:] Do the hand-off. We get a million dollars cash. [Ryan:] And then we don't have to work any more. [Katie:] Hey, who is this guy? [Ryan:] That can't be him. [Katie:] Just be cool. [Katie:] I think it is him. [Ryan:] No. Gangsters drive nice cars. [Ryan:] Why is he in this thing? [Katie:] What is he doing? [knock on window] [car window rolls down] [Ryan:] Hello! [Patty D:] Get out of the car. [Ryan:] Are you Patty D? [Patty D:] Get out of the car! [Katie:] I think we get out of the car, man. He's serious. [Ryan:] Uh... [Ryan:] You just stay there. [Katie:] It is a pleasure to meet you. [Ryan:] Thank you for this opportunity. [Patty D:] I don't know who that is... [Patty D:] But that's not who I told you to kidnap. [Ryan:] That's impossible! [Katie:] That was the only person at North Martel. We checked. [Patty D:] South Martel! I said South Martel! [Ryan and Katie:] Ohhh... [Patty D:] You idiots! [Katie:] I'm bad with directions! [Ryan:] Anybody could have made that mistake! [Patty D:] This is the person I wanted. [Ryan:] Well, they kind of look alike. [Ryan:] You could probably still use this person. [Patty D:] You think this is some kind of video game? [Ryan and Katie:] No. [Patty D:] You think this is a joke? [Ryan:] No! Hey! [Katie:] Be cool! [Patty D:] The only game I'm going to be playing is Duck Hunt with you two. [Ryan:] Whoa. Okay. [Patty D:] You better get this situation fixed by tomorrow night... [Ryan and Katie:] Okay. [Patty D:] Or you'll both be sleeping at the bottom of the lake. [Katie:] You got it, Patty D. [Patty D:] Tomorrow night! [Patty D:] No more games! [Ryan:] No more games! [Katie:] We'll fix it! [Ryan:] No more games... [electric scooter] [Ryan:] I like that jacket. [Katie:] Get in the car! [Katie:] Get in the car! [Ryan:] We're going to fix this! [Katie:] Shut up and get in the car! [car doors slam shut] [Katie:] That is a huge mistake! [Ryan:] He's a gangster? [Katie:] We kidnapped the wrong person! [Ryan:] Yeah, this happens all the time. We'll just - [Ryan:] We'll go kidnap the right person. [Ryan:] People kidnap the wrong person all the time! [Katie:] Do they? [Ryan:] Yeah! [Ryan:] It happens. [Katie:] You know... [Katie:] It would be nice if you said something. [Katie:] It's good to know when we kidnap the wrong person! [Ryan:] Yeah, she does have a point. [Katie:] What's your deal? [Ryan:] You could have said something. [Katie:] You know, I don't like the way you're looking at us. [Ryan:] Get the bag. You are freaking me out. [Katie:] I don't trust you. [bag over head] [bag removed] [air conditioning unit starts] [Katie:] Mmm... [Katie:] Let's see what is in the wallet. [Katie:] Identification... [Katie:] Oh, that's your name! [Katie:] Ha! [Katie:] I like it! [Katie:] Whoa, Chili's gift card! [Ryan:] Hey, Oh! [Katie:] Score! We'll take that! [Katie:] We got some cash... [Katie:] Two dollars? [Katie:] You might as well keep that. [Ryan:] Yeah, dude. I don't see anything in here about kidnapping the wrong person. [Katie:] Nothing? It's a book on kidnapping. [Katie:] Yeah. It just assumes you kidnap the right person. [Katie:] Whatever. We have to make a plan. [Katie:] What are we going to do? [Ryan:] We could just take you back. [Ryan:] Promise not to say anything. It will be fine. [Katie:] No. [Katie:] I don't trust you. [Katie:] We need to... [switch blade open] [Katie:] Cut that tongue out! [Ryan:] Whoa! [Ryan:] No dude. [Ryan:] Uh... [Ryan:] That's creepy and way too disturbing. [Ryan:] Who are you? [Katie:][mocking] Ohh, okay. [Katie:] Please, make a suggestion then. [Ryan:] You could just move in with us! [Ryan:] Yeah, like... [Ryan:] We'll be best friends. We could hang out. [Katie:] Move in with us?! That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard! [Katie:] What are we going to do? [Katie:] Take you around with us wherever we go? [Katie:] I already take care of you. I can't take care of another person! [Ryan:] Alright. Just make a decision. I don't care. [Katie mumbling:] Make a decision...make a decision... [Katie:] I'll make a decision. [Katie:] I'll make this decision right now. [Katie:] Three... [Katie:] Two... [door knock] [Woman outside door:] Hello? Are you guys back? [Katie:] You said she wasn't going to be here! [Ryan:] She wasn't! [Woman outside door:] I can hear you in there! [Ryan:] Just a second! [Ryan:] Get the sheet! [Katie:] Not a word! [bag over head] [door open] [Woman outside door:] Oh, look at those masks! [Woman outside door:] Are you two making Youtube movies? [Ryan:][embarrassed] Yes, Mom. [Ryan's Mother:] You two are so talented! [Ryan:] Mom, do you mind if we just finish this shot? [Ryan's Mother:] Well, sure. But I wanted to tell you I made your favorite! [Ryan:][excited] Breakfast waffles...for dinner? [Ryan's Mother:] With chocolate chips! [Ryan and his Mom celebrate in delight] [Ryan:] Mom, I love you so much! [kissing noises] [Ryan:] Alright. [Ryan:] We'll be right there. [door close] [foot steps] [bag removed] [Ryan:] Whew! [Ryan:] That was close. [Katie:][frustrated] Dude, we have got to move out of your mom's house! [Ryan:] Hey... [Ryan:] I told you this was just temporary. [Ryan:] We're going to move out. I promise. [Katie:] You've been promising that for months! [Ryan:] Look. [Ryan:] Once we get enough money from this kidnapping job... [Ryan:] We're going to be able to do whatever we want! [Katie:][deadpan] Really? [Ryan:] Yeah! [Katie:] Let's finish this job right now... [Ryan:] No! [Ryan:] We're not murderers. [Ryan:] We're kidnappers! [Katie:] No! [Katie:] We're not! [Katie:] We're not anything! [Katie:] We're idiots who quit our jobs and now we do this! [Ryan:] We're going to fix this... [Ryan:] But not until tomorrow morning. [Ryan:][comforting] Hey. [guitar serenade plays] [Ryan:] Come on... [Ryan:] Come on... [Ryan:] Come on... [Ryan meows like a kitten] [meow] [Katie:][laughs] Stop... [guitar serenade ends] [Ryan:] Look. Let's just go get some waffles... [Ryan:] It will make everything better. [Katie:] Alright. But we're going to fix this tomorrow, right? [Ryan:] Yeah. Katie: Alright. [Katie:] Well, we better hurry up. [Katie:] You know how your mom eats everything. [door close] [door open] [Ryan:] Hey... [lullaby nursery music begins] [Ryan:] I figured you want to be comfortable before you go to bed, right? [Ryan:] There you go... [Ryan:] Look. [Ryan:] Sorry you had to see that. Things are a little... [Ryan:] Things are a little weird between us right now. [Ryan:] I convinced her to quit her job and do a Youtube thing. And that didn't work out. [Ryan:] I convinced her to kidnap somebody with me and... [Ryan:] Well that clearly did not work out. [heavy sigh] [Ryan:] I don't know... [Ryan:][cheering up] Hey... [Ryan:] We're going to fix this! [Ryan:] I'll get you back to your home. [Ryan:][comforting] Alright? [Ryan:] Have a good night. [door shut] [Credits] [nursery lullaby ends] [Ryan:] Don't move! [Katie:] Don't move! [Ryan:] He's spinning his head around like a weirdo! [Ryan:] He's twiddling his thumbs! [Katie:] Think you're better than me? [Ryan:] He's wiggling his toes! [Katie:] Because you're watching an iPad? [Ryan:] This little piggy went to market... [Katie:] Tickle. Tickle. Tickle. [Ryan and Katie:] Bang! [Katie:] Chitty, chitty. Bang, bang. [Ryan:] I'm Neo and you're Trinity. [Katie:] Okay. [Ryan]: Ready? [loud thud] [Ryan groaning in pain] [Ryan:] You hit me in the nuts! [fun music] [Yeesh Kabob]
