 you're just minutes away from heading into the theater for a speech you know while attending Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference Apple made the announcement that Mac OS High Sierra will be made of Lee supporting virtual reality as someone who's dabbled in 360-degree video I was quite intrigued after the press event I got to try out the HTC vive a virtual reality headset now yes I have created some 360-degree video but I also have a visual impairment since someone who's legally blind appreciate VR I began by trying out a game that put me in a 3d classic arcade space shooter using a motion controls I raised my shield and laser gun and shot incoming alien UFOs it was very responsive and well detailed I'm positive I could see greater detail in this space than I actually could in the real world [Music] what'd you think yeah work ok for you actually like surprisingly yes like it's pretty closed off there and well detailed yeah next I got a demo of 360-degree editing on Final Cut Pro which is my editor of choice on the Mac I did a 360 video in Final Cut in the past but it was never natively supported before this I'd have to create a custom resolution project and couldn't preview the project properly I'm excited for this VR video opens up new possibilities for storytelling sure it's gimmicky but that's the fun part about exploring new techniques with this medium and who knows maybe we could see some more 360-degree video and the not so distant future on this channel following that I was put into a 3d game design editors where I could move and scale objects in real time put together a 3d map for an application this felt pretty weird it's like you're in the space and you have full control over this reality and bringing objects in and out changing the properties and so on I'm no developer or designer but I feel like this could open up some interesting workflows in the field [Music] lastly I got the opportunity to try out the Star Wars demo though it's shown off during Apple's actual press event I was able to watch a cinematics team take place but also was able to look around as Darth Vader was well about to murder me overall I actually enjoyed virtual reality I have not tried it for long periods of time but so what I've tried so far it's been relatively successful the high resolution headsets have been able to project details I normally miss out on I'm stoked to see where the technology will continuously push boundaries I strongly believe that audio makes up 50% of the video 360-degree audio is something less important for a totally blind person to draft what might be happening in a virtual reality experience so keep that in mind if you're a developer or creator creating 360-degree experiences that is all for this video what is your opinion on virtual reality have given it a try I'm curious what we know down below is it less successful to you do you get headaches from it or do you really actually enjoy the experience that it's providing let me know in the comments and that's about it this video if you liked it give a thumbs up if you like these videos subscribe and I will see you guys next time - brainy video bye
