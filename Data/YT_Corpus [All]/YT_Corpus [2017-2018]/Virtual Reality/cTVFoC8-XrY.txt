 So many goofy faces. I'm about to put some earphones on you as well. ooh, I feel really weird. So it's being streamed to the PC so I can see all the things you're seeing I did hear it. I should probably ask you if you can see anything. yeah I can see fine So how was that? Quite an experience, lots of things going on, you don't realise. I guess, sort of, the ability not to, rather the ability not to be able to control the filters. So that everything seems to be really challenging, every noise, every sound, every visual aspect. It seems really yeah. That was intense, that was really intense That was really freaky and horrible. God that really makes you think, doesn't it So that's like one part of the autistic spectrum, not everyone's like that. They're all kind of different. Do you feel like after experiencing that you'd be more likely to help or be affectionate to somebody who's going through that experience? Absolutely yeah. Definitely it's yeah, it's quite scary to see what it's really like from the side of somebody who has autism. Yeah I think I'd have a much more, I'd understand it more. So I think if I saw like maybe a child screaming like out in town or something rather than just assuming like oh they're just a kid having a temper tantrum it might be like oh ok they actually might be experiencing something scary really scary to them so it's not jumping to conclusions yeah definitely. I feel really like, I feel more aware of it. definitely you, again it's like you can't know something like this until you see it through someone eyes, someone else's eyes and seeing it like that just so daunting.
