 [Music] [Applause] so how do you define yourself how many people here would consider themselves educators okay what about learners I feel like that's everyone what about athletes any athletes in the room one of the athletes couch potatoes Netflix and chill errs so I could go on and on but the point is that we define ourselves in large part by the things that we do our everyday activities I'm an occupational therapist and we define our everyday activities as occupations so occupation in this sense isn't just your job or the thing that you get paid to do it's anything that you do that matters to you that makes a difference that helps you to define who you are so occupational therapists for those of you who don't know help people across the lifespan to do the things that they want and need to do every day and we do this through the use of occupations as well we also have an academic discipline called occupational science and this is where we study how our everyday activities actually impact our health and our well-being so because the way that what we do affects how who we are and how we live our discipline is really diverse we have people from anthropology sociology psychology neuroscience molecular biology everything but we consider this the science of everyday living because we basically are just trying to study how what we do everyday affects who we are I think I speak on behalf of all occupational therapists when I say thank you for having us here we are so excited about this conference and this theme of everyone included and patient-centered care because that to us is the basis of our whole profession we can't do a treatment session without asking the patient first what matters to you what is it that you want to do today and how can we help you to get there so when we walk in we ask what matters to you and not what's the matter with you we like to start with actually taking what we call an occupational profile or occupational history so let's say so tell me about yourself who are you what is it that you like to do what are you doing every day and then we ask what challenges are you facing now and how can we help you get there in that sense we really feel like we're more of just collaborators with them in their care and in helping them to achieve their goals so you might say that sounds great but doesn't that mean that what you do is really diverse and the answer is yes yes it is so every time so I work with patients who have stroke and no matter who it is even if I worked with ten people who all had a stroke if I asked if I asked ten people in this room what matters to you your answers would all be different and that is the same with every single patient and client that I see so therefore what we do is really different sometimes we're helping them just to get back to their normal daily routine sometimes they want to use that opportunity to try something new or they want to reinvent themselves in this case this is a picture of Nate Higgins he is a pro swimmer he had a spinal cord injury but before that he defined himself as an athlete and after his spinal cord injury he still defined himself as an athlete and a large part of his care and recovery was making sure that he could go on to swim and continue to call himself an athlete so Nate actually has swam across Alcatraz he swam faster and further than most people in this room and he's gone on to inspire so many people with his story so I think the real question then is if what we do every day is so different how do we teach our students to do this so we do the same things that most medical professions do we teach about the diagnosis we commonly see we teach about the etiology the treatments we teach about the mechanisms the neuroscience the kinesiology but we also teach about task analysis and so that's how we take any given task that somebody wants to do and break it down so that we can incorporate that in since therapy so for instance if somebody has had a stroke but they want to work at the automotive shop where they worked before we you all their therapy laying down on their back so that they can simulate what they were doing when they're working on a car and so we do task analysis in those ways and then the most important thing I think is we also bring in experts into our classroom so this is dr. Samuel rafidhi she's the director of our masters level clinical program at the University of Southern California and she has done something that I think is really fantastic what she says is that any instructor can teach about disabilities out of a book but only somebody with the disability can speak to the lived experience and in reality they are the expert and so because of that she brings experts that we call community mentors or experts into the classroom oh okay so in this picture this is Steven he's a community mentor from Rancho Los Amigos national rehab hospital here he's teaching one of our students he's just showing them how he does everyday life so he's showing them how he drives his car using hand controls he shows them also how he transfers in and out of the car he does this at Rancho Los Amigos because he is a person who has had a spinal cord injury and he teaches people who have new spinal cord injuries how he gets around and how he does things but if the thing that I think is the most important about this is that when Sam you brings them into the classroom the first thing they do is spend about 30 to 45 minutes just talking about themselves so they tell the students who they are what matters to them what they do every day what they like to do and what they don't like to do just like you or I might to anyone else then they start to talk about the challenges that they face what challenges does having a spinal cord injury pose to everyday life and then they go through the things that they've come up with because they're the experts in their life and how they've worked to resolve those issues and overcome them and I think this gives the students the the concept and the idea that every patient is going to be a different case a different scenario and they're gonna have their own solutions and that it's really important to listen to those I think though that this is a little bit preaching to the choir all right so in this case what if you can't have an expert come to your classroom well this is where I think technology really comes in handy this is dr. John Mayer Geddes he's an assistant professor at us and also an occupational therapist and he also was born without hands or feet so John is fantastic because what he decided to do because people were always looking at him and wondering how he does things he just said tada if you couldn't hear that so what he decided to do is put videos of himself doing different things online so he put this on YouTube and it trended on Reddit which he was very excited about it has about 78,000 views now and I think that the real beauty is that this is how technology can influence and bring the experts story to the classroom into the masses one other thing I wanted to talk about is virtual reality so how many people here have tried a virtual reality headset on some people many people most people well if you have it I think there are tons of opportunities here for you to do that so there's lots of really great and interesting use cases for virtual reality and medical education a lot of them I think you'll hear about or see here things like being able to simulate an environment so you can simulate a surgical training without actually having to have a cadaver you could simulate a chaotic emergency situation and have people practice decision making but the thing that I think is the most exciting about virtual reality is something that we call embodiment it's the fact that you can actually embody the person that you're given in virtual reality and that is really interesting so doctor most Slater and ma vie vive Sanchez from Barcelona have done tons of work on this where they actually did this before VR was a thing before there was any hype to it and when VR headsets cost about $50,000 so they put people in VR and they gave them all sorts of different bodies in one case they gave somebody an a body that had the right arm four times longer than the left arm and they show that people actually embody that body and start to interact with the world as though their right arm really is super long and even after you take the VR headset off they still act like they have this really long arm until they get back to the real world they also show that if you give somebody a child's body in VR they start to show more childlike behaviors if you give somebody different gender body they start to show behaviors for that gender it's fantastic and it's super interesting and it means that we can give people experiences firsthand embodied experiences that they might not normally be able to have so one way this is being used in medical education and which might be talked about here is through simulations of the lived experience of people with different disabilities so I like this example it's called the Alford lab and it's created by a company called embodied labs and basically what happens when you put on the headset is you become Alfred a 60 76 year old male who goes through his daily life but has macular degeneration and hearing impairments and the nice thing about this is that similar to what I was saying with Sammy and and John experts actually helped to make these scenarios they helped to tell the story in virtual reality and they make it so that you're not just focused on what the disease or disorder looks like but how it affects your everyday life how it affects the way that you have a birthday party with your family or when you go to the doctor what that looks like for my lab so I'm also a neuroscientist and we do a lot to try to help people recover after stroke and so one of the things that we thought is if you can give somebody the experience of someone with a disability with virtual reality then you potentially could also give somebody who has a disability the experience of not having that so with VR we've created a system that we call reinvent it's a rehabilitation environment using the integration of neuromuscular based virtual enhancements for neural training we mostly did that just to have the acronym of reinvent we only ever say that on tox okay so what happens normally for a typical individuals is you might think to yourself I want to pick up this cup of coffee and you had generate a motor command and that command would get sent from your brain down to your hand and your hand would move and you would pick up the coffee and you would see that you had picked up that coffee and you had done it right and that commanding your brain would get reinforced however after a stroke what happens is that sometimes that motor command gets attempted but it doesn't make it all the way to the hand and so even if it was the right motor command nothing happens at the hand and your feedback your visual feedback doesn't reinforce that command because you didn't see anything happen this is a problem because then if you have this type of disconnect between the brain and the hand there's no way to train it and there's no way to tell the patient if their brain activity was right or not with reinvent we've created a low-cost portable brain computer interface so what we do is we actually take the signals from the brain and the muscles that indicate that the person is trying to move and we give them feedback in virtual reality of an arm actually moving and because it can be embodied they can actually feel like they have control over a virtual body even if they can't control their body in the real world so we think this is not only really rewarding it also activates neural circuits that are native and biologically efficient and it also gives them feedback so that they continue to train and practice those brain connections that we think will promote motor recovery this is what our system looks like we recently had the opportunity to show it off at South by Southwest which was very fun but it's a low-cost portable system it just consists of a laptop an oculus rift and an EEG and EMG headset so the EEG goes on your head and it's actually a nine-dollar swim cap that we got off Amazon and we just poked holes in it because usually EEG headsets are tens of thousands of dollars so ours is less than a thousand and then we have some sticky electrodes that we put on the arm and to the right is one of our our friends Ian trying it on we call him the happiest man in VR all right so one of the things that we had to do was try to understand first what the experience of an older adult was in VR right so most of our users were going to be people who are older what do they like this is a ninety nine year old woman who is NPR for the first time oh yeah butterflies are so pretty all right so that video is mostly gratuitous it is the cutest thing that we've ever seen but a lot of people in our lab were super jealous that a 99 year old woman got to try VR before they did but actually her message in what we learned from this experience of bringing VR to older adults was pretty consistent it turns out that they don't love rollercoasters and flight simulators the way that younger generations might but what they do have is nature and being outdoors and they love birds and butterflies and seeing nature interacting with it so we use that to design the environment so this is a picture of what you see in VR except you don't see the gooey but you have an orange hand which is a target hand and then you have your own hand and you can move that hand to the target hand in a few different ways if you have movement you could actually move your hand and if you don't if you aren't able to move you can control that hand just using your brain activity or your muscle activity and when you do I think it's the video I'm not sure if it will play when you do a hummingbird comes and flies to your hand and you have this rewarding sound so in conclusion I just want to close with a quote by the late doctor and novel Jan so Anne was a colleague of mine and I think that if she had known about this conference she would have been amazed I think this embodies everything that she would love to have seen because Anne was a professor at USC an occupational therapist and a disability rights advocate and she also was born with spina bifida and when she was born the doctors told her parents that she didn't have a good chance of having a fulfilling life and she definitely proved them all wrong so Anne is somebody that I think went through life sharing her story talking to everybody that she could and she really paved the way for a lot of work in this area and so I just want to leave you with this quote from Anne in which she says disabilities add twists and turns on the road of life but the road nonetheless stretches before you if your game thank you [Music]
