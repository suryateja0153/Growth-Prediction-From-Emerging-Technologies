 Our project is really trying to immersively allow people to be trained inside virtual reality environment. We're actually using of the same sort of platform that a lot of gamers use. The first time I think there's like that sense of awe. There are these new worlds, these new experiences that you've never had before. What we want to do is that leverage those for engineering purposes. Any stage of the project development lifecycle from concept to prototyping to manufacturing you can do it virtually. We've been trying to investigate how we can put the trainer and reflect the inside of virtual reality environment so they can kind of see the same sort of perspective that the trainer might experience while they're doing a job They can practice inside virtual environments in smaller spaces and then they can move off to location and they'll be ready to work There's no bounds; there's no limits at this platform where you are in this warehouse, and there's a helicopter, and there's a jet and you can put on a headset and essentially go teleport around this helicopter. We have the ability to test it, and it's been really really fun to start bringing in students of any discipline to essentially try out this new training platform and see if it's more effective than traditional training methods. They love to be in there; they love to kind of like bend the rules and physics is just kind of like a new dimension. Virtual reality type of potential to really offer solutions to some of the problems in this world, and BYU can be a leader in that regard.
