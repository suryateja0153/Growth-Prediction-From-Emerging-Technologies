 means matriarch I'm a postdoc at shape lab in Stanford University and the work I'm going to present today is called robotic assemblies of haptic proxy objects for tangible interaction in virtual reality and I'm presenting presenting this paper on behalf of us our master students who said you can't Janis today for many because of reasons so over the past decades we've seen that virtual reality has been becoming more accessible and more affordable to the general public while providing more immersive and engaging user expenses and so we can see here that people can now play in virtual worlds interact with like many different virtual objects and throw them and do a bunch of stuff with them and yet reality virtual reality is indeed we need to seem in a sense that it offers great advantages with regard to interaction as we can interact with the virtual world the same way we interact in the physical world within our hand but the remaining issue is that these manipulations are performed in meet here and we cannot feel physically the physical objects that the virtual objects is that we are actually manipulating but our hands of an incredible potential for manipulation and interaction and haptic feedback and tangible interaction remain a key part of our they need experience of the physical world so haptics researchers have explored two different many two different approaches to provide haptics haptic feedback to manipulate digital objects so the first one on the right is called kinesthetic first feedback and allows to recreate sensations such as inertia damping stiffness while the tactile feedback on the left on the right side relies on precise mechanoreceptors locating located in the skin to capture finer sensations such as texture temperature or pressure the to the best of our knowledge none as yet been able to combine and emulate all the sensations of touch within one single device in the mean time and cancel taps type optics using physical props to embody virtual objects and facilitate manipulation provide accurate kinesthetic and tactile feedback but these physical products are static and cannot change shape too much the virtual objects that we're manipulating in the virtual world and does require a large collection of physical objects to be able to face all the different possible situations that could be actually encamped encountered in the virtual world so how could we obtain these physical proxy objects on demand as we manipulate the virtual world so one simple way would just be to 3d print objects and demand but this remains too slow for a user user interaction and especially doesn't provide interactive objects so another approach would be to use shape-changing interfaces as they are allowed to create 2.5 these shapes as runtime but the main problem remains that the objects that are created are grounded by the device and done' do not allow which hand manipulations inference in interface so another approach consists in assembling structures automatically by combining simple objects together either using surface and resistance on the left on collaborative systems and so we see great potential using robotic assembly systems to provide seamless user interfaces user experiences India and we propose to combine both approaches to create robotic assembly object assembly systems at runtime and at low resolution to create haptic proxy objects for tangible interaction in virtual reality we created this proof-of-concept a system capable of building haughty proxy objects of on any recent of surface using my magnetic building blocks these building blocks are created by small actuated side by small robots to create rich and diverse haptic virtual objects supported by supporting which manipulations in via as well as supporting a interactive capabilities but new challenges emerge as we consider objects objects for virtual reality is an optimal system an optimal assembly system should allow fast assemblies to support uninterrupted uninterrupted and seamless interaction in VO as well as fine spatial resolution to allow virtual objects and haptic proxy objects too much with sufficient identifiable features the system should be modular to leverage reusable elements in order to keep the size of the overall system adapted to the application and scalable to support diverse objects they were subject without hindering the performances of the users and endless and the resulting object should be untethered and should have thought unrestricted hand manipulation in the physical world and the thing is most like some of these goals that still remain an achievable due to technical actual technical limitations and as such this work is our attempt to tackle these challenges contributing with the proof-of-concept of the self-assembly system for tangible interaction in via two different approaches to assemble haptic proxy objects with robots and a technical evaluation of these two approaches we used so it's our robotic platform for our eye we used it as our base robotic system for assembling platform so the which can be controlled by a central server using radio communication and as they report their position and orientation using high-speed light pattern optical tracking the main the first assembly method that we developed was using active building blocks each capable of moving them by themself on any oh isn't a surface each active block is composed of a so it on top of which sits an actual building block so this one has permanent magnets distributed all around its outer surface allowing blocks to magnetically bind together and as with moving blocks constitute obstacles for each other when they assemble we need to coordinate the motion to optimize both assembly time while maximum maximizing the success rate of the assembly and and for this each block trying to reach his destination first comes closer to its destination and then adjust its orientation it finally slides into position and snaps magnetic me with the rest of the assembly but to avoid what we called this situation our guts that is a high failure prone where when the one block has to come in and fit in between two others we assembled the object from the center of the way from the center of the object and we let it go outwards by assembling blocks one after another in a crevice peril and so this method allows us to assemble pretty much any have supports the object that we interact with but so while this worked one for one single layer can we build something that would be a bit more complex actually and so using runs for instance in that case actuated by two other robots we allow building blocks to come and sit on top of each other to create multi layers assembly multi layers assemblies the second approach use passive docks of essentially empty shells the same shells but completely empty and we use one single robot or like multiple robots but dedicated ones to move these blocks around mainly to optimize the number of Technology columns that we would have in the system for simplicity and while providing more diversity in the in Java building block design so we used multiple different types of blocks in this method so the first one movers like the active blocks contain one so it on top of which sits an act case that allows to attach and carry the other passive blocks among these specific passive blocks can be of different shapes and Heights they also they also have permanent magnets distributed on the outer surface that allows them to snap together and cap can be coupled with a bunch of different magnetic interchangeable tops that like to snap magnetically as well and so as the mover comes and pick up the block they snap magnetically together and the misalignment is allowed to lift one side of the after block the mover can then move the block around more easily and as it comes and snaps in the rest of the assembly the magnetic force lays the block down on the surface and allows to move out disconnect and move on and go fetch another blood and so in this assembly method we start from a corner and we pin the object layering outwards by assembling columns afterwards like that and so this allows move to disconnect from passive objects easily passive blocks easily well minimize minimizing the narrow gap the difficult situation that we talked about before and if the mover happened to fail to disconnect it it is just going to wait for a little bit as other blocks tend to create vibration ahead the the all the mover to disconnect and if not it's just it remains in the indie assembly as considered as a Pacific website and so we included in these assemblies then tracking optical trackers that can be that allowed the optic box the object to be tracked in space using standard motion capture systems optic proxy objects can then be manipulated to reflect 3d objects in VR allowing users to perform simple infractions in that case just like pointing and touching the object in the virtual world but happy proxy objects can also be used as input devices to draw in space simple things when to create custom controllers for video games when not limited in the physical world the motion of the motion can be constrained in the virtual world to allow to create motion illusion and guide users to perform specific actions in that case controlling the the brightness of the light just using the vertical motion of the handle and combination combinations of trackable blocks allowed to create interactive features such as yes sandwich that the user can push in and flick like that to control the lightsaber in the Fiat reward so we can conducted a technical evaluation to measure the other performances of assembly method we had the system assemble basic rectangle using six different six active blocks actually and so the research shows a linear correlation between the number of blocks in the assembly and the overall assembly time where like each block required about three seconds and and this method showed high successful rate although on the other hand we had the passive method performing exactly the same assembly using two or three respectively 2 & 3 assembling robots but we can see here that the performances are much lower and so each assembly of each block required about like between nine and five seconds to be put in the assembly and we also see a nonlinear correlation between the number of blocks and over time and this was mainly due to the turn-by-turn polyline assembly so each each couple of assembling block assembling robot had to go fetch each time a passive blocks and so if the number was if the overall number of block was odd that they had both of them had to go back and fetch a new one so like increasing your time assembling time and so the the only thing that we can see the successful reg is like significantly lower in that case and so that many comes from difficulty that so it had to move the blocks around actually as it did modify the local control system and do to add to their to disease actually due to the low positioning accuracy this often led to miss placements of strategists stuck tight situations decreasing your successful rate of the system so now let's look back at the goals that we identified a bit earlier to build an optimal healthy proxy object system so we saw that the blocks we use in both methods allow to create diverse haptic proxy objects but still assemblies have to be manually disassembled to allow blocks to be reused for further form objects limit imitating the the overall module modularity of the system so using electromagnets for instance just like robot table would allow us to control the magnetic bond between all the different blocks and would allow us then to see what automatic disassembly sort of objects could like fall apart and could recreate another objects on the fly like that the technique technical evaluation revealed also that the speed and reliability remain limiting factors for seamless interaction in via using our assembly system so using an external system instead of roads could actually improve your assembly systems the other words assembling performances while providing more potentially more stability and more reliability and and and I need the resolution of our assembly remain kind of course limited both by the size of the sides and the size of our building blocks and so to improve this resolution one thing that we could do is just use a smaller blocks typically but performances would just like drop with that as we would have liked so many so much more many more blocks to assemble and and more travelers to doing everything and so another an alternative direction that we started to explore is to leverage haptic retargeting so providing to allow to provide higher resolution sensations by wrapping the space around the object and displacing the hand in the virtual world accordingly for instance using techniques like scaling a bank and curvature interaction so to wrap up we presented to the proof of concept of a robotic assembly system for haptic 40 objects to support haply a tangible interaction in virtual reality we then introduced two methods and their respective performance evaluations while yet while imperfect we believe that this work shows this early work shows potential for feature which research to explore new ways to provide better haptic feedback in virtual reality thank you very much and I will now be happy to take your questions [Applause] the reason that you'd prefer networks so this is a cool stuff I was just wondering why so the purpose of having yourself assembling blocks for the purpose of proxy objects how does that compare to just a shell since you have a user and just a couple of loss why don't something like a Lego light system where you just send all your you have to proxy object wouldn't be more efficient you could also have smaller objects as well what was widely apps we need that kind of robotic self-assembling contraction because it's cool and no and mainly for the thing that you saw was that so but people and and use as many so use where hand this interaction view and so cannot see they will for transparency purposes you know you don't want to like take off judge hmd and have the thing as your Lego stars on board on the side and put them together and then put back your put back HMG continue interacting means we also the core won't I mean it's it's still early work and we need to like improve the scale at of the objects that we can assemble as well as the finesse of it but essentially the goal would be to assemble these objects as as you interacting in via so you don't know what is happening they're just the robots are just assembling the things that the objects that you need actually on the side and they come within reach you know within your line of sight in in the virtual world as usually members exactly yeah hi John McClelland Carleton University like this is really cool work and I probably like to talk to you a bit more after the talk but I'm wondering a big problem I see with passive haptics in virtual reality is transitioning between objects and for switching out physical proxies it seems like at least at this point you may still have a problem with with switching those so I was wondering where you might see kind of making the transition between objects smoother in the future so one the the blocks that we've been using the ones that you saw in in this work was just like simple you know like blocks liked like Legos typically and so these don't change shape the Darja static and so one thing that we thought about exploring was to like combine these blocks with shapes changing technologies so using like you know like shape memory alloys for instance or all the work that has been done by like Android or instance leaning out from from MIT and and so combining these things with these passive but to have each block capable changing slightly its shape but then we would be able to create assemblies that would actually mmm could evolve in shape to time actually in India assemblies and so that we see potential for that to create like an even more seamless user experience in VR manipulating these objects so do I thank you [Applause]
