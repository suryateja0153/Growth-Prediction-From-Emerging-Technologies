 We studied spinal cord injury, and a much neglected issue of spinal cord injury, namely: pain, chronic pain. A classical observation in spinal cord injury in neuropathic pain is that the pain is located at the level of the legs. And it's really terrible because Nothing is generally felt below the level of spinal cord injury. Let's say from here including the legs, the only thing you feel is pain, so you feel no touch you feel no warmth. And we wanted to achieve, and did achieve, two things: first of all, make people feel the body again using virtual reality, and the other part is to decrease pain. We used something called the immersive VR which is based on this head mounted display that you can see here so people are not simply watching a film on a computer screen but they're watching a movie, a three-dimensional movie on this head mounted display. So they're completely immersed into this. The patient worked with a virtual reality setup, in which they saw a film of a camera that was positioned over a fake leg. So patients they saw the film of these legs as they were superimposed over their real legs. And then the experimenter touched the dummy legs and the patient's back in synchrony. After some duration, the participants started experiencing the illusion. So there is a referral of touch from one body position on my shoulder or my back towards where I see touch on my legs. Being exposed to this, if we later on asked the individuals to rate their pain, the pain had decreased. The effect was mild but we should not forget that this was done after a minute or two minutes of stroking, so future scenarios we'll probably try to extend this into rehabilitative settings and then present this several times per day over several weeks for extended periods
