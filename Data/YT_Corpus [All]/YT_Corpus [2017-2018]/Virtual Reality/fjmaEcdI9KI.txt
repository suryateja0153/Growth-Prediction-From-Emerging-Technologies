 Leizel: Let's see. What do we got? [Ambient, chill music begins to fade in] Several people off-camera: Ooooh! More people chiming in: OOOooooh! [Light percussion chimes in on the ambient, chill music] [Record scratching sound that transitions into a heavy beat that smooths out into a chill beat] [Chill beat with some bass notes dropping in] [Music swings up] [Music swings down] [Steady, chill beat continues with bass] [An echoing musical sound chimes in] [The sound of birds chirping in a rainforest chimes in on the track, but they flow with the beat of the song] [All of the sounds flow in harmony with the chill beat and bass] [The music is interrupted with record scratching sounds, again.] [All sounds drop out except for the bass] [The drum beat chimes in] [Ambient, chill music fades out]
