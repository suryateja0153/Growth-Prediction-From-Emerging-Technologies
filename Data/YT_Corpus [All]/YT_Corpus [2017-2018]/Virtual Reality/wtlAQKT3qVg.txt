 to be able to paint in space I am for the first time given a third dimension I've never been so affected by a piece of technology you are inside of your drawing the second I tried tilt brush I started crying I couldn't believe how powerful this was tilt brush is a drawing program designed by Google it allows you to use your hand as the paintbrush and you can draw in every direction these tools are not bound by physical laws I don't have to worry about gravity it is entirely whatever I want it to do my name is teak Mok I'm a virtual-reality artist this is my apartment in Los Angeles the great thing about being of the artists is that even though the space is really tiny I can put on the headset and it's a way to make any space magical like I can adjust the intensity of the light like this I'm live painting while the orchestra plays and that ability to kind of put you inside of a song suddenly I can do that with a painting I've been painting since I was a kid it's something that I do almost every day [Music] I wanted to know more about virtual reality because it sounded amazing but I had never done it I mean I've been it's like talking about love you have to experience it to fully understand it I've been living in virtual reality for the last five months every single day on average about eight to ten hours a day tell me this stuff is real I've been able to create like an entire world of imagination I've never felt like there's been such a clear vehicle for me to show and express my ideas with each stroke it feels like I am mapping out the way I think and I'm just like giving you a tour of this of my moon this is to me if it is a real world it is just as valid as as the physical world I can put the headset on you and you can go inside of my head and you can explore what I've created and that sharing of experience is an incredibly effective tool that I think is only going to grow I think it just connects us more I can't wait to see other people's projects and the world that exists in everyone else it's like a dream you feel the energy that's going in force being directed towards the water and you feel you impact on the nature around you [Music] it feels magical intuitive and it feels like you have superpowers [Music]
