 I've reached the stage in my ontology  work where people know my name. when they need an ontology, they very often approached me and asked me whether I want to collaborate. So I agreed some months ago to collaborate with a group of people who were putting together a grant proposal called motor pack, for the NIH, which is about the molecular transduction of physical activity; which basically means how does exercise make you more healthy at the molecular chemical level. So now I have to build a physical activity ontology and this means, changing existing oncology's so walking for instance, in the existing oncology, will be described as moving from place to place by putting one leg in front of another. But if you are doing a physical activity ontology, you can be walking on the treadmill and then you're not moving at all. So all the definitions need to be changed.
