 so I'm going to be talking about what happens when you start a new title on your job so obviously taxonomy is quite important partners younger all suites of things that we did with in information architecture to try and make the world better and I've been doing there for every many times my country says so right about me I've spent my whole career architects information specializing in taxonomy design and development my very first job I started out working insured it shall be cast the first calm boom and anybody remember nathan barley from back in zone yeah that sounds an awful lot of people like that run that term for century so i started out doing indexing cataloguing but almost exactly a decade ago i decided to go freelance after being permanently employees and I've never look back I feel like I've never had the same job Tyson twice I've never done the same project twice certainly miss been seen I'm do assignments for people that range from between one and a half games that's my shorts a second job it was meant to be natural hasn't fired right right up to five years working on very many digital transformation projects I've always been driven by the same basic desire to help people when their customers whether their internal staff when their specialist to consuming process information I want to help people use don't seem content and information which were always told us so much of in the world now to do something useful so through more like an x 0 means I help people discover restaurants find but dull policy document that they really really need to do that job fine grant TV and radio to to watch or just to get their work done more efficiently just to make their lives a little easier there's a song people have worked for also worked for some charities with dozen agencies that might be using their logos but so so right you've got a new types on with your normal so I really recommend a book called steal like an artist so then we're not yes listen get not sir by us think Leon and it's a fantastic moment best time for being creative and that's all sorts of creative I I don't kiss of myself creative in terms of more to save my life but I'm terested in terms of the digital work that I do and this book is fantastic it have to get things done and the reason that are out there is a great point in there so anyone was giving you advice but basically talking to themselves in the past and that's what I'm doing so I've written this talk to try and because I would have liked to have had something like this when I started out I based only pistol because I'm moving around different jobs and I've made plenty of mistakes in my career I've got these rides and I really like to have some communication that experience to me so we need to approach new projects or jobs with confidence and the real curiosity and the butt cover on the right is that's a book for 30 90 days and that's a really good some genuine book for getting your feet under the table of any job so I recommend that popular breeding but i think that the sort of working in tax on me because it's quite specialist and i'm still finding using to my career the level of understanding of it is quite variable within within organizations that are varies from people just don't get it and people want it to do everything but i think this quite particular advice that could be the motive i also i think this is just a really exciting time for information architecture + tax on me I think there's more opportunities to use our skills than ever before it's only nothing these sorts of places I never would have imagined that we could use information architecture and post the rice booked but it's obvious now I've seen it that's fantastic and we need to be ready to dive in and be flexible enough to make the most of it so you thought in the new job hand over now you might be lucky and start somewhere and there's already some of them in post that is there to show you the ropes take you for everything but a lot of the time but that isn't the case in my experience you might be the only taxonomy person in that organization or it might be a new role or in my case you can find consultant I might not be that embedded with the team so you can't always hope that someone is going to sit there with a nice cup of coffee and all the time bag and take you through those things so I think that's just something to be aware of I think so first thing is to try the album's much documentation as you can if there's already tax on news then make sure you've got them if anything sounds really obvious that's it don't assume that it is that you can I can start a job doing take some reason people don't actually show me anything from the first week so yeah it's always useful to submit the jobs fact that you were hired to usually in the fens month or so I tend to rewrite it because it doesn't actually reflect what I'm doing what they need from me but it's all bad is it useful to have because it's a reference point for what they think play away from you and your job is to try and show that an influencer using your sins oh good to look at the particular application you be quiet in the cab whether it's the website from enterprise search engine or intranet amor sometimes internal system so you need to spend time familiarizing yourself effects in that it's also important to think about the picture so even if you know like in that case of that job I've been throwing one and half things I needed to know what the overall strategy was where where do I fit into in the face of this project it's a big banking projects but still wondering but if you don't understand what they're trying to move to you'll never get me up soon hug them take those steps another thing that I think is really important in taxonomy workers government and maintenance and the kind of business side of things in my experience says no one is ever happy with how their taxonomy have been maintained their diver mcafee or there's a lot of politics or people are fighting over what customers are called on websites and sometimes but organisation will have a beautifully designed a flowchart and a big fat process up to me but it's just being good so you need to read those documents but not necessarily get too attached to thinking that's actually how it's going to happen also has been wearing the influence of the what's called the hippo the highest-paid person's opinion I guess and fuel sir we've all worked with a few hippos and that even the best fun process documentation in the world it's still might come dancing pig shouts loudest forgot something's told if you're doing kind of lame brain or have somethings driven within search I also find that a massive death sometimes within organizations where teams and say yeah we really want to maintain our own attacks on the movies we don't want to have something that sense of telling us what to do and then maybe they're not actually results to do it maybe there's restructures and those really enthusiastic people involved and I think it's only good to have that sense of reality that and to be pragmatic that you might not be able to give people the amount of control but they think they wants at that point if they are well results been fantastic and I am an advocate people manage their own information assets where possible run up the slide oh sorry my slides in the wrong not to worry so um laxing is really important in any job than special information architectures who are your immediate colleagues who's got your back in the scene and what I found this that takes on the wrists commitment of lots of niches within an organization in which area which leash you're in we'll probably have quite big influence on your the focus of your work and the interactions that you have and probably buttons that you might have to fight it's def if you felt some Johnson's but um are we fighting for you fantastic after you might have matrix management and multiple managers and you need to work out a way to work with all of them that isn't gonna try to match or the keep everybody happy i think i'm working with a publisher and i'm really tightly embedding into the technical team and i have to spend time worrying about servers and there's my stuff on cheer up today's your asset anything then stand ups but actually i was try to do a strategic role so that it's causing point of tensions and I think tax on which need to be really really did that formats I think I wish some they told me that when I started when my career but you can pick up the technical skills you can pick up design skills you can use all different tools but you need to have those tongs business skills to help you these contentions so I have a lot of fun but I don't really want to be worrying about you 10 tickets when untwisting your current envision for our organization so that's why I come to places like this thing took people linger share so I'm learning Oh mr. do I have how the senior within interactive on scenes are they in the silo do they have the communication processes and I would say that I yeah making a list of the different types of things I've worked with in my career I've worked in sales teams lots of technical teams here at teams that were very heavily focused on vision design search teams product teams and some information processing and retrieval teams so but that's why I say this is a really exciting time that people with us fields can fit me almost anywhere if this is great so as I as I lead it if you're in a team you're going to have lots of different stakeholders there's plenty of the results about their from understanding you'll stay calm network mapping you know who needs one understanding needs and styles and motivations and how best to work with them but again but I think what I'm trying to communicate is specific to kind of attacks on green information architecture because what I think is important is people's attitudes as well as their positions and what deliverables they might need from you then there's a rational understanding because in my face sometimes the biggest champion mr. filter and how do your work white new genie developer or it won't me to say young and then vice versa sometimes the developers might have you off as you say yo to one that clears a path and a lot of that depends on their level of interest and how well you can communicate your your passion to learn and so there's there's a few different styles and i would say that none of them would necessarily get all bad and everyone has different preferences in how they work but basically i think everybody wants support and everybody wants the space to deal with their jobs and different styles are going to work differently with different people so i think if you're lucky enough that enthusiasm to SoCal that's fantastic but i guess it they might done it themselves they've got my sphere as a par something that's fantastic or they understand the benefits of what you're doing these people right um there's also the other flip side light is in cdale manager that swoops in they won't leave some kind of deposit on you oh and then they need your alone and you might be some point in your hand that same excuse me excuse me um if that can be frustrating his work press but you should say that's an opportunity because that can give you the space to to think to show things and actually work to receive our managers will probably make better in the long run I've also been processed me style but I told these the janitor who is a temporary person they might they might be the person who's in charge of me as a consultant or they might be new to the job or they might just be looking after something for cover or maternity cover or something and their focus is elsewhere they don't really care what the materials I probably care that you turn it off that you did something but they're not really going to get into details of it and they're not gonna give you anything back and again like the single it can make you better because you're accepting that you have to drive things you have to do what you can if that's in remote that's a problem but it can write your to the benefit in the long run another style of come across is in what I pull the reductionist who doesn't really understand what I've sonrisa for Tommy makes jokes about types of their me now I've had more organized I'll just get some interns to write the enterprise taxonomy or what if it won the developers to find out attacks only ones doing something else and that's always really freaked me out as some of you consider myself a specialist and as crashing for this and gives up my Saturday to talk about it so it would fit not include a quote from both apostle this but 04 wondrous butcher anticipated came he says however I can have all this inside rain and severe it's just words listen to sometimes I think that I'm trying to explain the benefits and tax on the man you know although the kind of depth the year on scene you know the power of what it can do what information architecture is all about and social project manager sesame no it's just a bunch of words don't you just shove it in the database but that's what those diplomacy skills come in but again you can use that to make you better by learning to communicate your your passion better you know what is it that they care about they care about delivering a project and they care about the big picture the product we can deliver it fine where do you fit into that you care about the detail you can be passionate about details workouts pick their language and another stylist leave for some Wi-Fi toaster diode oh but that's a poster the Prince weather forecasting toast so those that is a bit probably necessary technology but some people really really love much and battery but I'm put that in the sort of example of new people whom they have to be picture they they might have the big vision in white matter sensible and because I'm quite there detail-oriented person sometimes I find that a bit for struggle to kind of get into their universe and Alison vice versa so they're probably not gonna appreciate the detail of what you do but again it's you know if you're there is something that enables the weather forecast we printed a leap into x make sure they know that make sure witness you know the value of it even if they don't appreciate the particular kind of blood sweat and tears you get there a slightly important group for information architecture is your actual users and the chances are they're not you whatever you're working on it's different people with different interest to me and that's why we have to use a sense of design that's why there's no load of different methodologies for Durham user centered design and in case of tax on moon if you're starting a new job is there any meaningful research that's been done before or is it just a big fat report for the pie charts that they paid an agency for but maybe the CEO really likes it but does it help you do the job I've seen too many of those reports and then just get filed away I think that's difficult ins bear in mind i also come across research that's done in the past and antidotal evidence from that has somehow become the folk consciousness of the organization but one little thing that someone says oh no one ever clips to leggings be on the homepage or no one searches from this page and somehow that's just being obsessive and it's never been challenged and I think this an interesting opportunity if you're starting somewhere new to question that sort of stuff you might find out actually it has something grain of truth like lots of fond memories or on wife sounds but it's possible actually you could try and change that understanding and also its user research helpful have they asked people the right questions there's that quote from Henry Ford said he didn't talk to customers that much because they would never come up with the idea of the power they would've just said build me a better horse so I think it's important to use your skills and information architect to typically on what you might see in these research or if you're actually lucky enough to participate the user research to try and dig under what people sining necessarily taken at face value because you might know something about something that way it seeds what they thought better for some bad product and some of the greatest innovations will never come back for my customers though you just like a massive different processes yes I've got couple of examples of some working yes I think it's important if you're doing kind of taxonomy and mobile inning structural work not just to focus on the task stuff but to actually understand when how why people would use stuff um so I found this online an intranet revamp that I was doing for a public sector agency and they've done lots of research so I know people think there's too many loops on the homepage and desiring a navigation is working but actually what was more useful was trying to understand how the internet fitted into their works and there's a lot of frontline workers and sometimes people think about that without even have their own computers they not been spend half an hour which they live and I am reading the press releases from depositing they just went but really essential piece of information and then when the dial do they were interacting with public their arm to do things properly and yeah so something that I really tempted in whenever I start a new job is just to dive in right away i want to start playing with the taxonomy if there's a taxing weeks all i would start pressing buttons if if I've seen the website so you before I've actually started with a job I think okay able to i'm going to show you talk about that more than that i think it's important just to take that step back so it's really tempting to want to make an impact and you know maybe about but i do believe in understanding what's on what if anyone especially as our sewing could use a research even if you have a healthy attachment from it you need to understand why it's there what people thought and then if you're working someone they haven't got attacks on me like I sometimes for this that one of the first person is done taxing moving somewhere so the temptation is just to start playing because that's what I really love their and I whether it's a sign for developers so if they start a new job they would start when you won't produce an account and it's not a mentality thing but again I think it's important to say that step back document your your progress document probably be talking soon and actually get further into the job you might find that you're thinking changed so obviously crystal part of attacks on New Year's the language of the words in phrases and especially where our detention is what language your users are using versus what language exists within the organization or and the organization is a user as well so you need to be aware of acronyms corporate style the glossary if they've got such a thing if other any words that are really loaded that you can't use within and labeling structure for whatever reason people who probably say to you ah yes we've got plenty right provincia we've got so much jargon and I wish I had a pound for every time someone said that to me but you need to kind of on the sandal in fact as far as possibly because I think there will always be compromises you've never done at attacks on ring that is entirely focused on the username bridge maybe it's possible ringing just getting a bit steps from the center in my old age but you always have to find out what operas are and what what buttons are worth fighting but you can make you can make a difference in these things so I was working for a very well-established professional body with a big member database and they were describing the member members and then trailer architects so they were describing the architects and quite kind of prosaic term doesn't say where they were what their main areas of expertise Awards qualification something but when we talk to users what they really wanted it was inspirational language and they wanted to know about specialists and flirty things and they wanted to know if they want to be able to find if I got patched roof intent who's first person to do that and know that I want something I don't want to be motor modes of searches for heart attacks and can you might be better on Bell dings as conservation saying this match houses they want to something that's better designs in the stimulation so we were trying to make that not so much for phone book but more of a ton of its exploration discovering database and that's that's the real value of of this kind of work I things and hoping organizations on to serve themselves better and you understand their customers better oh where it would briefly on one point of tongues so why me why this is what you actually use to manage attacks on the man these two things I'd say is please don't be spreadsheets or but includes every spreadsheets if it's so frustrating because it it's not secure it's difficult to manage pong hierarchy metadata workflow all the standard functions of semantics or the stalls and yet even when spreadsheet happens that's I think that's in my half and I would say if if your organization is funny about giving you the budget to buy a decent time and there's lots of stuff online but at 17 some looking to make particular recommendations if they told stump up for that buy yourself a copy of multi tears it's like 100 pounds for a single user license and I actually be loved it the UI is quite within climbing far it's actually bringing to the mess really really detailed taxonomy work I'm pretty easy to get stuff into other systems and yeah things are also on a cruise sorry um multi test so Motsinger than to yes all the word and they don't plan around them but it's just a really cheat tool that you can buy yourself and installing your own laptop if you're a marketing bike by organization so nice i love you we're good 02 / a long time so I decide to try joining organizer of a conference call at summer camp London we have our first one last year we had something local more taciturn about anything though he's very dead in my college as well talking and what we're trying to do is to create a real community of people who are interested in this point about the ever sets a very whatever rather work for their lesson poem contractors but my team is on time wasn't there just interested or ever let developers and so we want to make this range from community and it's now our second year so we don't putting out our conversations in in the next few days and we are really really keen to get people from the information architecture community we really we've got a broad range of things that reach it in and we're very open to other ideas from people is a really lovely community they don't have good a fantastic moving it's we're open registration motoring year so I mean oh Jesus on the power plant in the next few days on Twitter that's that's my dresser and the conference for sir oh I hope this has been helpful we favor you as well to get started in afternoon tax on we project you
